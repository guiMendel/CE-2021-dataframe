Abstract = {{Recently, monolayer SnS, a two-dimensional group IV monochalcogenide,
   was grown on a mica substrate at the micrometer-size scale by the simple
   physical vapor deposition (PVD), resulting in the successful
   demonstration of its in-plane room temperature ferroelectricity.
   However, the reason behind the monolayer growth remains unclear because
   it had been considered that the SnS growth inevitably results in a
   multilayer thickness due to the strong interlayer interaction arising
   from lone pair electrons. Here, we investigate the PVD growth of
   monolayer SnS from two different feed powders, highly purified SnS and
   commercial phase-impure SnS. Contrary to expectations, it is suggested
   that the mica substrate surface is modified by sulfur evaporated from
   the Sn2S3 contaminant in the as-purchased powder and the lateral growth
   of monolayer SnS is facilitated due to the enhanced surface diffusion of
   SnS precursor molecules, unlike the growth from the highly purified
   powder. This insight provides a guide to identify further controllable
   growth conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this study is to identify the core competencies
   for librarians working in special libraries. It also measures the
   competencies of librarians working in special libraries of the Punjab
   Province against the checklist developed by the Special Library
   Association (SLA) Task Force. The study also identifies the training
   needs of librarians working in special libraries and the problems they
   face in acquiring SLA competencies.
   Design/methodology/approach - A peer-reviewed questionnaire based on the
   list of competencies for special librarians prepared by the SLA Task
   Force was used to collect quantitative data from a targeted population.
   An online survey was administered to approach the population working in
   special libraries of Punjab Province. Collected data was analyzed
   statistically through SPSS software.
   Findings - A review of literature highlighted the various competencies
   for librarians working in special libraries (Figure 1). The findings of
   the study showed that the competencies identified by SLA Task Force are
   imperative for librarians working in special libraries of Punjab
   Province. The results showed that librarians working in special
   libraries of Punjab possessed an intermediate level of competencies
   identified by the SLA. However, they had a good level of basic
   professional and interpersonal skills. The study highlights the training
   needs of librarians working in special libraries to enable them in
   acquiring relevant competencies.
   Research limitations/implications - The study measures the competencies
   of librarians in special libraries of the Punjab Province. During the
   data collection phase, it was observed that there were some libraries
   where the non-professional/supporting staff was deputed, and due to
   this, data could not be collected from these libraries.
   Practical implications - This study has practical implications for
   librarians and information professionals working in special libraries to
   acquire the relevant competencies identified by the SLA. This study has
   identified various competencies areas that are essential for librarians
   working in special libraries.
   Social implications - Librarians working in any special library can use
   the results of this study as a checklist to improve their competencies
   level and work efficiently.
   Originality/value - In contrast to other studies conducted on
   professional competencies of library professionals working in academic
   libraries, this study particularly identifies and measures the
   competencies of librarians working in special libraries.}},

Abstract = {{The water temperature in the ocean varies according to its depth and
   generates a thermocline layer. An internal wave can be excited by an
   object moving near the thermocline layer because the density changes
   owing to the water temperature. The internal wave propagates and
   interacts with the surface wave. This study aims to investigate the
   internal wave propagation in a two-layer stratified flow, generated by
   2D hydrofoil (NACA0012) using a RANS based CFD model. Eulerian
   multiphase methods were used for the modeling of the two-layer
   stratified flow; Volume of Fluid (VOF) model and mixture model. A
   two-layer stratified fluid consisting of
   air(rho(air))-water1(rho(w1))-water2(rho(w2)) is considered instead of
   the thermocline layer to simplify the numerical simulations. The
   generation and propagation of the internal wave were investigated, with
   different configurations of the speed and submergence depth of the
   hydrofoil. The result suggested that the VOF model shows better
   agreement with the experimental data compared to the mixture model.}},

Abstract = {{Michelson interferometers have been routinely used in various
   applications ranging from testing optical components to interferometric
   time-resolved spectroscopy measurements. Traditionally, plate
   beamsplitters are employed to redistribute radiation between the two
   arms of an interferometer. However, such an interferometer is
   susceptible to relative phase fluctuations between the two arms
   resulting from vibrations of the beamsplitter. This drawback is
   circumvented in diffraction-grating-based interferometers, which are
   especially beneficial in applications where highly stable delays between
   the replica beams are required. In the vast majority of grating-based
   interferometers, reflective diffraction gratings are used as
   beamsplitters. Their diffraction efficiency, however, is strongly
   wavelength dependent. Therefore transmission-grating interferometers can
   be advantageous for spectroscopy methods, since they can provide high
   diffraction efficiency over a wide spectral range. Here, we present and
   characterize a transmission grating-based Michelson interferometer,
   which is practically dispersion-free, has intrinsically high symmetry
   and stability and moderate throughput efficiency, and is promising for a
   wide range of applications. (C) 2020 Optical Society of America under

Abstract = {{Following in vitro tests established for surgical prosthetic heart
   valves, transcatheter aortic valves (TAV) are similarly tested in
   idealized geometries-excluding effects that may hamper TAVR performance
   in situ. Testing in vitro in pulse duplicator systems that incorporated
   patient-specific replicas would enhance the testing veracity by bringing
   it closer to the clinical scenario. To that end we compare TAV
   hemodynamic performance tested in idealized geometries according to the
   ISO standard (baseline performance) to that obtained by testing the TAVs
   following deployment in patient-specific replicas. Balloon-expandable (n
   = 2) and self-expandable (n = 3) TAVs were tested in an idealized
   geometry in mock-circulation system (following ISO 5840-3 guidelines)
   and compared to the measurements in a dedicated mock-circulation system
   adapted for the five patient-specific replicas. Patient-specific
   deployments resulted in a decline in performance as compared to the
   baseline idealized testing, as well as a variation in performance that
   depended on the design features of each device that was further
   correlated with the radial expansion and eccentricity of the deployed
   TAV stent (obtained with CT-scans of the deployed valves). By excluding
   the deployment effects in irregular geometries, the current idealized
   ISO testing is limited to characterize the baseline device performance.
   Utilizing patient-specific anatomic contours provides performance
   indicators under more stringent conditions likely encountered in vivo.
   It has the potential to enhance testing and development complementary to
   the ISO standard, for improved TAV safety and effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Health professions education (HPE) research is dominated by
   variable-centred analysis, which enables the exploration of
   relationships between different independent and dependent variables in a
   study. Although the results of such analysis are interesting, an effort
   to conduct a more person-centred analysis in HPE research can help us in
   generating a more nuanced interpretation of the data on the variables
   involved in teaching and learning. The added value of using
   person-centred analysis, next to variable-centred analysis, lies in what
   it can bring to the applications of the research findings in educational
   practice. Research findings of person-centred analysis can facilitate
   the development of more personalized learning or remediation pathways
   and customization of teaching and supervision efforts. Making the
   research findings more recognizable in practice can make it easier for
   teachers and supervisors to understand and deal with students. The aim
   of this article is to compare and contrast different methods that can be
   used for person-centred analysis and show the incremental value of such
   analysis in HPE research. We describe three methods for conducting
   person-centred analysis: cluster, latent class and Q-sort analyses,
   along with their advantages and disadvantage with three concrete
   examples for each method from HPE research studies.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple myeloma (MM) is a heterogeneous bone marrow cancer
   characterized by proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone
   marrow. One of its major symptoms are hypercalcaemia and bone lesions,
   which may result in pathologic bone fractures. Receptor activator for
   nuclear factor kappa B (RANK) and its ligand, RANKL, are part of an
   activation pathway for osteoclasts and are thus responsible for bone
   resorption. Furthermore, RANKL expression is increased in multiple
   myeloma. In the present study, we investigated the role of single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes coding for RANK (rs1805034,
   rs8086340), RANKL (rs7325635, rs7988338), and TACI (rs34562254), a
   receptor for osteoclast-derived pro-survival factors. The study involved
   222 patients and 222 healthy individuals, and the analysis included
   disease susceptibility, survival, bone lesions, calcium levels, and
   vascular endothelial growth factor levels. Patients with allele RANK
   rs1805034 C had higher survival (p = .003). This relationship was
   especially evident in women (p = .006). Furthermore, allele rs1805034 C
   was associated with slightly lower median age at diagnosis (64.0 vs.
   65.5, p = .008). Allele RANKL rs7325635 A correlated with lower
   progression-free survival (p = .027), and with lack of early progression
   (p = .023). Additionally, women with allele rs7325635 G were found to
   have higher calcium blood concentration (p = .040). Allele TACI
   rs34562254 A was more common in MM patients in more advanced stages (II
   and III stage International Staging System) at diagnosis (p = .017), and

Abstract = {{Nitrogen photo-fixation, under ambient conditions using low-price,
   earth-abundant, and eco-friendly nanostructured solar-energy materials
   and water feedstock, is a sustainable strategy to produce ammonia-a
   modern, safe, green, and H-based fuel as well as principal nitrogen
   supply for living organisms. To this end, herein, the authors fabricated
   a robust, stand-alone FeS2/Cu monolithic photoelectrochemical device,
   which is able to continually photosynthesize ammonia while N-2 molecules
   reaching the photodevice surface. Furthermore, it is reported for the
   first time that without consuming electricity {[}electron flow; faradaic
   process], just by applying a non-faradic/electrostatic potential bias to
   the device or adding a promoter species into the reaction medium, the
   activity of the photodevice to synthesize ammonia can be substantially
   enhanced {[}promotion: up to similar to 131\%]. Finally, through a
   photoelectrochemical approach and providing extra supporting evidence,
   the phenomenon is interpreted in detail from basic viewpoints.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we report on the Photoinduced Electron Transfer (PET)
   reaction between a donor (adenine analogue) and an acceptor
   (3-methoxychromone dye, 3MC) in the context of designing efficient
   fluorescent probes as DNA sensors. Firstly, Gibbs energy was
   investigated in disconnected donor-acceptor systems by Rehm-Weller
   equation. The oxidation potential of the adenine derivative was
   responsible for exergonicity of the PET reaction in separated
   combinations. Then, the PET reaction in donor-pi-acceptor conjugates was
   investigated using steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, acid-mediated
   PET inhibition and transient absorption techniques. In conjugated
   systems, PET is a favorable pathway of fluorescent quenching when an
   electron-rich adenine analogue (d7A) was connected to the fluorophore
   (3MC). We found that formation of ground-state complexes even at nm
   concentration range dominated the dye photophysics and generated poorly
   emissive species likely through intermolecular PET from d7A to 3MC. On
   the other hand, solution acidification disrupts complexation and turns
   on the dye emission. Bridging an electron-poor adenine analogue with
   high oxidation potential (8 d7A) to 3MC presenting low reduction
   potential is another alternative to prevent complex formation and
   produce highly emissive monomer conjugates.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GENERAL PHYSIOLOGY}},

Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{Calmodulin (CaM) plays a critical role in intracellular signaling and
   regulation of Ca2+-dependent proteins and ion channels. Mutations in CaM
   cause life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Among the known CaM targets,
   small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels are unique, since they
   are gated solely by beat-to-beat changes in intracellular Ca2+. However,
   the molecular mechanisms of how CaM mutations may affect the function of
   SK channels remain incompletely understood. To address the structural
   and functional effects of these mutations, we introduced prototypical
   human CaM mutations in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived
   cardiomyocyte-like cells (hiPSC-CMs). Using structural modeling and
   molecular dynamics simulation, we demonstrate that human
   calmodulinopathy-associated CaM mutations disrupt cardiac SK channel
   function via distinct mechanisms. CaMD96V and CaMD130G mutants reduce SK
   currents through a dominant-negative fashion. By contrast, specific
   mutations replacing phenylalanine with leucine result in conformational
   changes that affect helix packing in the C-lobe, which disengage the
   interactions between apo-CaM and the CaM-binding domain of SK channels.
   Distinct mutant CaMs may result in a significant reduction in the
   activation of the SK channels, leading to a decrease in the key
   Ca2+-dependent repolarization currents these channels mediate. The
   findings in this study may be generalizable to other interactions of
   mutant CaMs with Ca2+-dependent proteins within cardiac myocytes.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Precise harm assessment by the medical staff is very important in a
   patient safety event reporting system but there are differences in
   perception due to insufficiencies in education.
   Methods
   We developed the survey tool consisting of nine patient safety incident
   scenarios to investigate the interrater agreement in the harm score
   assigning among nurses. The survey tool was distributed to 287 nurses
   working at two hospitals.
   Results
   The overall kappa value for interrater agreement was k = 0.21 for harm
   and k = 0.28 for harm duration. In nine patient safety event scenarios,
   such as ``mislabeled specimen{''} or ``chest tube drain{''}, when the
   degree of harm was not clear, the assessments of harm and harm duration
   were somewhat dispersed.
   Conclusion
   For the quality of the patient safety incident reporting system, the
   accurate harm assessment of medical personnel is highly important;
   however, results in this study indicated that theassessment of the
   degree of harm by Korean nurses was not standardized. The reason for
   this variability could be due to the lack of education that takes harm
   assessment into account. Therefore, training in harm assessment and the
   development of programs to support this training are both necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) exhibits an excellent photocatalytic
   performance as a powder, especially under visible light irradiation.
   However, it encounters great challenges for practical applications. For
   instance, to avoid aggregation and precipitation, a continuous stirring
   process is required for the bare g-C3N4 powder during the photocatalytic
   reaction. In addition, recycling of the powder photocatalyst is
   complicated and usually not environment friendly. To overcome these
   drawbacks, we present a hybrid materials. This material combines g-C3N4
   nanosheets loaded with cocatalyst Pt atoms (CN) with a polymer hydrogel.
   In the ready-to-use photocatalyst, CN is well distributed in the
   hydrogel matrix. Water stored in the hydrogel can serve as a water
   reservoir for the photocatalytic water splitting. Due to the
   intermolecular interactions between CN and the hydrogel, a 3D network
   with a small-sized nanostructure is formed, which enhances the light
   absorption and the charge carrier separation. As a result, the H-2
   evolution rate is 7437 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), which is 130\% higher than
   that of the bare CN powder in water. Furthermore, the hydrogel-supported
   CN is able to function under ambient environment conditions without any
   significant reduction of the photocatalytic performance, as compared to
   the bare CN powder. In the hybrid material, the combination of hydrogel
   and CN provides a possibility for the photocatalyst to work without a
   water environment and accomplish an efficient H-2 evolution.}},

Title = {{A walking bout reveals altered foot thermodynamics associated with
   unilateral transtibial amputation among individuals with type 2 diabetes}},

Abstract = {{Background:
   Increased foot temperature among individuals with type 2 diabetes can be
   predictive of diabetic foot ulcer development. A combination of
   physiological and mechanical deficiencies may contribute to elevations
   in intact foot temperature during gait for individuals with type 2
   diabetes and transtibial amputation.
   Objective:
   This study evaluated plantar foot temperature differences between
   individuals with type 2 diabetes with and without transtibial
   amputation. We hypothesized that individuals with transtibial amputation
   maintain increased foot temperature compared to those without
   amputation.
   Study Design:
   Cross-sectional, case control.
   Methods:
   A sample of 16 participants with type 2 diabetes and transtibial
   amputation, and 16 age- and sex-matched participants with type 2
   diabetes without amputation were recruited. Foot temperatures were
   measured during resting, walking, and cooldown periods. Peak
   temperature, mean temperature, and rate of temperature change were
   analyzed for each period, and compared between cohorts.
   Results:
   Participants with amputation exhibited increased mean foot temperature
   while at rest and during walking. Participants without amputation
   exhibited increased rate of change of foot temperature during walking.
   No differences in peak temperature or rate of temperature change were
   observed during the baseline or cooldown periods.
   Conclusion:
   The current findings of altered foot temperature for individuals with
   transtibial amputation and type 2 diabetes suggest a possible reason for
   the high rates of contralateral limb ulceration and amputation among
   this population.}},

Abstract = {{The glomerular filtration barrier is a highly specialized capillary wall
   comprising fenestrated endothelial cells, podocytes, and an intervening
   basement membrane. In glomerular disease, this barrier loses functional
   integrity, allowing the passage of macromolecules and cells, and there
   are associated changes in both cell morphology and the extracellular
   matrix. Over the past 3 decades, there has been a transformation in our
   understanding about glomerular disease, fueled by genetic discovery, and
   this is leading to exciting advances in our knowledge about glomerular
   biology and pathophysiology. In current clinical practice, a genetic
   diagnosis already has important implications for management, ranging
   from estimating the risk of disease recurrence post-transplant to the
   life-changing advances in the treatment of atypical hemolytic uremic
   syndrome. Improving our understanding about the mechanistic basis of
   glomerular disease is required for more effective and personalized
   therapy options. In this review, we describe genotype and phenotype
   correlations for genetic disorders of the glomerular filtration barrier,
   with a particular emphasis on how these gene defects cluster by both
   their ontology and patterns of glomerular pathology.}},

Abstract = {{While Fe-N-C materials are a promising alternative to platinum for
   catalysing the oxygen reduction reaction in acidic polymer fuel cells,
   limited understanding of their operando degradation restricts rational
   approaches towards improved durability. Here we show that Fe-N-C
   catalysts initially comprising two distinct FeNx sites (S1 and S2)
   degrade via the transformation of S1 into iron oxides while the
   structure and number of S2 were unmodified. Structure-activity
   correlations drawn from end-of-test Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy reveal
   that both sites initially contribute to the oxygen reduction reaction
   activity but only S2 substantially contributes after 50 h of operation.
   From in situ Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy in inert gas coupled to
   calculations of the Mossbauer signature of FeNx moieties in different
   electronic states, we identify S1 to be a high-spin FeN4C12 moiety and
   S2 a low- or intermediate-spin FeN4C10 moiety. These insights lay the
   groundwork for rational approaches towards Fe-N-C cathodes with improved
   durability in acidic fuel cells.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a solid-state electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensor based
   on resonance energy transfer (RET) was proposed using MoS(2)QDs@g-C3N4
   as a donor and NH2-SiO2@PTCA as an acceptor. Herein, MoS(2)QDs could
   significantly facilitate the stability and efficiency of the ECL of
   g-C3N4. PTCA provided a large platform to anchor NH2-SiO2 nanoparticles.
   The prepared MoS(2)QDs@g-C3N4 exhibited good spectral overlap with the
   UV-vis absorption spectrum of NH2-SiO2@PTCA. Based on this, we designed
   an ``off-on{''} ECL sensing strategy for sensitive and selective
   detection of glutathione (GSH). Under the best conditions, the linear
   range of the sensor for GSH detection was from 0.001 to 100 mu M with a
   detection limit of 0.63 nM (S/N = 3). More importantly, GSH in
   commercial samples can be detected using the proposed sensor, which
   indicated its superior detection capabilities and potential application
   value in commercial medicines.}},

Title = {{Development and Validation of a Nomogram to Predict Type 2 Diabetes
   Mellitus in Overweight and Obese Adults: A Prospective Cohort Study from
   82938 Adults in China}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Background. The twin epidemic of overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes
   mellitus (T2DM) is a major public health problem globally, especially in
   China. Overweight/obese adults commonly coexist with T2DM, which is
   closely related to adverse health outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed
   to develop risk nomogram of T2DM in Chinese adults with
   overweight/obesity. Methods. We used prospective cohort study data for
   82938 individuals aged >= 20 years free of T2DM collected between 2010
   and 2016 and divided them into a training (n = 58056) and a validation
   set (n = 24882). Using the least absolute shrinkage and selection
   operator (LASSO) regression model in training set, we identified
   optimized risk factors of T2DM, followed by the establishment of T2DM
   prediction nomogram. The discriminative ability, calibration, and
   clinical usefulness of nomogram were assessed. The results were assessed
   by internal validation in validation set. Results. Six independent risk
   factors of T2DM were identified and entered into the nomogram including
   age, body mass index, fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol,
   triglycerides, and family history. The nomogram incorporating these six
   risk factors showed good discrimination regarding the training set, with
   a Harrell's concordance index (C-index) of 0.859 {[}95\% confidence
   interval (CI): 0.850-0.868] and an area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve of 0.862 (95\% CI: 0.853-0.871). The calibration
   curves indicated well agreement between the probability as predicted by
   the nomogram and the actual probability. Decision curve analysis
   demonstrated that the prediction nomogram was clinically useful. The
   consistent of findings was confirmed using the validation set.
   Conclusions. The nomogram showed accurate prediction for T2DM among
   Chinese population with overweight and obese and might aid in assessment
   risk of T2DM.}},

Abstract = {{Rice tillering is an important agronomic trait affecting grain yield.
   Here, we identified a high-tillering mutant tillering20 (t20), which
   could be restored to the wild type by treatment with the strigolactone
   (SL) analog racGR24. T20 encodes a chloroplast zeta-carotene isomerase
   (Z-ISO), which is involved in the biosynthesis of carotenoids and their
   metabolites, SL and abscisic acid (ABA). The t20 mutant has reduced SL
   and ABA, raising the question of how SL and ABA biosynthesis is
   coordinated, and whether they have overlapping functions in tillering.
   We discovered that rac-GR24 stimulated T20 expression and enhanced
   all-trans-beta-carotene biosynthesis. Importantly, rac-GR24 also
   stimulated expression of Oryza sativa 9-CIS-EPDXY-CAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE
   1 (OsNCED1) through induction of Oryza sativa HOMEOBOX12 (OsHOX12),
   promoting ABA biosynthesis in shoot base. On the other hand, ABA
   treatment significantly repressed SL biosynthesis and the ABA
   biosynthetic mutants displayed elevated SL biosynthesis. ABA treatment
   reduced the number of basal tillers in both t20 and wild-type plants.
   Furthermore, while ABA-deficient mutants aba1 and aba2 had the same
   number of basal tillers as wild type, they had more unproductive upper
   tillers at maturity. This work demonstrates complex interactions in the
   biosynthesis of carotenoid, SLs and ABA, and reveals a role for ABA in
   the regulation of rice tillering.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of Dirac points (DPs) characterizes the topological phase
   transition and the gapless interface states in composite
   metal-dielectric metamaterials. In this work, we study a kind of
   compound plasmonic-dielectric periodic structure (PDPS) which sustains
   both plasmonic modes and multiple photonic modes. The structure has
   primitive cell consisting of four layers made from triple constituent
   components. Due to the generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger, DPs can emerge
   at the Brillouin one center. More specifically, in weak
   plasmonic-photonic mode interaction regime, multiple DPs would emerge at
   the Brillouin zone center and edge due to the band folding, from the
   perspective of general effective medium. From the rigorous field
   analysis, the origin of these DPs is clearly demonstrated. These
   interleaved DPs behave as the intermediate transitions of the surface
   impedance for the PDPS and raise fully spanned topological interface
   states originated from 0 to 2nd-order photonic bands in the PDPS. The
   cases of combining our PDPS with either a plasmonic or dielectric
   homogenous medium are presented. (C) 2020 Optical Society of America

Volume = {{25}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Research indicated the prevalence of perinatal deaths of
   infants immediately or up to a week after birth and includes fresh and
   macerated stillbirths and neonatal deaths. Worldwide, there is a decline
   in perinatal deaths. However, in South Africa, it is not the case. Often
   the quality of maternity care is considered as the most important
   contributing factor for these deaths. However, maternal and neonatal
   factors can also contribute.
   Aim: The aim of the study was to determine the maternal and neonatal
   factors associated with perinatal deaths in a single selected district
   hospital within the Free State Province of South Africa.
   Setting: The maternity unit of the largest district hospital in the
   specific district in the Free State Province of South Africa.
   Method: A clinical audit design was used. Units of analysis comprised
   the Perinatal Problem Identification Programme (PPIP) database of
   neonates born during 2015, and their mothers. A random sample of 384
   alive neonates and an all-inclusive sample of 43 deceased neonates were
   taken from a total of 2319. Descriptive statistics were reported and
   Cohen's effect sizes, d, were calculated to identify practically
   significant differences between the neonates in the alive and the
   deceased group, respectively.
   Results: Cohen's effect sizes and logistical regression analyses
   indicate that the Apgar score recorded 10 min after birth, gestational
   age, birth weight of neonate and the parity of the mother were the most
   practically significant factors influencing a neonate's chances of
   survival.
   Conclusion: Quality maternity care is not the only cause of perinatal
   mortality rates; maternal and neonatal factors are also contributors.}},

   cancer (mCRPC). Realistic values of cell radiosensitivity, nucleus size
   and lesion size were used for calculations. As the cell radiosensitivity
   decreased, the nucleus size decreased and the lesion size increased, the
   absorbed dose to reach a given TCP increased. The widest variations
   occurred with regard to the cell radiosensitivity. For the Monte Carlo
   simulations, in order to address a non-uniform PSMA expression,
   different Ac-225-PSMA distributions were considered. The effect of these
   different PSMA distributions resulted in small variations in the TCP
   curves (maximum variation of 5\%). Absorbed doses to reach a TCP of 0.9
   for a uniform Ac-225-PSMA distribution, considering a relative
   biological effectiveness (RBE) of 5, ranged between 35.0 Gy and 116.5
   Gy. The lesion absorbed doses per administered activity reported in a
   study on treatments with Ac-225-PSMA of mCRPC ranged between 1.3 Gy
   MBq(-1) and 9.8 Gy MBq(-1) for a RBE = 5. For a 70 kg-patient to whom
   100 kBq kg(-1) of Ac-225-PSMA are administered, the range of lesion
   absorbed doses would be between 9.1 Gy and 68.6 Gy. Thus, for a single
   cycle of 100 kBq kg(-1), a number of lesions would not receive an
   absorbed dose high enough to reach a TCP of 0.9.}},

Abstract = {{Methylation of carbon-5 of cytosines (m(5)C) is a post-transcriptional
   nucleotide modification of RNA found in all kingdoms of life. While
   individual m(5)C-methyltransferases have been studied, the impact of the
   global cytosine-5 methylome on development, homeostasis and stress
   remains unknown. Here, using Caenorhabditis elegans, we generated the
   first organism devoid of m(5)C in RNA, demonstrating that this
   modification is non-essential. Using this genetic tool, we determine the
   localisation and enzymatic specificity of m(5)C sites in the RNome in
   vivo. We find that NSUN-4 acts as a dual rRNA and tRNA methyltransferase
   in C. elegans mitochondria. In agreement with leucine and proline being
   the most frequently methylated tRNA isoacceptors, loss of m(5)C impacts
   the decoding of some triplets of these two amino acids, leading to
   reduced translation efficiency. Upon heat stress, m(5)C loss leads to
   ribosome stalling at UUG triplets, the only codon translated by an
   m(5)C34-modified tRNA. This leads to reduced translation efficiency of
   UUG-rich transcripts and impaired fertility, suggesting a role of m(5)C
   tRNA wobble methylation in the adaptation to higher temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Isoflavones are listed among the most widely studied natural compounds
   in light of their several biological properties, one of which consists
   in their ability to inhibit phosphodiesterases (PDEs). The enzymes from
   this class are deputed to the regulation of the 3 `,5 `-cyclic adenosine
   monophosphate (cAMP) and 3 `,5 `-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)
   levels in the central and in the peripheral nervous systems (CNS and
   PNS), thus affecting several downstream pathways involved in different
   diseases. In this work, an extensive set of semi-synthetically
   obtainable molecules was generated by a combinatorial approach starting
   from the isoflavone scaffold with the aim of optimizing the interaction
   with the macromolecule and identifying new putative hit compounds. More
   specifically, a docking protocol was developed, validated and then
   adopted to screen the generated compounds towards PDE4, PDE5 and PDE9,
   three isoforms which are known to be involved in neurodegenerative
   disorders. Then, a structure based analysis was employed to guide the
   identification of the most promising hits based on the interactions with
   specific residues in the metal binding pocket of the PDEs, which have
   been proved to be crucial for triggering enzymatic inhibition. Lastly,
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted to study with greater
   accuracy the binding of these compounds with the considered
   macromolecules. This study led to the set up and validation of a
   multi-technique computational approach for efficiently screening
   molecular structures towards PDE isoforms involved in neurodegeneration,
   and may pave the way for more targeted development of new,
   semi-synthetic potential PDE inhibitors derived from the isoflavone
   scaffold.}},

Abstract = {{This study explores hyper-cross-linking of the cores of block copolymer
   micelles as a means to generate star polymers with a hyper-cross-linked

   micelles which were reacted with alpha,alpha `-dichloro-p-xylene in the
   presence of FeCl3 to produce core hyper-cross-linked star (CHS) polymers
   by selective cross-linking of the PS core. A kinetic investigation
   showed formation of high-molar mass species (>10(4) kg mol(-1)) within 1
   h of reaction, which supported conversion of individual MS micelles into
   CHS polymers. We synthesized several CHS polymers by varying the PS core
   fractions from 20 to 53\%. All the polymers possessed discrete spherical
   cores that were 19-60 nm in diameter and all were highly soluble in
   organic solvents retaining the CHS architecture. While permanent

Abstract = {{Aims Eculizumab is an anti-C5 monoclonal antibody approved for rare
   diseases including atypical haemolytic-uraemic syndrome. The maintenance
   phase dosing regimen is identical for all adult patients: 1200 mg every
   2 weeks. Recent studies reported an overexposure in many patients when
   considering a target trough concentration range of 50-100 mg/L. The aim
   of the present work was to validate the feasibility of therapeutic drug
   monitoring of eculizumab in atypical haemolytic-uraemic syndrome
   patients.
   Methods We performed a 2-step prospective multicentre study. In the
   first phase, we developed a pharmacokinetic population model using data
   from 40 patients and identified patients for whom a 1-week lengthening
   of interval between infusions would lead to a trough concentration above
   100 mg/L. In the second phase, selected patients were allocated a 1-week
   extension and eculizumab trough concentrations were monitored.
   Results The model confirmed the previously reported influence of
   bodyweight on elimination clearance and predicted that 36 (90\%)
   patients would be eligible for interval extension. In the second phase
   of the study, a 1-week lengthening of interval between infusions was
   performed in 15 patients whose trough concentration at the next visit
   was predicted with a Bayesian model to be above 100 mg/L. After interval
   extension, 10 patients (67\%) presented measured trough concentrations
   over 100 mg/L. No biological or clinical recurrence of disease was
   observed, even in the 5 patients with concentrations below 100 mg/L in
   whom the initial dosing regimen was resumed.
   Conclusion Safe eculizumab interval adjustment is feasible with a PK
   monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Highly selective fishing has the potential to permanently change the
   characteristics within a population and could drive the decline of
   genetic diversity. European lobster is an intensively fished crustacean
   species in the Adriatic Sea which reaches high market value. Since
   knowledge of population structure and dynamics is important for
   effective fisheries management, in this study, we used 14 neutral
   microsatellites loci and partial mitochondrial COI region sequencing to
   explore population connectivity and genetic structure by comparing
   samples from the Adriatic Sea and the adjacent basins of the
   Mediterranean Sea. The obtained results suggest that neutral genetic
   diversity has not been significantly affected by decrease in population
   size due to overfishing, habitat degradation and other anthropogenic
   activities. Global genetic differentiation across all populations was
   low (F-ST = 0.0062). Populations from the Adriatic Sea were panmictic,
   while genetic differentiation was found among populations from different
   Mediterranean basins. Observed gene flow for European lobster suggest
   that populations in the north eastern Adriatic act as a source for
   surrounding areas, emphasizing the need to protect these populations by
   establishing interconnected MPAs that will be beneficial for both
   fisheries and conservation management.}},

Abstract = {{COVID-19 has not only dramatically changed the way we live, it has also
   impacted how we die and how we grieve. With more and more Americans
   dying in ICU settings, away from family, and more funerals being held
   virtually, the pandemic has seriously curtailed normal expressions of
   grief and cultural mourning. Given the CDC guidelines for funerals and
   social distancing, simple human touch is no longer a mitigating force
   against prolonged grief. So, while one epidemic has a face and a name,
   we point to a second, more silent yet potentially equally devastating
   one, unacknowledged grief, and emphasize how policy can be a current
   therapeutic. We can wait for a vaccine, but we can also act now through
   thoughtful policymaking that acknowledges this second epidemic.}},

Abstract = {{The role of Bronsted and Lewis acid sites at the surface of
   heteropolyacid-based catalysts was studied in resorcinol alkylation with
   methyl-tert-butylether. Three sets of catalysts, SiO2/HPW, TiO2/HPW and
   ZrO2/HPW (where HPW stands for phosphotungstic acid hydrate),
   synthesized by the hydrolytic sol-gel method were investigated. The
   surface total acidity was characterized by ammonia chemisorption and
   thermo-programmed desorption. In addition, infrared analysis of adsorbed
   pyridine was performed to distinguish between Bronsted and Lewis sites.
   The resorcinol conversion was correlated to the fraction of Bronsted
   sites present at the catalyst surface based on the total acidity. The
   results pointed out the importance of considering both Bronsted and
   Lewis sites as active players in the mechanism of resorcinol alkylation:
   Lewis sites have the role of adsorbing the substrate close to the
   tert-butyl cation, which is formed on Bronsted sites. Resorcinol
   conversion can be increased to a maximum if the right Bronsted/Lewis
   ratio is attained at the catalyst surface.}},

Abstract = {{This work focuses on a class of nano-laminated Ni/Al composites
   fabricated by a rolling-stacking procedure. This method results in
   nano-laminated composites with a complex structure. Their reactivity was
   compared with that of reactive multilayer nanofoils with constant
   bilayer thickness. Typical samples are composed of randomly distributed
   grains of Ni and Al. The self-propagating reactive front presents
   peculiarities that are directly related to the initial microstructure.
   The combustion mode is unsteady, with shifts in velocity. The
   temperature profile is characterized by broad combustion and
   post-combustion zones. The instantaneous shape of the front is tortuous,
   with the appearance of hot spots correlated with the underlying grain
   configuration. Local dynamics was studied in order to detect all the
   elemental processes occurring at nanoscale that trigger propagation:
   melting of Al, coarsening of Al grains, progressive exothermic
   dissolution mixing, heterogeneous nucleation, and growth of the
   intermetallic phase,
   B2-NiAl. The role of the complex initial microstructure was clearly
   demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{The preparation of functionalized, heteroleptic PdxL2x coordination
   cages is desirable for catalytic and optoelectronic applications.
   Current rational design of these cages uses the angle between
   metal-binding (angle B) sites of the di(pyridyl)arene linker to predict
   the topology of homoleptic cages obtained via non-covalent chemistry.
   However, this model neglects the contributions of steric bulk between
   the pyridyl residues-a prerequisite for endohedrally functionalized
   cages, and fails to rationalize heteroleptic cages. We describe a
   classical mechanics (CM) approach to predict the topological outcomes of
   PdxL2x coordination cage formation with arbitrary linker combinations,
   accounting for the electronic effects of coordination and steric effects
   of linker structure. Initial validation of our CM method with reported
   homoleptic Pd(12)(L)Fu(24) ((L)Fu = 2,5-bis(pyridyl)furan) assembly
   suggested the formation of a minor topology Pd(15)(L)Fu(30), identified
   experimentally by mass spectrometry. Application to heteroleptic cage
   systems employing mixtures of (L)Fu (angle B = 127 degrees) and its
   thiophene congener Th-L (angle B = 149 degrees angle B-exp = 152.4
   degrees) enabled prediction of Pd12L24 and Pd24L48 coordination cages
   formation, reliably emulating experimental data. Finally, the
   topological outcome for exohedrally ((L)Ex) and endohedrally ((L)En)
   functionalized heteroleptic PdxL2x coordination cages were predicted to
   assess the effect of steric bulk on both topological outcomes and
   coordination cage yields, with comparisons drawn to experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Throughout the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, personal
   protective equipment (PPE) guidance has rapidly evolved. Healthcare
   workers (HCWs) should use PPE correctly to reduce the risk of nosocomial
   transmission of the coronavirus. We predict a lack of training regarding
   correct PPE usage amongst HCWs and introduce a low-resource method of
   training.
   Methods: HCWs from various disciplines at a District General Hospital
   self-rated their ability in utilising PPE using uncontrolled pre- and
   post-session 16-item questionnaires following a single PPE training
   session. Participant responses were analysed using Student's t-test for
   independent (unpaired) samples.
   Results: Of 64 participants, 37 participants (59\%) received any prior
   PPE training. Six participants (9\%) previously received specific severe
   acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 PPE training. Survey scores
   were higher in the post-test than the pre-test group.
   Conclusion: This study highlights the lack of formal PPE training
   amongst HCWs and the need for establishing PPE training as part of the
   mandatory training of HCWs.}},

Title = {{Bypassing the nearest emergency department for a more distant
   neurosurgical centre in traumatic brain injury patients}},
Journal = {{BRITISH JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY}},
Abstract = {{Background and objective
   Major trauma triage within regional trauma networks (RTN) select
   patients with suspected TBI for bypass to specialist neuroscience
   centres (SNC), expediting neurosurgical care but may delay
   resuscitation. This comparative effectiveness study assessed the impact
   of this strategy on the risk adjusted hospital survival rates of
   patients confirmed to have intracranial injury on brain computed
   tomography (CT) scan.
   Method
   A retrospective cohort study was conducted using Trauma Audit and
   Research Network trauma registry data. Adult patients with a TBI on CT
   scan were included if they presented between June 2015 to February 2016
   to SNCs or non-specialist acute hospitals (NSAH) in the North of England
   (South Cumbria, Lancashire and the North East Region). Patients were
   identified as having bypassed a nearer NSAH emergency department (ED) to
   a SNC using google maps. Their standardised excess survival rate was
   compared to TBI patients who received primary treatment at a NSAH. A
   multivariate logistic regression model predicting 30-day survival after
   TBI (Ps14(n)) (1) was used to adjust for variation in casemix between
   cohorts.
   Study design and results
   355 patients met the study inclusion criteria, with 89/355 (25\%) of TBI
   patients bypassing a nearer NSAH to a SNC, and 266/355 (75\%) receiving
   primary treatment at an NSAH. The median severity of intracranial injury
   was equivalent (median Head Abbreviated Injury Scale 4 (IQR 4-5) in each
   group. There was no statistically significant difference in the
   standardised excess survival rate between the two cohorts; +6.15\% for
   bypass (95\% CI -1.24\% to +13.55\%) versus -1.12\% for non-bypass (95\%
   CI -4.51\% to +2.25\%).
   Conclusion and future research
   No statistically significant survival benefit was identified for TBI
   patients who bypassed the nearest ED to attend a SNC compared to those
   receiving treatment at the nearest NSAH, however a clinically
   significant 7\% excess survival rate merits a larger study.}},

Abstract = {{Luminescent rare earth Eu(ii) complexes with a characteristic 5d-4f
   transition have shown potential in various applications. However, the
   exploration and further application of typical Eu(ii) complexes are
   strongly impeded by their instability arising from the easily oxidation
   of Eu2+ ions. In this work, three new Eu(ii) complexes
   bis(hydro-tris(3-phenyl-5-methylpyrazolyl)borate)europium(ii)
   (Eu(Tp(Ph,Me))(2)), bis(hydro-tris(3-phenylpyrazolyl)borate)europium(ii)
   (Eu(Tp(Ph))(2)), and
   bis(hydro-tris(3,5-diphenylpyrazolyl)borate)europium(ii)
   (Eu(Tp(Ph2))(2)) were designed and synthesized. Their crystal
   structures, photophysical properties and air stabilities were
   characterized and discussed. It is found that the introduction of the
   bulky phenyl group not only increases the air stability by sterically
   hindering the central Eu2+ ions, but also tunes the maximum emission
   wavelength by influencing the ligand field. This work provides rules for
   regulating the luminescence properties of Eu(ii) complexes as well as
   design basis for achieving stable and efficient Eu(ii) complexes.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MATERIALS AND PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES}},
Abstract = {{Hybrid composite refers to as an attractive structural material due to
   its ability to provide a better combination of properties with respect
   to single-particle-containing composite. Composites were prepared by
   using customised extruder machine at five levels (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50
   wt\%) of aluminium powder and silicon carbide loading. Microstructural
   analysis utilising scanning electron microscope and optical microscope
   was performed to observe the cohesiveness and distributions of matrix
   and reinforcement in the composites. Tensile, flexural, impact and
   hardness tests were conducted for the purpose of mechanical
   characterisation. Tensile strength increased up to 40 wt\% particles
   loading and then decreased in 50 wt\% particles loaded composite.
   Young's modulus, flexural strength, flexural modulus, and hardness
   increased with the increase of aluminium powder and silicon carbide
   reinforcement loading. On the other hand, impact strength showed an
   opposite trend. Based on the particle loading and uniformity, 40 wt\%
   aluminium powder and silicon carbide reinforced composite revealed the
   best set of mechanical properties.}},

Volume = {{63}},

Month = {{JAN 4}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to critically examine the prohibition on
   debt-to-equity conversions for private limited companies in Thailand,
   resulting from an interpretation of Section 1119 of the Thai Civil and
   Commercial Code (TCCC) adopted by academics and the regulator.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper critically examines the interpretation of Section 1119 of the
   TCCC made by academics, the Thai Supreme Court and the regulator. Taking
   an approach, which draws on debate in the EU over the past two decades,
   this paper presents a new understanding of the rules relating to legal
   capital in Thailand. This new understanding is applied to challenge the
   orthodox interpretation of Section 1119.
   Findings
   The interpretation proposed by this paper is that debt-to-equity
   conversions may be permitted when viewed as shares issued in return for
   payment in kind. This proposed interpretation is consistent with
   existing Thai Supreme Court jurisprudence. In addition, a close reading
   of the provision, further supported by a historical investigation into
   the legislative drafting process, reveals that it reflects the original
   intention behind this provision.
   Originality/value
   This paper presents a view of Thai legal capital rules, which challenges
   the orthodox understanding of their nature, purpose and categorisation.
   Furthermore, the proposed interpretation of Section 1119 of the TCCC, if
   adopted by the regulator, would permit Thai private limited companies to
   engage in debt-to-equity swaps without further legislative intervention.}},

Title = {{Assessment of the relationships between agroecosystem condition and the
   ecosystem service soil erosion regulation in Northern Germany}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{Ecosystems provide multiple services that are necessary to maintain
   human life. Agroecosystems are very productive suppliers of
   biomass-related provisioning ecosystem services, e.g. food, fibre, and
   energy. At the same time, they are highly dependent on good ecosystem
   condition and regulating ecosystem services such as soil fertility,
   water supply or soil erosion regulation. Assessments of this interplay
   of ecosystem condition and services are needed to understand the
   relationships in highly managed systems. Therefore, the aim of this
   study is twofold: First, to test the concept and indicators proposed by
   the European Union Working Group on Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems
   and their Services (MAES) for assessing agroecosystem condition at a
   regional level. Second, to identify the relationships between ecosystem
   condition and the delivery of ecosystem services. For this purpose, we
   applied an operational framework for integrated mapping and assessment
   of ecosystems and their services. We used the proposed indicators to
   assess the condition of agroecosystems in Northern Germany and
   regulating ecosystem service control of erosion rates. We used existing
   data from official databases to calculate the different indicators and
   created maps of environmental pressures, ecosystem condition and
   ecosystem service indicators for the Federal State of Lower Saxony.
   Furthermore, we identified areas within the state where pressures are
   high, conditions are unfavourable, and more sustainable management
   practices are needed. Despite the limitations of the indicators and data
   availability, our results show positive, negative, and no significant
   correlations between the different pressures and condition indicators,
   and the control of erosion rates. The idea behind the MAES framework is
   to indicate the general condition of an ecosystem. However, we observed
   that not all proposed indicators can explain to what extent ecosystems
   can provide specific ecosystem services. Further research on other
   ecosystem services provided by agroecosystems would help to identify
   synergies and trade-offs. Moreover, the definition of a reference
   condition, although complicated for anthropogenically highly modified
   agroecosystems, would provide a benchmark to compare information on the
   condition of the ecosystems, leading to better land use policy and
   management decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Glass manufacturing is a high-temperature, energy-intensive, and highly
   inefficient process, with a significant global environmental impact.
   Therefore, given the high-scaled nature of the glass-making sector, the
   design of more energy-efficient manufacturing protocols is an economic
   and environmental imperative. In this context, this work presents a
   comprehensive study about the milling effect in the heat-driven
   chemistry and phase evolution, of a typical soda-lime-silica
   (Na2O:CaO:SiO2) flat glass batch. Our findings show that, with the
   experimental settings imposed in this work, mechanochemical reactions
   leading to in situ formation of alkali/alkaline-earth silicate compounds
   in the vial, are most likely absent. However, all carbonated raw
   materials of the formula (soda ash, calcite, and dolomite), undergo
   severe structural damage during milling and even become amorphous to XRD
   after milling for 360 min, with their decomposition reactions shifting
   markedly toward lower temperatures as the milling time increases (e.g.,
   the volatile fraction of the formula activated for 360 min, is
   completely removed almost 200 degrees C below than of a nonactivated
   reference sample). Furthermore, milling has also a profound effect in
   the evolution of the silicon local coordination environment, with
   temperature, and in the formation temperature and stoichiometry of
   silicate species observed on heating. Moreover, events related to the
   depolymerization of the fully linked Q(4) units characteristic of
   crystalline SiO2 (i.e., formation of metal silicates), are observed in
   activated batches at temperatures well below those of the reference
   sample (e.g., 600 degrees C when activated for 360 min vs 900 degrees C
   of a nonactivated sample). These changes are not only a consequence of
   particle size reduction, because the particle size distribution of the
   batch does not change much after 30 min; milling-induced amorphization
   of the carbonated fraction of the formula and the corresponding reduced
   activation energy for their decomposition reactions and improved
   reactivity toward SiO2 are the driving forces behind the significant
   reduction in the formation temperature of the first liquid phases with
   increasing milling time.}},

Abstract = {{Sustained disturbances are relevant for environmental biotechnology as
   they can lead to alternative stable states in a system that may not be
   reversible. Here, we tested the effect of a sustained organic loading
   alteration (food-to-biomass ratio, F:M, and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio,
   C:N) on activated sludge bioreactors, focusing on the stability of
   nitrification and nitrifiers. Two sets of replicate 5-L sequencing batch
   reactors were operated at different, low and high, F:M (0.19-0.36 mg
   COD/mg TSS/d) and C:N (3.5-6.3 mg COD/mg TKN) conditions for a period of
   74 days, following 53 days of sludge acclimation. Recovery and
   resilience were tested during the last 14 days by operating all reactors
   at low F:M and C:N (henceforth termed F:M-C:N). Stable nitrite
   accumulation (77\%) was achieved through high F:M-C:N loading with a
   concurrent reduction in the abundance of Nitrospira. Subsequently, only
   two of the three reactors experiencing a switch back from high to low
   F:M-C:N recovered the nitrite oxidation function, with an increase in
   Nitrobacter as the predominant NOB, without a recovery of Nitrospira.
   The AOB community was more diverse, resistant and resilient than the NOB
   community. We showed that functional recovery and resilience can vary
   across replicate reactors, and that nitrification recovery need not
   coincide with a return to the initial nitrifying community structure.}},

Title = {{Analysis of the residual stresses and deformations during the autogenous

Abstract = {{Purpose
   The gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process is a widely used process
   that produces quality weldments. But the high heat generation from the
   GTAW arc can cause extreme temperatures as high as 20,000 degrees C. The
   residual stresses and deformations are high accordingly. One of the
   methods for decreasing residual stresses and deformations is to change
   the welding pattern. In the literature, there are not so many examples
   of modeling dealing with welding patterns. This paper aims to
   investigate the influence of welding patterns on the deformations.
   Design/methodology/approach
   In this work, back-stepping patterns and partitioning of the weld line
   were investigated and the distortions and residual stresses were
   calculated. By doing this, temperature-dependent thermophysical and
   thermo-mechanical material properties were used. The temperature
   distribution and deformation from experiments with the same welding
   conditions were used for validation purposes.
   Findings
   Seven different welding patterns were analyzed. There is only one
   pattern with a single partition. There are three patterns investigated
   for both two and three partitioned weldings. The minimum deformation and
   the optimum residual stress combination is obtained for the last
   pattern, which is a three partitioned and diverging pattern.
   Originality/value
   The most important aspect of this paper is that it deals with welding
   patterns, which is not much studied beforehand. The other important
   thing is that the structural part and the thermal part of the simulation
   were coupled mutually and validated according to experiments.}},

Abstract = {{The new guidelines for the diagnosis and management of atrial
   fibrillation (AF) were published by the European Society of Cardiology
   (ESC) in collaboration with the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic
   Surgery (EACTS) in August 2020. The 2020 guidelines of the ESC on AF
   summarize the current developments in this field and provide general
   recommendations for the management of patients with AF based on the
   principles of evidence-based medicine. Beside the general statements on
   definition, epidemiology and clinical features of AF, interesting new
   aspects in screening and diagnosis of AF are also presented. The main
   novelties of the 2020 guidelines are the proposal of the 4S-AF scheme
   for a structured characterization of AF that takes the stroke risk,
   severity of symptoms, severity of AF burden and substrate severity into
   account. Also new is the ABC approach for improvement of the structured
   management and treatment results. A further innovation is the
   introduction of the concept of major risk factors for recurrences in the
   decision for catheter ablation. This review focuses on the newest and
   most important recommendations taken from the 2020 ESC guidelines for
   the diagnosis and management of AF.}},

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is one of the most accurate computation
   methods for dose calculation and image formation in radiation therapy.
   However, the high computational complexity and long execution time of
   MCS limits its broad use. In this paper, we present a novel strategy to
   accelerate MCS using a graphic processing unit (GPU), and we demonstrate
   the application in mega-voltage (MV) cone-beam computed tomography
   (CBCT) simulation. A new framework that generates a series of MV
   projections from a single simulation run is designed specifically for
   MV-CBCT acquisition. A Geant4-based GPU code for photon simulation is
   incorporated into the framework for the simulation of photon transport
   through a phantom volume. The FastEPID method, which accelerates the
   simulation of MV images, is modified and integrated into the framework.
   The proposed GPU-based simulation strategy was tested for its accuracy
   and efficiency in a Catphan 604 phantom and an anthropomorphic pelvis
   phantom with beam energies at 2.5 MV, 6 MV, and 6 MV FFF. In all cases,
   the proposed GPU-based simulation demonstrated great simulation accuracy
   and excellent agreement with measurement and CPU-based simulation in
   terms of reconstructed image qualities. The MV-CBCT simulation was
   accelerated by factors of roughly 900-2300 using an NVIDIA Tesla V100
   GPU card against a 2.5 GHz AMD Opteron (TM) Processor 6380.}},

Abstract = {{Coliforms are one of the most common families of bacteria responsible
   for water contamination. Certain coliform strains can be extremely
   toxic, and even fatal if consumed. Current technologies for coliform
   detection are expensive, require multiple complicated steps, and can
   take up to 24 hours to produce accurate results. Recently, open-channel,
   paper-based microfluidic devices have become popular for rapid,
   inexpensive, and accurate bioassays. In this work, we have created an
   integrated microfluidic coliform lysis and detection device by
   fabricating customizable omniphilic regions via direct printing of
   omniphilic channels on an omniphobic, fluorinated paper. This
   paper-based device is the first of its kind to demonstrate successful
   cell lysing on-chip, as it can allow for the flow and control of both
   high and low surface tension liquids, including different cell lysing
   agents. The fabricated microfluidic device was able to successfully
   detect E. coli, via the presence of the coliform-specific enzyme,
   beta-galactosidase, at a concentration as low as similar to 10(4) CFU
   mL(-1). Further, E. coli at an initial concentration of 1 CFU mL(-1)
   could be detected after only 6 hours of incubation. We believe that
   these devices can be readily utilized for real world E. coli
   contamination detection in multiple applications, including food and
   water safety.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundTrans-women sex workers bear the greatest brunt of HIV and
   other sexually transmitted infections (STI). Trans-women are 49 times
   more at risk of HIV infections compared to the general population.
   However, they remain underserved and continue to grapple with access to
   and utilisation of HIV/STI prevention services. This study explored
   barriers to access and utilisation of HIV/STI prevention services and
   associated coping mechanisms.MethodsThis exploratory qualitative study
   was conducted among trans-women sex workers in the Greater Kampala
   Metropolitan area, Uganda. A total of 22 in-depth interviews, 6 key
   informant interviews and 9 focus group discussions were conducted to
   obtain data on barriers to access and utilisation of HIV and other STI
   prevention and care services, and coping strategies of trans-women sex
   workers. Data were analysed through thematic analysis using a hybrid of
   inductive and deductive approaches.ResultsIndividual level barriers to
   access and utilisation of HIV/STI prevention and care services included
   internalised stigma and low socio-economic status. Healthcare system
   barriers included social exclusion and lack of recognition by other key
   population groups; stigmatisation by some healthcare providers; breach
   of confidentiality by some healthcare providers; limited hours of
   operation of some key population-friendly healthcare facilities;
   discrimination by straight patients and healthcare providers; stockout
   of STI drugs; inadequate access to well-equipped treatment centres and
   high cost of drugs. At community level, transphobia hindered access and
   utilisation of HIV/STI prevention and care services. The coping
   strategies included use of substitutes such as lotions, avocado or
   yoghurt to cope with a lack of lubricants. Herbs were used as
   substitutes for STI drugs, while psychoactive substances were used to
   cope with stigma and discrimination, and changing the dress code to hide
   their preferred gender identity.ConclusionsIndividual, community and
   healthcare system barriers hindered access and utilisation of HIV/STI
   prevention and care services among the trans-women sex workers. There is
   a need to create an enabling environment in order to enhance access to
   and utilisation of HIV/STI prevention and care services for trans-women
   sex workers through sensitisation of healthcare providers, other key
   population groups and the community at large on the transgender
   identity.}},

Abstract = {{Cross-correlation between magnetism and dielectric is expected to offer
   distinct emergent phenomena. Here, magnetic excitations in the organic
   donor-acceptor spin-chain system, tetrathiafulvalene-bromanil (TTF-BA),
   with a ferroelectric ground state is investigated by H-1-NMR
   spectroscopy. A nonmagnetic transition with a ferroelectric order is
   marked by sharp drops in the NMR shift and the nuclear spin relaxation
   rate T-1(-1) at 53 K. Remarkably, the analyses of the NMR shift and
   T-1(-1) dictate that the paramagnetic spin susceptibility in TTF-BA is
   substantially suppressed from that expected for the one-dimensional
   Heisenberg spins. We propose that the spin-lattice coupling and the

   formation in the ionic spin system with a nonmagnetic ferroelectric

Title = {{Lower Trabecular Bone Score and Spine Bone Mineral Density Are
   Associated With Bone Stress Injuries and Triad Risk Factors in
   Collegiate Athletes}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Determinants of bone health and injury are important to
   identify in athletes. Bone mineral density (BMD) is commonly measured in
   athletes with Female Athlete Triad (Triad) risk factors; the trabecular
   bone score (TBS) has been proposed to predict fracture risk independent
   of BMD. Evaluation of TBS and spine BMD in relation bone stress injury
   (BSI) risk has not been studied in female collegiate athletes.
   Objective We hypothesized that spine BMD and TBS would each
   independently predict BSI and that the combined measures would improve
   injury prediction in female collegiate athletes. We also hypothesized
   that each measure would be correlated with Triad risk factors.
   Design: Retrospective cohort.
   Setting: Academic Institution.
   Methods Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the lumbar spine was
   used to calculate BMD and TBS values. Chart review was used to identify
   BSI that occurred after the DXA measurement and to obtain Triad risk
   factors. We used logistic regression to examine the ability of TBS and
   BMD alone or in combination to predict prospective BSI.
   Results Within 321 athletes, 29 (9.0\%) sustained a BSI after DXA. BMD
   and TBS were highly correlated (Pearson correlation r = 0.62, P <
   .0001). Spine BMD and TBS had similar ability to predict BSI; the
   C-statistic and 95\% confidence intervals were 0.69 (0.58 to 0.81) for
   spine BMD versus 0.68 (0.57 to 0.79) for TBS. No improvement in
   discrimination was observed with combined BMD + TBS (C-statistic 0.70,
   0.59 to 0.81). Both TBS and BMD predicted trabecular-rich BSI (defined
   as pelvis, femoral neck, and calcaneus) better than cortical-rich BSI.
   Both measures had similar correlations with Triad risk factors.
   Conclusion Lower BMD and TBS values are associated with elevated risk
   for BSI and similar correlation to Triad risk factors. TBS does not
   improve prediction of BSI. Collectively, our findings suggest that BMD
   may be a sufficient measure of skeletal integrity from DXA in female
   collegiate athletes.}},

Title = {{Navigated laparoscopic microwave ablation of tumour mimics in pig
   livers: a randomized ex-vivo experimental trial}},
Journal = {{SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES}},
Abstract = {{Background In order to efficiently perform laparoscopic microwave
   ablation of liver tumours precise positioning of the ablation probe is
   mandatory. This study evaluates the precision and ablation accuracy
   using the innovative laparoscopic stereotactic navigation system
   CAS-One-SPOT in comparison to 2d ultrasound guided laparoscopic ablation
   procedures. Methods In a pig liver ablation model four surgeons,
   experienced (n = 2) and inexperienced (n = 2) in laparoscopic ablation
   procedures, were randomized for 2d ultrasound guided laparoscopic or
   stereotactic navigated laparoscopic ablation procedures. Each surgeon
   performed a total of 20 ablations. Total attempts of needle placements,
   time from tumor localization till beginning of ablation and ablation
   accuracy were analyzed. Results The use of the laparoscopic stereotactic
   navigation system led to a significant reduction in total attempts of
   needle placement. The experienced group of surgeons reduced the mean
   number of attempts from 2.75 +/- 2.291 in the 2d ultrasound guided
   ablation group to 1.45 +/- 1.191 (p = 0.0302) attempts in the
   stereotactic navigation group. Comparable results could be observed in
   the inexperienced group with a reduction of 2.5 +/- 1.50 to 1.15 +/-
   0.489 (p = 0.0005). This was accompanied by a significant time saving
   from 101.3 +/- 112.1 s to 48.75 +/- 27.76 s (p = 0.0491) in the
   experienced and 165.5 +/- 98.9 s to 66.75 +/- 21.96 s (p < 0.0001) in
   the inexperienced surgeon group. The accuracy of the ablation process
   was hereby not impaired as postinterventional sectioning of the ablation
   zone revealed. Conclusion The use of a stereotactic navigation system
   for laparoscopic microwave ablation procedures of liver tumors
   significantly reduces the attempts and time of predicted correct needle
   placement for novices and experienced surgeons without impairing the
   accuracy of the ablation procedure.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundIn the setting of congenital C1 occipitalization and C2-3
   fusion, significant strain is placed on the atlantoaxial joint.
   Vertebral fusion both above and below the atlantoaxial joint (i.e., a
   ``sandwich{''}) creates substantial instability. We retrospectively
   report on a case series of ``sandwich fusion{''} atlantoaxial
   dislocation (AAD), describing the associated clinical characteristics
   and detailing surgical treatment. To the best of our knowledge, the
   present study is the largest investigation to date of this congenital
   subgroup of AAD.MethodsSeventy consecutive patients with sandwich fusion
   AAD, from one senior surgeon, were retrospectively reviewed. The
   clinical features and the surgical treatment results were assessed using
   descriptive statistics. No funding sources or potential conflict of
   interest-associated biases exist.ResultsThe mean patient age was
   42.2years (range: 5-77years); 36 patients were male, and 34 were female.
   Fifty-eight patients (82.9\%) had myelopathy, with Japanese Orthopaedic
   Association (JOA) scores ranging 4-16 (mean: 12.9). Cranial neuropathy
   was involved in 10 cases (14.3\%). The most common presentation age
   group was 31 to 40years (24 cases, 34.3\%). Radiological findings
   revealed brainstem and/or cervical-medullar compression (58 cases,
   82.9\%), syringomyelia (16 cases, 22.9\%), Chiari malformation (12
   cases, 17.1\%), cervical spinal stenosis (10 cases, 14.3\%), high
   scapula deformity (1 case, 1.4\%), os odontoideum (1 case, 1.4\%), and
   dysplasia of the atlas (1 case, 1.4\%). Computed tomography angiography
   was performed in 27 cases, and vertebral artery (VA) anomalies were
   identified in 14 cases (51.9\%). All 70 patients underwent surgical
   treatment, without spinal cord or VA injury. Four patients (5.7\%)
   suffered complications, including 1 wound infection, 1 screw loosening,
   and 2 cases of bulbar paralysis. In the 58 patients with myelopathy, the
   mean JOA score increased from 12.9 to 14.5. The average follow-up time
   was 50.5months (range: 24-120months). All 70 cases achieved solid
   atlantoaxial fusion at the final follow-up.ConclusionsSandwich fusion
   AAD, a unique subgroup of AAD, has distinctive clinical features and
   associated malformations such as cervical-medullar compression,
   syringomyelia, and VA anomalies. Surgical treatment of AAD was
   associated with myelopathy improvement and minimal complication
   occurrence.}},

Title = {{Bootstrap embedding with an unrestricted mean-field bath}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{153}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{A suite of quantum embedding methods have recently been developed where
   the Schmidt decomposition is applied to the full system wavefunction to
   derive basis states that preserve the entanglement between the fragment
   and the bath. The quality of these methods can depend heavily on the
   quality of the initial full system wavefunction. Most of these methods,
   including bootstrap embedding (BE) {[}M. Welborn et al; J. Chem. Phys.
   145, 074102 (2016)], start from a spin-restricted mean-field
   wavefunction {[}call this restricted BE (RBE)]. Given that
   spin-unrestricted wavefunctions can capture a significant amount of
   strong correlation at the mean-field level, we suspect that starting
   from a spin-unrestricted mean-field wavefunction will improve these
   embedding methods for strongly correlated systems. In this work, BE is
   generalized to an unrestricted Hartree-Fock bath {[}call this
   unrestricted BE (UBE)], and UBE is applied to model hydrogen ring
   systems. UBE's improved versatility over RBE is utilized to calculate
   high spin symmetry states that were previously unattainable with RBE.
   Ionization potentials, electron affinities, and spin-splittings are
   computed using UBE with accuracy on par with spin-unrestricted coupled
   cluster singles and doubles. Even for cases where RBE is viable, UBE
   converges more reliably. We discuss the limitations or weaknesses of
   each calculation and how improvements to RBE and density matrix
   embedding theory these past few years can also improve UBE.}},

   hydrogen was located in place of the nitro group, by considering K-i
   values against hCA II. Compounds 3c and 4c, where the sulfanilamide
   moiety is available, were the leads in terms of AChE inhibition with the
   lowest K-i values. The use of secondary sulfonamides was a more
   effective modification on CA inhibition, whereas the primary sulfonamide

Abstract = {{The human medial temporal lobe (MTL) has been suggested to play a role
   in valuation. However, little is known about its role in binary
   decisions and metacognition. We performed two decision-making tasks
   while recording from neurons in the human MTL. During a break, subjects
   consumed their preferred food item to satiation and subsequently
   repeated both tasks. We identified both a persistent and a transient
   modulation of the neural activity. Two independent subpopulations of
   neurons showed a persistent correlation of their firing rates with
   either decision confidence or reaction times. Importantly, the changes
   in confidence and reaction time between experimental sets were
   accompanied by a correlated change in the neural activity, and this
   correlation lasted as long as it was relevant for the behavioral task.
   Previous studies have suggested a transient modulation of the neural
   activity in the human MTL correlated with subjective value. However, in
   our study, neither subjective value nor unsigned value could explain
   this transient activity better than the nutritional features of the
   stimuli, calling into question the role of the human MTL in valuation.}},

Abstract = {{Targeting cell cycle and inducing DNA damage by activating cell death
   pathways are considered as effective therapeutic strategy for combating
   breast cancer progression. Many of the naturally known small molecules
   target these signaling pathways and are effective against resistant
   and/or aggressive types of breast cancers. Here, we investigated the
   effect of catechol, a naturally occurring plant compound, for its
   specificity and chemotherapeutic efficacies in breast cancer (MCF-7 and
   MDA-MB-231) cells. Catechol treatment showed concentration-dependent
   cytotoxicity and antiproliferative growth in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
   cells while sparing minimal effects on noncancerous (F-180 and HK2)
   cells. Catechol modulated differential DNA damage effects by activating
   ATM/ATR pathways and showed enhanced gamma-H2AX expression, as an
   indicator for DNA double-stranded breaks. MCF-7 cells showed G1 cell
   cycle arrest by regulating p21-mediated cyclin E/Cdk2 inhibition.
   Furthermore, activation of p53 triggered a caspase-mediated cell death
   mechanism by inhibiting regulatory proteins such as DNMT1, p-BRCA1,
   MCL-1, and PDCD6 with an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Overall, our results
   showed that catechol possesses favorable safety profile for noncancerous
   cells while specifically targeting multiple signaling cascades to
   inhibit proliferation in breast cancer cells.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a scheme of high-speed physical key distribution based on
   dispersion-shift-keying chaos synchronization in two semiconductor
   lasers without external feedback (response lasers), which are driven by
   a common external-cavity semiconductor laser (drive laser). In this
   scheme, the dispersion introduces a laser field beating-induced
   nonlinear transformation to the outputs of drive laser and renders the
   correlation elimination between the drive and response lasers improving
   the security of key distribution. Moreover, the commonly driven lasers
   without external feedback constitute an open-loop synchronization
   configuration and yield a short synchronization recovery time of a
   subnanosecond supporting the implementation of high-speed key
   distribution. With these two merits, we numerically demonstrate a 1.2
   Gb/s secure key distribution with a bit error ratio below 3.8x10(-3).

Abstract = {{Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) can detect the presence of cytoplasmic
   DNA and activate the innate immune system via the cGAS-STING pathway.
   Although several structures of cGAS-DNA complexes were resolved
   recently, the molecular mechanism of cGAS in its recognition of DNA has
   not yet been fully understood. In order to reveal the subtle differences
   between human and mouse cGAS in terms of their DNA-binding mechanisms,
   four systems, both human and mouse cGAS in complex with two different
   DNA sequences of equal length, were studied by molecular dynamics
   simulations and molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area
   analysis. Several residues, including ARG176/ARG161, ARG195/ARG180,
   ASN210/ASN196, LYS384/LYS372, CYM397/CYM385, LYS403/LYS391,
   LYS407/LYS395, and LYS411/LYS399, were identified to be the common key
   residues in the recognition of DNA for cGAS in both humans and mice. In
   addition, four residue pairs LYS173/ARG158, ASP177/LYS162,
   CYS199/LYS184, and GLU398/SER387 were suggested to be the major residues
   that make human cGAS and mouse cGAS different in terms of their binding
   to DNA. Besides the well-known zinc-thumb domain, two residues at the
   kink of the spine helix were also proposed for the first time to be the
   major binding motifs in cGAS-DNA interaction.}},

Abstract = {{The solvent effect usually plays an important role in triplet-triplet
   annihilation (TTA) upconversion processes. In this work, we have studied
   the TTA upconversion kinetics of perylene with Bodipy-phenyl-C-60 as the
   triplet photosensitizer in five solvents, 1,4-dioxane, dichlorobenzene,
   chlorobenzene, toluene, and tetrahydrofuran (THF). Although no
   significant solvent effect was observed in steady-state absorption and
   fluorescence emission spectra, the overall TTA upconversion quantum
   yields showed a profound dependence on solvent properties, i.e. 4.9\% in
   1,4-dioxane, 7.1\% in dichlorobenzene, 6.7\% in chlorobenzene, 4.6\% in
   toluene, and 2.2\% in THF (the maximum of 50\%). Each elementary
   reaction step involved in the overall process was analyzed by applying
   femtosecond and nanosecond time-resolved transient absorption
   spectroscopy, revealing that the fluorescence emission of perylene was
   more significantly affected by the solvents in contrast to the other
   steps. Moreover, an extra intramolecular energy-transfer pathway of
   Bodipy-phenyl-C-60 was found via the formation of charge-separated
   states in dichlorobenzene, chlorobenzene, and THF solvents, once being
   excited. These conclusions provide valuable clues to choose the most
   favorable solvent for the higher TTA upconversion efficiency in related
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{The human face is complex and multipartite, and characterization of its
   genetic architecture remains challenging. Using a multivariate
   genome-wide association study meta-analysis of 8,246 European
   individuals, we identified 203 genome-wide-significant signals (120 also
   study-wide significant) associated with normal-range facial variation.
   Follow-up analyses indicate that the regions surrounding these signals
   are enriched for enhancer activity in cranial neural crest cells and
   craniofacial tissues, several regions harbor multiple signals with
   associations to different facial phenotypes, and there is evidence for
   potential coordinated actions of variants. In summary, our analyses
   provide insights into the understanding of how complex morphological
   traits are shaped by both individual and coordinated genetic actions.
   A multivariate genome-wide association study identifies 203 signals

Title = {{The Suppression of miR-199a-3p by Promoter Methylation Contributes to
   Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma Aggressiveness by Targeting RAP2a and DNMT3a}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Background It was previously demonstrated that miR-199a-3p plays an
   important role in tumor progression; especially, its down-regulation in
   papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is associated with cancer cell invasion
   and proliferation. In the present report, we investigated the mechanism
   involved in the down-regulation of miR-199a-3p in PTC and how
   miR-199a-3p regulates PTC invasion both in vivo and in vitro. Methods
   qRT-PCR and Western blot assays were used to determine the expression of
   the investigated genes. Bisulfite sequencing PCR was used to investigate
   miR-199a-3p methylation. The functions of miR-199a-3p were investigated
   by a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. Results Our results
   showed hypermethylation of the miR-199a-3p promoter, which resulted in
   decreased miR-199a-3p expression both in PTC cell lines and PTC tissues.
   DNA-methyltransferase 3a (DNMT3a), a target gene of miR-199a-3p, was
   increased both in PTC cell lines and PTC tissues, while 5-aza-2
   `-deoxycytidine (methyltransferase-specific inhibitor) or knock-down
   using DNMT3a Small-Interfering RNA could restore the expression of
   miR-199a-3p, and the over-expression of miR-199a-3p could decrease the
   expression of DNMT3a; this suggests that miR-199a-3p/DNMT3a constructs a
   regulatory circuit in regulating miR-199a-3p/DNMT3a expression.
   Moreover, gain- and loss-of-function studies revealed that miR-199a-3p
   is involved in cancer cell migration, invasion, and growth. Meanwhile,
   we found that RAP2a was also a direct target of miR-199a-3p, which might
   mediate the tumor-growth-inhibiting effect of miR-199a-3p. To further
   confirm the tumor-suppressive properties of miR-199a-3p, stable
   overexpression of miR-199a-3p in a PTC cell line (BCPAP cells) was
   xenografted to athymic BALB/c nude mice, resulting in delayed tumor
   growth in vivo. In clinical PTC samples, the expression of RAP2a and
   DNMT3a was increased significantly, and the expression of RAP2a was
   inversely correlated with that of miR-199a-3p. Conclusion Our studies
   demonstrate that an epigenetic change in the promoter region of miR-199a
   contributes to the aggressive behavior of PTC via the miR-199a-3p/DNMT3a
   regulatory circuit and directly targets RAP2a.}},

   Intracerebral Hemorrhage via the PERK Pathway}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{PERK signaling pathway plays an important role in neuronal apoptosis
   after Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). ICH can cause the release of blood
   components into the brain. However, which component in the blood plays a
   major role still unclear. This study was designed to investigate the
   activation of the PERK pathway in different blood components after ICH
   and explore which components have major relationships with neuronal
   apoptosis. Eighty-five Sprague-Dawley rats were used to establish an ICH
   model. Western blot (WB) and immunofluorescence (IF) were used to
   evaluate the expression of the PERK pathway. TUNEL staining, FJC
   staining and neurological score were used to evaluate neuronal apoptosis
   and necrosis after ICH. The results showed that protein levels of p-PERK
   and p-eIF2 alpha were upregulated following ICH with the injection of
   Fe3+ and Fe2+ after 48 h. Then, deferoxamine (DFX) was used to study the
   roles of Fe3+ in ICH through the PERK signaling pathway. The results
   showed that injection of DFX reversed increasing protein levels and
   prevented neuronal apoptosis. Thus, iron plays an important role in ICH
   through the PERK signaling pathway. Furthermore, the reduction of iron
   demonstrates neuroprotective effects in ICH. This suggests that
   targeting intervention of the iron and PERK pathway could be an
   effective treatment strategy to improve ICH prognosis.}},

Abstract = {{Redox-active conjugated polymers have drawn much attention as electrodes
   for batteries. Among them, branched conjugated polymers (BCPs) are
   supposed to have advantages over linear conjugated polymers (LCPs),
   because the branched structure should benefit electrolyte infiltration
   and ionic transport and thus would contribute to high rate capability.
   However, the direct comparison of BCPs with LCPs as electrodes for
   batteries is rarely reported because it is difficult to synthesize an
   LCP and a BCP with a similar chemical environment. Herein, we design and
   synthesize two aza-fused conjugated polymers as anodes for sodium-ion
   batteries (SIBs), including an LCP and a BCP with similar constructing
   units. Both of them displayed outstanding Na-storage performance at a
   slow rate. Particularly, the BCP anode exhibited extraordinary rate
   capability, which was much higher than that of the LCP anode. The rate
   performance of the BCP anode even outperformed most organic polymeric
   anodes for SIBs. This work provides insight into branched conjugated
   polymers and inspires the molecular design of novel polymers for SIBs.}},

Abstract = {{Lead-free perovskites and their analogues have been extensively studied
   as a class of next-generation luminescent and optoelectronic materials.
   Herein, we report the synthesis of new colloidal Cs4M(ii)Bi2Cl12 (M(ii)
   = Cd, Mn) nanocrystals (NCs) with unique luminescence properties. The
   obtained Cs4M(ii)Bi2Cl12 NCs show a layered double perovskite (LDP)
   crystal structure with good particle stability. Density functional
   theory calculations show that both samples exhibit a wide, direct
   bandgap feature. Remarkably, the strong Mn-Mn coupling effect of the
   Cs4M(ii)Bi2Cl12 NCs results in an ultra-short Mn photoluminescence (PL)
   decay lifetime of around 10 mu s, around two orders of magnitude faster
   than commonly observed Mn2+ dopant emission in NCs. Diluting the Mn2+
   ion concentration through forming Cs-4(Cd1-xMnx)Bi2Cl12 (0 < x < 1)
   alloyed LDP NCs leads to prolonged PL lifetimes and enhanced PL quantum
   yields. Our study provides the first synthetic example of Bi-based LDP
   colloidal NCs with potential for serving as a new category of stable
   lead-free perovskite-type materials for various applications.}},

Abstract = {{While there has been rapid progress made in the performance of organic
   photovoltaic (OPV) cells in recent years, the device stability remains a
   major bottleneck for commercialization. In this work, we blended a
   stable acceptor (O-IDTBR) with two photostable donors (PTB7-Th and
   PffBT4T-2OD) having different polymer crystallinity, and the resulting
   devices show a significant difference in the OPV degradation rate. The
   OPV devices employing a highly crystalline polymer PffBT4T-2OD as an
   active layer show a good resistance against light soaking, maintaining
   80\% of the initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 100 hours,
   while the devices employing an amorphous polymer PTB7-Th as an active
   layer show a significant PCE loss in the initial 20 hours mainly due to
   a rapid loss of the fill factor. By carrying out a comprehensive
   analysis of the device degradation mechanisms, we conclude that the
   origin for the PTB7-Th:O-IDTBR device degradation is the formation of
   mid-gap states under continuous sunlight illumination, leading to a
   significant drop in electron mobility. Device simulation revealed that
   deep traps act as charge recombination centers and increase the
   trap-assisted recombination rate, lowering the FF and J(sc).}},

Title = {{Tailoring non-fullerene acceptors using selenium-incorporated

Abstract = {{Small molecular acceptors (SMAs) have gained extensive research
   attention as they offer many attractive features and enable highly
   efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) that cannot be achieved using
   fullerene acceptors. Recently, a new SMA named Y6 was reported, yielding
   high-performance OSCs with an efficiency of 15.7\%. This report has
   inspired the OSC community to study the structure-property relationship
   and further modify this important class of materials. In this work, we
   used the selenium (Se) substitution strategy and developed two new
   Y6-type SMAs to study the effect of Se atoms on materials properties and
   device performances. It is found that the introduction of Se atoms can
   red-shift the absorption spectra and enhance the aggregation of the
   resulting SMAs. Interestingly, the variations in the substitution
   positions of Se atoms induce different intramolecular charge transfer
   within the SMAs. Se substitution at the benzothiadiazole ring is more
   effective than that at the thienothiophene rings, leading to the
   increased short-circuit current density (J(SC)) and higher efficiencies
   of over 16\%. This contribution suggests that appropriate Se
   substitution is a promising method for optimizing the absorption and
   aggregation of Y6-type SMAs, thus enhancing their OSC performances.}},

Abstract = {{Externally triggered thermogenic nanoparticles (NPs) are potential drug
   carriers and heating agents for drug delivery and hyperthermia. A good
   understanding of the transport and adhesion behaviors of NPs in
   microvessels is conducive to improving the efficiency of NP-mediated
   treatment. Given the thermogenesis of NPs and interactions of NP-blood
   flow, NP-NP, NP-red blood cell (RBC) and ligand-receptor, the movement
   of NPs in blood flow was modeled using a hybrid immersed boundary and
   coupled double-distribution-function lattice Boltzmann method. Results
   show that the margination probability of NPs toward the vessel wall was
   evidently increased by NP thermogenesis owing to the noticeable
   variation in blood flow velocity distribution, thereby enhancing their
   adhesion to the target region. NP-RBC collision can promote NP movement
   to the acellular layer in microvessels to increase the NP adhesion rate.
   The number of adhered smaller NPs was larger than that of the larger NPs
   having the same ligand density due to the enhancement of Brownian force
   although their adhesion was relatively less firm. Compared with the NPs
   with a regular shape, the irregularly shaped NPs can adhere to the
   vessel wall more readily and strongly as a result of the higher
   turbulence levels caused by NP-blood flow interaction and relatively
   higher ligand density, which led to a higher rate of NP adhesion.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic signaling between the endocrine system (ES) and the nervous
   system (NS) is essential for brain and body homeostasis. In particular,
   reciprocal interaction occurs during pregnancy and motherhood that may
   involve changes in some brain plasticity processes. Prolactin (PRL), a
   hormone with pleiotropic effects on the NS, promotes maternal behavior
   and has been linked to modifications in brain circuits during
   motherhood; however, it is unclear whether PRL may regulate synaptic
   plasticity. Therefore, the main aim of the present work was to determine
   the cellular and molecular mechanisms triggered by PRL that regulate
   synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. By analyzing extracellular
   recordings in CA3-CA1 synapses of hippocampal slices, we report that PRL
   modifies short and long-term synaptic plasticity in female mice of
   reproductive age, but not in sexually immature females or adult males.
   This effect is carried out through mechanisms that include participation
   of GABA(A) receptors and activation of the JAK2-mediated signaling
   pathway. These findings show for the first time how PRL enhances the
   synaptic strength in hippocampal circuits and that this effect is
   sexually dimorphic, which would influence complex brain processes in
   physiological conditions like pregnancy and lactation.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of different heat treatment processes on the microstructure

   studied by means of microanalysis, weight loss test and electrochemical
   test. The results show that appropriate heat treatment can improve the
   corrosion resistance of the alloy. Among the tested alloys, the T6-12 h
   alloy has the best corrosion resistance, which is mainly attributed to
   the morphology and distribution of the Mg-RE phase. The corrosion rate
   of the T4 alloy is similar to that of the T6-12 h alloy. The corrosion
   resistance of the T4 alloy may be reduced under long-term corrosion due
   to the existence of surface corrosion microcracks.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this work is to analyse the influence of heat
   treatment with polydimethylsiloxane on integrated performance of bamboo
   timber. Bamboo timber was heat treated using polydimethylsiloxane as a
   medium at 120, 150, 180 and 210 degrees C for 3 h in this study. Results
   revealed that the equilibrium moisture content (EMC) and linear swelling
   ratio of heat-treated bamboo specimens was remarkable decreased with
   increasing heat treatment temperature. The surface contact angle of
   water on the bamboo specimens was observed to increase with the
   increasing heat treatment temperature, indicating the reduction of
   wettability with water. Additionally, the modulus of rupture (MOR) and
   modulus of elasticity (MOE) was decreased with the increasing heat
   treatment temperature and lower than that of untreated specimens.
   Cellulose crystallinity of bamboo specimens was slightly decreased with
   the increase of heat treatment temperature. TG-DTG results illustrated a
   reduction in relative content of hemicellulose, and increase in relative
   content of lignin and cellulose of bamboo specimens with the increase of
   heat treatment temperature. Presence of the stretching vibration Si-C in
   Si-CH3 indicated the bonding of siloxane to bamboo timber by forming
   covalent bonds. The colour of the heat-treated bamboo timber was even
   deepened after heat treatment, endowing the bamboo timber with better
   surface decoration performance.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. We aim to analyze the diagnostic yield, diagnostic accuracy,
   and delayed diagnosis of patients with terminal ileum lesions, providing
   follow-up suggestions for suspected patients. Methods. We carried out an
   analysis of 1099 patients who had terminal ileum lesions in our hospital
   from 2009 to 2019. The endoscopy reports and histopathology reports of
   terminal ileal biopsies were recorded. Clinical diagnosis and management
   were reviewed to determine whether there was a need to correct after a
   follow-up endoscopy result. Results. A total of 1099 patients were found
   to have terminal ileum lesions, among which 959 in 1099 patients
   (87.26\%) were diagnosed as benign, 17 in 1099 patients (1.55\%) were
   diagnosed as malignant, and 123 in 1099 patients (11.19\%) were
   diagnosed as suspected. The diagnostic accuracies of terminal ileal
   polyp, cyst, cancer, eosinophilic enteritis, parasite, lymphofollicular
   hyperplasia, and amyloidosis were 100\%. The diagnosis was delayed in
   9.93\% of Crohn's disease (CD) and 12.5\% of lymphoma. Among the
   definite cases, the diagnosis was corrected during the follow-up in
   12.5\% of the patients, while the clinical treatment was corrected
   during the follow-up in 17.86\% of the patients. Among the suspected
   cases, the diagnosis and treatment was corrected in 61.11\% of the
   patients during the follow-up. Conclusion. Coincident diagnosis of
   ileitis and ileum ulcer is low. Delayed diagnosis of Crohn's disease and
   lymphoma were observed in a certain proportion of patients with terminal
   ileum lesions. A follow-up endoscopy was strongly recommended for these
   suspected patients with terminal ileum lesions.}},

Abstract = {{Background Proteomic characterization of cancers is essential for a
   comprehensive understanding of key molecular aberrations. However,
   proteomic profiling of a large cohort of cancer tissues is often limited
   by the conventional approaches. Methods We present a proteomic landscape
   of 16 major types of human cancer, based on the analysis of 126
   treatment-naive primary tumor tissues, 94 tumor-matched normal adjacent
   tissues, and 12 normal tissues, using mass spectrometry-based
   data-independent acquisition approach. Results In our study, a total of
   8527 proteins were mapped to brain, head and neck, breast, lung (both
   small cell and non-small cell lung cancers), esophagus, stomach,
   pancreas, liver, colon, kidney, bladder, prostate, uterus and ovary
   cancers, including 2458 tissue-enriched proteins. Our DIA-based
   proteomic approach has characterized major human cancers and identified
   universally expressed proteins as well as tissue-type-specific and
   cancer-type-specific proteins. In addition, 1139 therapeutic targetable
   proteins and 21 cancer/testis (CT) antigens were observed. Conclusions
   Our discoveries not only advance our understanding of human cancers, but
   also have implications for the design of future large-scale cancer
   proteomic studies to assist the development of diagnostic and/or
   therapeutic targets in multiple cancers.}},

Title = {{Clinical Prediction of Coronavirus Disease-20 How Accurate Can One Be?}},
Journal = {{CUREUS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 6}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Some models based on clinical information have been reported to predict
   which patients have Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia but
   have failed so far to yield reliable results. We aimed to determine if
   physicians were able to accurately predict which patients, as described
   in clinical vignettes, had, or did not have this infection using their
   clinical acumen and epidemiological data.
   Methods
   Of 1177 patients under investigation for COVID-19 admitted, we selected
   20 and presented them in a vignette form. We surveyed physicians from
   different levels of training (<5, and five or more years after
   graduation from medical school) and included non-medical participants as
   a control group. We asked all participants to predict the result of the
   PCR test for COVID-19. We measured the accuracy of responses as a whole,
   and at three stages of the pandemic associated with a growing incidence
   of COVID-19 in the community. We calculated the inter-rater reliability,
   sensitivity, and specificity of the clinical prediction as a whole and
   by pandemic stage.
   Results
   Between June 8 and August 28, 2020, 82 doctors and 20 non-medical
   participants completed the survey. The accuracy was 58\% (59\% for
   doctors and 52\% for non-medical, p=0.002). The lowest accuracy was
   noted for cases in the pandemic middle stage; years of post-graduate
   training represented no difference. Of the 2040 total answers, 1176 were
   accurate and 864 inaccurate (349 false positives and 515 false
   negatives).
   Conclusion
   The influence of symptomatic positivity, confirmation bias, and rapid
   expertise acquisition on accuracy is discussed, as the disease is new,
   time after graduation made no difference in the response accuracy. The
   limited clinical diagnostic capacity emphasizes the need for a reliable
   diagnostic test.}},

Abstract = {{Bi-metallic and tri-metallic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) supported
   on the magnetic activated carbon (MAC) were synthesized for the
   reduction of methylene blue (MB) concentration in the aqueous solutions.
   The adsorbent nanocomposites were characterized by applying the general
   tests including XRD, FTIR, FESEM, TEM, BET, and VSM. The XRD
   achievements demonstrated that crystalline structure of MOFs was derived
   on the MAC by the presented method. The core-shell morphology with
   nano-scale size of the magnetic carbonaceous MOFs was detected in TEM
   and FESEM micro-images. The acceptable magnetic strength of the prepared
   adsorbents was proved by using the VSM analysis. The important operating
   conditions including pH and temperature were also evaluated, while the
   other parameters were kept constant. The pseudo-second-order kinetic
   model was matched with the experimental data to show the kinetic
   behavior of the multi-component MOFs. The isotherm studies showed that
   the good agreement between the experimental data with both Langmuir
   model and the maximum capacities was calculated to be about 66.51 and
   71.43 mg/g for the bi-metallic and tri-metallic nanocomposites,
   respectively. Regeneration experiments indicated that the fabricated
   adsorbents have an excellent reusing adsorption capacity which can be a
   proper selection for the industrial applications.
   Practitioner points
   Bi-metallic and tri-metallic MOFs supported on the magnetic activated
   carbon were synthesized by the facile preparation method.
   Adsorption of methylene blue by using MOFs were successfully done.
   Nanocomposites were evaluated by XRD, FTIR, BET, FESEM, TEM, and VSM
   techniques.
   Maximum of adsorption capacity was observed for tri-metallic MOF as
   71.43 mg/g.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the impact of combining physical and mental load on
   the anticipatory judgements of skilled soccer players. Sixteen players
   completed an 11vs11 video anticipation test in four counterbalanced
   conditions, each separated by 7 days. The baseline condition consisted
   of only the anticipation test. A physical load condition required
   participants to complete a simulated soccer protocol on a treadmill
   followed by the anticipation test. A mental load condition required
   participants to complete a 30-min Stroop test followed by the
   anticipation test. Finally, in the combined load condition, participants
   completed the physical load protocol alongside the mentally loading
   Stroop task followed by the anticipation test. Response accuracy, visual
   search behaviour and measures of effort were assessed throughout.
   Response accuracy decreased in the separate physical load and mental
   load conditions when compared to baseline and worsened further in the
   combined load condition. The reduction in response accuracy across
   experimental conditions coincided with an increase in the number of
   fixations when compared to the baseline condition. It is suggested that
   the separate sources of load impaired the players ability to allocate
   sufficient resources to task-relevant information leading to a reduction
   in anticipatory accuracy, and this was exacerbated in the combined load
   condition.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background Early vascular complications following pancreatic
   transplantation are not uncommon (3\%-8\%). Typically, cross-sectional
   imaging is requested in response to clinical change. We instituted a
   change in protocol to request imaging pre-emptively to identify patients
   with thrombotic complications.
   Methods In 2013, protocol computer tomography angiography (CTA) at days
   3-5 and day 10 following pancreas transplantation was introduced. A
   retrospective analysis of all pancreas transplants performed at our
   institution from January 2001 to May 2019 was undertaken.
   Results A total of 115 patients received pancreas transplants during
   this time period. A total of 78 received pancreas transplant without
   routine CTA and 37 patients with the new protocol. Following the change
   in protocol, we detected a high number of subclinical thromboses
   (41.7\%). There was a significant decrease in invasive intervention for
   thrombosis (78.6\% before vs 30.8\% after, p = .02), and graft survival
   was significantly higher (61.5\% before vs 86.1\% after, p = .04). There
   was also a significant reduction in the number of graft failures
   (all-cause) where thrombosis was present (23.4\% before vs 5.6\% after,
   p = .02). Patient survival was unaffected (p = .48).
   Conclusions Implementation of early protocol CTA identifies a large
   number of patients with subclinical graft thromboses that are more
   amenable to conservative management and significantly reduces the
   requirement for invasive intervention.}},

Abstract = {{Secure children's homes are used to accommodate children aged 10-16
   under two main categories; while half are sentenced after committing a
   serious offence, the other half are placed because there are serious
   concerns around their safety in the community. Secure children's homes
   are prized within the secure estate, and they administer complex
   therapeutic support to `the most vulnerable' young people, however
   little is known about the experiences of those employed to work in such
   spaces. This paper shares findings from PhD research conducted in one
   secure children's home over 1 year. Data presented are drawn from
   sensitive ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth interviews with
   residential staff and residents in the home. Although young people's
   views are important, we concentrate here on the perspectives of
   residential staff to share their reflections of delivering `care' and
   the strategies used to manage successful relationships within a secure
   setting. We conclude that residential staff tread a fine line between
   creating emotional closeness while maintaining physical distance and
   that they are sometimes unable to return the intensity of feeling that
   residents' direct towards them. We recommend that all residential staff
   receive regular and detailed supervision to provide opportunity to
   request support when necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Fiber optic gyroscope (FOG) is a new type of optical sensor used to
   measure the rotating angular velocity. As the core component, fiber
   optic coil (FOC) plays a decisive role in the FOG output precision. The
   manufacturing level and efficiency of FOC have been main factors
   restricting the application and development of high precision FOG.
   Precision mechanical positioning method based on the photoelectric
   devices was researched, and high-performance fully automatic micro
   mechanical error compensation technique was developed. On these basis.
   automatic fiber distribution and winding control technology were
   realized. Eventually a multifunctional system was developed with fiber
   splitting module, fiber winding module, and calibration module. This
   system could accomplish automatic preparation of FOC with quadrupolar
   symmetric pattern according to the parameters set by user. The principle
   and working flow of each functional module are discussed in details.
   Experiments show that the system can achieve automatic speed changing,
   automatic reversing, constant small tension control and precise fiber
   arrangement. The new designed system greatly improve FOC production
   efficiency and is conductive to promoting high level FOG development.}},

Title = {{Thermodynamic interpretation of the drift and noise of gradient
   baselines in reversed-phase liquid chromatography using mobile phase
   additives}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{1633}},
Month = {{DEC 6}},
Abstract = {{The drift and noise of acetonitrile-water gradient baselines (5-95\%,
   v/v, 5 min linear gradient) in reversed phase liquid chromatography
   (RPLC) are recorded at a wavelength of 215 nm using 0.1\%
   trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as the mobile phase additive, a 4.6 mm x 150
   mm 5 mu m Symmetry-C 18 RPLC column, and an Arc system (low-pressure
   gradient proportioning valve or GPV, pump with a stroke volume of either
   66 or 132 mu L, no mixer) as the LC instrument. These observations are
   predicted from solid-liquid adsorp-tion thermodynamics which requires
   the measurement of the excess adsorption isotherm of acetonitrile from
   water onto the RPLC column and of the variation of the Henry's constant
   of TFA as a function of the volume fraction of acetonitrile in the bulk
   mobile phase. The incomplete mixing of the acetonitrile and water
   packets delivered by the low-pressure GPV is represented by a sinusoidal
   perturbation of the programmed volume fraction of acetonitrile during
   the entire gradient. The variation of the TFA absorbance at 215 nm with
   increasing acetonitrile concentration is measured in order to transform
   TFA concentration into the observable absorbance unit. The drift and
   noise of the gradient baseline are calculated by solving numerically
   (Rouchon method) the equilibrium-dispersive (ED) mass balance equations
   of acetonitrile and TFA
   The agreement between the calculated and observed gradient baselines is
   very good as the proposed model of chromatography accurately accounts
   for the displacement of TFA between stationary and mobile phases (early
   excess and late deficit of TFA concentration relative to 0.1\%) and for
   the frequency (equal to the ratio of the applied flow rate to the stroke
   volume) and the amplitude of the periodic noise recorded during the
   gradient. From a practical viewpoint, the drift of the gradient baseline
   can be minimized by maximizing the ratio of the gradient volume to the
   hold-up volume (10) and/or by minimizing the retention factor of the
   mobile phase additive in the water-rich eluent (k < 0.2). The reduction
   of the noise amplitude below 0.1 mAU as requested by the pharmaceutical
   industry imposes the ratio of the flow rate to the stroke volume of the
   pump to be larger than 1 Hz. This opens avenues towards the development
   of new GPV, pump, and mixers in order to mix efficiently the solvent
   packets delivered by conventional LC instrument. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Onset and progression of the berry shrivel ripening disorder in grapes}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF GRAPE AND WINE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{280-289}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims The grape ripening disorder called berry shrivel is
   characterised by cessation of sugar accumulation, low pH, impaired
   anthocyanin biosynthesis in dark-skinned cultivars and water loss. We
   tested whether damage to the bunch peduncle vasculature can induce berry
   shrivel and whether cell death in the rachis precedes cell death in the
   berries.
   Methods and Results Peduncle phloem removal, but not xylem removal,
   resulted in symptoms resembling berry shrivel. Fluorescein diacetate
   staining, however, and microscopic observations of non-manipulated
   bunches showed that cell death in the berries often preceded that in the
   rachis. Mesocarp cell death started around the central vasculature
   proximal to the seeds and spread outward as symptoms worsened. Berries
   near the bunch tip were the earliest to be affected and developed the
   most severe symptoms, but ripening of all berries on symptomatic bunches
   was impaired.
   Conclusions Loss of functionality of the rachis phloem may not be the
   primary cause of berry shrivel. The disorder may originate in the distal
   berries of a bunch and spread towards the proximal berries as they
   soften at the onset of ripening.
   Significance of the Study This study contributes towards an eventual
   understanding of the causes and consequences of an important grape
   ripening disorder.}},

Title = {{Impact of virus-antibody interactions on viral clearance in anion
   exchange chromatography}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{1633}},
Month = {{DEC 6}},
Abstract = {{Viral clearance is an important performance metric for the downstream
   process of monoclonal antibod-ies (mAbs) due to its impact on patient
   safety. Anion exchange chromatography (AEX) has been well accepted in
   the industry as one of the workhorse techniques for removing viruses,
   and is considered to be able to achieve high log clearance values under
   most operating conditions. However, it is not uncommon for viral
   clearance results on AEX to fall below the desired level despite
   operating under conditions that should achieve high clearance levels
   according to conventional wisdom of how this mode of chromatography
   operates. In this study, a design of experiment (DoE) approach was used
   to develop a more fundamental understanding of viral clearance during
   AEX chromatography using Minute Virus of Mice (MVM) on POROS HQ resin.
   Load pH, conductivity and virus concentration were evaluated as design
   factors for three mAbs with varying physical and chemical properties.
   The hydrophobicity and surface charge distributions of the molecules
   were found to be the most significant factors in influencing viral
   clearance performance, and the viral clearance trends did not seem to
   fit with conventional wisdom. To explain this seemingly unconventional
   behavior, we propose a new mechanism that suggests that interactions
   between the mAb and the virus have a major contribution on retention of
   the virus on the resin. This furthered understanding may help improve
   the predictability, performance and robustness of viral clearance during
   AEX chromatography . (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Improving yield is a primary mission for cotton (Gossypium hirsutum)
   breeders; development of cultivars with suitable architecture for high
   planting density (HPDA) can increase yield per unit area.
   We characterized a natural cotton mutant, AiSheng98 (AS98), which
   exhibits shorter height, shorter branch length, and more acute branch
   angle than wild-type.
   A copy number variant at the HPDA locus on Chromosome D12 (HPDA-D12),
   encoding a dehydration-responsive element-binding (DREB) transcription
   factor, GhDREB1B, strongly affects plant architecture in the AS98
   mutant. We found an association between a tandem duplication of a c.
   13.5 kb segment in HPDA-D12 and elevated GhDREB1B expression resulting
   in the AS98 mutant phenotype. GhDREB1B overexpression confers a
   significant decrease in plant height and branch length, and reduced
   branch angle.
   Our results suggest that fine-tuning GhDREB1B expression may be a viable
   engineering strategy for modification of plant architecture favorable to
   high planting density in cotton.}},

Title = {{Bayesian Testing for Exogenous Partition Structures in Stochastic Block
   Models}},
Journal = {{SANKHYA-SERIES A-MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS AND PROBABILITY}},
Abstract = {{Network data often exhibit block structures characterized by clusters of
   nodes with similar patterns of edge formation. When such relational data
   are complemented by additional information on exogenous node partitions,
   these sources of knowledge are typically included in the model to
   supervise the cluster assignment mechanism or to improve inference on
   edge probabilities. Although these solutions are routinely implemented,
   there is a lack of formal approaches to test if a given external node
   partition is in line with the endogenous clustering structure encoding
   stochastic equivalence patterns among the nodes in the network. To fill
   this gap, we develop a formal Bayesian testing procedure which relies on
   the calculation of the Bayes factor between a stochastic block model
   with known grouping structure defined by the exogenous node partition
   and an infinite relational model that allows the endogenous clustering
   configurations to be unknown, random and fully revealed by the
   block-connectivity patterns in the network. A simple Markov chain Monte
   Carlo method for computing the Bayes factor and quantifying uncertainty
   in the endogenous groups is proposed. This strategy is evaluated in
   simulations, and in applications studying brain networks of Alzheimer's
   patients.}},

Title = {{Reinterpreting the Chinese Revolution: The Balance between Radical and
   Moderate Approaches, 1937-1945}},
Journal = {{MODERN CHINA}},
Abstract = {{The success of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) by the end of the
   Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) has generally been credited to its
   moderate approach to mobilizing the local peasantry through appeals to
   anti-Japanese nationalism and programs of social justice. However, the
   evidence presented in this article demonstrates that during late 1939
   and early 1940 in some counties of the Southwest Shanxi Base Area and
   other major North China base areas the CCP abandoned its moderate
   approach and promoted a radical and violent class struggle. Based on its
   experiences in 1939-1940, the CCP created a model for mobilization in
   early 1942 that balanced radical and moderate approaches, which was then
   gradually applied to all Communist base areas. This article argues that
   the CCP relied on a combination of two contrasting and complementary
   approaches-radical and moderate-both of which played an indispensable
   role in its success by 1945.}},

Title = {{Nitric Oxide Synthase inhibition counteracts the stress-induced DNA
   methyltransferase 3b expression in the hippocampus of rats}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{It has been postulated that the activation of NMDA receptors (NMDAr) and
   nitric oxide (NO) production in the hippocampus is involved in the
   behavioral consequences of stress. Stress triggers NMDAr-induced calcium
   influx in limbic areas, such as the hippocampus, which in turn activates
   neuronal NO synthase (nNOS). Inhibition of nNOS or NMDAr activity can
   prevent stress-induced effects in animal models, but the molecular
   mechanisms behind this effect are still unclear. In this study, cultured
   hippocampal neurons treated with NMDA or dexamethasone showed an
   increased of DNA methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3b) mRNA expression, which
   was blocked by pre-treatment with nNOS inhibitor
   n(omega)-propyl-l-arginine (NPA). In rats submitted to the Learned
   Helplessness paradigm (LH), we observed that inescapable stress
   increased DNMT3b mRNA expression at 1h and 24h in the hippocampus. The
   NOS inhibitors 7-NI and aminoguanidine (AMG) decreased the number of
   escape failures in LH and counteracted the changes in hippocampal DNMT3b
   mRNA induced in this behavioral paradigm. Altogether, our data suggest
   that NO produced in response to NMDAr activation following stress
   upregulates DNMT3b in the hippocampus.}},

Title = {{Solving hard stable matching problems involving groups of similar agents}},
Journal = {{THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},

Pages = {{171-194}},
Month = {{DEC 6}},
Abstract = {{Many important stable matching problems are known to be NP-hard, even
   when strong restrictions are placed on the input. In this paper we seek
   to identify structural properties of instances of stable matching
   problems which will allow us to design efficient algorithms using
   elementary techniques. We focus on the setting in which all agents
   involved in some matching problem can be partitioned into k different
   types, where the type of an agent determines his or her preferences, and
   agents have preferences over types (which may be refined by more
   detailed preferences within a single type). This situation would arise
   in practice if agents form preferences solely based on some small
   collection of agents' attributes. We also consider a generalisation in
   which each agent may consider some small collection of other agents to
   be exceptional, and rank these in a way that is not consistent with
   their types; this could happen in practice if agents have prior contact
   with a small number of candidates. We show that (for the case without
   exceptions), several well-studied NP-hard stable matching problems
   including MAX SMTI (that of finding the maximum cardinality stable
   matching in an instance of stable marriage with ties and incomplete
   lists) belong to the parameterised complexity class FPT when
   parameterised by the number of different types of agents needed to
   describe the instance. For MAX SMTI this tractability result can be
   extended to the setting in which each agent promotes at most one
   ``exceptional{''} candidate to the top of his/her list (when preferences
   within types are not refined), but the problem remains NP-hard if
   preference lists can contain two or more exceptions and the exceptional
   candidates can be placed anywhere in the preference lists, even if the
   number of types is bounded by a constant. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The present investigation was targeted towards a highly desirable
   everbearing trait in strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) via marker
   assisted selection while seeing its worldwide commercial applicability
   through the extended harvest season. The crosses were made between
   everbearing and june-bearing cultivars to raise the F-1 individuals.
   Morphological characters (plant, floral, and fruit) were assessed that
   showed significant differences among the strawberry cultivars. Molecular
   characterization was carried out between everbearing and non-everbearing
   cultivars using RAPD and SSR markers. For phenotyping, a chi-square test
   was performed and revealed that out of all four cross combinations, the
   best fitted cross found to be in Mendelian segregation ratio (1:1) was
   `Confectura' x `Torrey' with chi(2)-value 1.58. Further, the identified
   polymorphic markers were assessed across the F-1 individuals of cross
   `Confectura' x `Torrey' for its genotyping. It could be revealed that
   the targeted everbearing trait is governed by a dominant gene(s) in the
   subjected strawberry genotypes. Further, the identified polymorphic
   markers would be successfully employed in DNA fingerprinting of
   strawberry under various crop improvement programme.}},

Abstract = {{Background High-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NB) has a variable response to
   preoperative chemotherapy. It is not possible to differentiate viable
   vs. nonviable residual tumor before surgery.
   Purpose To explore the association between apparent diffusion
   coefficient (ADC) values from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance
   imaging (DW-MRI), I-123-meta-iodobenzyl-guanidine (I-123-mIBG) uptake,
   and histology before and after chemotherapy.
   Study Type Retrospective.
   Subjects Forty patients with HR-NB.
   Field Strength/Sequence 1.5T axial DW-MRI (b = 0,1000 s/mm(2)) and
   T-2-weighted sequences. I-123-mIBG scintigraphy planar imaging (all
   patients), with additional I-123-mIBG single-photon emission computed
   tomography / computerized tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging (15 patients).
   Assessment ADC maps and I-123-mIBG SPECT/CT images were coregistered to
   the T-2-weighted images. I-123-mIBG uptake was normalized with a
   tumor-to-liver count ratio (TLCR). Regions of interest (ROIs) for
   primary tumor volume and different intratumor subregions were drawn. The
   lower quartile ADC value (ADC(25prc)) was used over the entire tumor
   volume and the overall level of I-123-mIBG uptake was graded into
   avidity groups.
   Statistical Tests Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and linear regression
   were used to compare ADC and MIBG values before and after treatment.
   Threshold values to classify tumors as viable/necrotic were obtained
   using ROC analysis of ADC and TLCR values.
   Results No significant difference in whole-tumor ADC(25prc) values were
   found between different I-123-mIBG avidity groups pre- (P = 0.31) or
   postchemotherapy (P = 0.35). In the ``intratumor{''} analysis, 5/15
   patients (prechemotherapy) and 0/14 patients (postchemotherapy) showed a
   significant correlation between ADC and TLCR values (P < 0.05).
   Increased tumor shrinkage was associated with lower pretreatment tumor
   ADC(25prc) values (P < 0.001); no association was found with
   pretreatment I-123-mIBG avidity (P = 0.17). Completely nonviable tumors
   had significantly lower postchemotherapy ADC(25prc) values than tumors
   with >10\% viable tumor (P < 0.05). Both pre- and posttreatment TLCR
   values were significantly higher in patients with >50\% viable tumor
   than those with 10-50\% viable tumor (P < 0.05).
   Data Conclusion I-123-mIBG avidity and ADC values are complementary
   noninvasive biomarkers of therapeutic response in HR-NB.

Abstract = {{Background Supraventricular arrhythmias (SVAs), commonly managed with
   radiofrequency ablation (RFA), may occur after orthotopic heart
   transplantation (OHT).
   Methods We retrospectively assessed 514 consecutive patients (pts.)
   undergoing OHT between January 1990 and July 2016 in a single-center.
   Patients with SVAs managed with RFA were included. Mechanisms of genesis
   of SVAs, association with surgical techniques and outcomes, were
   analyzed.
   Results Of 514 pts undergoing OHT, 53\% (272 pts.) were managed with
   bicaval (BC) technique and 47\% (242 pts.) with biatrial (BA) technique.
   Mean follow-up 10 +/- 8.4 years. Nine pts. (1.7\%) developed SVA
   requiring RFA. The BC technique was performed in 4 pts., 3 pts.
   presented cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent atrial flutter (CTI AFL), and
   1 pt. double loop AFL. Five pts. were managed with BA technique, 4 pts.
   presented CTI AFL, and 1 pt. atrial tachycardia (AT). Mean time between
   OHT and SVA occurrence was 6.6 +/- 5.5 years. The procedure was
   successful in 89\% (8 pts.). Arrhythmia recurrence was seen in 3 pts
   (37\%), all with BA technique.
   Conclusion Supraventricular arrhythmias in heart transplantation may be
   associated with the surgical scar. Identifying the mechanism is vital to
   choose the appropriate treatment with radiofrequency ablation.}},

Abstract = {{Background We aimed to determine the impact of tocilizumab use on severe
   COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 19) pneumonia mortality. Methods We
   performed a multicentre retrospective cohort study in 18 tertiary
   hospitals in Spain from March to April 2020. Consecutive patients
   admitted with severe COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab were compared to
   patients not treated with tocilizumab, adjusting by inverse probability
   of the treatment weights (IPTW). Tocilizumab's effect in patients
   receiving steroids during the 48 h following inclusion was analysed.
   Results During the study period, 506 patients with severe COVID-19
   fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Among them, 268 were treated with
   tocilizumab and 238 patients were not. Median time to tocilizumab
   treatment from onset of symptoms was 11 days {[}interquartile range
   (IQR) 8-14]. Global mortality was 23.7\%. Mortality was lower in
   patients treated with tocilizumab than in controls: 16.8\% versus
   31.5\%, hazard ratio (HR) 0.514 {[}95\% confidence interval (95\% CI)
   0.355-0.744], p < 0.001; weighted HR 0.741 (95\% CI 0.619-0.887), p =
   0.001. Tocilizumab treatment reduced mortality by 14.7\% relative to no
   tocilizumab treatment {[}relative risk reduction (RRR) 46.7\%]. We
   calculated a number necessary to treat of 7. Among patients treated with
   steroids, mortality was lower in those treated with tocilizumab than in
   those treated with steroids alone {[}10.9\% versus 40.2\%, HR 0.511
   (95\% CI 0.352-0.741), p = 0.036; weighted HR 0.6 (95\% CI 0.449-0.804),
   p < 0.001] (interaction p = 0.094). Conclusions These results show that
   survival of patients with severe COVID-19 is higher in those treated
   with tocilizumab than in those not treated and that tocilizumab's effect
   adds to that of steroids administered to non-intubated patients with
   COVID-19 during the first 48 h of presenting with respiratory failure
   despite oxygen therapy. Randomised controlled studies are needed to
   confirm these results.}},

Title = {{ColAtt-Net: In Reducing the Ambiguity of Pedestrian Orientations on
   Attribute-Aware Semantic Segmentation Task}},

Abstract = {{Semantic segmentation has become one of the trending topics in the world
   of computer vision and deep learning. Recently, due to an increasing
   demand to solve a semantic segmentation task simultaneously with
   attribute recognition of objects, a new task named attribute-aware
   semantic segmentation has been introduced. Since the task requires to
   handle pixel-wise object class estimation with its attributes such as a
   pedestrian's body orientation, previous works had difficulties to handle
   ambiguous attributes such as body orientations in object-level,
   especially when segmenting the pedestrians with their attributes
   correctly. This paper proposes the ColAtt-Net that is an attribute-aware
   semantic segmentation model augmented by a column-wise mask branch to
   predict the pedestrians' orientations in the horizontal perspective of
   the input image. We firmly assume that the pedestrians captured by a
   car-mounted camera are distributed horizontally so that for each column
   of the input image, the pedestrian pixels can be labeled with one
   orientation uniformly. In the proposed method, we split the output of
   the base semantic segmentation model into two branches; one branch for
   segmenting the object categories, while the other one, as the novel
   column-wise attribute branch, is to map the recognition of pedestrian's
   orientations that are distributed horizontally. This method successfully
   enhances the performance of attribute-aware semantic segmentation by
   reducing the ambiguity on segmenting the pedestrian's orientation.
   Improvements on the pedestrian orientation segmentation are confidently
   shown by the proposed method in the experimental results, both in
   quantitative and qualitative views. This paper also discusses how the
   improved performance becomes an advantage in the autonomous driving
   system. (c) 2020 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan. Published

Abstract = {{Modified starches are widely employed excipients in tablets compression.
   The ability of materials to deform under pressure (compressibility) and
   create strong compacts (compactability) is then important for tablet
   manufacture. This study aims to evaluate and compare two partially
   pregelatinized starches, namely, Starch 1500 and Lycatab C, from the
   perspectives of compressibility, compactability, and lubricant
   sensitivity. Compressibility is evaluated by means of the compression
   energy profile and a stress relaxation test. Compactability is evaluated
   by means of the tablets tensile strength, and lubricant sensitivity is
   characterized by the lubricant sensitivity ratio (LSR) values. The
   lubricants employed are magnesium stearate and sodium stearyl fumarate
   at concentrations of 0.5\% and 1\%, respectively. In the case of the
   mixtures with 1\% magnesium stearate, the influence of the mixing time
   is also evaluated. Starch 1500 shows better compressibility than Lycatab
   C due to its lower precompression and total energy values. On the
   opposite, the plasticity is higher for Lycatab C. This material has also
   better compactability, yields stronger tablets, but has higher lubricant
   sensitivity than Starch 1500. Different compressibility and
   compactability are found for Lycatab C and Starch 1500 and therefore,
   they cannot be easily interchanged in tablet manufacture.}},

Title = {{Using electronic dental records to establish a surveillance system for

Abstract = {{Objectives Previous surveys have demonstrated high rates of early
   childhood caries (ECC) in the Alaska Native (AN) population of western
   Alaska. There are many challenges to providing dental care in this
   road-less Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta region. The regional Tribal Health
   Organization implemented an electronic dental record (EDR) system in the
   late 1990s. We explored use of the EDR to establish an oral health
   surveillance system in children.
   Methods We contracted with EDR software developers to implement
   calculation of a summary count of decayed (d), missing (m) or filled (f)
   primary (dmft) score for each individual. We calculated the yearly
   average dmft scores for 2011-2019 for children aged 3 and 5 years with a
   comprehensive exam in a given year. We also assessed the number of
   children undergoing full mouth dental rehabilitation (FMDR). We used US
   census data population estimates for these age groups to calculate
   rates.
   Results Over the 9-year period, 2,427 3-year-old children (47 percent of
   all 3-year olds over this period), received a comprehensive exam;
   increasing from 24 percent in 2011 to 62 percent in 2019. Their average
   dmft score over the 9-years was 6.4 with a significant annual decline
   over this period. Seventy percent of AN children who turned 6 between
   2015 and 2019 had received at least one FMDR.
   Conclusions An oral health surveillance system has been established in
   western Alaska using the Electronic Dental Record. High rates of ECC and
   FMDR were observed. This surveillance system will allow assessments of
   ECC prevalence and impact of dental interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Recent approaches to facilitating coach development place considerable
   emphasis on social interaction aimed at enhancing participants' learning
   through collaboration and discussion. This investigation examined the
   usefulness of utilising the Landscapes of Practice (LoP) framework to
   better understand such ``social{''} learning, specifically focussing on
   boundary interactions experienced by international coaches. Having
   recently undertaken a cross-sport development programme, 14 coaches from
   11 sports were interviewed and a thematic structure was subsequently
   established featuring four categories: (a) confidence, openness and
   authenticity, (b) sense making, (c) reflection and mentoring and (d)
   reconceptualising and reframing. This investigation found strong support
   for the usefulness of the LoP framework. Furthermore, knowledgeability
   and boundary interactions were insightful concepts to better understand
   how coaches learnt through interactions within, and beyond, the
   programme. For example, cross-sport interactions enabled some coaches to
   learn more effectively because they felt less encumbered by peers'
   judgements when compared to other environments.}},

Abstract = {{Supercritical carbon dioxide plays a vital role in the development of
   power generation applications. It owns the characteristics of high
   density and low viscosity, which can ensure a compact structure for
   turbomachinery. With the blossom of optimization algorithm, an
   interdisciplinary research which applies optimization method to a
   traditional design process of turbomachinery can accelerate the course
   and promote the validity by leaps and bounds. We improve the traditional
   simulated annealing algorithm and establish an optimization process
   containing the optimization of rotor meridian plane and nozzle profile.
   This process can effectively reduce the computation time by establishing
   a surrogate model of coarse mesh simulation. The effects of traditional
   simulated annealing algorithm (SAA), genetic algorithm (GA) and improve
   simulated annealing algorithm (ISAA) are compared. As a result, we
   realize a maximum of 4.94\% promotion for isentropic efficiency in ISAA
   computation. Also, ISAA method saves the computation time by 59.6\%
   compared to GA and by 41.5\% compared to SAA. Applying ISAA optimization
   method to the turbine in a kW-scale solar-driven Brayton cycle power
   system, we realize a 1.17\% increase for the system efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Pennsylvania (PA) first-episode psychosis (FEP) program evaluation
   is a statewide initiative, supported by the PA Office of Mental Health
   and Substance Abuse Services (PA-OMHSAS) and administered by PA Early
   Intervention Center/Heads Up, which evaluates fidelity and outcomes of
   PA Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) programs. Programs participate in
   standard computerized measures of CSC outcomes using centralized
   informatics. The aims of the current report are to describe
   implementation of this core battery for program evaluation in PA and to
   present 6- and 12-month outcomes.
   Methods Participants (n = 697) from nine PA CSC programs completed the
   core battery at admission. The battery was re-administered at 6- and
   12-month follow-up, and data were analysed for individuals (n = 230) who
   had completed 12-months of treatment. Domains assessed via clinician
   report and/or self-report included symptoms, role and social
   functioning, self-perceived recovery and service utilization.
   Results PA FEP CSC participants showed improvement over time in several
   domains, including decreased symptoms, higher role and social
   functioning, decreased hospitalizations, and improved self-perception of
   recovery, quality of life, and services satisfaction. Trends towards
   improvements were observed for participant happiness, hopelessness, and
   school-enrolment. Nearly all improvements were observed at 6-month
   follow-up, with earlier gains maintained at 12-months.
   Conclusions PA FEP CSC programs demonstrate the ability to assess and
   improve critical outcomes of coordinated specialty care in PA. Improved
   outcomes by 12 months in treatment provides evidence of an effective
   treatment model and supports the continuation of these programs in
   pursuit of our goal of reducing schizophrenia disease burden on
   individuals and society.}},

Volume = {{844}},
Pages = {{142-153}},
Month = {{DEC 6}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we study linear constraint systems in which each
   constraint is a fractional Horn constraint. A constraint is fractional
   Horn, if it can be written in the form: Sigma(n)(i=1) a(i) . x(i) >= c,
   where each a, is integral, c is integral, at most one of the a(i)s is
   positive, and all negative chs are equal to -1. A conjunction of
   fractional Horn constraints is called a Fractional Horn Constraint
   Systems (FHS). FHSs generalize a number of specialized constraint
   systems such as Difference Constraint Systems (DCS) and Horn Constraint
   Systems (HCS). We know that the problem of checking lattice point
   feasibility in DCSs and HCSs is in P. In contrast, we show that the
   problem of checking lattice point feasibility in FHSs is NP-complete. We
   then study a sub-class of fractional Horn constraint systems called
   Binary Fractional Horn Constraint Systems (BFHS). In a BFHS, each
   constraint has at most two non-zero coefficients. In this case, we show
   that the problem of checking integer feasibility is in P. Furthermore,
   we establish several properties of the least integer point and the least
   linear point of a BFHS, if they exist. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This survey presents a review of state-of-the-art deep neural network
   architectures, algorithms, and systems in speech and vision
   applications. Recent advances in deep artificial neural network
   algorithms and architectures have spurred rapid innovation and
   development of intelligent speech and vision systems. With availability
   of vast amounts of sensor data and cloud computing for processing and
   training of deep neural networks, and with increased sophistication in
   mobile and embedded technology, the next-generation intelligent systems
   are poised to revolutionize personal and commercial computing. This
   survey begins by providing background and evolution of some of the most
   successful deep learning models for intelligent speech and vision
   systems to date. An overview of large-scale industrial research and
   development efforts is provided to emphasize future trends and prospects
   of intelligent speech and vision systems. Robust and efficient
   intelligent systems demand low-latency and high fidelity in
   resource-constrained hardware platforms such as mobile devices, robots,
   and automobiles. Therefore, this survey also provides a summary of key
   challenges and recent successes in running deep neural networks on
   hardware-restricted platforms, i.e. within limited memory, battery life,
   and processing capabilities. Finally, emerging applications of speech
   and vision across disciplines such as affective computing, intelligent
   transportation, and precision medicine are discussed. To our knowledge,
   this paper provides one of the most comprehensive surveys on the latest
   developments in intelligent speech and vision applications from the
   perspectives of both software and hardware systems. Many of these
   emerging technologies using deep neural networks show tremendous promise
   to revolutionize research and development for future speech and vision
   systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The performances of the extract obtained from Rosmarinus officinalis
   (RO) on the corrosion inhibition of XC48 steel is examined by mass loss
   method, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), potentiodynamic polarization (PDP), Fourier transform
   infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
   (LC-MS). Investigations are performed in hydrochloric acid solution at 1
   M concentration at different temperatures. Results show that the RO
   extract behaves as an inhibitor of mixed-type; in particular, the
   inhibition efficiency is augmented at greater concentration of the
   inhibitor and decreases with the rise of the temperature from 303 K to
   333 K. The values of activation and free energy of inhibition reaction
   support the hypothesis of a mechanism of physisorption that is
   adequately described by the Langmuir equilibrium model. The retrieved
   outcomes are confirmed by SEM observations, which reveal that the
   adsorbed inhibitor molecules completely hinder the HCl attacks at the
   steel grain boundaries. Finally, quantum chemical calculations show that
   among the most abundant component detected in the RO extract, carnosic
   acid has a greater inhibitor potential with respect to carnosol.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)
   has caused enormous strain on health-care systems worldwide. Early
   recognition of prognostic markers and appropriate management of patients
   with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) remains a major global health
   concern, particularly when resources are limited. We undertook a study
   to see if basic tests can inform frontline clinicians of disease
   trajectory in individual patients with COVID-19.
   Methods: We retrospectively assessed characteristics of the first 50
   consecutive patients admitted to district general hospital in the United
   Kingdom with positive SARS-Cov-2 RNA swabs.
   Results: Our patient cohort shared broad similarities with previously
   published data on comorbidities and presenting features. We have found
   that chest radiographic assessment differed between survivors and
   non-survivors. Air space shadowing in middle zones were more prevalent
   in non-survivors (73.3\% vs. 35.5\% {[}p = 0.027]). Chest radiograph
   severity score was also found to be higher in non-survivors compared to
   survivors (3 vs. 1.5 {[}p = 0.007]).
   Conclusions: In this small retrospective study, our results suggest
   features of chest radiographs at presentation may provide a helpful tool
   for prognostication. In environments with constrained computed
   tomography (CT) imaging with serial chest radiographs could be a
   cost-effective tool in the assessment of Covid-19 patients.}},

Title = {{Efficient near-infrared laser emission and nonlinear optical properties
   of a newly developed Yb:LYSB laser crystal}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{844}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{Herein, we report on the growth and characterization of
   La0.78Y0.32Yb0.04Sc2.86(BO3)(4) (Yb:LYSB) crystal as bifunctional laser
   and nonlinear optical (NLO) medium. High quality Yb:LYSB crystal with
   non-congruent melting has been grown by the Czochralski technique.
   Structural, linear and NLO properties, and nearinfrared (NIR) laser
   emission performances of the grown crystal are presented. The absorption
   crosssection at 980 nm for s-polarization was evaluated to be 0.6 x
   10(-20) cm(2), and emission cross-section around 1080 nm in
   p-polarization and s-polarization amounted to 3.6 x 10(-21) cm(2) and
   1.33 x 10(-21) cm(2), respectively. The spectroscopic investigations
   revealed the existence of two different Yb3thorn centers in the LYSB
   crystal matrix. Efficient laser emission at 1028 nm was obtained with a
   c-cut 4 at.\% Yb:LYSB uncoated sample with a thickness of 3.5 mm.
   Employing the pump at 971.5 nm with a fiber-coupled diode laser, the
   Yb:LYSB medium yielded laser pulses with 1.5 mJ energy at 4.25 mJ energy
   of the absorbed pump pulse, corresponding to an overall
   optical-to-optical efficiency of 0.35. The laser operated with a high
   slope efficiency of 0.57. The refractive indexes were measured and the
   NLO properties of Yb:LYSB crystal for second harmonic generation of 1028
   nm laser radiation were determined. The results of this work indicate
   Yb:LYSB as a promising crystal to design new laser sources in the NIR
   and green (similar to 514 nm) spectral ranges based on direct laser
   emission and self-frequency doubling processes, respectively. (c) 2020

Journal = {{ACTA PHYSICA SINICA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{69}},

Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and its self-powered sensor based on
   the principles of contact electricity generation and electrostatic
   induction have important application prospects in the fields of new
   energy and internet of things (IoT). In the contact separation process
   of polymer materials with different electronegativity values, due to the
   transfer of electrons, a changing electrostatic field will be generated
   in the space around the polymer. In the existing TENG research, the
   field strength perpendicular to the plane of the friction layer and the
   electrode layer is mainly used to generate electrostatic induction, and
   the electric field effect around the polymer is ignored. According to
   the principle of electrostatic induction, the internal charge of the
   conductor in the electric field will be redistributed, which provides a
   way for the conductor to generate an induced electrical signal on the
   surface of the conductor without contacting the friction material. In
   this paper, we design a non-contact triboelectric nanogenerator
   (NC-TENG) based on changing electrostatic field. The influence of the
   distance between the conductor and the friction material, the induction
   area of the conductor and the position of the conductor relative to the
   friction material on the induced electrical output performance are
   studied when silicone rubber and nitrile rubber are used as a friction
   material. The results show that the NC-TENG can produce a stable
   electrical signal output when the conductor is completely separated from
   the friction material. The induced voltage of NC-TENG decreases with the
   increase of the distance between the conductor and the friction
   material, and gradually increases with the increase of the conductor's
   induction area. For the friction material with a size of 30 mm x 30 mm,
   the electrical output of NC-TENG tends to be stable when its conductor
   area is 60 mm x 45 mm. In addition, the different orientation of the
   conductor relative to the friction material also has a significant
   effect on the induced electrical output. The NC-TENG designed in this
   paper provides a novel electrical output generation mode, which provides
   a higher possibility for the subsequent research on TENG and the
   application of self-powered sensors.}},

Abstract = {{A sincere effort towards conversion and utilisation of any locally

Abstract = {{Curriculum within the US was birthed in a context of antiblackness and
   continues to operate as anti-Black through imagining Black youth as less
   than and uneducable. However, despite the ways educational space has
   historically worked to image Black children and communities through
   deficit lenses, the creation of non-traditional Black curricular spaces
   has long served as a strategy of resistance. In this paper, I examine
   the ways Black urban youth leveraged a co-created non-traditional
   curricular space, grounded in centering Blackness to make sense of their
   educational experiences. I draw from an academic yearlong (2016-2017)
   critical ethnography, centered in Black Critical Theory (BlackCrit), to
   examine what is revealed about Black living and learning and curriculum,
   through centering Blackness in a non-traditional curricular space.
   Theoretically framed through BlackCrit and Sharpe's (2016) concept of
   wake work, I analyze critical literacy artifacts and interview data to
   examine how centering antiblackness, a strength-based positioning,
   facilitated Black curricular un/makings that worked to: 1) center Black
   empowerment and 2) affirm Black knowledge. I use the term curricular
   un/makings to represent the ways the Black youth leveraged their
   life-worlds to disrupt or abandon nation-state curriculum (unmake
   anti-Black curricular space) to compose new ideations of curriculum and
   curricular space (make curriculum anew by centering Blackness). Black
   curricular un/makings represent the intentional process of
   deconstructing anti-Black curriculum through an unapologetic centering
   of a Black ethos.}},

   A design of experiments (DOE) has been carried out by the Taguchi method

   conductive ink doped with CNTs/GNPs to achieve Joules heating. The
   target of the DOE is based on reaching the highest average temperature,

   account the quality of the 3D printed circuits. The DOE factors were the
   CNT and GNP content, the voltage applied to the circuit and its
   geometry, proposing two alternative designs.
   Finally, a de-icing test was carried out with the optimal parameters

Abstract = {{Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs that are highly
   relevant as disease biomarkers. Several studies that explored the role
   of miRNAs in Alzheimer's disease (AD) demonstrated their usefulness in

   would contribute to the standardization of these biomarkers in AD. The
   objective of the study was to identify miRNAs that can be used as ECs in
   AD. Methods We evaluated 145 patients divided into two different
   cohorts. One was a discovery cohort of 19 women diagnosed with mild to
   moderate AD (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score >= 20) and with

   assessment cohort consisted of 126 individuals: 24 subjects without AD
   or any kind of dementia and negative for all core CSF biomarkers of AD,
   25 subjects with MCI and negative for CSF biomarkers (MCI -), 22
   subjects with MCI and positive for CSF biomarkers (MCI +), and 55
   subjects with AD and positive for CSF biomarkers. In the discovery
   cohort, a profile of 384 miRNAs was determined in the plasma by TaqMan
   low-density array. The best EC candidates were identified by
   mean-centering and concordance correlation restricted normalization
   methods. The stability of the EC candidates was assessed using the
   GeNorm, BestKeeper, and NormFinder algorithms. Results Nine miRNAs
   (hsa-miR-324-5p, hsa-miR-22-5p, hsa-miR-103a-2-5p, hsa-miR-362-5p,
   hsa-miR-425-3p, hsa-miR-423-5p, hsa-let-7i-3p, hsa-miR-532-5p, and
   hsa-miR-1301-3p) were identified as EC candidates in the discovery
   cohort. The validation results indicated that hsa-miR-103a-2-5p was the
   best EC, followed by hsa-miR-22-5p, hsa-miR-1301-3p, and hsa-miR-425-3p,
   which had similar stability values in all three algorithms. Conclusions
   We identified a profile of four miRNAs as potential plasma ECs to be
   used for normalization of miRNA expression data in studies of subjects
   with cognitive impairment.}},

Journal = {{BMC FAMILY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: The Netherlands Triage Standard (NTS) is a widely used
   decision support tool for telephone triage at Dutch out-of-hours primary
   care services (OHS-PC), which, however, has never been validated against
   clinical outcomes. We aimed to determine the accuracy of the NTS urgency
   allocation for patients with neurological symptoms suggestive of a
   transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or stroke, with the clinical outcomes
   TIA, stroke, and other (neurologic) life-threatening events (LTEs) as
   the reference.
   Method: A cross-sectional study of telephone triage recordings of
   patients with neurological symptoms calling the OHS-PC between 2014 and
   2016.The allocated NTS urgencies were derived from the electronic
   medical records of the OHS-PC. The clinical outcomes were retrieved from
   the electronic medical records of the patients' own general
   practitioners. The accuracy of a high NTS urgency allocation (medical
   help within 3 h) was calculated in terms of sensitivity, specificity,
   positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) with the clinical
   outcomes TIA/stroke/other LTEs as the reference.
   Results: Of 1269 patients, 635 (50.0\%) received the diagnosis
   TIA/stroke (34.2\% TIA/minor stroke, 15.8\% major ischaemic or
   haemorrhagic stroke), and 4.8\% other LTEs. For TIA/stroke/other LTEs,
   the sensitivity and specificity of the NTS urgency allocation were 0.72
   (95\%CI 0.68-0.75) and 0.48 (95\%CI 0.43-0.52), and the PPV and NPV were
   0.62 (95\%CI 0.60-0.64) and 0.58 (95\%CI 0.54-0.62).
   Conclusions: The NTS decision support tool used in Dutch OHS-PC
   performed poor to moderately regarding safety (sensitivity) and
   efficiency (specificity) in allocating adequate urgencies to patients
   with and without TIA/stroke/other LTEs.}},

Title = {{The chemical and structural transformation of bamboo wastes during
   torrefaction process}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{To investigate the chemical and structural transformation of bamboo
   during torrefaction process, bamboo wastes were torrefied at
   temperatures of 200, 250, and 300 degrees C and residence times of 1.0,
   1.5, and 2.0 hr, whose properties were determined by thermogravimetry
   coupled with mass spectrometry (PY-MS), Fourier transform infrared
   spectrometer (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and solid-state nuclear
   magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). The results showed that
   torrefaction improved the energy density and calorific value, reduced
   the volatile matters, and pollutant emission of bamboo wastes. The
   chemical and structural transformation of bamboo wastes was due to
   pyrolysis of some chemical groups. Torrefaction temperatures had the
   more significant effect than residence times. The energy enrichment
   factor (EEF), the calorific value improvement (CVI), and fuel ratio (FR)
   of torrefied bamboo wastes increased with the increase of torrefaction
   temperatures and residence times. When torrefaction temperatures
   increased to 300 degrees C, crystalline region of cellulose was
   destroyed. There were more than 10 families of pyrolysis products,
   including alcohol, acid, aldehyde, alkane, ester, ether, furan, ketone,
   phenol, etc. Torrefaction changed the chemical environment of H atoms
   from aromatics of guaiacs unit, beta-O-4 structure, beta-beta structure
   to xylan. The beta-O-4 bond was broken in guaiacle unit and formed
   aromatization and alkyl side chains. The results will be helpful to
   reveal torrefaction mechanism of bamboo wastes and further develop their
   add-valued utilization as energy products.}},

Abstract = {{The article gives a critical examination considering the descriptive
   potential, explanatory limitations, and recent productive
   problematization of presentism. For several decades, notions of
   presentist temporality have occupied the forefront of debates about the
   nature of historical time, challenging the modern dynamic
   future-oriented temporal imaginary and theorizing the reign of an
   overwhelming present that assimilates the past and the future within its
   expanding scope. According particular attention to distinct
   interpretations from the work of Francois Hartog, Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht,
   and Hartmut Rosa, the article considers the rise of memory culture and
   suspension of future-oriented momentum as crucial characteristics of the
   presentist perspective. Referencing recent interventions by Zoltan
   Boldizsar Simon, Dipesh Chakrabarty, and Helge Jordheim, however, the
   paper argues that momentous changes across technological and ecological
   domains necessitate conceptual innovation capable of exceeding
   presentism's static temporal economy.}},

   investigated, after each reported five or more weaned calves with
   diarrhoea and/or ill-thrift, or at least one calf with oral/nasal
   ulceration. Primary study objectives included the development of a
   detailed case definition for the clinical syndrome, termed upper
   alimentary tract ulcerative syndrome (UAUS) and the identification of
   potential causative virus(es) using metagenomics. A diagnosis of UAUS
   could not be made based solely on clinical signs and required
   histopathological assessment of post-mortem samples. Specifically, this
   included the identification of multifocal to coalescing areas of mucosal
   epithelial necrosis at all depths of the stratified squamous epithelium
   of the oesophagus, along with exclusion of bovine viral diarrhoea virus.
   Based on this case definition, twelve herds were diagnosed with clinical
   UAUS across the three dairying regions of Victoria, while thirteen were
   ruled UAUS-negative. The status of the nine remaining herds was
   unresolved due to a lack of required post-mortem samples.
   Metatranscriptomic analysis on oral swabs and oesopharyngeal samples
   from confirmed UAUS cases did not detect a virus common to the
   cross-sectional sample collection.}},

Title = {{Newborn crawling and rooting in response to maternal breast odor}},
Journal = {{DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2021}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A growing literature shows that perception and action are already
   tightly coupled in the newborn. The current study aimed to examine the
   nature of the coupling between olfactory stimuli from the mother and the
   newborn's crawling and rooting (exploratory movements of the head). To
   examine the coupling, the crawling and rooting behavior of 28 2-day-old
   newborns were studied while they were supported prone on a mobility
   device shaped like a mini skateboard, the Crawliskate (R), their head
   positioned directly on top of a pad infused with either their mother's
   breast odor (Maternal) or the odor of water (Control). Video and 3D
   kinematic analyses of the number and types of limb movements and
   quantification of displacement across the surface revealed that newborns
   are significantly more efficient crawlers when they smell the maternal
   odor, moving greater distances although performing fewer locomotor
   movements. In addition, the newborns made significantly more head
   rooting movements in the presence of the maternal odor. These findings
   suggest that the circuitry underlying quadrupedal locomotion and
   exploratory movements of the head is already adaptable to olfactory
   information via higher brain processing. Moreover, the coupling between
   olfaction and the two action systems, locomotion and rooting, is already
   differentiated. As crawling enables the newborn to move toward the
   mother's breast immediately after birth and facilitates mother-infant
   interaction, the results of this study highlight the potential value of
   using maternal odors to stimulate mobility in infants at risk of motor
   delay and/or deprived of this odor when born prematurely.}},

Abstract = {{Surface defect engineering has been suggested as an effective strategy
   to enhance photo-Fenton degradation performance. However, the underlying
   impact mechanism remains unknown. This study precisely constructed an
   efficient photo-Fenton catalyst through self-assembly of
   Fe-polyoxometalates nanoparticles on porous and ultrathin g-C3N4
   nanosheets with nitrogen vacancies (Fe-POM/CNNS-N-vac). These nitrogen
   vacancies promoted photo-Fenton reaction rate constant for tetracycline
   hydrochloride (TCH) from 0.0950 to 0.1520 min(-1) under visible light
   irradiation. Scavenging experiments and characterization results
   indicated that nitrogen vacancies could accelerate Fe(III)/Fe(II)
   conversion for (OH)-O-center dot and O-1(2) generation, and directly
   regulate electronic structure for O-center dot(2)- generation. The
   possible degradation pathways of TCH were interpreted using experimental
   results and frontier electron density calculations. The results
   indicated that holes (h(+)) were responsible for ring-opening and
   O-1(2)/(OH)-O-center dot/O-center dot(2)- contributed to demethylation,
   deamination, and further mineralization. This study provides novel
   insight for the design of highly efficient catalysts with nitrogen
   vacancies for the removal of emerging pollutants.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature monitoring plays an increasingly important role in research
   and industrial applications. Based on the influence of liquid crystal
   material thermal sensitivity on the capacitance of liquid crystal cell,
   the sensing performance of the capacitive-type liquid crystal
   temperature sensor were studied. By testing the capacitance under the
   voltage from 0 V to 20 V at different temperatures, the
   capacitance-voltage curve is drawn, and then the relationship between
   the capacitance change rate and the temperature at different voltages
   was obtained, so as to analyse its sensitivity. The results show that
   the capacitance of the liquid crystal material (RDP-09 T-100) is
   linearly related to the temperature in the temperature range of 20-110
   degrees C, even when the applied voltage is 0.1 V, which proves its
   feasibility as a temperature measuring medium for the temperature sensor
   and shows that the sensor has the advantage of low power consumption.
   When the applied voltage is 15 V, the sensitivity of the capacitive-type
   liquid crystal temperature sensor can reach 0.94 pF/degrees C and its
   response time is 0.115 s/(pF.degrees C). This research further expands
   the application scope of liquid crystal and has certain guiding
   significance for the development of new temperature sensor.}},

Abstract = {{Durability properties of self-compacting concrete (SCC) made with coarse
   recycled concrete aggregates (CRCA) and fine recycled concrete
   aggregates (FRCA) are reported. The replacement levels of fine natural
   aggregates with FRCA were kept at 0\%, 25\%, 50\%, 75\% and 100\% in the
   SCCs in which 100\% of the coarse natural aggregates were replaced with
   CRCA. The effect of CRCA and FRCA inclusion on the compressive strength
   and durability properties such as rapid chloride penetration, initial
   surface absorption, water permeability and capillary suction tests were
   evaluated. In order to enhance the performance of various SCC mixes,
   silica fume (SF) was used in some of the SCC mixes. The experiments show
   that in general, replacement of the natural aggregates with the recycled
   aggregates lead to deterioration in the compressive strength and
   durability properties. However, the use of SF in a ternary blend
   improved the compressive strength and durability properties. Hence, SF
   has the potential to significantly offset deterioration in compressive
   strength and durability properties of SCC mixes consequent to
   replacement of natural aggregates with recycled aggregates.}},

Abstract = {{This study sought to develop a highly efficient adsorbent material for
   phosphorus (P) removal via valorization of industrial Escherichia coli
   biomass waste. To ensure an easy and fast recovery after the sorption
   process, the E. coli biomass waste was immobilized into polysulfone
   matrix. Additionally, to improve P sorption capacity, the sorbent
   surface was coated with polyethylenimine (PEI) and further chemically
   modified. The P uptakes of the developed sorbent (decarboxylated
   PEI-modified polysulfone-biomass composite fiber, DC-PEI-PEF) were
   significantly affected by pH. Moreover, the maximum sorption capacity
   (qmax) of DC-PEI-PEF was estimated as 30.46 +/- 1.09 mg/g at neutral pH,
   as determined by a Langmuir isotherm model. Furthermore, DC-PEI-PEF
   could reach sorption equilibrium within 5 min and exhibited reusability
   potential. The partition coefficient of the newly developed material
   (DC-PEI-PEF) was calculated as 0.387 mg/g.mu M at 4 mg/L of initial P
   concentration and decreased as initial P concentrations increased.
   Therefore, DC-PEI-PEF could be suggested as a promising adsorbent for
   application in direct phosphorus removal from natural aquatic

Abstract = {{Although managers in South Korea's casino industry have continued to
   consciously adopt leadership styles, the literature on how authentic
   leadership has impacted the industry remains scarce. Therefore, the
   purpose of our study was to investigate the relationships between
   authentic leadership, employees' self-efficacy, and turnover intention
   at casinos, as well as whether employees' gender and age moderate the
   relationship between authentic leadership and their self-efficacy. After
   data were collected from casino employees in South Korea, 281 usable
   surveys were processed using structural analysis. Among the results, not
   only did authentic leadership and employees' self-efficacy positively
   relate to each other, but customer satisfaction significantly influenced
   turnover intention as well. Moreover, employees' gender and age indeed
   moderated the relationship between their self-efficacy and authentic
   leadership. This study discusses the several implications of its

   formation of a ground-state complex. As there was an increase in
   Stern-Volmer constant observed as a function of temperature, idea of
   dynamic quenching was established. However, the negligible changes in
   lifetime indicated static quenching; thus, making the process a
   combination of static-dynamic quenching. Basically, the protein - glycan
   interaction was driven by entropy of the system and mediated by
   hydrophobic interactions. Secondary structure (CD spectroscopy) of
   native protein was significantly affected (intensity became more
   negative) in presence of CS, thus, introducing more compactness in the
   protein. CS infused thermal and chemical stability into BMP - 2 via
   alteration in its conformation. The rate of association was inversely
   proportional to concentration of quencher (CS), which confirmed the
   correlation between large size (similar to 5 times the size of protein)
   and structural complexity of CS with fewer binding sites present in BMP
   - 2. The rate of association in presence of urea, suggested a decrease
   in association rate as a function of urea concentration for 15 mu M CS.
   Experimental evidences suggested an interaction between protein and
   glycan mediated by hydrophobic interactions, which deciphers structural,
   thermal and chemical stability into protein. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of
   quercetin on the tight junction proteins of human retinal pigment
   epithelial cells (ARPE-19 cells) suffering from oxidative stress injury
   and explore the possible mechanism.
   Methods: H2O2 (300 mu M) was used to establish an oxidative stress model
   of ARPE-19 cells. ARPE-19 cells were pretreated with different
   concentrations (0-80 mu M) of quercetin before H2O2 exposure. The
   expression and distribution of tight junction proteins and
   autophagy-related proteins were detected by Western blot and
   immunostaining. ARPE-19 cells were pretreated with 5 mM 3-methyladenine
   (3-MA).
   Results: The cell viability weakened in the H2O2 group compared with the
   control group. However, it was preserved after pretreatment with
   quercetin. It was observed that the expression levels of occludin,
   claudin-1 were decreased in the H2O2 group. Quercetin treatment
   significantly enhanced the expression levels of them as compared to the
   H2O2 group. H2O2 alone strongly decreased the Zonula occludens protein 1
   (ZO-1) expression in the cytomembrane. Quercetin supplementation
   enhanced the accumulation of ZO-1 in ARPE-19 cells. The expression
   levels of Beclin-1 and Microtubule associated protein light chain 3 II
   (LC-3II) increased, and that of P62 decreased in the quercetin
   protection group. The appearance of LC-3II, which examined by
   immunofluorescence experiments, enhanced in the quercetin protection
   group as compared with the control group. The expression levels of
   beclin-1 and LC-3II increased, and that of P62 increased in the
   autophagy-inhibited group compared with the quercetin protection group.
   The levels of occludin and claudin-1 also decreased.
   Conclusion: Quercetin prevents the loss of tight junction proteins by
   upregulating autophagy after oxidative stress in ARPE-19 cells.}},

Title = {{Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of peripheral blood cells derived
   from patients with first-episode schizophrenia in the Chinese Han
   population}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY}},
Abstract = {{Schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder with core features
   including hallucinations, delusions, and cognition deficits.
   Accumulating evidence has implicated abnormal DNA methylation in the
   development of schizophrenia. However, the mechanisms by which DNA
   methylation changes alter the risk for schizophrenia remain largely
   unknown. We recently carried out a DNA methylome study of peripheral
   blood samples from 469 first-episode patients with schizophrenia and 476
   age- and gender-matched healthy controls of Han Chinese origin. Genomic
   DNA methylation patterns were quantified using an Illumina Infinium
   Human MethylationEPIC BeadChip. We identified multiple differentially
   methylated positions (DMPs) and regions between patients and controls.
   The most significant DMPs were annotated to genes C17orf53, THAP1 and
   KCNQ4 (K(V)7.4), with Bonferroni-adjusted P values of 1.34 x 10(-12),
   1.15 x 10(-11), and 3.11 x 10(-11), respectively. In particular, KCNQ4
   encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel of the K(V)7 family, which is
   linked to neuronal excitability. The genes associated with top-ranked
   DMPs also included many genes involved in nervous system development,
   such as LIMK2 and TMOD2. Gene ontology analysis of the differentially
   methylated genes further identified strong enrichment of neuronal
   networks, including neuron projection extension, axonogenesis and neuron
   apoptotic process. Finally, we provided evidence that
   schizophrenia-associated epigenetic alterations co-localize with genetic
   susceptibility loci. By focusing on first-episode schizophrenia
   patients, our investigation lends particularly strong support for an
   important role of DNA methylation in schizophrenia pathogenesis
   unconfounded by the effects of long-term antipsychotic medication or
   disease progression. The observed DNA methylation aberrations in
   schizophrenia patients could potentially provide a valuable resource for
   identifying diagnostic biomarkers and developing novel therapeutic
   targets to benefit schizophrenia patients.}},

Title = {{Regression Analysis of Asynchronous Longitudinal Functional and Scalar
   Data}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION}},
Abstract = {{Many modern large-scale longitudinal neuroimaging studies, such as the
   Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study, have
   collected/are collecting asynchronous scalar and functional variables
   that are measured at distinct time points. The analyses of temporally
   asynchronous functional and scalar variables pose major technical
   challenges to many existing statistical approaches. We propose a class
   of generalized functional partial-linear varying-coefficient models to
   appropriately deal with these challenges through introducing both scalar
   and functional coefficients of interest and using kernel weighting
   methods. We design penalized kernel-weighted estimating equations to
   estimate scalar and functional coefficients, in which we represent
   functional coefficients by using a rich truncated tensor product
   penalized B-spline basis. We establish the theoretical properties of
   scalar and functional coefficient estimators including consistency,
   convergence rate, prediction accuracy, and limiting distributions. We
   also propose a bootstrap method to test the nullity of both parametric
   and functional coefficients, while establishing the bootstrap
   consistency. Simulation studies and the analysis of the ADNI study are
   used to assess the finite sample performance of our proposed approach.
   Our real data analysis reveals significant relationship between
   fractional anisotropy density curves and cognitive function with
   education, baseline disease status and APOE4 gene as major contributing
   factors. for this article are available online.}},

Journal = {{COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, styrene butadiene resin/nano-SiO2 (SBR/SiO2) composite
   was synthesized by the continuous emulsion polymerization method, which
   was used as a plugging agent for oil-based drilling fluid (OBDF) to
   enhance plugging efficiency in shale formations. The characterization of
   SBR/SiO2 was measured by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
   thermal stability and scanning electron microscopy. The results implied
   that the structure of SBR/SiO2 was consistent with design. The
   dispersion of SBR/SiO2 in water and mineral oil were studied by particle
   size distribution and rheological analysis. The results indicated that
   SBR/SiO2 can be dispersed in water and mineral oil simultaneously, while
   most normal OBDF plugging agents can only be dispersed in water or
   mineral oil. Since OBDF is a water-in-oil emulsion, when the plugging
   agents can be dispersed in two continuous phases, the plugging
   efficiency can be maximized. And it's the first time to explain plugging
   ability from dispersion perspective and produce the plugging agent for
   OBDF which can be dispersed in two phases. Then the plugging ability was
   evaluated by filtration volume, porosity physical adsorption instrument
   (BET), and pressure transmission test. The results showed that SBR/SiO2
   can enter into the nanopores of shale formations and significantly
   reduce fluid invasion, thereby improving wellbore stability. Finally,
   the dispersion and plugging mechanism of SBR/SiO2 were analyzed. This
   study might provide an avenue to solve the wellbore instability and
   reservoir damage owing to OBDF during the drilling process by adding the
   plugging agent which can form a dense filter cake and reduce fluid loss
   in shale formations.}},

Title = {{Peroxide/Zero-valent iron (Fe-0) pretreatment for promoting
   dewaterability of anaerobically digested sludge: A mechanistic study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{400}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{Peroxide/Zero-valent iron (Fe-0) was reported to promote dewaterability
   of anaerobically digested sludge (ADS), but the mechanism of how
   Peroxide/Fe-0 facilitates ADS dewatering is unknown. This study
   therefore aims to uncover the details of how Peroxide/Fe-0 elevates ADS
   dewaterability. Experimental results showed that with 0.6 g Fe-0/g TSS
   and 0.08 g peroxide/g TSS, capillary suction time, specific resistance
   to filtration, and time to filtration of ADS was 50.7 \%, 41.4 \%, and
   54.4 \% of that in the control, respectively. In this condition, water
   content of sludge cake decreased from 91.2 \% +/- 0.5 \% (the control)
   to 68.6 \% +/- 1.3 \%. The mechanism explorations revealed that the
   elevated dewaterability was mainly caused by role of H-center dot and
   Fe(II)/Fe(III) species during Peroxide/Fe degrees pretreatment.
   (OH)-O-center dot decreased the polysaccharides and proteins in
   extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), then injured the cytoderm \&
   cytomembrane through the releases of lactate dehydrogenase and
   N-acetylglucosamine, and further facilitated the decrease of
   intracellular substances, which disengaged the water trapped in ADS. In
   addition, the cell lysis caused by (OH)-O-center dot facilitated forming
   macro-pores. Moreover, (OH)-O-center dot converted the conformational
   structure of extracellular proteins, which may strengthen the ADS
   hydrophobicity, promoting the discharge of unbound water and ADS
   flocculation. Meanwhile, Fe(II)/Fe(III) benefited aggregating the
   denatured ADS particulates.}},

Title = {{Superconducting and flux pinning properties of FeSexTe1-x topological
   superconductors}},

Abstract = {{Iron-based superconductor FeSexTe1-x has attracted attention because of
   its high upper critical field, low anisotropy, and high critical current
   density. Also, it is predicted to have nontrivial topological
   properties, so that it is a candidate of realizing Majorana fermion,
   when the superconductivity is combined with topological features.
   However, its flux pinning behavior and mechanism in superconducting
   state with varying Se/Te ratio have not been systematically studied. We
   use self-flux method to grow single crystal samples of FeSe(x)Te(1-x
   )with different x values (0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6). The structural and
   morphological properties of the monocrystalline samples are
   characterized by XRD and SEM. All samples show that they possess the
   expected crystalline structures and their lattice parameters vary with x
   value. The magnetic properties at low temperatures are also measured,
   showing that all samples have good superconductivity. Superconducting
   properties, such as critical current densities and flux pinning force
   densities, are extracted from the magnetic measurements and analyzed,
   and the flux pinning behavior is discussed. The best Se:Te ratio is
   determined to be nearly 0.4/0.6 based on the comparison among these
   properties of different samples. By utilizing the Dew-Hughes theory and
   analyzing the pinning force density peak, the flux pinning mechanism in
   the best samples (x = 0.4, 0.5) can be regarded as the mixture of normal
   point pinning and A kappa volume pinning. This work provides important
   information for the further study of the topological and superconducting
   properties of FeSexTe1-x.}},

Abstract = {{Design and synthesis of new fluoride upconversion (UC) luminescent
   materials with controllable morphologies remains a challenge. Here,
   novel Ba4Bi3F17:Er3+/Yb3+ UC nanoparticles (UCNPs) were discovered and
   prepared using a simple one-step solvothermal strategy, and the
   modulation of the morphology and particle size was investigated in
   detail. Upon 980 nm excitation, the influence of dosage amounts of
   Yb3+/Er3+, and the environmental temperatures on the UC luminescent
   performance were studied in the temperature range of 293-393 K. The
   maximum relative sensitivities (Sr) of Ba4Bi3F17:1 mol\%Er, 13 mol\% Yb
   material are calculated to be 0.0122 K-1 and 0.0167 K-1 at 293 K,
   respectively, based on the two energetic levels of (H-2(11/2),
   S-4(13/2)) and (H-2(11/2), F-4(9/2)). In addition, the internal heating
   performance of the Ba4Bi3F17:Er3+/Yb3+ UCNPs was also evaluated in the
   pump power range of 112-901 mW, and the internal temperature of the
   UCNPs increased from 296 to 367 K with the increase of excitation power.
   This work initiates the discovery of the new bismuth-based fluoride
   nanothermometers and demonstrates the great potential for bifunctional

Volume = {{844}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{We report the synthesis of the first carbide-hydride phase obtained in
   the family of equiatomic intermetallics RTX (R = rare earth, T =
   transition metal, X =p-block element) by insertion of light elements. We
   prepared the NdScSiC0.5H0.2 compound by solid-gas reaction, by exposing
   the carbide NdScSiC0.5 to 40 bars of H-2 gas at 450 degrees C. It
   crystallizes in the La2Fe2Se2O3-type structure with H and C atoms
   occupying Nd-4 tetrahedral and Nd2Sc4 octahedral interstices,
   respectively. The H site is only partly filled owing to the presence of
   Nd-C covalent bonding that prevents the formation of Nd-H bonding
   through antagonist effect. The carbide-hydride was characterized through
   magnetic measurements, specific heat and powder neutron diffraction.
   Remarkably, hydrogenation of the carbide provokes a quite drastic effect
   on the magnetic properties by changing the ground state from a
   ferromagnetic (T-C similar to 70 K) to an antiferromagnetic one (T-N =
   10 K). The magnetic structure of NdScSiC0.5H0.2 consists of double
   layers of ferromagnetic Nd moments aligned along the c-axis and coupled
   antiferromagnetically along this axis. This magnetic structure results
   in a field-induced metamagnetic behaviour as pointed out by
   magnetisation isotherms. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The role of heparin in preventing the early silent ischemia in carotid
   stenting}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{Introduction and aims
   Serebral silent ischemia is a complication of carotid stenting. If
   silent ischemia occurs 24 h later of carotid stenting, it called early
   serebral silent ischemia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   effect of heparin infusion on the prevention of early silent ischemia in
   patients who underwent carotid stenting.
   Materials and methods
   We included 26 patients who underwent carotid stenting. Patients who had
   carotid stenting, we randomized into two groups. The first group of
   patients were given continuously heparin infusion a maximum of 20,000
   units for 24 h, and screened the aPTT value each 6 h. The aPTT value
   aimed a range of 2-3 times to up baseline. The second group didn't take
   heparin infusion. Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging
   (DWI-MRI) and gradient echo (GRE) sequences performed in all patients at
   the 24 h of carotid stenting.
   Results
   Early serebral silent ischemia was detected by DWI-MRI in 13 (50\%) of
   26 patients who underwent carotid stenting. Seven (53.80\%) of 13
   patients whit early serebral silent ischemia did not receive heparin
   treatment, while 6 (46.20\%) received heparin treatment. There was no
   symptomatic or asymptomatic acute hemorrhage in patients who treated
   with heparin.
   Conclusion
   In our study, the continuation of anticoagulant therapy for 24 h to
   prevent early silent ischemia was not statistically significant. Also
   there is no reduction for count of serebral silent ischemia between two
   groups. However, due to the small number of patients in the study,
   future studies are required with more patients.}},

Abstract = {{The monoclinic phase Er3+/Er3+-Yb3+:MgMoO4 phosphors prepared via
   solid-state reaction method reveal Stark sublevels of green emitting
   levels of Er3+ under 980 nm diode laser excitation. The developed
   phosphors have been characterized through X-ray diffraction (XRD), field
   emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and diffuse reflectance
   studies. The dipole-dipole interaction was found responsible for the
   concentration quenching. The mechanism behind the upconversion (UC)
   emission study, energy level diagram of Er3+-Yb3+ system have been
   explored in detail. Moreover, the temperature dependent behaviour have
   been studied based on single and multiple ratiometric thermometry on the
   basis of four schemes of fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) that consist
   of two component peaks of H-2(11/2) -> I-4(15/2) transition (similar to
   524 \& similar to 530 nm) and two component peaks of S-4(3/2) ->

   thermally coupled levels exhibit strong green emission intensity as well

Abstract = {{We investigated whether Early Posterior Negativity (EPN) indicated the

   with high-level and low-level arousing auditory stimuli, while we
   simultaneously recorded EEG. In accordance with previous studies,
   arousing stimuli were temporally overestimated and led to higher EPN
   amplitude. Yet, we observed that time dilation and EPN amplitude were
   significantly correlated and this effect cannot be explained by
   confounds from stimulus valence. We interpret our findings in terms of
   the pacemaker-accumulator model of human timing, and suggest that EPN
   indicates an arousal-based increasing of the speed of our mental clock.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the whiteness index (W-ID) and surface roughness
   (Ra) of bovine enamel after simulated tooth brushing with different
   commercial and experimental whitening dentifrices.
   Materials and Methods: Cylindrical enamel bovine specimens were acid
   etched, stained, and divided in nine groups (n = 8): Colgate (R) Optic
   White (R), Crest (R) Baking Soda and Peroxide, Arm and Hammer (R)
   Advanced White (TM) Extreme Whitening, Rembrandt (R) Deeply White (R) +
   Peroxide, Close up (R) White Attraction Natural Glow, Hinode Prowhite,
   and experimental dentifrice containing papain (PP), bromelain (PB), or
   papain and bromelain (PPB). Ra and W-ID were obtained initially and
   after 600, 1200, and 3,600 cycles of simulated tooth brushing. Data were
   analyzed using two-way analysis of variance test (alpha = 0.05).
   Results: Ra was significantly influenced by both dentifrice (p = 0.043)
   and period of tooth-brushing simulation (p < 0.001). Except for PP and
   PPB, all groups showed a statistically significant increase in Ra after
   simulated tooth brushing. After staining and brushing, none of the
   materials tested increased the initial W-ID.
   Conclusions: The effect of commercial whitening dentifrices may be
   related to their high abrasiveness. Experimental formulations tested
   provided a similar effect without undesired wear of enamel. Whitening
   dentifrices only act through an abrasive effect rather than bleaching
   the tooth structures. When used, special care must be taken for avoid
   undesired wear of enamel. Experimental dentifrices provided similar
   removal of extrinsic stains without undesired abrasiveness; however,
   this effect may be due to the use of less aggressive abrasives in their
   formulations.}},

Abstract = {{Microplastics (MPs) have been proven to concentrate hydrophobic organic
   contaminants (HOCs) from seawater as the sorbent phase, and the
   concentration of HOCs in aqueous solutions could be estimated from MPs
   preloaded with HOCs by equilibrium partition coefficient. This study
   firstly proposed to in situ quantify fiuoranthene (a representative
   HOCs) pre-concentrated on MPs using surface enhance raman scattering
   (SERS) in combination with mathematical models, as an efficient
   monitoring tool for fiuoranthene pollution in the aquatic environment.
   AgNPs-coated quartz (AgNPs@SiO2) substrate was fabricated. The SERS
   substrate was tested using fiuoranthene standard solution with the
   minimal detectable concentration of 1 ng/mL achieved. Applying SERS for
   the detection of fiuoranthene sorbed on MPs, the detection limit of
   fiuoranthene on MPs was 3.3 ng/g, where the concentration in the
   corresponding equilibrium seawater was 0.97 ng/mL. Since more than one
   fiuoranthene peak was observed, the quantitative detection was
   investigated by interval partial least square model. Eight
   characteristic peak ranges were selected to develop the model for
   predicting fiuoranthene concentration, with R(2)c and R(2)v of 0.90 and
   0.82, respectively. The study provides a promising solution to monitor
   trace level of contaminations in aquatic environment, using MPs as the
   passive sampler.}},

Title = {{Functionalized magnetic PAMAM dendrimer as an efficient nanocatalyst for
   a new synthetic strategy of xanthene pigments}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{400}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{A green protocol has been developed for preparation of the wide variety
   of colored xanthene derivatives using a new efficient magnetic solid
   acid catalyst bearing polyamidoamine dendrimer moiety as a nanoscopic
   compound. Dendrimers, highly symmetric molecules around a core and 3D
   spherical morphology, show interesting traits based on their
   functionalized groups on the branched surface. They can be designed to
   provide water soluble structures or pseudo-active sites of biomolecules.
   The catalyst was assembled via a polyamidoamine dendrimer immobilized on
   the surface of gamma-Fe2O3 followed by the sulfonylation of the amine
   groups by chlor osulfonic acid resulting in gamma-Fe2O3@PAMAM-SO3H.
   Herein, PAMAM dendrimer with repeating amine/amide branches as catchable
   sites of sulfonic acid groups was introduced as transformer of
   homogeneous to heterogeneous acidic catalysts. The physicochemical
   properties of synthesized catalyst were studied using by FT-IR, FE-SEM,
   XRD, VSM, EDS, TGA/DTG, and TEM. Finally, the catalytic activity of
   gamma-Fe2O3@PAMAM-SO3H was evaluated for the preparation of xanthene
   derivatives via a one-pot, three components reaction of aromatic
   aldehydes with i) 13-naphthol, ii) cyclic 1,3-dicarbonyl,
   iii)beta-naphthol and cyclic 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds, iv)
   2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, leading to the eco-riendly preparation of
   the target compounds in good to excellent yields. The catalyst could be
   easily recycled for at least five consecutive runs without significant
   loss in its catalytic activity.}},

Abstract = {{The use of metallodrugs in the treatment of various diseases is common.
   Free radicals' scavenging can prevent diseases such as cancer.
   Therefore, the design and synthesis of antioxidant metallodrugs can be
   very important. In this study, the antioxidant activity and HSA
   interaction of two Pd(II) complexes formulated as {[}(NeN)Pd(
   m-pr-dtc)Pd(NeN)](NO3) 2 (where pr-dtc is propylenbisdithiocarbamate,
   NeN are 2,2'-bipyridine for complex a, and 1,10 phenanthroline for
   complex b) were reported. Antioxidant activity of the Pd complexes
   against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radicals (DPPH) revealed that
   complexes have moderate antioxidant activity (IC50 = 790 mg L-1 for
   complex a and 1030 mg L-1 for complex b). The fluorescence spectra
   demonstrated that the quenching mechanism of HSA in the presence of the
   complexes was static quenching. The complex b (K-b = 1.23 x 10(4) M-1)
   had a tendency to HSA more than the complex a (K-b = 0.257 x 10(4) M-1).
   Thermodynamic parameters showed that hydrophobic interactions
   contributed to dominantly in the interaction process. The biophysical
   approaches, including UV-Vis spectra, CD spectroscopy, and FT-IR spectra
   confirmed the conformational changes in the structure of HSA in the
   presence of Pd complexes. Molecular dynamic and docking simulation
   disclosed that both complexes could interact with different residues on
   the surface of HSA. Theoretical results were supported by experimental
   evidence. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   knowledge-first approach}},
Journal = {{SYNTHESE}},
Abstract = {{In order for a reason to justify an action or attitude it must be one
   that is possessed by an agent. Knowledge-centric views of possession
   ground our possession of reasons, at least partially, either in our
   knowledge of them or in our being in a position to know them. On
   virtually all accounts, knowing P is some kind of non-accidental true
   belief that P. This entails that knowing P is a kind of non-accidental
   true representation that P. I outline a novel theory of the epistemic
   requirement on possession in terms of this more general state of
   non-accidental true representation. It is just as well placed to explain
   the motivations behind knowledge-centric views of possession, and it is
   also better placed to explain the extent of the reasons we possess in
   certain cases of deductive belief-updates and cases involving
   environmental luck. I conclude with three reflections. First, I indicate
   how my arguments generate a dilemma for Errol Lord's (2018a) view that
   possessing reasons is just a matter of being in a position to manifest
   one's knowledge how to use them. Second, I explain how my view can
   simultaneously manage cases of environmental luck without falling prey
   to lottery cases. Finally, I sketch the direction for a further range of
   counterexamples to knowledge-centric theories of possession.}},

Abstract = {{Werner Herzog, one of New German Cinema's auteur directors, often uses
   indigenous people's images, especially in his films The Wrath of God,
   Aguirre (1972), Enigma of Kasper Hauser (1974), Fitzcarraldo (1982),
   Burden of Dreams (1982), Ballad of the Little Soldier (1984), Where the
   Green Ants Dream (1984), and Cobra Verde (1987). The geographical
   regions from which the indigenous images in these films emerge are
   former colonial lands that have been the subject of European economic
   and cultural exploitation. In this study, indigenous images in Herzog
   films are examined through colonial and postcolonial perspectives and
   analysed in terms of their place in collective memory. The main argument
   of the study is that the colonial history of former colonial regions is
   at the centre of the director's films. Also, the Winnetou character of
   Karl May, an important popular image in German colonial history, is
   examined with reference to the concept of the `noble savage'. These
   films are analysed using the method of textual analysis. The main
   finding of the study is that the images created by the director in his
   films include rather than exclude colonial history.}},

Abstract = {{Background The role of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in improving outcomes
   following live donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is not well
   established. We designed a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled
   trial to study the role of NAC infusion in recipients undergoing LDLT.
   Methods We assigned 150 patients who underwent LDLT by
   computer-generated random sequence on 1:1 ratio to either NAC group or
   placebo group. Patients in the NAC group received NAC infusion which was
   started at beginning of graft implantation at an initial loading dose of
   150 mg/kg/h over 1 h, followed by 12.5 mg/kg/h for 4 h and then at 6.25
   mg/kg/h continued for 91 h. Placebo group received normal saline. The
   primary endpoint was composite occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI)
   and early allograft dysfunction (EAD) in the recipient. Secondary
   endpoints included levels of bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase
   (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine, INR, primary graft
   non-function, intraoperative bleeding, post-transplant hospital stay and
   in-hospital mortality. Results The composite endpoint did not show any
   significant difference between the NAC and placebo group (21.3\% vs
   29.3\%, p = 0.35). Peak AST (425.65 IU/L vs 702.24 IU/L, p = 0.02) and
   peak ALT (406.65 IU/L vs 677.99 IU/L, p = 0.01) levels were
   significantly lower in the study group. Time to normalization of
   transaminases was also significantly low in the study group. Conclusions
   Perioperative NAC infusion following LDLT resulted in significantly
   lower postoperative AST and ALT levels. Rapid normalization of
   transaminases was also observed. This, however, did not translate to
   improvement in AKI or EAD.}},

Abstract = {{LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 is considered as a promising Ni-rich layered cathode
   material of lithium-ion batteries due to low cost and high capacity.
   However, it is generally prepared by complicated precursor methods. In
   this work, LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 is synthesized by a solid-state method
   with manganese acetate as manganese source and an effective mixing way.
   The as-prepared samples are characterized by XRD, FESEM, XPS and
   electrochemical techniques. The results show that the synthesized
   LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 cathode materials have an alpha-NaFeO2 type
   structure with insignificant cation mixing, octahedral single crystal
   and quasi sphere morphology, smaller particle size and good dispersion,
   so that it displays an initial discharge capacity of 163.6 mAh g(-1)
   with a coulombic efficiency of 85.6\% at 0.1C, a capacity retention of
   99.1\% after 100 cycles at 0.5C and an excellent rate performance, and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Soil washing is commonly used to remediate PAHs contaminated sites.
   However, the effluent after washing containing PAHs and surfactant may
   cause secondary pollution and remediation cost is still high, unless
   PAHs are selectively removed from the effluent and the surfactant is
   recovered and recycled. Herein, ultraviolet irradiation (254 nm, UV-C)
   and its combination with peroxydisulfate (UV-C/PDS) were applied to
   selectively degrade PHE in the synthetic soil washing effluent. At
   natural pH of 8.6, 98.2 \% of PHE was removed within 30 min under 6 W
   UV-C irradiation. After adding 2 mM PDS, the time was shortened to 8 min
   but still achieving 98.7 \% PHE removal and less toxic treated effluent
   than UV-C alone. The O-1(2) was the main oxidizing species in UV-C alone
   system, while O-1(2) as well center dot OH and SO4 center dot- were
   responsible for PHE removal in the UV-C/PDS system. The possible
   intermediates of PHE degradation were recognized using liquid
   chromatography-mass spectrometry technique and the degradation pathways
   in both systems were proposed. Soil washing recycling experiments
   verified the recovered SDS could be reused directly without surfactant
   supplement and the soil washing efficiency changed insignificantly
   during three cycles. It indicates UV-C/PDS coupled with soil washing is
   a promising remediation technology.}},

Abstract = {{The development of high-performance electrochemical energy storage
   device is important for addressing energy shortage issues. As one of the
   next-generation energy storage devices, supercapacitor (SCs) material
   and their composite designs have gained increased attention in recent
   years. Herein, the CNT@MoS2/PDDA/PMo12 nanocomposite, was assembled via
   PDDA-assisted (PDDA is poly(dimethyldiallylammonium chloride)) synthesis
   strategy. The positively charged polyelectrolyte can interact with two
   negatively charged components, phosphomolybdic acid (PMo12) and CNT@MoS2
   (CNT referred to multi-walled carbon nanotubes, and MoS2 referred to
   molybdenum disulfide) through electrostatic interaction. PMo12 has
   uniformly attracted on the surface of the ultrathin MoS2
   nanosheetsmodified CNT, which endowed the nanocomposite with a fast
   electron transport efficiency, enrich charge storage and multi-electron
   transfer capabilities. As a symmetric supercapacitor system, this
   composite exhibited a high rate specific capacitance of 110 F g(-1) at
   0.5 A g(-1) and an energy density of 15.27 W h kg(-1) at a power density
   of 152 W kg(-1). Moreover, an excellent cycle performance with 89\%

Title = {{A photoelectrochemical aptasensor for the determination of bisphenol A
   based on the Cu (I) modified graphitic carbon nitride}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{400}},

Abstract = {{Bisphenol A (BPA) has been penetrating every corner of our daily life
   via the entities of children's toys, food containers and electronic
   equipment. The ubiquitous exposure of BPA urges the implementation of
   supervising its emission in environment. This work designs a method of
   photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensing for the determination of BPA
   based on the Cu(I) modified carbon nitride (Cu/g-C3N4). The Cu/g-C3N4
   was prepared by solvothermal reaction with the ionic liquid
   bis(1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium) tetrachlorocuprate (II) as Cu
   source. Cu/g-C3N4 displays excellent PEC performances due to the
   introduction of Cu(I). The visible light absorption capacity and
   conductivity of g-C3N4 can be enhanced by introducing Cu(I). With the
   help of BPA-binding aptamer immobilized on the surface of Cu/g-C3N4, the
   Cu/g-C3N4 PEC aptasensor has adopted for the determination of BPA. The
   PEC aptasensor exhibits a well-fitted linear correlation between the
   response photocurrent signal and the logarithm of the concentration of
   BPA. The PEC aptasensor shows a distinguished capability of BPA
   detection with a wide detection range of 5.00 x 10(-11) to 5.00 x 10(-5)
   g L-1 and low detection limit of 1.60 x 10(-11) g L-1 (at S/N = 3). This
   work provides a profound insight for detecting BPA in environmental

Title = {{A novel SLC37A4 missense mutation in GSD-Ib without hepatomegaly causes
   enhanced leukocytes endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR GENETICS \& GENOMIC MEDICINE}},
Abstract = {{Background: Glycogen storage disease (GSD) type Ib is an autosomal
   recessive disease caused by defects of glucose-6-phosphate transporter
   (G6PT), encoded by the SLC37A4 gene. To date, over 100 mutations have
   been revealed in the SLC37A4 gene. GSD-Ib patients manifest a metabolic
   phenotype of impaired blood glucose homeostasis and also carry the
   additional complications of neutropenia and myeloid dysfunction.
   Methods: Here, we present two daughters with an initial diagnosis of
   gout in a Chinese consanguineous family. Whole-exome sequencing was
   performed to identify the mutations. The mechanism of leukocytopenia was
   investigated.
   Results: Whole-exome sequencing analysis of the proband identified a
   novel homozygous p.P119L mutation in SLC37A4, leading to a diagnosis of
   GSD-Ib. We found that the potential pathogenic p.P119L mutation leads to
   an unusual phenotype characterized by gout at onset, and GSD-Ib arising
   from this variant also manifests multiple metabolic abnormalities,
   leukocytopenia, and anemia, but no hepatomegaly. The leukocytes from the
   proband showed increased mRNA levels of sXBP-1, BIP, and CHOP genes in
   the unfolded protein response pathway, and enhanced Bax mRNA and
   caspase-3 activity, which might contribute to leukocytopenia.
   Conclusion: Our findings broaden the variation spectrum of SLC37A4 and
   suggest no strict genotype-phenotype correlations in GSD-Ib patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background Among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and
   ventricular fibrillation, more than half present with refractory
   ventricular fibrillation unresponsive to initial standard advanced
   cardiac life support (ACLS) treatment. We did the first randomised
   clinical trial in the USA of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
   (ECMO)-facilitated resuscitation versus standard ACLS treatment in
   patients with OHCA and refractory ventricular fibrillation.
   Methods For this phase 2, single centre, open-label, adaptive, safety
   and efficacy randomised clinical trial, we included adults aged 18-75
   years presenting to the University of Minnesota Medical Center (MN, USA)
   with OHCA and refractory ventricular fibrillation, no return of
   spontaneous circulation after three shocks, automated cardiopulmonary
   resuscitation with a Lund University Cardiac Arrest System, and
   estimated transfer time shorter than 30 min. Patients were randomly
   assigned to early ECMO-facilitated resuscitation or standard ACLS
   treatment on hospital arrival by use of a secure schedule generated with
   permuted blocks of randomly varying block sizes. Allocation concealment
   was achieved by use of a randomisation schedule that required scratching
   off an opaque layer to reveal assignment. The primary outcome was
   survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes were safety,
   survival, and functional assessment at hospital discharge and at 3
   months and 6 months after discharge. All analyses were done on an
   intention-to-treat basis. The study qualified for exception from
   informed consent (21 Code of Federal Regulations 50.24). The ARREST
   trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03880565.
   Findings Between Aug 8, 2019, and June 14, 2020, 36 patients were
   assessed for inclusion. After exclusion of six patients, 30 were
   randomly assigned to standard ACLS treatment (n=15) or to early
   ECMO-facilitated resuscitation (n=15). One patient in the
   ECMO-facilitated resuscitation group withdrew from the study before
   discharge. The mean age was 59 years (range 36-73), and 25 (83\%) of 30
   patients were men. Survival to hospital discharge was observed in one
   (7\%) of 15 patients (95\% credible interval 1.6-30.2) in the standard
   ACLS treatment group versus six (43\%) of 14 patients (21.3-67.7) in the
   early ECMO-facilitated resuscitation group (risk difference 36.2\%,
   3.7-59.2; posterior probability of ECMO superiority 0.9861). The study
   was terminated at the first preplanned interim analysis by the National
   Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute after unanimous recommendation from the
   Data Safety Monitoring Board after enrolling 30 patients because the
   posterior probability of ECMO superiority exceeded the prespecified
   monitoring boundary. Cumulative 6-month survival was significantly
   better in the early ECMO group than in the standard ACLS group. No
   unanticipated serious adverse events were observed.
   Interpretation Early ECMO-facilitated resuscitation for patients with
   OHCA and refractory ventricular fibrillation significantly improved
   survival to hospital discharge compared with standard ACLS treatment.

Abstract = {{Background: The present study aims to identify the underlying genetic
   defects in a Chinese family with autosomal dominant congenital cataracts
   (ADCC).
   Methods: Detailed family histories and clinical data were recorded.
   Targeted exome sequencing of 54 known cataract-associated genes combined
   with high-throughput next-generation sequencing was conducted followed
   by Sanger sequencing and bioinformatic analysis to identify the
   causative gene lesion for the family.
   Results: A four-generation Chinese family with posterior pole type
   cataract were enrolled. Enrichment of targeted genes revealed a new
   heterozygous p.X176Y mutation in the stop codon of alpha B-crystallin
   (CRYAB) gene, which resulted in the loss of the stop codon and
   prolongation of the mutant protein by 19 amino acid residues
   (p.X176Yfs19{*}). Sanger sequencing showed complete co-segregation with
   the disease. The elongated mutant protein was predicted to be pathogenic
   by forming new alpha-helix and random-coil in the secondary structure as
   well as producing an extended strand in the tertiary structure,
   potentially leading to increased hydrophobicity and reduced protein
   stability.
   Conclusions: Our report added a new mutation in the spectrum of
   congenital cataracts. The data suggested that X176 residue in the
   COOH-terminal is of crucial importance for the alpha B-crystallin
   protein function which was valuable for further study of the
   pathogenesis of congenital cataracts.}},

Abstract = {{In the era of technological innovation, some companies own similar
   patent assets but capture different profits. The paper aims to explore
   whether and why there are different effects of patent assets on firm
   performance across industries. The listed corporations in the Growth
   Enterprises Market (GEM) of Shenzhen Stock Exchange, China, are taken as
   samples, which are categorised as three industries: the
   technology-intensive industry, capital-intensive industry, and
   labour-intensive industry, in light of the production factors. Moreover,
   the multiple stepwise regression and the fixed effects model are
   utilised. This paper highlights the effects of patent assets on firm
   performance are different across industries. Patent quality strongly
   influences firm performance in the technology-intensive industry, while
   patent count increases firm performance in the capital-intensive
   industry and labour-intensive industries. Notably, technological
   knowledge stock owned by companies plays a moderating role in
   influencing patent assets on firm performance in the
   technology-intensive industry. Our findings enrich the research on
   patent assets influencing financial performance from the industrial
   difference perspective and suggest that companies in different
   industries should take differentiated patent strategies to improve firm
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{A big challenge in practical water splitting is the sluggish reaction
   kinetics at high current densities that essentially requires efficient
   electrocatalysts to lower the overpotentials. While exciting progress
   has been made in noble metal-based catalysts, earth-abundant materials
   that can actively catalyze the water splitting at high current densities
   (e.g. >= 500 mA cm(-2)) are rare. In this work, we show that a rational
   design of the catalysts could promote the charge transfer, facilitate
   the gas release, as well as boost the surface active sites, and
   therefore significantly enhance the electrocatalytic activity toward
   both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction
   (OER). Using NiCo/NiCo-OH and NiFe/NiFe-OH as examples, we achieved
   ultralow overpotentials of 184 and 296 mV at 500 mA cm(-2) in 1M KOH for
   HER and OER, respectively. More importantly, the alkaline electrolyzer
   based on these two materials is able to actively drive the overall water
   splitting at 1000 mA cm(-2) for at least 300 h at a low cell voltage
   without significant performance decay, which is much superior to the
   state-of-the-art 20 \% Pt/C parallel to RuO2 combination. Our work
   points out a promising pathway to achieve inexpensive electrocatalysts
   for practical water splitting at high currents.}},

Abstract = {{Drought stress is one of the major abiotic stresses affecting lint yield
   and fibre quality in cotton. With increase in population, degrading
   natural resources and frequent drought occurrences, development of high
   yielding, drought tolerant cotton cultivars is critical for sustainable
   cotton production across countries. Six Gossypium hirsutum genotypes
   identified for drought tolerance, wider adaptability and better fibre
   quality traits were characterized for various morpho-physiological and
   biochemical characters and their molecular basis was investigated under
   drought stress. Under drought conditions, genotypes revealed
   statistically significant differences for all the morpho-physiological
   and biochemical traits. The interaction (genotype x treatment) effects
   were highly significant for root length, excised leaf water loss and
   cell membrane thermostability indicating differential interaction of
   genotypes under control and stress conditions. Correlation studies
   revealed that under drought stress, relative water content had
   significant positive correlation with root length and root-to-shoot
   ratio while it had significant negative correlation with excised leaf
   water loss, epicuticular wax, proline, potassium and total soluble sugar
   content. Analysis of expression of fourteen drought stress related genes
   under water stress indicated that both ABA dependent and ABA independent
   mechanisms of drought tolerance might be operating differentially in the
   studied genotypes. IC325280 and LRA5166 exhibited ABA mediated
   expression of stress responsive genes and traits. Molecular basis of
   drought tolerance in IC357406, Suraj, IC259637 and CNH 28I genotypes
   could be attributed to ABA independent pathway. Based on physiological
   phenotyping, the genotypes IC325280 and IC357406 were identified to
   possess better root traits and LRA5166 was found to have enhanced
   cellular level tolerance. Variety Suraj exhibited good osmotic
   adjustment and better root traits to withstand water stress. The
   identified drought component trait(s) in specific genotypes would pave
   way for their pyramiding through marker assisted cotton breeding.}},

Abstract = {{Breast cancer metastasis occurs via blood and lymphatic vessels. Breast
   cancer cells `educate' lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) to support
   tumor vascularization and growth. However, despite known metabolic
   alterations in breast cancer, it remains unclear how lymphatic
   endothelial cell metabolism is altered in the tumor microenvironment and
   its effect in lymphangiogenic signaling in LECs. We analyzed metabolites
   inside LECs in co-culture with MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and SK-BR-3 breast
   cancer cell lines using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
   metabolomics, Seahorse, and the spatial distribution of metabolic
   co-enzymes using optical redox ratio imaging to describe breast
   cancer-LEC metabolic crosstalk. LECs co-cultured with breast cancer
   cells exhibited cell-line dependent altered metabolic profiles,
   including significant changes in lactate concentration in breast cancer
   co-culture. Cell metabolic phenotype analysis using Seahorse showed LECs
   in co-culture exhibited reduced mitochondrial respiration, increased
   reliance on glycolysis and reduced metabolic flexibility. Optical redox
   ratio measurements revealed reduced NAD(P)H levels in LECs potentially
   due to increased NAD(P)H utilization to maintain redox homeostasis.
   13C-labeled glucose experiments did not reveal lactate shuttling into
   LECs from breast cancer cells, yet showed other 13C signals in LECs
   suggesting internalized metabolites and metabolic exchange between the
   two cell types. We also determined that breast cancer co-culture
   stimulated lymphangiogenic signaling in LECs, yet activation was not
   stimulated by lactate alone. Increased lymphangiogenic signaling
   suggests paracrine signaling between LECs and breast cancer cells which
   could have a pro-metastatic role.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The aim of this EANM / SNMMI Practice Guideline with ESTRO
   endorsement is to provide general information and specific
   considerations about {[}F-18]FDG PET/CT in advanced uterine cervical
   cancer for external beam radiotherapy planning with emphasis on staging
   and target definition, mostly in FIGO stages IB3-IVA and IVB, treated
   with curative intention. Methods Guidelines from related fields,
   relevant literature and leading experts have been consulted during the
   development of this guideline. As this field is rapidly evolving, this
   guideline cannot be seen as definitive, nor is it a summary of all
   existing protocols. Local variations should be taken into consideration
   when applying this guideline. Conclusion The background, common clinical
   indications, qualifications and responsibilities of personnel, procedure
   / specifications of the examination, documentation / reporting and
   equipment specifications, quality control and radiation safety in
   imaging is discussed with an emphasis on the multidisciplinary approach.}},

   compact disc for extended drug release}},
Journal = {{SN APPLIED SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{An erodible polyamide 6,10 based drug carrier was fabricated for
   continuous, extended release of a model hydrophilic drug, amitriptyline
   hydrochloride. The developed polyamide-based drug loaded compact disc
   was stable, semi-crystalline, mechanically robust and demonstrated the
   potential to prolong drug release while displaying controlled in vitro
   matrix erosion that was quantified as gravimetric matrix loss and
   changes in conductivity potential. 14.06\%w/w of amitriptyline
   hydrochloride content was released over a 30-day period. A zero-order,
   linear mathematical fitting of the drug release profile predicted a
   100\% release in approximately 240 days. Drug release kinetics was
   predicted to be zero order and regulated more by matrix relaxation than
   Fickian diffusion. The synthesized polyamide compact disc was identified
   as being physicochemically stable and physicomechanically robust. In
   conclusion, the preliminary in vitro data generated serves as
   proof-of-concept that the polyamide-based disc can potentially function
   as a useful polymeric biomaterial for designing extended release,
   erodible drug carriers.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of intimate partner violence survivors tell at least one
   person about the abuse, and the reactions of these support providers can
   have a profound impact on survivors' recovery. In recent years, the
   Social Reactions Questionnaire (SRQ) has become the predominant measure
   of social reactions toward intimate partner violence survivors, but the
   SRQ was developed based on the experiences of sexual assault survivors
   only. To determine how well intimate partner violence survivors'
   descriptions of social reactions from informal support providers align
   with constructs in the SRQ, we examined qualitative interview data about
   survivors' interactions with informal support providers obtained from a
   larger study with 113 female survivors of intimate partner violence.
   Excerpts were coded inductively, and a total of 12 types of social
   reactions emerged. Seven of these social reactions aligned with existing
   social reactions in the SRQ: (a) emotional support, (b) tangible aid,
   (c) blame, (d) took control, (e) treated differently, (f) egocentric
   reactions, and (g) distraction. An additional six reactions emerged as
   separate constructs, including (h) minimization, (i) told to leave, (j)
   advice, (k) interventions, and (l) indifference. These findings
   highlight the need for direct interventions with friends and family
   members to improve social reactions toward intimate partner violence
   survivors.}},

Title = {{Induction of Lactation After Adoption in a Muslim Mother With History of
   Breast Cancer: A Case Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HUMAN LACTATION}},
Abstract = {{Introduction
   With the prevalence of infertility increasing worldwide, many are
   seeking adoption to fulfill the need to start or expand their family.
   However, one of the challenges mothers face is the lack of the early
   maternal bond with the adopted infant, which typically starts during
   pregnancy, and then continues after birth, while providing care and
   nourishment to the infant. Breastfeeding is proven to strengthen the
   maternal-infant bond and provides numerous benefits to the dyad. Reports
   of induced lactation in non-biological mothers are uncommon, they are
   even more uncommon to find in women with a history of breast cancer.
   Main issue
   The induction of lactation in a Muslim adoptive mother who had a history
   of breast cancer.
   Management
   Pharmacologic methods, which included galactagogues Domperidone and
   fenugreek, in addition to non-pharmacologic methods that included breast
   stimulation by using a breast pump. The participant was able to provide
   her own milk for her adopted infant.
   Conclusion
   When provided with proper support, an adopting mother with a history of
   breast radiation was able to breastfeed. The participant's need to
   provide her own expressed milk was met; although, she was counseled on
   the possibility that her milk production will most likely not be
   sufficient to entirely meet the infant's needs. Determination and
   support definitely have a role in cases where the influence of past
   treatment on human milk production is not known.}},

Title = {{First-Principle Studies of Istradefylline with Emphasis on the
   Stability, Reactivity, Interactions and Wavefunction-Dependent
   Properties}},
Journal = {{POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC COMPOUNDS}},
Abstract = {{Dermal fibrosis and Parkinson's disease are two chronic syndromes
   affecting a large population leading to systematic morbidity. The
   mechanisms of these diseases are well debated, and many medicines are in
   the market for managing them. Recently, istradefylline was approved by
   the FDA as a medicine for the management of aforesaid disorders. But the
   detailed structure and reactivity profile of this compound was not
   reported. We use molecular modeling using density functional theory
   (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) methods
   using B3LYP/CAM-B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ level to study the structure,
   reactivity and other physicochemical properties of this compound.
   Conformational analysis over two dihedral angles was discussed. The
   compound was found to be an ideal candidate for being used as an NLO
   material. Molar refractivity was found to be 13.19 times greater than
   urea and 2.61 times greater than p-nitro acetanilide. TD-DFT indicated
   that the compound shows excellent light-harvesting efficiency of 94.21
   in the near UV region of 337.23 nm. We also report several
   wavefunction-based properties such as molecular electrostatic potential,
   localized orbital locator, average local ionization energy, local
   information entropy and electron localized function. Using MESP, LIE,
   LOL, etc., information entropy studies showed that the molecule is
   stable with low uncertainty electrons in spatial distribution. These
   studies are useful for future experimental studies involving
   istradefylline and will assist in the design and prediction of the
   activity of new derivatives from this compound.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce an improved form for the anisotropic hydrodynamics
   distribution function which explicitly takes into account the
   free-streaming and equilibrating contributions separately. We
   demonstrate that with this improvement one can better reproduce exact
   results available in the literature for the evolution of moments of the
   distribution function, in particular, for moments which contain no
   powers of the longitudinal momentum in their definition (m = 0 moments).
   Using the resulting dynamical equations, we extract the non-equilibrium
   attractor associated with our improved anisotropic hydrodynamics ansatz
   and demonstrate that the improvement also allows one to better reproduce
   the exact dynamical attractor obtained using kinetic theory in the
   relaxation time approximation, particularly at early rescaled times and

Title = {{Identification of Differentially Expressed Drought-Responsive Genes in
   Guar {[}Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taub]}},

Abstract = {{Drought remains one of the most serious environmental stresses because
   of the continuous reduction in soil moisture, which requires the
   improvement of crops with features such as drought tolerance. Guar
   {[}Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taub], a forage and industrial crop, is
   a nonthirsty plant. However, the information on the transcriptome
   changes that occur under drought stress in guar is very limited;
   therefore, a gene expression analysis is necessary in this context.
   Here, we studied the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response
   to drought stress and their metabolic pathways. RNA-Seq via an
   expectation-maximization algorithm was used to estimate gene abundance.
   Subsequently, an Empirical Analysis of Digital Gene Expression Data in
   the R Bioconductor package was used to identify DEGs. Blast2GO,
   InterProScan, and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes were used
   to explore functional annotation, protein analysis, enzymes, and
   metabolic pathways. Transcription factors were identified using the
   PlantTFDB database. Our study identified 499 upregulated and 191
   downregulated genes in response to drought stress. Of those, 32
   upregulated and six downregulated genes were deemed as novel genes
   exclusive to guar. An aggregate of 137 protein families, 306 domains, 12
   repeats, and two sites were upregulated. The proton-dependent
   oligopeptide transporter family and transferase, aquaporin transporter,
   calcium/calmodulin-dependent/calcium-dependent protein kinase, aspartic
   peptidase A1 family, UDP-glucuronosyl/UDP-glucosyltransferase, and major
   intrinsic protein were the most upregulated protein families. The
   upregulated unigenes were associated with 88 enzymes and 77 KEGG
   pathways. Finally, the MYB-related, MYB, and ERF transcription factor
   families were upregulated. These data may be useful for understanding
   the plant molecular response to drought stress.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring volcanic activity along the submarine volcanoes that are
   usually induced by subsurface magmatism is a challenge. We present fresh
   set of Ocean Bottom Seismometer (OBS) data that shows geophysical
   evidence indicative of subsurface magmatism along the submarine
   volcanoes in the off Nicobar region, Andaman Sea. In this region, we
   observed for the first time, hybrid very long-period earthquakes
   documented by passive OBS experiment. These events were initiated by
   high-frequency (5-10 Hz) with a clear onset of P-phase followed by
   low-frequency (0.01-0.5 Hz) oscillations in the range of 300-600 s with
   a prominent high-frequency (10-40 Hz) hydro-acoustic phase. A total of
   141 high-frequency events were detected on 21st and 22nd March 2014 out
   of which 71 were of low-frequency oscillations. These events are
   distributed in the northwest-southeast direction along the submarine
   volcanic arc and Seulimeum strand of Great Sumatra fault. Off Nicobar
   region has been witnessing frequent earthquake swarms since 26th
   December 2004 tsunamigenic Sumatra earthquake. These swarms occurred in
   January 2005, March and October 2014, November 2015 and March 2019. The
   occurrence of low-frequency earthquakes and prominent hydro-acoustic
   phase are suggestive of sub-surface tectonic and magmatic influence. We
   propose that upward movement of magma pulses from deeper magma reservoir
   to the shallow magma chamber activated the strike-slip movement of
   sliver faults and induced earthquake swarms in the off Nicobar region.}},

Abstract = {{The possible action of polyphenolic compounds in the reduction of
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial toxicity may suggest
   them as putative agents for the treatment of drug-induced mitochondrial
   dysfunction and cardiotoxicity. This study was designed to explore
   protective effect of ellagic acid (EA) against celecoxib-induced
   cellular and mitochondrial toxicity in cardiomyocytes and their isolated
   mitochondria. In order to do this, isolated cardiomyocytes and
   mitochondria were pretreated with 3 different concentrations of EA (10,
   50 and 100 mu M), after which celecoxib (16 mu g/ml) was added to
   promote deleterious effects on cells and mitochondria. Using flow
   cytometry and biochemical methods, the parameters of cellular and
   mitochondrial toxicity were investigated. Our results showed that
   celecoxib (16 mu g/ml) caused a significant decrease in cell viability,
   mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), glutathione (GSH) in intact
   cardiomyocytes and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, MMP collapse,
   and mitochondrial swelling, and a significant increase in reactive
   oxygen species (ROS) formation, lipid peroxidation (LP) and oxidative
   stress in isolated mitochondria. Also, our results revealed that
   co-administration of EA (50 and 100 mu M) with celecoxib significantly
   attenuated the cellular and mitochondrial toxicity effects. In this
   study, we showed that simultaneous treatment with of EA ameliorated the
   cellular and mitochondrial toxicity induced by celecoxib, with
   cardiomyocytes presenting normal activity compared to the control group,
   and mitochondria retaining their normal activity.}},

Title = {{The antinomies of Ernesto Laclau: a reassessment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES}},
Abstract = {{This article provides an internal assessment of Ernesto Laclau's theory
   of populism. While critiques of Laclau have been made from a variety of
   traditions, few scholars have sought to work through the contradictions
   of his thought on internal terms. This article identifies some key
   antinomies in Laclau's oeuvre and hints at some redemptive strategies.
   It starts with a short summary of Laclau's conception of populism in
   contextual and conceptual fashion. Subsequently, four possible deficits
   of Laclau's theory are examined, ranging from a tension between
   verticality and horizontality, an ahistorical dimension, a descriptive
   and normative hyperformalism, and the lack of a reflexive approach to
   the term `populism' itself. The article finishes with a fresh research
   agenda for `post-Laclauian' theories of populism.}},

Abstract = {{Homeobox transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR), has been associated with
   neuroprotective effects in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the
   underlying mechanisms still remain unclear. Hence, this present study
   attempted to clarify the functional relevance of HOTAIR in PD. We
   established an in vivo mouse model of PD using
   1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and an in vitro cell
   model of PD by treating dopaminergic neuron MN9D cells with
   1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium species (MPP+). The expressions of
   somatostatin receptor 1 (SSTR1) and HOTAIR were altered to examine their
   effects on MN9D cell viability and apoptosis, as well as on movement
   impairments in MPTP-induced PD mouse model. The results indicated that
   HOTAIR expression was upregulated and SSTR1 was downregulated in in vivo
   and in vitro PD models. HOTAIR could bind to the promoter region of
   SSTR1, resulting in an increase of SSTR1 methylation through the
   recruitment of DNA methyltransferases in PD cell models. Notably,
   overexpression of HOTAIR and silencing of SSTR1 enhanced dopaminergic
   neuron apoptosis in MN9D cells and exacerbated dyskinesia in
   MPTP-induced PD mouse model. Collectively, overexpressed HOTAIR
   stimulates DNA methylation of SSTR1 to reduce SSTR1 expression, thereby
   accelerating dyskinesia and facilitating dopaminergic neuron apoptosis
   in a MPTP-lesioned PD mouse model via activation of the ERK1/2 axis.}},

   Trials}},
Journal = {{EMERGENCY MEDICINE INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy and safety
   of prone versus supine position ventilation for adult acute respiratory
   distress syndrome (ARDS) patients. The electronic databases of PubMed,
   Embase, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched from their
   inception up to September 2020. The relative risks (RRs) and weighted
   mean differences (WMDs) with corresponding 95\% confidence intervals
   (CIs) were employed to calculate pooled outcomes using the
   random-effects models. Twelve randomized controlled trials that had
   recruited a total of 2264 adults with ARDS were selected for the final
   meta-analysis. The risk of mortality in patients who received prone
   position ventilation was 13\% lower than for those who received supine
   ventilation, but this effect was not statistically significant (RR:
   0.87; 95\% CI: 0.75-1.00; P = 0.055). There were no significant
   differences between prone and supine position ventilation on the
   duration of mechanical ventilation (WMD: -0.22; P = 0.883) or ICU stays
   (WMD: -0.39; P = 0.738). The pooled RRs indicate that patients who
   received prone position ventilation had increased incidence of pressure
   scores (RR: 1.23; P = 0.003), displacement of a thoracotomy tube (RR:
   3.14; P = 0.047), and endotracheal tube obstruction (RR: 2.45; P =
   0.001). The results indicated that prone positioning during ventilation
   might have a beneficial effect on mortality, though incidence of several
   adverse events was significantly increased for these patients.}},

Abstract = {{Lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are characterized by the
   presence of dysplasia, low bone marrow blast percentage, low number and
   depth of cytopenia(s), and relatively good-risk karyotpic and molecular
   abnormalities. A score of <= 3.5 on the Revised International Prognostic
   Scoring System classifies patients as lower-risk MDS. Information from a
   mutational profile of the MDS at time of diagnosis (and over serial time
   points) can be reassuring for predicted behavior of lower-risk MDS
   compared with one expected to progress more rapidly (higher-risk MDS).
   Supportive care continues to be the crux of treatment, although the
   options to reduce transfusion needs have improved in 2020.
   Erythropoiesis stimulating agents, lenalidomide, and luspatercept
   address the most frequent (and symptomatic) cytopenia (anemia) and are
   started only when patients are transfusion dependent. Patients can
   derive long-term benefits (years) from these approaches but will often
   progress to higher-risk MDS. Interestingly, some patients with
   lower-risk MDS can present with an isolated thrombocytopenia for which
   thrombopoietin receptor analogs such as romiplostim and eltrombopag are
   options (as long as blast counts are low). The presence of pancytopenia
   and or intensifying and unremitting clinical symptoms are often treated
   with hypomethylating agents or (anti-thymocyte globulin if hypocellular
   MDS is of concern). Targeted therapies are emerging for small subsets of
   MDS patients with specific somatic mutations (ie, TP53, IDH1/2, FLT3),
   although currently, there are no approved, mutation-directed medications
   to treat MDS.}},

Title = {{High levels of glucose alter Physcomitrella patens metabolism and
   trigger a differential proteomic response}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Sugars act not only as substrates for plant metabolism, but also have a
   pivotal role in signaling pathways. Glucose signaling has been widely
   studied in the vascular plant Arabidopsis thaliana, but it has remained
   unexplored in non-vascular species such as Physcomitrella patens. To
   investigate P. patens response to high glucose treatment, we explored
   the dynamic changes in metabolism and protein population by applying a
   metabolomic fingerprint analysis (DIESI-MS), carbohydrate and
   chlorophyll quantification, Fv/Fm determination and label-free
   untargeted proteomics. Glucose feeding causes specific changes in P.
   patens metabolomic fingerprint, carbohydrate contents and protein
   accumulation, which is clearly different from those of osmotically
   induced responses. The maximal rate of PSII was not affected although
   chlorophyll decreased in both treatments. The biological process,
   cellular component, and molecular function gene ontology (GO)
   classifications of the differentially expressed proteins indicate the
   translation process is the most represented category in response to
   glucose, followed by photosynthesis, cellular response to oxidative
   stress and protein refolding. Importantly, although several proteins
   have high fold changes, these proteins have no predicted identity. The
   most significant discovery of our study at the proteome level is that
   high glucose increase abundance of proteins related to the translation
   process, which was not previously evidenced in non-vascular plants,
   indicating that regulation by glucose at the translational level is a
   partially conserved response in both plant lineages. To our knowledge,
   this is the first time that metabolome fingerprint and proteomic
   analyses are performed after a high sugar treatment in non-vascular
   plants. These findings unravel evolutionarily shared and differential
   responses between vascular and non-vascular plants.}},

Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Using siRNAs to genetically manipulate immune cells is important to both
   basic immunological studies and therapeutic applications. However, siRNA
   delivery is challenging because primary immune cells are often sensitive
   to the delivery materials and generate immune responses. We have
   recently developed an amphiphilic dendrimer that is able to deliver
   siRNA to a variety of cells, including primary immune cells. We provide
   here a protocol for the synthesis of this dendrimer, as well as siRNA
   delivery to immune cells such as primary T and B cells, natural killer
   cells, macrophages, and primary microglia. The dendrimer synthesis
   entails straightforward click coupling followed by an amidation
   reaction, and the siRNA delivery protocol requires simple mixing of the
   siRNA and dendrimer in buffer, with subsequent application to the
   primary immune cells to achieve effective and functional siRNA delivery.
   This dendrimer-mediated siRNA delivery largely outperforms the standard
   electroporation technique, opening a new avenue for functional and
   therapeutic studies of the immune system. The whole protocol encompasses
   the dendrimer synthesis, which takes 10 days; the primary immune cell
   preparation, which takes 3-10 d, depending on the tissue source and cell
   type; the dendrimer-mediated siRNA delivery; and subsequent functional
   assays, which take an additional 3-6 d.
   Delivery of siRNAs to immune cells is challenging because of these
   cells' sensitivity to standard transfection reagents. This protocol
   describes how to synthesize an amphiphilic dendrimer and apply it to
   transfect siRNAs in a variety of primary immune cells.}},

Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   The aim of this work is to introduce the 2019 International Planning
   Competition and to analyze its results.
   Methods and materials
   A locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) case using the
   simultaneous integrated boost approach was selected. The plan quality
   was evaluated by using a ranking system in accordance with practice
   guidelines. Planners used their clinical Treatment Planning System (TPS)
   to generate the best possible plan along with a survey, designed to
   obtain medical physics aspects information. We investigated the quality
   of the large population of plans designed by worldwide planners using
   different planning and delivery systems. The correlations of plan
   quality with relevant planner characteristics (work experience,
   department scale, and competition experience) and with technological
   parameters (TPS and modality) were examined.
   Results
   The number of the qualified plans was 287 with a wide range of scores
   (38.61-97.99). The scores showed statistically significant differences
   by the following factors: 1) department scale: the mean score (89.76 +/-
   8.36) for planners from the departments treating >2,000 patients
   annually was the highest of all; 2) competition experience: the mean
   score for the 107 planners with previous competition experience was
   88.92 +/- 9.59, statistically significantly from first-time participants
   (p = .001); 3) techniques: the mean scores for planners using VMAT
   (89.18 +/- 6.43) and TOMO (90.62 +/- 7.60) were higher than those using
   IMRT (82.28 +/- 12.47), with statistical differences (p <.001). The plan
   scores were negligibly correlated with the planner's years of work
   experience or the type of TPS used. Regression analysis demonstrated
   that plan score was associated with dosimetric objectives that were
   difficult to achieve, which is generally consistent with a clinical
   practice evaluation. However, 51.2\% of the planners abandoned the
   difficult component of total lung receiving a dose of 5 Gy in their plan
   design to achieve the optimal plan.
   Conclusion
   The 2019 international planning competition was carried out
   successfully, and its results were analyzed. Plan quality was not
   correlated with work experiences or the TPS used, but it was correlated
   with department scale, modality, and competition experience. These
   findings differed from those reported in previous studies.}},

Abstract = {{Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are expressed at high levels in the brain and
   are involved in various central nervous system diseases. However, the
   potential role of circRNAs in ischemic stroke-associated neuronal injury
   remains largely unknown. Herein, we uncovered the function and
   underlying mechanism of the circRNA UCK2 (circUCK2) in ischemia stroke.
   The oxygen-glucose deprivation model in HT-22 cells was used to mimic
   ischemia stroke in vitro. Neuronal viability and apoptosis were
   determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays and TUNEL (terminal
   deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end
   labeling) staining, respectively. Middle cerebral artery occlusion was
   conducted to evaluate the function of circUCK2 in mice. The levels of
   circUCK2 were significantly decreased in brain tissues from a mouse
   model of focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. Upregulated circUCK2
   levels significantly decreased infarct volumes, attenuated neuronal
   injury, and improved neurological deficits. circUCK2 reduced oxygen
   glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced cell apoptosis by regulating
   transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)/mothers against
   decapentaplegic homolog 3 (Smad3) signaling. Furthermore, circUCK2
   functioned as an endogenous miR-125b-5p sponge to inhibit miR-125b-5p
   activity, resulting in an increase in growth differentiation factor 11
   (GDF11) expression and a subsequent amelioration of neuronal injury.
   Consequently, these findings showed that the circUCK2/miR-125b-5p/GDF11
   axis is an essential signaling pathway during ischemia stroke. Thus, the
   circRNA circUCK2 may serve as a potential target for novel treatment in
   patients with ischemic stroke.}},

Abstract = {{Adipocyte differentiation is a general physiological process that is
   also critical for metabolic syndrome. In spite of extensive study in the
   past two decades, adipogenesis is a still complex cellular process that
   is accompanied by complicated molecular mechanisms. Here, we performed
   SILAC-based quantitative global proteomic profiling of 3T3-L1 adipocyte
   differentiation. We report protein changes to the proteome profiles,
   with 354 proteins exhibiting significant increase and 56 proteins
   showing decrease in our statistical analysis. Our results show that
   adipocyte differentiation is involved not only in metabolic processes by
   increasing TCA cycle, fatty acid synthesis, lipolysis, acetyl-CoA
   production, antioxidants, and electron transport, but also in
   nicotinamide metabolism, cristae formation, mitochondrial protein
   import, and Ca2+ transport into mitochondria and ER. A search for
   Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP) using neXtprot
   highlighted one protein with a protein existence uncertain (PE5) and 17
   proteins as functionally uncharacterized protein existence 1 (uPE1).
   This study provides quantitative information on proteome changes in
   adipogenic differentiation, which is helpful in improving our
   understanding of the processes of adipogenesis.}},

Title = {{Tidal evolution of the Pluto-Charon binary}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{644}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{A giant collision is believed to be at the origin of the Pluto-Charon
   system. As a result, the initial orbit and spins after impact may have
   substantially differed from those observed today. More precisely, the
   distance at periapse may have been shorter, subsequently expanding to
   its current separation by tides raised simultaneously on the two bodies.
   Here we provide a general 3D model to study the tidal evolution of a
   binary composed of two triaxial bodies orbiting a central star. We apply
   this model to the Pluto-Charon binary, and notice some interesting
   constraints on the initial system. We observe that when the eccentricity
   evolves to high values, the presence of the Sun prevents Charon from
   escaping because of Lidov-Kozai cycles. However, for a high initial
   obliquity for Pluto or a spin-orbit capture of Charon's rotation, the
   binary eccentricity is damped very efficiently. As a result, the system
   can maintain a moderate eccentricity throughout its evolution, even for
   strong tidal dissipation on Pluto.}},

Title = {{Study of dye desorption mechanism of bone char utilizing different
   regenerating agents}},
Journal = {{SN APPLIED SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{The reactive blue BF-5G dye is used on the textile industry due to its
   bifunctional characteristic that enables a higher interaction between
   the dye and the fabric fibers. Nonetheless, the dyeing produces a high
   amount of wastewater and the removal of the dye with a regenerative
   adsorbent is an attractive cost-efficient process. Therefore, the aim of
   this work was to evaluate the desorption mechanism of the reactive blue
   BF-5G dye on bone char employing different regenerating agents at
   different pH conditions. Aqueous solutions with pH from 2 to 12 and
   alcoholic solutions of methyl, ethyl and isopropyl were used as
   regenerating agents in a batch system with constant temperature. The
   highest regeneration efficiency with water was at pH = 12 (similar to
   2.0\%) which was low due to alkaline conditions. The increase of
   negative charges on the surface of the bone char at pH = 12, generated
   electrostatic repulsion between the adsorbent and the dye, followed by
   its desorption. In addition, with increasing concentration of sodium
   hydroxide, the desorption efficiency is reduced due to the fact that Na+
   compensate the negative charge generated on the surface of the bone
   char. On the other hand, since dye desorption using organic regenerating
   agents is due to replacement of the dye molecules by an organic one, an
   increase in regeneration was observed. The highest regeneration
   efficiencies of similar to 21.0\% and 19.5\% were obtained using
   isopropyl and ethyl alcohols, respectively. These results indicate that
   the strong interactions between the dye and the bone char surface were
   not broken by the regenerating agents studied, thus achieving low dye
   desorption efficiency. Therefore, desorption efficiencies are related
   only to the regeneration of weaker interactions on bone char surfaces
   for these systems, in batch conditions.}},

Title = {{Targeting the eCIRP/TREM-1 interaction with a small molecule inhibitor
   improves cardiac dysfunction in neonatal sepsis}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Background Neonatal sepsis and the associated myocardial dysfunction
   remain a leading cause of infant mortality. Extracellular cold-inducible
   RNA-binding protein (eCIRP) acts as a ligand of triggering receptor
   expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1). M3 is a small CIRP-derived
   peptide that inhibits the eCIRP/TREM-1 interaction. We hypothesize that
   the eCIRP/TREM-1 interaction in cardiomyocytes contributes to
   sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction in neonatal sepsis, while M3 is
   cardioprotective. Methods Serum was collected from neonates in the
   Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). 5-7-day old C57BL/6 mouse pups were
   used in this study. Primary murine neonatal cardiomyocytes were
   stimulated with recombinant murine (rm) CIRP with M3. TREM-1 mRNA and
   supernatant cytokine levels were assayed. Mitochondrial oxidative
   stress, ROS, and membrane potential were assayed. Neonatal mice were
   injected with rmCIRP and speckle-tracking echocardiography was conducted
   to measure cardiac strain. Sepsis was induced by i.p. cecal slurry.
   Mouse pups were treated with M3 or vehicle. After 16 h, echocardiography
   was performed followed by euthanasia for tissue analysis. A 7-day
   survival study was conducted. Results Serum eCIRP levels were elevated
   in septic human neonates. rmCIRP stimulation of cardiomyocytes increased
   TREM-1 gene expression. Stimulation of cardiomyocytes with rmCIRP
   upregulated TNF-alpha and IL-6 in the supernatants, while this
   upregulation was inhibited by M3. Stimulation of cardiomyocytes with
   rmCIRP resulted in a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP)
   while M3 treatment returned MMP to near baseline. rmCIRP caused
   mitochondrial calcium overload; this was inhibited by M3. rmCIRP
   injection impaired longitudinal and radial cardiac strain. Sepsis
   resulted in cardiac dysfunction with a reduction in cardiac output and
   left ventricular end diastolic diameter. Both were improved by M3
   treatment. Treatment with M3 attenuated serum, cardiac, and pulmonary
   levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to vehicle-treated septic
   neonates. M3 dramatically increased sepsis survival. Conclusions
   Inhibition of eCIRP/TREM-1 interaction with M3 is cardioprotective,
   decreases inflammation, and improves survival in neonatal sepsis. Trial

Title = {{An asynchronous and task-based implementation of peridynamics utilizing
   HPX-the C++ standard library for parallelism and concurrency}},
Journal = {{SN APPLIED SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2}},

Abstract = {{On modern supercomputers, asynchronous many task systems are emerging to
   address the new architecture of computational nodes. Through this shift
   of increasing cores per node, a new programming model with focus on
   handling of the fine-grain parallelism with increasing amount of cores
   per computational node is needed. Asynchronous Many Task (AMT) run time
   systems represent a paradigm for addressing the fine-grain parallelism.
   They handle the increasing amount of threads per node and concurrency.
   HPX, a open source C++ standard library for parallelism and concurrency,
   is one AMT which is conforming to the C++ standard. Motivated by the
   impressive performance of asynchronous task-based parallelism through
   HPX to N-body problem and astrophysics simulation, in this work, we
   consider its application to the Peridynamics theory. Peridynamics is a
   non-local generalization of continuum mechanics tailored to address
   discontinuous displacement fields arising in fracture mechanics.
   Peridynamics requires considerable computing resources, owing to its
   non-local nature of formulation, offering a scope for improved computing
   performance via asynchronous task-based parallelism. Our results show
   that HPX-based peridynamic computation is scalable, and the scalability
   is in agreement with the theory. In addition to the scalability, we also
   show the validation results and the mesh convergence results. For the
   validation, we consider implicit time integration and compare the result
   with the classical continuum mechanics (CCM) (peridynamics under small
   deformation should give similar results as CCM). For the mesh
   convergence, we consider explicit time integration and show that the
   results are in agreement with theoretical claims in previous works.}},

Title = {{Application of a Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram to horses competing at
   5-star three-day-events: Comparison with performance}},
Journal = {{EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION}},
Abstract = {{A Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram (RHpE) was previously developed to
   facilitate the detection of musculoskeletal pain. The objectives were to
   apply the RHpE during warm-up for the dressage phase of two 5{*}
   three-day events and to correlate the RHpE scores with subsequent
   performance. It was hypothesised that there would be a higher rate of
   failure to complete the cross-country phase in horses which exhibited >=
   7 behaviours compared with those showing <7 behaviours. The RHpE,
   comprising 24 behaviours, was applied for 10-12 min during warm-up. Gait
   abnormalities in trot and canter were recorded. Dressage penalties,
   cross-country performance, showjumping penalties and final placings were
   documented. Horses were categorised as those which completed
   cross-country, or those which did not complete because of elimination or
   retirement. RHpE scores (n = 137) ranged from 0 to 9/24 (median 3
   {[}range 0-9] for nonlame horses; median 5 {[}range 1-9] for horses with
   gait abnormalities in trot or canter). There was a moderate correlation
   between dressage penalty scores and the RHpE score (rho = 0.4, P<0.001,
   Spearman rank). Fifty-nine per cent of horses (n = 10/17) with a RHpE
   score >= 7 failed to complete cross-country, compared with 33\% (n =
   39/117) with a score <7. Horses that failed to complete the
   cross-country phase had higher RHpE scores compared with those that
   completed (P = 0.04, W = 8.3, Kruskal-Wallis; pairwise comparison
   Bonferroni, P = 0.06). There was a significant (rho = 0.3) relationship
   between total RHpE score and final horse placings (n = 80, P<0.01,
   Spearman rank). Horses with lameness or gait abnormalities in canter had
   significantly higher RHpE scores (P<0.01, chi(2) = 35, chi-square test)
   compared with other horses. There was a strong correlation between the
   RHpE scores for horses which competed at both events (P<0.001, rho =
   0.6, Spearman rank). The RHpE should facilitate earlier identification
   of horses which may benefit from diagnosis and treatment, resulting in
   improvement in both performance and equine welfare.}},

Abstract = {{To date, the strongest predictor for dying with COVID-19 is suffering
   from several chronic disorders prior to the viral infection.
   Pre-existing multimorbidity is highly correlated with socioeconomic
   inequality. In turn, having several chronic conditions is closely linked
   to multiple medication intake, especially in richer countries with good
   access to biomedical care. Owing to its vertical structure, biomedicine
   often risks giving multiple treatments in an uncoordinated way. Such
   lack of integrated care can create complex forms of iatrogenic harm.
   Multimorbidity is often exacerbated by a pharmaceuticalization of social
   deprivation in place of integrated care. In this article, I explore the
   possibility that clusters of over-medication are a contributing factor
   to higher death rates from COVID-19, especially in poorer areas within
   richer countries. Anthropological perspectives on the social
   embeddedness of multimorbidity and multiple medication use can expand
   our understanding of who is most vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Poly(benzimidazole-benzophenanthroline) (BBL) is a ladder-type
   conjugated polymer showing remarkable charge transport properties. Upon
   doping it displays various conductive regimes, leading to two
   insulator-to-conductor transitions. Such transitions are never fully
   characterized, limiting understanding of its charged states. Open issues
   are: i) the electron/hole polaron relaxations, ii) the
   structure-function relationships of multiple redox states and their
   connection with the conductive regimes, and iii) the role of
   protonation. Such knowledge-gaps are tackled via a comprehensive
   computational investigation of multiple redox species. Polarons show
   polyradicaloid character, as revealed by combining broken-symmetry
   density functional theory, fragment orbital density, and multireference
   analysis. Electron/hole polaron relaxations occur on the polymer chain,
   the former localizing on the benzophenanthroline moieties, the latter on
   the benzimidazole units. Modeling of multiple charged species, up to one
   electron per repeat unit (1 eru), reveals a complex scenario of
   quasidegenerate states each featuring different spin multiplicity. Four
   redox states are responsible for the BBL insulator-to-conductor
   transitions. The two high conductive states refer to the electron
   polaron (0.25 eru) and the redox species with 0.75 eru. The insulating
   regimes refer to the bipolaron (0.50 eru) and the redox state with 1
   eru. Protonation is modeled, revealing polaron-like features in the
   spectroscopic properties.}},

Journal = {{HOUILLE BLANCHE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE L EAU}},
Year = {{2020}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{17-27}},

Abstract = {{The Real Collobrier hydrological observatory in southeastern France
   close to the Mediterranean coast, managed by Irstea since 1966,
   constitutes a benchmark site for regional hydro-climatology. Because of
   the dense network of stream gauges and raingauges available, this site
   provides a unique opportunity to evaluate long term hydro-meteorological
   Mediterranean trends. The vegetation is composed of forest mainly
   calcified on crystalline soils (maquis of heath, cork-oak, maritime pine
   and chestnut). Direct human influence has been negligible over the past
   50 years. The land use/land cover has remained almost unchanged, with
   the notable exception of a wildfire in 1990 that impacted a small
   sub-catchment. Therefore changes in the hydrological response of the
   catchments are caused by changes in climate and/or physical conditions.
   This study investigates changes in observational data using up to
   50-year daily series of precipitation and streamflow. The analysis used
   several climate indices describing distinct modes of variability, at
   inter-annual and seasonal time scales. Trends were assessed by the
   Mann-Kendall test. The analysis also used hydrological indices
   describing drought events based on daily data for a description of low
   flows, in particular in terms of timing and severity. The analysis shows
   that there is a marked tendency towards a decrease in the water
   resources of the Real Collobrier catchment in response to climate
   trends, with a increase in drought severity and duration. But the
   changes are variable among the sub-catchments according to their own
   hydrological functioning.}},

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{In the following I would like to expose Julian Culp's normative
   argumentation to some empirical considerations. My commentary focuses on
   one of the central premises of the book: Culp assumes that education can
   make a decisive contribution to solving the current challenges in plural
   and globalized societies. He states that recent political philosophy has
   unacceptably neglected the issue of education. But the book's aim is not
   the theoretical determination of education itself. Rather, Culp is
   concerned with the question of giving education the right normative
   foundation to solve the social, ecological and democratic challenges the
   globalized world is currently facing. I don't think that one can or
   should discuss and analyse education without normative considerations.
   Educational thinking cannot do without a normative foundation and it is
   helpful and necessary to reflect upon them philosophically. This is the
   central concern of the book, and there is nothing to be added to it by
   historians or educational researchers. But a purely normative approach
   runs the risk of repeating many of the problems inherent in educational
   thinking. I think that even a normative approach would gain a lot from
   taking the empirical and historical boundaries of its subject more
   seriously than Culp does. Therefore, most of my remarks are about the
   relationship between normative theory and historical realities.}},

Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{The present work focuses on the conditions required to understand
   time-dependent ultrafast charge migration in oriented and floppy chiral
   molecules. Ultrashort linearly polarized laser pulses are used to drive
   an ultrafast charge migration process by the excitation of a small
   number of low-lying excited states from the ground electronic state of
   R- and S-epoxypropane. Control over electron dynamics is achieved by
   choosing the different orientations of the linearly polarized pulse. For
   oriented and floppy molecules, we find that the charge migration is
   different for enantiomers when the polarization of the pulse lies in the
   mirror plane defining the enantiomer pair, or when it is strictly
   perpendicular to it. Ultimately the choice of polarization of the
   linearly polarized pulse determines the properties of the charge
   migration process in the chiral molecules, i.e., the direction of the
   electronic current densities.}},

Abstract = {{The identification of chronic pain and neuropathic pain as common
   contributors to the overall pain experience of patients with sickle cell
   disease (SCD) has altered the way we should evaluate difficult-to-treat
   pain. The recognition of these 2 entities is not generally routine among
   various medical specialties and provider levels that treat SCD. Due to
   the relative recency with which neuropathic pain was first described in
   SCD, validated assessment tools and evidence-based treatments remain
   lacking. Although clinical assessment and judgment must continue to
   inform all decision making in this understudied area of SCD pain
   management, a number of validated neuropathic pain assessment tools
   exist that can make possible a standardized evaluation process.
   Similarly, investigation of available neuropathic pain treatments for
   the uniquely complex pain phenotypes of SCD has only just begun and is
   better established in pain conditions other than SCD. The aim of this
   review is to briefly summarize the proposed basic pathophysiology,
   assessment, and treatment of neuropathic pain in patients with SCD.
   Furthermore, the aim of this review is to encourage an expanded
   framework for the assessment and treatment of SCD pain that appreciates
   the hidden complexities of this common complication of SCD.}},

Title = {{It's a question of talent! The interplay of design complexity and talent
   information on consumers' product design responses}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1338-1358}},
Month = {{MAY 11}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   Existing research on product design has found that a design's complexity
   is an important antecedent of consumers' aesthetic and behavioural
   responses. This paper aims to shed new light on the relationship between
   design complexity and perceptions of design quality by taking the
   effects of consumers' naive theories into account.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The hypotheses of this paper are tested in a series of three
   experiments.
   Findings
   The findings from three studies show that the extent to which consumers
   prefer more complex product designs to simpler ones depends on the
   extent to which they believe that the complexity of a design is
   indicative of the effort or of the talent of the designers involved in
   the design process. These competing naive theories, in turn, are
   triggered by contextual information that consumers have at their
   disposal, such as the professional background of a designer or the brand
   that is associated with a particular design.
   Research limitations/implications
   This research was limited to a design's complexity as the central design
   element and to the effects of two naive theories. Future research may
   also take other design factors and consumer heuristics into account.
   Practical implications
   This research reveals that the extent to which managers may successfully
   introduce both complex and simple designs may depend on the reputation
   of a company's designers and the prestige of a brand.
   Originality/value
   This research examines design complexity from a novel theoretical
   perspective and shows that the effect of design complexity on
   perceptions of design quality is contingent on two specific naive
   theories of consumers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a low-cost and fast method to evaluate gross alpha
   and beta (-) radioactivities in natural water based on an online
   high-purity germanium detector gamma measurement system. The major gamma
   activities in natural water are provided by natural and artificial
   radionuclides such as (40) K, Cs-137, and radionuclides belonging to
   U-238 and Th-232 series. The main alpha emitters related to gamma
   emissions in natural water are Ra-224 (240.98 keV) and Ra-226 (186.21
   keV), and the beta (-) emitters are (40) K (1460.85 keV), Bi-214 (609.31
   keV), Tl-208 (583.19 keV), and Pb-214 (351.93 keV). The formula for
   gross alpha and beta (-) activity concentration is based on these
   radionuclides, and the short half-life decay products are considered in
   the calculation. The detection efficiency of the device across energy
   region (0-3 MeV) is obtained through Monte Carlo simulation, and a
   calibration experiment is conducted to verify the simulation results.
   Gamma radioactivity is measured continuously for 114 d in Pixian County
   and Dongfeng Canal located in the Zouma River, Chengdu, Sichuan
   Province, China. A comparison of the calculation results and monitoring
   data from the Sichuan Management and Monitoring Center Station of
   Radioactive Environment indicates that the percentage and absolute error
   of alpha activity concentration is lower than 53\% and 0.02 Bq/L,
   respectively, and that of beta -activity concentration is lower than
   33.2\% and 0.016 Bq/L, respectively. The method can rapidly determine
   gross alpha and beta (-) activity concentrations in natural water
   online.}},

Title = {{Effects of different heat treatment and radiation (microwave and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FOOD PROCESSING AND PRESERVATION}},

Abstract = {{Milk is an animal-origin food with high nutritional value. After the
   milk is obtained, its composition is affected by the tools and equipment
   used (such as filter, holding tank) its environment and heat treatments
   applied to milk. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of
   different heat treatments on the concentration of certain minerals and
   heavy metals in milk. Raw cow's milk, pasteurized milk (control,
   microwave, and infrared-assisted microwave), and UHT milk samples were
   used in the study. Al, As, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fr, Mg, Na, Ni, P, Pb, Se, and Zn
   concentrations were investigated in these samples. Al and Ni
   concentrations of whole samples were statistically significant (p <
   .05). No significant differences have been found in terms of other heavy
   metal concentrations. Furthermore, there was no statistical difference
   between the pH values of the samples (p > .05). Both Al and Ni
   concentrations were found to be very low in infrared-assisted microwave
   applications. As a result, infrared-assisted microwave application
   revealed that the level of Al and Ni concentrations in milk was low.
   Besides, heavy metal toxicity can cause a variety of diseases in humans.
   Therefore, the effects of heavy metal levels below or above permitted
   limits in milk on human health were discussed in this study.
   Practical applications In our study, it was found that both Al and Ni
   concentrations were found to be very low in infrared-assisted microwave
   applications. There was no significant difference between applications
   in terms of the contents of other heavy metals and minerals. For all
   these reasons, it was concluded that infrared-assisted microwave
   application may be capable of reducing the danger of heavy metals such
   as Al and Ni concentrations in milk. Further research is needed on the
   subject.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial fluctuations of a superfluid flowing in a weak random

   demonstrate that the disorder-averaged nonequilibrium second-order

   the thermally averaged equilibrium counterpart of a uniform superfluid
   at an effective temperature. The physics behind this equivalence is that
   scattering of a moving condensate by disorder has the same effect on the
   correlation function as equilibrium thermal excitations. The correlation
   function exhibits an exponential decay in one dimension and a power-law
   decay in two dimensions. We show that the effective temperature can be

Title = {{Alloyed Palladium-Silver Nanowires Enabling Ultrastable Carbon Dioxide
   Reduction to Formate}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED MATERIALS}},
Abstract = {{Palladium can enable the electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate with
   nearly zero overpotential and good selectivity. However, it usually has
   very limited stability owing to CO poisoning from the side reaction
   intermediate. Herein, it is demonstrated that alloying palladium with
   silver is a viable strategy to significantly enhance the
   electrocatalytic stability. Palladium-silver alloy nanowires are
   prepared in aqueous solution with tunable chemical compositions, large
   aspect ratio, and roughened surfaces. Thanks to the unique synergy
   between palladium and silver, these nanowires exhibit outstanding
   electrocatalytic performances for selective formate production. Most
   remarkably, impressive long-term stability is measured even at < -0.4 V
   versus reversible hydrogen electrode where people previously believed
   that formate cannot be stably formed on palladium. Such stability
   results from the enhanced CO tolerance and selective stabilization of
   key reaction intermediates on alloy nanowires as supported by detailed
   electrochemical characterizations and theoretical computations.}},

Title = {{Treatment of non-sports related concussion in adolescents following an
   irritability algorithmic approach: a case series}},
Journal = {{PHYSIOTHERAPY THEORY AND PRACTICE}},
Abstract = {{Background: Concussion management evidence supports the efficacy of
   gradual active rehabilitation for return to sport in adolescents,
   however there is paucity of evidence for non-sports-related concussion
   management.
   Purpose: The purpose of this case series is to describe the feasibility
   and practicality of an irritability-based step-by-step model to guide
   rehabilitation.
   Case Descriptions: Three adolescent patients diagnosed with concussion
   during a non-sports related event are described. Each adolescent was
   classified as high, moderate, or low irritability level based on symptom
   exacerbation with Vestibular/Ocular-Motor Screening (VOMS), physical
   exertion based on age-predicted maximum heart rate, and cervicogenic
   factors. Each Patient's intervention was progressed following the
   proposed irritability-based algorithm.
   Outcomes: Patients were assessed using the Brain Injury Functional
   Status Patient-Reported Outcome Measure, VOMS testing, and a Numeric
   Pain Rating Scale. Concluding each plan of care, all patients met or
   exceeded the minimal clinically important difference for age, gender,
   and risk-adjusted predicted measure on all outcome assessments. All
   patients returned to school and age-appropriate activities without
   symptom exacerbation.
   Conclusion: An irritability-based algorithm model for non-sports-related
   concussion management may be a practical and feasible treatment approach
   for adolescents.}},

   model study}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{We theoretically investigate the polariton-polariton interaction in
   microcavities beyond the commonly used Born approximation (i.e., mean
   field), by adopting a toy model with a contact interaction to
   approximately describe the attraction between electrons and holes in
   quantum well and by using a Gaussian pair fluctuation theory beyond mean
   field. We obtain a density or chemical potential independent
   polariton-polariton interaction strength even in two dimensions, which
   result from coupling to the photon field. We show that quantum
   fluctuations lead to about a factor of 2 reduction in the
   polariton-polariton interaction strength within our toy model. Together
   with corrections to the 1 s exciton approximation at very strong
   light-matter coupling, we find the polariton-polariton interaction
   strength under typical experimental conditions is overestimated by a
   factor of 3 in the widely used theories, if our toy model can
   qualitatively simulate the polariton interaction in GaAs quantum wells.
   We compare our prediction with the most recent measurement and argue
   that the beyond-Born-approximation effect to the polariton-polariton
   interaction strength is crucial for a quantitative understanding of the
   experimental data by Estrecho et al. {[}Phys. Rev. B 100, 035306

Abstract = {{Introduction: Partial nephrectomy (PN) has evolved into the surgical
   standard of care for localized renal lesions. Hemostatic agents (HA)
   support the surgeon in achieving local hemostasis during PN. We
   previously reported initial results with the HA Hemopatch(R) in PN. We
   now report our experiences with Hemopatch(R) in a larger and more
   challenging single-surgeon PN cohort.
   Methods: Our study included 45 patients who underwent PN due to
   suspicious renal lesions between December 2013 and March 2018. All
   surgeries were performed by a single surgeon using the HA Hemopatch(R).
   Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative parameters were
   assessed.
   Results: Preoperative median tumor diameter was 27 mm. Median PADUA and
   RENAL nephrometry scores were 7 and 6, respectively. In 13.3\% of the
   cases an additional HA was applied. Intraoperative and postoperative
   bleeding occurred in 2.2\% and 8.9\%, respectively. Median total blood
   loss was 200 ml. Urgent pedicle clamping due to bleeding was necessary
   in 2 (4.4\%) patients. The transfusion rate was 8.9\%. There were no
   conversions.
   Conclusion: We confirmed our initial results demonstrating feasibility
   and reliability of Hemopatch(R) during PN. Notably, the cohort consists
   of selected patients. Prospective randomized studies are needed for
   comparison of different types of HA with regard to perioperative
   outcome.}},

Title = {{Measuring instructors continued intention to reuse Google Classroom in
   Iraq: a mixed-method study during COVID-19}},
Journal = {{INTERACTIVE TECHNOLOGY AND SMART EDUCATION}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   The use of learning management systems (LMSs) such as Google Classroom
   has increased significantly in higher education institutes during the
   COVID-19 pandemic. However, only a few studies have investigated
   instructors' continued intention to reuse LMS. The purpose of this study
   is to investigate the factors that influence instructors' intention to
   reuse an LMS in higher education institutes.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This study adopted a mixed-method research design. In the quantitative
   section, an integrated model of technology acceptance model and
   information system success model is proposed to explore the effects of
   system quality, service quality, information quality, perceived ease of
   use and perceived usefulness on instructors' satisfaction and how their
   satisfaction will influence their intention to reuse Google Classroom in
   the future. In the qualitative section, to gain more understanding,
   instructors were asked to identify the challenges that inhibit the
   adoption of e-Learning technologies in public universities in Iraq and
   what are their recommendations to rectify them.
   Findings
   The findings revealed that service quality had no positive influences on
   the satisfaction of instructors, while other factors had varying levels
   of influence, the findings further showed that inadequate internet
   service and students lack of interest are the biggest challenges
   instructors faced during their experience with Google Classroom.
   Research limitations/implications
   To improve the generalizability of the results, future studies are
   recommended to include larger samples, in addition, further studies are
   also advised to take individual traits such as age and gender into
   consideration.
   Originality/value
   The outcomes of this study are expected to benefit researchers,
   policymakers and LMS developers who are interested in factors that
   affect instructors' intention to reuse LMS in higher education
   institutes in developing countries.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW C}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},

Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Pb-208 is a doubly magic nucleus which has been studied extensively by
   many experiments and nuclear models. Its properties, such as excitation
   energies, spins, and parities of the ground and excited states are well
   known. However, some gamma transitions with E-gamma > 3 MeV from the
   excited states to the ground state in Pb-208 have never been observed.
   The intensities of these gamma transitions are important issues for 0 nu
   beta beta decay searches because these transitions can make
   non-negligible background signals depending on their intensities. We
   conducted a measurement to search for the 3197.7, 3475.1, and 3708.4 keV
   transitions, which are emitted from the second, third, and fourth
   excited states in Pb-208, respectively. A 2 kg ThO2 sample was measured
   using a 100\% relative efficiency high-purity germanium detector for

Abstract = {{In France, liver grafts which have been refused by at least five centers
   are proposed as rescue allocation (RA). The aim of this study is to
   clarify the feasibility and safety of RA grafts in liver transplantation
   (LT). Short- and long-term outcomes of patients who received RA grafts
   (RA group) were compared with those of patients who received standard
   allocation (SA) grafts (SA group). From a total of 1635 patients, 102
   patients received RA grafts. Before matching, the RA group was
   characterized primarily by less severe liver disease, but the quality of
   graft was worse. After matching recipients' characteristics of 102
   patients who used RA grafts with 306 patients who used SA grafts,
   recipients' characteristics were well balanced (1:3 matching). Although
   the rate of primary dysfunction was significantly higher in the RA
   group, there is no significant difference in the occurrence of major
   complications, length of hospitalization, and mortality between two
   groups. Graft survival (GS) and overall survival (OS) in the RA group
   were not significantly different from the SA group (GS; HR = 1.03 P =
   .89, OS; HR = 1.03 P = .90). In the French allocation system, the
   feasibility and safety of RA grafts might be comparable to SA grafts for
   carefully selected patients.}},

Abstract = {{Poly (ether ether ketone) (PEEK) material can be used in a wide variety
   of fields, such as the aerospace, automotive, electronics, and nuclear
   industries. In this research, the irradiation effect of 25 MeV Si ions
   and 25 MeV O ions on the PEEK films was studied, focusing on the changes
   in chemical and structural properties. By analyzing surface morphology
   and microstructure evolution of the PEEK films after 25 MeV Si ion and
   25 MeV O ion irradiation, particles were generated on surface of the
   PEEK after 25 MeV Si ion irradiation and black dots were generated on
   surface of the PEEK after 25 MeV O ion irradiation. The irradiation
   reduced the surface roughness of the PEEK films from the atomic force
   microscopy (AFM) results. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) results
   indicated that the groups and structure of the material were not changed
   by irradiation. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results
   showed that the contents of the chemical bonds C-C, C=O increased first
   and then decreased with the increasing of the fluences. The generated
   free radicals were observed by the electron paramagnetic resonance
   spectroscopy (EPR) at room temperature and the irradiation degradation
   mechanisms were analyzed. Thermal properties of the PEEK irradiated by
   25 MeV O ions, indicating that a new secondary crystallization peak was
   found during the cooling stage. Consequently, the low fluences
   irradiation improves in the viscoelasticity and mechanical properties of
   PEEK films, while the high fluences irradiation reduces its performance.}},

Journal = {{EARLY CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND CARE}},
Abstract = {{With a non-clinical sample of pre-schoolers, we used partial least
   squares regression to assess the extent to which children's seven
   sensory regulatory factors (X) account for variations in the three
   temperament factors (Y) and Y explains variations in X. The results
   suggested predicting temperament factors from sensory processing factors
   receive better outcomes. Finally, multiple regression analyses using the
   sensory processing measures to predict each of the three temperamental
   variables showed that (1) significant predictors of negative affectivity
   included difficulties in tactile sensitivity, taste/smell sensitivity,
   and low energy; (2) surgency was predicted by underresponsive/seeks
   sensation, auditory filtering, tactile sensitivity, and movement
   sensitivity; and (3) effortful control was predicted by low energy and
   auditory filtering. The hypothesis supported children's sensory
   processing preferences form the basis for the manifestation of

Journal = {{MOLECULAR THERAPY-NUCLEIC ACIDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{22}},

Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Dysregulated expression of microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) has been
   implicated in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
   However, their underlying role in the complication of detrusor fibrosis
   remains poorly understood. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the
   potential functional relevance of miR-363 in detrusor fibrosis of rats
   with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T2DM through the predicted target gene
   collagen type I alpha 2 (Col1a2). Immunohistochemical analysis found an
   increase in the positive expression of collagen type III alpha 1
   (Col3a1) and Col1a2 in detrusor tissues, where miR-363 expression was
   decreased. Next, gain- and loss-of-function experiments were performed
   to clarify the effects of miR-363 and Col1a2 on the activities of
   bladder detrusor cells. Of note, binding affinity between miR-363 and
   Col1a2 was verified by a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and RNA
   immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. Upregulated miR-363 inhibited Col1a2
   expression, which led to increased expression of B-cell lymphoma 2
   (Bcl-2) and Smad7 and accelerated cell viability, along with decreases
   in cell apoptosis and Col3a1, Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax),
   transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1, and Smad4 expressions. In
   conclusion, miR-363 upregulation reduces detrusor fibrosis in rats with
   STZ-induced T2DM through suppression of the TGF-beta 1/Smad signaling
   pathway by targeting Col1a2. Therefore, our study provided further
   insights for the development of new therapeutic targets for T2DM.}},

Title = {{Revealing two dynamic dengue epidemic clusters in Thailand}},
Journal = {{BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundThailand is home to around 69 million individuals. Dengue is
   hyper-endemic and all 4 serotypes are in active circulation in the
   country. Dengue outbreaks occur almost annually within Thailand in at
   least one province but the spatio-temporal and environmental interface
   of these outbreaks has not been studied.MethodsWe develop Bayesian
   regime switching (BRS) models to characterize outbreaks, their
   persistence and infer their likelihood of occurrence across time for
   each administrative province where dengue case counts are collected. BRS
   was compared against two other classification tools and their agreement
   is assessed. We further examine how these spatio-temporal clusters of
   outbreak clusters arise by comparing reported dengue case counts, urban
   population, urban land cover, climate and flight volumes on the province
   level.ResultsTwo dynamic dengue epidemic clusters were found nationally.
   One cluster consists of 47 provinces and is highly outbreak prone.
   Provinces with a large number of case counts, urban population, urban
   land cover and incoming flight passengers are associated to the epidemic
   prone cluster of dengue. Climate has an effect on determining the
   probability of outbreaks over time within provinces, but have less
   influence on whether provinces belong to the epidemic prone cluster. BRS
   found high agreement with other classification
   tools.ConclusionsImportation and urbanization drives the risk of
   outbreaks across regions strongly. In provinces estimated to have high
   epidemic persistence, more resource allocation to vector control should
   be applied to those localities as heightened transmission counts are
   likely to occur over a longer period of time. Clustering of epidemic and
   non-epidemic prone areas also highlights the need for prioritization of
   resource allocation for disease mitigation over provinces in Thailand.}},

Abstract = {{Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with a variety of human diseases
   including neurodegeneration, diabetes, nonalcohol fatty liver disease
   (NAFLD), and cancer, but its underlying causes are incompletely
   understood. Using the human hepatic cell line HepG2 as a model, we show
   here that endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), an ER
   protein quality control process, is critically required for
   mitochondrial function in mammalian cells. Pharmacological inhibition or
   genetic ablation of key proteins involved in ERAD increased cell death
   under both basal conditions and in response to proinflammatory
   cytokines, a situation frequently found in NAFLD. Decreased viability of
   ERAD-deficient HepG2 cells was traced to impaired mitochondrial
   functions including reduced ATP production, enhanced reactive oxygen
   species (ROS) accumulation, and increased mitochondrial outer membrane
   permeability. Transcriptome profiling revealed widespread

Abstract = {{Patients with hematologic malignancies are at increased risk of
   infection, with associated morbidity and mortality. Patients with acute
   myeloid leukemia (AML) have qualitative and quantitative deficits in
   granulocytes predisposing to bacterial and fungal infections. Acute
   lymphoblastic leukemia results in qualitative deficits in lymphocytes,
   resulting in hypogamma-globulinemia and reduced cell-mediated immunity
   predisposing to certain bacterial and viral as well as fungal
   infections. Chemotherapeutic regimens often compound these deficits,
   result in prolonged periods of severe neutropenia, and disrupt mucosal
   barriers, further elevating infection risk. Despite advances in
   antimicrobial therapies and prophylaxis, acute leukemia patients with
   disease- and treatment-related immunosuppression remain at risk for
   life-threatening infection, including with resistant organisms,
   antimicrobial-related adverse events, and higher treatment costs.
   Additionally, our knowledge of infection risk and drug-drug interactions
   with new immune-targeted cancer therapeutics is evolving. Here, we
   review 3 areas in which standard practice is evolving as challenges
   arise and new experience is gained, including antibiotic use in febrile
   neutropenia, fungal prophylaxis, and use of targeted therapies.}},

   always behave as substitutes, it turns out that in multi-stage serial
   supply chains the interplay between RMI and reserve capacity is more

Abstract = {{Introduction
   Right now, we are facing a global pandemic caused by the coronavirus
   SARS-CoV-2 that causes the highly contagious human disease COVID-19. The
   number of COVID-19 cases is increasing at an alarming rate, more and
   more people suffer from it, and the death toll is on the rise since
   December 2019, when COVID-19 has presumably appeared. We need an urgent
   solution for the prevention, treatment, and recovery of the involved
   patients.
   Methods
   Modulated electro-hyperthermia (mEHT) is known as an immuno-supportive
   therapy in oncology. Our proposal is to apply this method to prevent the
   progression of the disease after its identification, to provide
   treatment when necessary, and deliver rehabilitation to diminish the
   fibrotic-often fatal-consequences of the infection.
   Hypothesis
   The effects of mEHT, which are proven for oncological applications,
   could be utilized for the inactivation of the virus or for treating the
   fibrotic consequences. The hypothesized mEHT effects, which could have a
   role in the antiviral treatment, it could be applied for viral-specific
   immune-activation and for anti-fibrotic treatments.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL OPHTHALMOLOGY}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose This study aims to evaluate the usefulness of creating images of
   expected appearance after blepharoptosis surgery using mirror image
   processing software. Methods This prospective, observational study
   included 60 sides from 30 patients with bilateral aponeurotic
   blepharoptosis who underwent levator resection or aponeurotic repair on
   both sides. Before surgery, facial photographs were taken after the
   eyelid on one side was lifted with a curved hook. The mirror images were
   created from these photographs and were merged with the original
   photographs for making the whole facial images, which were shown to each
   patient at the preoperative counseling. At 1 month postoperatively, we
   asked patients about the usefulness of the mirror images to predict the
   postoperative appearance at the preoperative counseling and the
   similarity between the expected and the resultant postoperative
   appearance using questionnaires. Margin reflex distance-1, eyebrow
   height, and pretarsal skin height measured on predictive images were
   compared with those measured at 1 month postoperatively. Results
   Twenty-nine patients (96.7\%) favorably responded to the usefulness of
   the mirror images to predict the postoperative appearance, and
   twenty-five patients (83.3\%) accepted the similarity between the
   expected appearance and the actual postoperative appearance. The
   predictive images showed significantly lower margin reflex distance-1,
   higher eyebrow height, and higher pretarsal skin height than the
   postoperative results (P < 0.001). Conclusion The creation of expected
   postoperative images was a useful simulation procedure before
   blepharoptosis surgery for patients to predict the probable
   postoperative appearance.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated how deafness and sign language experience affect the
   human brain by comparing neuroanatomical structures across congenitally
   deaf signers (n = 30), hearing native signers (n = 30), and hearing
   sign-naive controls (n = 30). Both voxel-based and surface-based
   morphometry results revealed deafness-related structural changes in
   visual cortices (grey matter), right frontal lobe (gyrification), and
   left Heschl's gyrus (white matter). The comparisons also revealed
   changes associated with lifelong signing experience: expansions in the
   surface area within left anterior temporal and left occipital lobes, and
   a reduction in cortical thickness in the right occipital lobe for deaf
   and hearing signers. Structural changes within these brain regions may
   be related to adaptations in the neural networks involved in processing
   signed language (e.g. visual perception of face and body movements).
   Hearing native signers also had unique neuroanatomical changes (e.g.
   reduced gyrification in premotor areas), perhaps due to lifelong
   experience with both a spoken and a signed language.}},

   the existing research has focussed on centre-based itinerant TVIs, with
   scant attention paid to the other itinerant types. This study mitigates
   this lack of research. Designed as an exploratory study to provide a
   useful reference for future research, the study employed a qualitative
   research design using semi-structured interviews with nine German TVIs.
   The results showed more similarities than differences among the three
   types of TVIs in their daily tasks, needed qualities and skills, and
   overall perceptions of the job. Two crucial elements enabled these TVIs
   to work effectively: the existence of a large community of TVIs and TVIs
   possessing good `collaborative skills'. The school-based dual role
   seemed to provide much-needed emotional and technical support. Further
   investigations are needed on the factors that contribute to a good
   `team' or a `community' of TVIs and on the effectiveness of the
   school-based dual role.}},

Abstract = {{What can one say to the self-deceived? And - perhaps more importantly -
   who can say it? The attribution of self-deception depends heavily on the
   criteria for what is thought to be beyond dispute. For Galeotti,
   misperception of reality is a product of psychological and emotional
   pressure resulting in `emotionally overloaded wishes', and her solution
   thus involves the construction of what an `impartial' and
   `dispassionate' observer would conclude when presented with the same
   evidence. Drawing on her examples of foreign policy decision-making, I
   discuss two objections. First, I ask whether being `dispassionate' is
   enough get one off the hook from the sorts of value judgements that must
   be made in assessing evidence in complex situations. Second, I address
   the role of disagreement and dissent, and suggest that what is required
   are not actors with a lack of emotionally overloaded wishes, but actors
   with different goals and wishes. Thus, while Galeotti emphasizes
   solutions drawing on ideals of impartiality, we might more productively
   look for solutions that engage multiple forms of partiality.}},

Title = {{Fractured Neck of Femur Management at a District General Hospital:
   Adherence to NICE guidelines CG124 for total hip replacement}},
Journal = {{SICOT-J}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
   (NICE) in 2011 declared standards in the management of fracture neck of
   femur (NOF) patients suggesting a total hip replacement (THR) if
   necessary criteria were met. The Best Practice Tariff (BPT) states all
   NOF fracture patients should be operated on within 36 h of presentation
   to Accident \& Emergency. We conducted this retrospective study for the
   years 2016-2018 to evaluate the adherence to these guidelines by
   Basildon and Thurrock University Hospital and compared the results with
   national standards. Methods: Data for the period from 2016 to 2018 was
   collected from the National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD)
   retrospectively. The data was analysed to calculate various procedures
   performed for fracture NOF fixations, the number of THR's for displaced
   intracapsular fracture NOF, and percentage of patients operated within
   36 h and evaluated reasons for the delay. Results: Over the 3 years, the
   number of THR eligible displaced intracapsular neck of femur fracture
   patients that underwent THR was above the national average. Across all 3
   years, the number of patients who underwent surgery within 36 h was less
   than the national average. Administrative/logistic reasons for the delay
   were the major cause for delayed surgery in all 3 years. Conclusion:
   Compliance with the NICE guidelines and achievement of national
   standards in NOF fracture care is achievable by most district general
   hospitals. Awareness and implementation of NICE guidelines for THRs need
   to be enhanced. A sustained, continual team effort and strict vigilance
   are necessary to prevent delayed surgery.}},

Title = {{Professional judgement in clinical practice (part 3): A better
   alternative to strong evidence-based medicine}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{612-623}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Parts 1 and 2 in this series of three articles have shown that and how
   strong evidence-based medicine has neither a coherent theoretical
   foundation nor creditable application to clinical practice. Because of
   its core commitment to the discredited positivist tradition it holds
   both a false concept of scientific knowledge and misunderstandings
   concerning clinical decision-making. Strong EBM continues attempts to
   use flawed adjustments to recover from the unsalvageable base view.
   Paper three argues that a promising solution is at hand if we can manage
   several modes of inclusion. A modified original, moderate version of EBM
   continues though usually overshadowed. As definitively laid out by
   Sackett in the 1990s, clinical decision making is intended to be
   person-centered, recognizing and integrating multiple modes of evidence
   and knowledge that have been marginalized: professional experience,
   illness narratives, and individual patients' values and preferences.
   Complementary resources are at hand: interpretative understanding and
   practice, such as philosophical anthropology, hermeneutical
   phenomenology, complexity theory, and phronetic practices respond to the
   major problems and open new possibilities. Phronesis is especially
   important in regard to public decision making. Within part 3 an
   additional tone necessarily occurs. While most of papers 1, 2, and 3 are
   written in the classical mode of contrasting the theoretical-logical and
   empirical evidence offered by contending positions bearing on the
   decision making and judgement in clinical practice, a shift occurs when
   considerations move beyond what is possible for clinical practitioners
   to accomplish. A different, discontinuous level of power operates in the
   trans-personal realm of instrumental policy, insurance, and hospital
   management practices. In this social-economic-political-ethical realm
   what happens in clinical practice today increasingly becomes a matter of
   what is ``done unto{''} clinical practitioners, of what hampers their
   professional action and thus care of individual patients and clients.}},

Title = {{Large mammalian herbivores contribute to conspecific negative density
   dependence in a temperate forest}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{109}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1194-1209}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The Janzen-Connell Hypothesis (JCH) predicts that density-responsive and
   host-specific natural enemies limit the population sizes of abundant
   species. Importantly, these interactions help to maintain local
   community diversity through time. While ample evidence exists for the
   demographic predictions of the JCH, it remains unclear which natural
   enemies drive these dynamics across different plant communities.
   While large mammalian herbivores are often assumed to lack the
   specialized diet needed to drive Janzen-Connell effects, they do show a
   degree of host-preference that could drive density-dependent plant
   demography. However, the potential role of large mammalian herbivores in
   Janzen-Connell interactions has only rarely been investigated.
   Using 204 seedling transects (1 m x 10 m) at 51 sites across a 900-ha
   forested reserve in southwestern Pennsylvania (USA), we examined the
   role that large mammals play in driving conspecific negative density
   dependence (CNDD) in temperate tree seedlings. Individual fences were
   erected around half of the transects (n = 102) to exclude large mammals,
   and were paired with adjacent unfenced transects. Within transects, a
   total of similar to 15,000 individual seedlings were monitored over
   three growing seasons.
   Demographic neighbourhood models were constructed to examine the
   influence of neighbourhood composition and density on seedling survival
   and growth. An interaction term between conspecific neighbour density
   and fencing treatment was included to test the hypothesis that large
   herbivores cause CNDD.
   We found that seedling survival was influenced by both conspecific
   neighbour density and fencing. CNDD was strongest when large mammals
   were allowed access to seedlings, and these results were driven by two
   abundant taxa (Prunus serotina and Fraxinus spp). Despite evidence that
   large mammals mediate CNDD, we found no effect of fencing on rarified
   species richness or evenness in seedling transects during the study.
   Synthesis. Understanding the specific natural enemies driving
   conspecific negative density dependence remains vital for understanding
   the maintenance of forest diversity across the globe. Our results
   indicate that large mammalian herbivores are capable of driving CNDD in
   temperate tree species. These results suggest that large mammals may be
   an important and generally overlooked agent contributing to
   Janzen-Connell interactions in forest communities. We expect that
   further research examining large mammals in other systems will be
   important in the future.}},

Title = {{Frequency and Risk Factors of Acute Kidney Injury During Diabetic
   Ketoacidosis in Children and Association With Neurocognitive Outcomes}},
Journal = {{JAMA NETWORK OPEN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Question What are the mechanisms, risk factors, and outcomes associated
   with acute kidney injury (AKI) during pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis
   (DKA)? Findings In this cohort study using data from 1359 DKA episodes
   in a large, multicenter, prospective study of fluid treatment during
   DKA, AKI occurred in 43\% of episodes and was associated with greater
   acidosis and greater circulatory volume depletion. Children who had AKI
   were more likely to have subtle cognitive impairment during DKA and
   lower IQ at longer-term follow-up. Meaning These findings suggest that
   AKI is frequent in pediatric DKA and there is a pattern of multiorgan
   dysfunction during childhood DKA with the possibility of common
   pathophysiologic mechanisms.
   Importance Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs commonly during diabetic
   ketoacidosis (DKA) in children, but the underlying mechanisms and
   associations are unclear. Objective To investigate risk factors for AKI
   and its association with neurocognitive outcomes in pediatric DKA.
   Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study was a secondary
   analysis of data from the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research
   Network Fluid Therapies Under Investigation in DKA Study, a prospective,
   multicenter, randomized clinical trial comparing fluid protocols for
   pediatric DKA in 13 US hospitals. Included DKA episodes occurred among
   children age younger than 18 years with blood glucose 300 mg/dL or
   greater and venous pH less than 7.25 or serum bicarbonate level less
   than 15 mEq/L. Exposures DKA requiring intravenous insulin therapy. Main
   Outcomes and Measures AKI occurrence and stage were assessed using serum
   creatinine measurements using Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes
   criteria. DKA episodes with and without AKI were compared using
   univariable and multivariable methods, exploring associated factors.
   Results Among 1359 DKA episodes (mean {[}SD] patient age, 11.6 {[}4.1]
   years; 727 {[}53.5\%] girls; 651 patients {[}47.9\%] with new-onset
   diabetes), AKI occurred in 584 episodes (43\%; 95\% CI, 40\%-46\%). A
   total of 252 AKI events (43\%; 95\% CI, 39\%-47\%) were stage 2 or 3.
   Multivariable analyses identified older age (adjusted odds ratio {[}AOR]
   per 1 year, 1.05; 95\% CI, 1.00-1.09; P = .03), higher initial serum
   urea nitrogen (AOR per 1 mg/dL increase, 1.14; 95\% CI, 1.11-1.18; P <
   .001), higher heart rate (AOR for 1-SD increase in z-score, 1.20; 95\%
   CI, 1.09-1.32; P < .001), higher glucose-corrected sodium (AOR per 1
   mEq/L increase, 1.03; 95\% CI, 1.00-1.06; P = .001) and glucose
   concentrations (AOR per 100 mg/dL increase, 1.19; 95\% CI, 1.07-1.32; P
   = .001), and lower pH (AOR per 0.1 increase, 0.63; 95\% CI, 0.51-0.78; P
   < .001) as variables associated with AKI. Children with AKI, compared
   with those without, had lower scores on tests of short-term memory
   during DKA (mean {[}SD] digit span recall: 6.8 {[}2.4] vs 7.6 {[}2.2]; P
   = .02) and lower mean (SD) IQ scores 3 to 6 months after recovery from
   DKA (100.0 {[}12.2] vs 103.5 {[}13.2]; P = .005). Differences persisted
   after adjusting for DKA severity and demographic factors, including
   socioeconomic status. Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest
   that AKI may occur more frequently in children with greater acidosis and
   circulatory volume depletion during DKA and may be part of a pattern of
   multiple organ injury involving the kidneys and brain.
   This cohort study examines the mechanisms, risk factors, and outcomes
   associated with acute kidney injury during pediatric diabetic
   ketoacidosis.}},

Abstract = {{The structural stability and electronic states of GaSe monolayer with
   trigonal-antiprismatic (AP) structure, which is a recently discovered
   polymorph, were studied by first-principles calculations. The AP-phase
   GaSe monolayer was found stable, and the differences in energy and
   lattice constant were small when compared to those calculated for a GaSe
   monolayer with conventional trigonal-prismatic (P) structure which was
   found to be the ground state. Moreover, it was revealed that the
   relative stability of P-phase and AP-phase GaSe monolayers reverses
   under tensile strain. These calculation results provide insight into the
   formation mechanism of AP-phase GaSe monolayers in epitaxially grown
   GaSe thin films.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundTreatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection with direct
   acting antiviral therapy results in viral elimination in over 90\% of
   cases. The duration of treatment required to achieve cure differs
   between individuals and relapse can occur. We asked whether cellular and
   transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood collected during treatment
   could identify biomarkers predictive of treatment outcome.MethodsWe
   analyzed peripheral blood collected during treatment of genotype 1 HCV
   with 24weeks of sofosbuvir and weight-based or low dose ribavirin in a
   trial in which 29\% of patients relapsed. Changes in host immunity
   during treatment were assessed by flow cytometry and whole blood gene
   expression profiling. Differences in expression of immune-relevant
   transcripts based on treatment outcome were analyzed using the
   Nanostring Human Immunology V2 panel.ResultsMultiple cellular
   populations changed during treatment, but pre-treatment neutrophil
   counts were lower and natural post-treatment killer cell counts were
   higher in patients who relapsed. Pre-treatment expression of genes
   associated with interferon-signaling, T-cell dysfunction, and T-cell
   co-stimulation differed by treatment outcome. We identified a pre- and
   post-treatment gene expression signature with high predictive capacity
   for distinguishing treatment outcome, but neither signature was
   sufficiently robust to suggest viability for clinical
   use.ConclusionsPatients who relapse after hepatitis C virus therapy
   differ immunologically from non-relapsers based on expression of
   transcripts related to interferon signaling and T-cell dysfunction, as
   well as by peripheral neutrophil and NK-cell concentrations. These data
   provide insight into the host immunologic basis of relapse after DAA
   therapy for HCV and suggests mechanisms which may be relevant for
   understanding outcomes with currently approved regimens.}},

Abstract = {{Cyclitols are widely available natural sugars which do not exert toxic
   effects. Their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties may be used
   in the treatment of psoriasis. The aim of this placebo-controlled,
   double-blind study was to evaluate the clinical effects of
   D-chiro-inositol (DCI) in mild plaque psoriasis (46 psoriatic patients
   and 10 healthy volunteers). Three stable psoriatic plaques were selected
   for evaluation in every patient. Different samples were applied on each
   lesion twice a day: vehiculum without an active agent, containing 1\%
   DCI and 0.25\% DCI. The lesions were assessed using the PSI, VAS scale,
   and the objective measurement of hydration, transepidermal water loss
   (TEWL), elasticity, and thickness (DermaLab Combo) at 0, 3, and 6 weeks.
   PSI and VAS were improved in all groups without significant statistical
   differences. 1\% DCI sample presented the highest statistically
   significant increase in the hydration of 50\%, but it was still
   significantly lower than in healthy controls. TEWL increased for 1\%
   DCI, which was a statistically significant difference compared to 0.25\%
   DCI and still higher than in controls. An improvement in elasticity was
   observed in all lesions-it was statistically significant for 1\% DCI.
   The thickness of the lesion decreased for 1\% DCI, but the change was
   not statistically significant. Subepidermal low-echogenic band showed a
   decreasing tendency in all groups, but it was not statistically
   significant. Favorable 1\% DCI sample results indicate that it may be
   used as an adjuvant to the local treatment of psoriasis.}},

Abstract = {{Many Internet of Things (IoT) applications have been developed and
   implemented on unreliable wireless networks like the delay tolerant
   network (DTN); however, efficient data transfer in DTN is still an
   important issue for the IoT applications. One of the application areas
   of DTN is vehicular delay tolerant network (VDTN) where the network
   faces communication disruption due to lack of end-to-end relay route. It
   is challenging as some of the nodes show selfish behavior to preserve
   their resources like memory and energy and become noncooperative. In
   this article, an honesty-based democratic scheme (HBDS) is introduced
   where vehicles with higher honesty level are elected as heads-during the
   process. Vehicles involved in the process would maximize their rewards
   (reputation) through active participation in the network activities,
   whereas vehicles with noncooperative selfish behavior are punished. The
   honesty level of the heads is analyzed using Vickrey, Clarke, and Groves
   (VCG) model. The mathematical model and algorithms developed in the
   proposed HBDS technique are simulated using the VDTNSim framework to
   evaluate their efficiency. The performance results show that the
   proposed scheme dominates current schemes in terms of packet delivery
   probability, packet delivery delay, number of packets drop, and overhead
   ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) play an
   important role in central nervous diseases; however, the exact
   expression and co-expressed profiles in human traumatic brain injury
   (TBI) are still unknown. Therefore, we investigated whole blood in 12
   patients with TBI and 4 healthy controls to observe expression
   characteristics with different severity. We identified 3,035 lncRNAs and
   1,204 mRNAs differentially expressed in the severe TBI group, 2,362
   lncRNAs and 656 mRNAs in the moderate group, and 433 lncRNAs and 100
   mRNAs in the mild group. Enrichment analyses showed 30 signaling
   pathways such as inflammatory and immune response pathways.
   Subsequently, a lncRNA-gene co-expression network was generated for 717
   lncRNA-mRNA pairs and most of them with a positive correlation. Based on
   GSEA analysis, we found that TBI caused severe immune abnormality
   reflected on Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell differentiation deficiency.
   Finally, the expression of one upregulated and one downregulated lncRNA
   was validated in all three TBI groups, which was consistent with the
   microarray results. In summary, our results show that expression
   profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs are significantly different in bloods from
   different severity TBI especially in immune response, providing novel
   insight for lncRNAs in human TBI.}},

Abstract = {{According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red
   List, 41\% of the world's amphibian species are threatened with
   extinction, making them more threatened than any other vertebrate group
   nowadays. Given the global amphibian crisis, comprehensive understanding
   of demographics and population trends of declining and threatened
   species is essential for effective management and conservation
   strategies. Counting egg spawns is widely used to assess population
   abundance in pond breeding anurans. However, it is unknown how such
   counts translate into robust population size estimations. We monitored
   the breeding activity of the Natterjack toad (Epidalea calamita),
   combining egg string counts and individual photo-identification with
   Capture-Mark-Recapture population size and operational sex ratio
   estimation. Male Natterjack toads were identified by the pattern of
   natural markings with repeated ID of the same individual confirmed for
   10\% of the samples using genetic fingerprinting. We identified 647
   unique individuals within a closed study population at Caherdaniel, Co
   Kerry. Population estimates derived from egg string counts estimated a
   breeding population of 368 females (95\% CI 353-384) and
   Capture-Mark-Recapture estimated a breeding population of 1698 males
   (95\% CI 1000-2397). The female:male sex ratio was conservatively
   estimated at 1:5 (95\% CI 1:3-1:6) where 62\% +/- 6\% of females were
   assumed to spawn. These substantially departed from any priori
   assumption of 1:1 which could have underestimated the breeding
   population by up to 72\%. Where amphibian absolute population size
   estimation is necessary, methods should include empirical survey data on
   operational sex ratios and not rely on assumptions or those derived from
   the literature which may be highly population and/or context-dependent.}},

Abstract = {{Out-of-school making and engineering programmes that are frequently
   positioned as playful have increased dramatically in recent years - but
   how appropriate is the framing of play for engagement in these informal
   STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) spaces? Drawing
   on data from two research sites located in the UK, including
   observations of making and engineering activities with children aged
   5-13 years, and interviews with nine key informants, we identify that
   play has three key affordances namely: (1) play can provide structure,
   (2) play is considered to be synonymous with open-ended science inquiry,
   and, (3) play can enable gender inclusive STEM spaces through promoting
   free-choice. We also note that overly simplistic framings of play may
   limit recognition by both adults and children of the educational value
   of these spaces and deny a fuller understanding of the opportunities
   that such spaces afford in providing children with moreopportunities to
   engage with STEM, particularly engineering. We suggest that play has an
   important pedagogical role in informal STEM activities, including
   making, when it is grounded in free-choice exploration and imagination.
   We argue for continued discussion and reflection upon both the value of
   play as a pedagogical vehicle and its affordances for enhancing youth
   engagement in STEM spaces.}},

Title = {{Stochastic optimization for transportation planning in disaster relief

Pages = {{2632-2650}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   This study aims to minimize the expected arrival time of relief vehicles
   to the affected areas, considering the destruction of potential routes
   and disruptions due to disasters. In relief operations, required relief
   items in each affected area and disrupted routes are considered as
   uncertain parameters. Additionally, for a more realistic consideration
   of the situations, it is assumed that the demand of each affected area
   could be met by multiple vehicles and distribution centers (DCs) and
   vehicles have limited capacity.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The current study developed a two-stage stochastic programming model for
   the distribution of relief items from DCs to the affected areas.
   Locating the DCs was the first-stage decisions in the introduced model.
   The second-stage decisions consisted of routing and scheduling of the
   vehicles to reach the affected areas.
   Findings
   In this paper, 7th district of Tehran was selected as a case study to
   assess the applicability of the model, and related results and different
   sensitivity analyses were presented as well. By carrying out a
   simultaneous sensitivity analysis on the capacity of vehicles and the
   maximum number of DCs that can be opened, optimal values for these
   parameters were determined, that would help making optimal decisions
   upon the occurrence of a disaster to decrease total relief time and to
   maximize the exploitation of available facilities.
   Originality/value
   The contributions of this paper are as below: presenting an integrated
   model for the distribution of relief items among affected areas in the
   response phase of a disaster, using a two-stage stochastic programming
   approach to cope with route disruptions and uncertain demands for relief
   items, determining location of the DCs and routing and scheduling of
   vehicles to relief operations and considering a heterogeneous fleet of
   capacitated relief vehicles and DCs with limited capacity and fulfilling
   the demand of each affected area by more than one vehicle to represent
   more realistic situations.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Batch and continuous flow adsorption experiments are carried out and the
   design of a full-scale facility for removing dissolved natural organic
   matter (DNOM) from Catalan Lakewater is demonstrated. The adsorption
   efficiency is proportional to the temperature and the amount of
   adsorbent unlike pH increase. The highest DNOM removal rate is obtained
   at 35 degrees C, pH 4, and an adsorbent amount of 0.8 g L-1. Optimum
   contact time for batch studies is 60 min at equilibrium. Correlation
   constants (r) of Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms are 0.8905 and
   0.9739, respectively. Based on the Freundlich isotherm, the highest
   adsorption capacity (q(max)) obtained is 2.44 and 6.01 mg DNOM/g
   granulated activated carbon (GAC) for raw and enriched water,
   respectively. Consequently, the effects of adsorbent amount, bed depth,
   empty bed contact time, and organic loading on removal performance are
   investigated in the rapid small-scale column test (RSSCT) columns. The
   targeted effluent concentration of 1 mg DNOM/L can easily be achieved in
   the columns. At the design capacity of the facility, 15 adsorption
   columns with dimensions of 7 m height, 4.33 m diameter, and 22 days of
   operation cycle are required to remove DNOM from raw water.}},

Abstract = {{We argue that given holographic CFT1 in some state with a dual spacetime

   CFT2 whose dual geometries closely approximate arbitrarily large causal
   patches of M, provided that CFT1 and CFT2 can be non-trivially coupled

   they are obtained from the original CFT1 state by a regularized quench
   operator defined using a Euclidean path-integral with an interface
   between CFT2 and CFT1. Our results are consistent with the idea that the
   precise microscopic degrees of freedom and Hamiltonian of a holographic
   CFT are only important in fixing the asymptotic behavior of a dual
   spacetime, while the interior spacetime of a region spacelike separated
   from a boundary time slice is determined by more universal properties
   (such as entanglement structure) of the quantum state at this time
   slice. Our picture requires that low-energy gravitational theories

Abstract = {{Background Increased acute postoperative pain intensity has been
   associated with the development of persistent postsurgical pain (PPP) in
   mechanistic and clinical investigations, but it remains unclear which
   aspects of acute pain explain this linkage.
   Methods We analysed clinical postoperative pain intensity assessments
   using symbolic aggregate approximations (SAX), a graphical way of
   representing changes between pain states from one patient evaluation to
   the next, to visualize and understand how pain intensity changes across
   sequential assessments are associated with the intensity of
   postoperative pain at 1 (M1) and 6 (M6) months after surgery. SAX-based
   acute pain transition patterns were compared using cosine similarity,
   which indicates the degree to which patterns mirror each other.
   Results This single-centre prospective cohort study included 364
   subjects. Patterns of acute postoperative pain sequential transitions
   differed between the `None' and `Severe' outcomes at M1 (cosine
   similarity 0.44) and M6 (cosine similarity 0.49). Stratifications of M6
   outcomes by preoperative pain intensity, sex, age group, surgery type
   and catastrophising showed significant heterogeneity of pain transition
   patterns within and across strata. Severe-to-severe acute pain
   transitions were common, but not exclusive, in patients with moderate or
   severe pain intensity at M6.
   Conclusions Clinically, these results suggest that individual pain-state
   transitions, even within patient or procedural strata associated with
   PPP, may not alone offer good predictive information regarding PPP.
   Longitudinal observation in the immediate postoperative period and
   consideration of patient- and surgery-specific factors may help indicate
   which patients are at increased risk of PPP.
   Significance Symbolic aggregate approximations of clinically obtained,
   acute postoperative pain intraday time series identify different motifs
   in patients suffering moderate to severe pain 6 months after surgery.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of early treatment with
   corticosteroids on SARS-CoV-2 clearance in hospitalized COVID-19
   patients. Retrospective analysis on patients admitted to the San
   Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) with moderate/severe COVID-19 and
   availability of at least two nasopharyngeal swabs. The primary outcome
   was the time to nasopharyngeal swab negativization. A multivariable Cox
   model was fitted to determine factors associated with nasopharyngeal
   swab negativization. Of 280 patients included, 59 (21.1\%) patients were
   treated with steroids. Differences observed between steroid users and
   non-users included the proportion of patients with a baseline
   PaO2/FiO(2)<= 200 mmHg (45.8\% vs 34.4\% in steroids and non-steroids
   users, respectively; p=0.023) or <= 100 mmHg (16.9\% vs 12.7\%;
   p=0.027), and length of hospitalization (20 vs 14 days; p<0.001). Time
   to negativization of nasopharyngeal swabs was similar in steroid and
   non-steroid users (p=0.985). According to multivariate analysis,
   SARS-CoV-2 clearance was associated with age<less than or equal to>70
   years, a shorter duration of symptoms at admission, a baseline
   PaO2/FiO(2)>200 mmHg, and a lymphocyte count at admission>1.0x10(9)/L.
   SARS-CoV-2 clearance was not associated with corticosteroid use. Our
   study shows that delayed SARS-CoV-2 clearance in moderate/severe
   COVID-19 is associated with older age and a more severe disease, but not
   with an early use of corticosteroids.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Panobinostat, bortezomib, and dexamethasone combination
   therapy demonstrated progression-free survival (PFS) benefit over
   bortezomib and dexamethasone alone in the PANORAMA-1 study in
   relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). Here, we present data from a
   phase II study (NCT02290431) of this combination in Japanese patients
   with relapsed or relapsed-and-refractory MM. Methods: Patients received
   3-week cycles of 20-mg oral panobinostat (weeks 1 and 2), 1.3-mg/m(2)
   subcutaneous bortezomib (days 1, 4, 8, and 11), and 20-mg oral
   dexamethasone (day of and the day following bortezomib administration)
   for a total of 8 cycles (24 weeks; treatment phase 1). Patients with
   treatment benefit had an option to enter the extension phase to receive
   6-week (42-day) cycles of panobinostat (weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5) plus
   bortezomib (days 1, 8, 22, and 29) and dexamethasone (day of and the day
   following bortezomib treatment) for 24 weeks. The primary objective was
   complete response (CR) + near CR (nCR) rate after treatment phase 1 as
   per the modified European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation
   criteria. Results: Of the 31 patients, 4 (12.9\%) completed the
   treatment and 27 (87.1\%) discontinued; 17 (54.8\%) entered the
   extension phase. In total, 24 patients (77.4\%) entered the survival
   follow-up phase and followed until study closure when the last patient
   was treated for 1 year after treatment phase 1. The CR + nCR rate was
   48.4\% (90\% CI: 33.6-63.2). The overall response rate (CR + nCR +
   partial response) was 80.6\%. The median PFS, duration of response, time
   to response, and time to progression were 15.3, 22.7, 1.4, and 15.3
   months, respectively. All patients experienced adverse events (AEs),
   with diarrhea (80.6\%), decreased appetite (58.1\%), and
   thrombocytopenia (54.8\%) being the most frequent, regardless of
   relationship to the study treatment. Thrombocytopenia (48.4\%), fatigue
   (25.8\%), diarrhea (22.6\%), neutrophil count decrease (22.6\%),
   platelet count decrease (22.6\%), and lymphocyte count decrease (22.6\%)
   were the most frequent grade 3/4 AEs. Conclusion: The study met the
   primary objective with 48.4\% CR + nCR rate. The AEs associated with the
   combination treatment were safely managed using the existing AE
   management guidelines, including dose interruption/modification and/or
   supportive medical intervention. This treatment regimen is an effective
   option with a favorable benefit/risk profile for Japanese patients with
   relapsed/refractory MM.}},

Abstract = {{Prophylactic platelet transfusions are used to reduce the risk of
   spontaneous bleeding in patients with treatment- or disease-related
   severe thrombocytopenia. A prophylactic platelet-transfusion threshold
   of <10 x 10(3)/mu L has been shown to be safe in stable
   hematology/oncology patients. A higher threshold and/or larger or more
   frequent platelet doses may be appropriate for patients with clinical
   features associated with an increased risk of bleeding such as high
   fevers, sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, anticoagulation
   therapy, or splenomegaly. Unique factors in the outpatient setting may
   support the use of a higher platelet-transfusion threshold and/or dose
   of platelets. A prophylactic platelet-transfusion strategy has been
   shown to be associated with a lower risk of bleeding compared with no
   prophylaxis in adult patients receiving chemotherapy but not for a
   utologous transplant recipients. Despite the use of prophylactic
   platelet transfusions, a high incidence (50\% to 70\%) of spontaneous
   bleeding remains. Using a higher threshold or larger doses of platelets
   does not change this risk. New approaches to reduce the risk of
   spontaneous bleeding, including antifibrinolytic therapy, are currently
   under study.}},

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{19}},

Month = {{MAY 28}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is twofold: to test whether intellectual
   capital mediates the relationship between board of directors'
   effectiveness and adoption of International Financial Reporting
   Standards (IFRS) and to examine the contribution of the specific
   elements of intellectual capital and board of directors' effectiveness
   to adoption of IFRS.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This study is cross-sectional. Usable questionnaires were received from
   67 microfinance institutions (MFIs) that are members of the Association
   of MFIs of Uganda. The data was analyzed using Statistical Package for
   Social Sciences and MedGraph program (Excel version).
   Findings
   Results indicate that intellectual capital mediates the relationship
   between board of directors' effectiveness and adoption of IFRS. Results
   further indicate that board independence and board meetings contribute
   significantly to the adoption of IFRS unlike board size and board
   committees. Results also indicate that in the intellectual capital
   elements, only structural capital and human capital significantly
   contribute to the adoption of IFRS unlike relational capital.
   Originality/value
   This study provides more insights on our understanding of the
   relationship between intellectual capital, board of directors'
   effectiveness and adoption of IFRS. Specifically, it provides first time
   evidence of the mediation effect of intellectual capital in the
   relationship between board of directors' effectiveness and adoption of
   IFRS using evidence from an African developing country - Uganda.
   Further, this paper adds to existing literature on corporate governance
   and reporting practices, as it provides more insights on the
   contribution of specific elements of board of directors' effectiveness
   and intellectual capital to adoption of IFRS.}},

Journal = {{EMBO REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{Combined fatty acid esterification and lipolysis, termed lipid cycling,
   is an ATP-consuming process that contributes to energy expenditure.
   Therefore, interventions that stimulate energy expenditure through lipid
   cycling are of great interest. Here we find that pharmacological and
   genetic inhibition of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) in brown
   adipocytes activates lipid cycling and energy expenditure, even in the
   absence of adrenergic stimulation. We show that the resulting increase
   in ATP demand elevates mitochondrial respiration coupled to ATP
   synthesis and fueled by lipid oxidation. We identify that glutamine
   consumption and the Malate-Aspartate Shuttle are required for the
   increase in Energy Expenditure induced by MPC inhibition in Brown
   Adipocytes (MAShEEBA). We thus demonstrate that energy expenditure
   through enhanced lipid cycling can be activated in brown adipocytes by
   decreasing mitochondrial pyruvate availability. We present a new
   mechanism to increase energy expenditure and fat oxidation in brown
   adipocytes, which does not require adrenergic stimulation of
   mitochondrial uncoupling.}},

Abstract = {{Although there has been much interest in British public opinion on
   Brexit, much less is known about how EU-27 Europeans view the Brexit
   negotiations. This is surprising, because Brexit confronts the EU-27
   with difficult choices. Whereas accommodating the UK carries the risk of
   encouraging further countriesto leave the EU, an uncompromising
   negotiation stance increases the economic and social costs of Brexit.
   Using original survey data from 39,000 respondents in all EU-27
   countries collected between the start of the Brexit negotiations and
   December 2018, this article shows that exposure to the economic risks of
   Brexit makes respondents more willing to accommodate the UK, whereas a
   positive opinion of the EU decreases their willingness to compromise.
   Moreover, many Europeans face an accommodation dilemma that moderates
   these preferences. Overall, the EU-27 public unsentimentally supports a
   Brexit negotiation line that safeguards their own interests best.}},

Volume = {{43}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Dating app use is prevalent among non-single Chinese gay men. Applying
   domestication theory, this study explores how dating apps can be
   accepted in gay romantic relationships. The author argues that the
   domestication of technological artifacts unfolds on four dimensions: the
   practical, the symbolic, the cognitive, and the relational. Findings
   show that dating apps serve a dual role: a pool of sexual or romantic
   alternatives and a channel to the gay community. Although the former
   constitutes a threat to monogamy, the latter leaves room for a couple's
   negotiation for acceptable but restricted uses. This negotiation is in
   tandem with the negotiation of relational boundaries, which leads to
   either the reinforcement of monogamy or the embrace of non-monogamy.
   Meanwhile, one can perceive dating apps to be as unremarkable as other
   social media platforms. This is achieved through a cognitive process
   where gay men learn to debunk the arbitrary association between dating
   apps and infidelity. Monogamous or not, they put faith in user agency,
   not perceiving dating apps as a real threat to romantic relationships.}},

Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) and colon adenocarcinoma (CAC) are the most
   common gastrointestinal cancer subtypes, with a high incidence and
   mortality. Numerous studies have shown that its occurrence and
   progression are significantly related to abnormal DNA methylation,
   especially CpG island methylation. However, little is known about the
   application of DNA methylation in GAC and CAC. The methylation profiles
   were accessed from the Cancer Genome Atlas database to identify promoter
   methylation-based cancer subtypes and signatures for GAC and CAC. Six
   hypo-methylated clusters for GAC and six hyper-methylated clusters for
   CAC were separately generated with different OS profiles, tumor
   progression became worse as the methylation level decreased in GAC or
   increased in CAC, and hypomethylation in GAC and hypermethylation in CAC
   were negatively correlated with microsatellite instability.
   Additionally, the hypo- and hyper-methylated site-based signatures with
   high accuracy, high efficiency and strong independence can separately
   predict the OS of GAC and CAC patients. By integrating the
   methylation-based signatures with prognosis-related clinicopathologic
   characteristics, two clinicopathologic-epigenetic nomograms were
   cautiously established with strong predictive performance and high
   accuracy. Our research indicates that methylation mechanisms differ
   between GAC and CAC, and provides novel clinical biomarkers for the
   diagnosis and treatment of GAC and CAC.}},

Abstract = {{y Circular RNAs (circRNAs) function as efficient microRNA (miRNA)
   sponges that regulate gene expression in the pathogenesis of many human
   malignancies. However, their roles in cervical adenocarcinoma remain
   largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to seek novel circRNAs that
   regulate cervical adenocarcinoma carcinogenesis and to explore their
   regulatory mechanisms as well as clinical significance. We identified
   that 24 circRNAs were differentially expressed in cervical
   adenocarcinoma tissues by RNA sequencing. Among them, circEYA1 was the
   most significantly downregulated circRNA in cervical adenocarcinoma. In
   cervical adenocarcinoma cells, circEYA1 overexpression led to
   suppression of cell viability and colony formation, promotion of
   apoptosis, and a decrease of the xenograft tumor growth. The mechanism
   underlying these observations is that circEYA1 functioned as a sponge of
   miR-582-3p and abrogated its suppression of CXCL14 expression.
   Consistently, miR-582-3p inhibition phenocopied the biological effects
   of circEYA1 overexpression in cervical adenocarcinoma cells. Moreover,
   miR-582-3p overexpression reversed the suppressive behaviors of circEYA1
   in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the expression, correlation, and
   clinical diagnostic value of circEYA1/miR-582-3p/CXCL14 were confirmed
   in 198 clinical cervical tissue samples. In summary, our findings
   highlight a novel tumor suppressive role of circEYA1 in cervical
   adenocarcinoma tumorigenesis and may provide a potential diagnostic
   marker and therapeutic target for patients with cervical adenocarcinoma.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Despite the prevalent use of professional status and service
   feedback in online healthcare markets, the potential interaction
   relationship between two types of information is still unknown. This
   study used the signaling theory to examine the substitute relationship
   between professional status and service feedback in patients' doctor
   choice, as well as the moderating effect of illness severity.
   Design/methodology/approach To test the paper's hypotheses, we
   constructed a panel data model using 418 doctors' data collected over a
   period of six months from an online healthcare market in China. Then,
   according to the results of the Hausman test, we estimated a
   fixed-effects model of patients' choice in online healthcare markets.
   Findings The empirical results showed that the effect of a doctor's
   professional status and service feedback on a patient's doctor choice
   was substitutable. Moreover, patients' illness severity played a
   moderating role, in that the influence of professional status on a
   patient with high-severity illness was higher than that on a patient
   with low-severity illness, whereas the influence of service feedback on
   a patient with low-severity illness was higher than that of a patient
   with high-severity illness. In addition, we found that illness severity
   negatively moderated the substitute relationship between professional
   status and service feedback on a patient's choice. Originality/value
   These findings not only contribute to signaling theory and research on
   online healthcare markets, but also help us understand the importance of
   professional status and service feedback on a patient's choice when
   seeking a doctor online.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose An exact pattern prototype is a prerequisite for female girdle
   pattern-making. The purpose of this paper is to develop new ways to make
   girdle pattern prototypes based on 3D technology.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper presented two novel methods for
   creating girdle pattern prototypes. The first one was the girdle's
   parametric foundation pattern developing method based on 3D geometric
   modeling. In this method, considering the different characteristics of a
   female's lower body shape, several models were created to define the
   relationship between the female's lower body shape and the pattern, such
   as a side-waist curvature model, an interior-posterior waist-warping
   model, a buttocks' parametric model and an abdomen parametric model.
   Then, parameters of drawing the prototype were abstracted to facilitate
   transforming the 3D geometric model into the 2D pattern. Another method
   was implemented by 3D virtual modeling and unwrapping. The whole process
   included surface division, surface reconstruction and surface
   unwrapping. Findings The prototypes created by these two methods were
   tested using the 3D virtual trying-on examination. Trial tests showed
   that the patterns can be dressed in the right positions on the virtual
   model with little pressure. This means that the proportions and shapes
   of the pattern are correct. The prototypes obtained through the methods
   proposed in this paper have good effects and high precision. Both
   methods can be used for making the girdle's foundation pattern.
   Originality/value Two pragmatic approaches of girdle's prototype
   building have been put forward. The parametric prototype designing
   method has changed the unconstrained state of free modeling. The pattern
   structure can be controlled by parameter constraints. In the other
   method, with 3D scanning and surface modeling technology, personalized
   girdle's pattern is generated, and the segmentation lines of the girdle
   can be designed flexibly according to the requirements. These findings
   also can be used in other tight garments' prototype making.}},

   fluorocarbon-based water repellent in different concentrations. After
   finishing cotton fabrics with so-called solution the samples were then
   tested in terms of water repellency and antibacterial efficiency. In
   addition, to see the changes in whiteness during processes, the
   whiteness (stensby) values of the treated cotton fabrics were measured
   too. In terms of testing antibacterial efficiency two different types of
   bacteria; a Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and a Gram-negative
   (Escherichia coli) bacteria, were used. As a result of the study, it was
   observed that cotton fabrics can gain water repellency and antibacterial
   activity against Staphylococcus aureus has occurred. Meanwhile a limited
   antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli was found too.}},

Title = {{Association of Cigarette Smoking, COPD, and Lung Cancer With Expression

Abstract = {{SARS-CoV-2 enters into human airway epithelial cells via membrane fusion
   or endocytosis, and this process is dependent on ACE2, TMPRSS2, and
   cathepsin L. In this study, we examined the expression profiles of the
   three SARS-CoV-2 entry genes in primary human airway epithelial cells
   isolated from smokers, non-smokers, patients with chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease or lung cancer. An exhaustive search of the GEO
   database was performed to identify eligible data on 1st June 2020. In
   total, 46 GEO datasets comprising transcriptomic data of 3,053 samples
   were identified as eligible data for further analysis. All meta-analysis
   were performed using RStudio. Standardized mean difference was utilized
   to assess the effect size of a factor on the expression of targeted
   genes and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. This study
   revealed that (i) cigarette smoking is associated with an increased
   expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and a decreased expression of cathepsin
   L; (ii) significant alternations in expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and
   cathepsin L were observed between current smokers and former smokers,
   but not between former smokers and never smokers; (iii) when compared
   with healthy controls with identical smoking status, patients with COPD
   or lung cancer showed negligible changes in expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2,
   and cathepsin L. Therefore, this study implicates cigarette smoking
   might contribute to the development of COVID-19 by affecting the
   expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry genes, while smoking cessation could be
   effective to reduce the potential risk.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the change of cervical length and the best timing for
   pregnancy after cervical conization in patients with cervical
   intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). This was a retrospective study
   including patients under 40 years with fertility desire treated by
   cervical conization for CIN. To assess the cervical length, the patients
   were divided into 2 groups according to different surgery procedure:
   loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) and cold knife conisation
   (CKC). Patients with cervical length < 2.5 cm in CKC group were divided
   into 2 groups according to whether receiving cervical cerclage.
   Trans-vaginal ultrasound examination was used to measure cervical length
   by fixed professional sonographers. In LEEP group, the cervical length
   preoperative was significantly longer than 3 months postoperatively
   (3.03 +/- 0.45 cm vs 2.84 +/- 0.44 cm, P = .000). In CKC group, the
   cervical length preoperative was significantly longer than 3 and 6
   months postoperatively (2.90 +/- 0.41 cm vs 2.43 +/- 0.43 cm and 2.68
   +/- 0.41 cm, respectively, P = .000). Cervical length was significantly
   longer at 12 and 9 months after cerclage compared to that without
   cerclage. Eighteen patients got pregnant in LEEP group, among which one
   was pregnant at 5 months postoperatively and had premature delivery.
   There was 1 inevitable abortion and 1 preterm birth among 39 pregnant
   patients from CKC group. Patients who have fertility desire with CIN
   were recommended for pregnancy at 6 and 9 months after LEEP and CKC,
   respectively. Cerclage effectively prolonged cervical length in patents
   with that less than 2.5 cm to prevent cervical incompetence.}},

   Dielectric Properties}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{The rapid detection of asphalt content in asphalt mixture is of great
   significance to the quality evaluation of asphalt pavement. Based on the
   dielectric properties of an asphalt mixture, the prediction model of
   asphalt content is deduced theoretically using three types of dielectric
   models: Lichtenecker-Rother (L-R) model, Rayleigh model, and Bottcher
   equation. Under the condition of laboratory mixing at room temperature
   (about 20-25 degrees C), a dielectric test of asphalt mixture is
   conducted to verify the applicability of the model. The test results
   indicate that the dielectric constant of the asphalt mixture is
   inversely proportional to the asphalt content and directly proportional
   to the aggregate size of the mixture. Among the models, the Rayleigh
   model has a wide range of applications and exhibits a high accuracy,
   with an average relative error of only 1.86\%. The results provide a
   theoretical basis for the nondestructive testing of asphalt pavements
   using ground-penetrating radar.}},

Abstract = {{{[}This paper is part of the Focused Collection on Curriculum
   Development: Theory into Design.] We argue that teaching learning
   sequence (TLS) design needs to be further developed through the explicit
   articulation of methodology, which comprises the theoretical commitments
   regarding research and how those give rise to methods for design,
   implementation and assessment. In this study we propose design based
   research (DBR) as a methodology to conduct systematic and iterative
   studies of the design and assessment of educational interventions (such
   as materials and strategies) as solutions to complex problems in
   educational practice. This methodology does not specify theoretical
   commitments regarding the nature of learning and how those give rise to
   teaching strategies, but the articulation of those commitments is
   expected as part of the justification for decision making in the design
   process. In order to demonstrate the framework, we present an example of
   TLS development in the context of introductory electrostatics and dc
   circuits. We describe the evaluation of the TLS over three years of
   implementation, addressing both the capacity of the TLS for involving
   students in learning the topic and the students' learning itself.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Introduction Digital technology has the potential to provide a bias-free
   evaluation instrument for practical examination grading. E4D Compare
   software was designed for teaching institutions to allow comparison
   between scanned models prepared by students and master models prepared
   by instructors. The aim of this study was to determine the tolerance
   value for the E4D compare software (E4D Technologies LLC, Richardson,
   TX, USA) that provides scores comparable with faculty grades for wax-ups
   \#23 and \#19. Additionally, this study sought to assess the correlation
   between students' self-assessments, visual and digital grades and the
   reliability of the software.
   Methods Student wax-ups (n = 112) were uploaded into the software and
   then compared with faculty-generated master wax-ups. Digital grading was
   performed at tolerances 200-800 mu m in 50 mu m increments and was
   repeated twice.
   Results A tolerance of 350 mu m was the closest to faculty grades for
   \#23 and 500 mu m was the closest for \#19. Visual and digital grades
   showed moderate to high correlation for both wax-ups. Correlations
   between students' self-assessments and visual and digital grades
   improved with \#19 versus \#23. A near-perfect correlation was found
   between grades at the first and second digital grading sessions.
   Conclusions The tolerance that closely matches faculty grades differs
   according to the tooth type. The software provided consistent grades and
   correlated well with faculty grades. Students' self-assessment skills
   improved as they proceeded throughout the course. Further studies are
   necessary to ascertain the role of the software in improving students'
   self-assessment skills.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, a class of generalized telegraph and Cattaneo
   time-fractional models along with Robin's initial-boundary conditions is
   considered using the adaptive reproducing kernel framework. Accordingly,
   a relatively novel numerical treatment is introduced to investigate and
   interpret approximate solutions to telegraph and Cattaneo models of
   time-fractional derivatives in Caputo sense. This treatment optimized
   solutions relying on the Sobolev spaces and Schmidt orthogonalization
   process that can be directly implemented to generate Fourier expansion
   at a rapid convergence rate, in which the arbitrary kernel functions
   satisfy Robin's homogeneous conditions. Furthermore, the solution is
   displayed in a fractional series formula in complete Hilbert spaces
   without any restrictive hypothesis on the desired issues. The
   effectiveness, validity, and potentiality of the proposed procedure are
   demonstrated by testing some applications. The graphical consequences
   indicate that the method is superior, accurate, and convenient in
   solving such fractional models.}},

Title = {{The Emerging Potential of Extracellular Vesicles in Cell-Free Tissue
   Engineering and Regenerative Medicine}},
Journal = {{TISSUE ENGINEERING PART B-REVIEWS}},
Abstract = {{Extracellular vesicles (Evs) are membrane-enclosed vesicles secreted by
   all cell types that mediate cell-cell communication via their protein,
   lipid, carbohydrate, and nucleic acid (RNA, DNA) cargo. EVs are involved
   in a multitude of physiological processes, including development, cell
   differentiation, and angiogenesis, and have been implicated in tissue
   repair. Thus, they have been suggested to offer opportunities for the
   development of novel cell-free tissue engineering (TE) approaches. In
   this review, we provide an overview of current understanding and
   emerging applications of EVs in TE and address opportunities and
   challenges for clinical translation. In addition, we discuss systemic
   and local routes of delivery of EVs and the advantages and disadvantages
   of different biomaterials in providing a substrate for the sustained
   release of EVs in vivo.
   Impact statement
   Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanoscale, membrane-bound vesicles
   released by most, if not all, cells in the body. They are implicated in
   a wide range of physiological processes and diseases ranging from cancer
   to neurodegeneration, and hold huge potential as mediators of tissue
   regeneration. This has led to an explosion of interest in using EVs in a
   variety of tissue engineering applications. In this review, we provide
   an overview of current progress in the field and highlight the
   opportunities and challenges of harnessing the potential of EVs in
   regenerative medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with cancer frequently experience malnutrition, which is
   associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the
   implementation of strategies for its early detection and for
   intervention should improve the evolution of these patients. Our study
   aim is to design and implement a protocol for outpatients starting
   chemotherapy, by means of which any malnutrition can be identified and
   treated at an early stage. Before starting chemotherapy for patients
   with cancer, a complete assessment was made of their nutritional status,
   using the Nutriscore screening tool. When nutritional risk was detected,
   an interventional protocol was applied. Of 234 patients included in the
   study group, 84 (36\%) required an individualised nutritional approach:
   27 (32.1\%) presented high nutritional risk, 12 had a Nutriscore result
   >= 5 and 45 experienced weight loss during chemotherapy. Among this
   population, the mean weight loss (with respect to normal weight) on
   inclusion in the study was - 3.6\% +/- 8.2. By the end of the
   chemotherapy, the mean weight gain was 0\% +/- 7.3 (p < 0.001) and
   71.0\% of the patients had experienced weight gain or maintenance, with
   respect to the initial weight. More than a third of cancer patients who
   start chemotherapy are candidates for early nutritional intervention.
   This finding highlights the importance of early identification of
   patients at risk in order to improve the efficacy of nutritional
   interventions, regardless of the stage of the disease.}},

Title = {{Towards a classification of rank rN=2 SCFTs. Part II. Special Kahler
   stratification of the Coulomb branch}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{We study the stratification of the singular locus of four dimensional N
   = 2 Coulomb branches. We present a set of self-consistency conditions on
   this stratification which can be used to extend the classification of
   scale-invariant rank 1 Coulomb branch geometries to two complex
   dimensions, and beyond. The calculational simplicity of the arguments
   presented here stems from the fact that the main ingredients needed -
   the rank 1 deformation patterns and the pattern of inclusions of rank 2
   strata - are discrete topological data which satisfy strong
   self-consistency conditions through their relationship to the central
   charges of the SCFT. This relationship of the stratification data to the
   central charges is used here, but is derived and explained in a
   companion paper {[}1] by one of the authors. We illustrate the use of
   these conditions by re-analyzing many previously-known examples of rank
   2 SCFTs, and also by finding examples of new theories. The power of
   these conditions stems from the fact that for Coulomb branch
   stratifications a conjecturally complete list of physically allowed
   ``elementary slices{''} is known. By contrast, constraining the possible
   elementary slices of symplectic singularities relevant for Higgs branch
   stratifications remains an open problem.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical polarity governs various mechanical, chemical, and
   thermodynamic properties of dielectrics. Polar liquids have been amply
   studied, yet the basic mechanisms underpinning their dielectric
   properties remain not fully understood, as standard models following
   Debye's phenomenological approach do not account for quantum effects and
   cannot aptly reproduce the full dc-up-to-THz spectral range. Here, using
   the illustrative case of monohydric alcohols, we show that deep
   tunneling and the consequent intermolecular separation of excess protons
   and ``proton-holes{''} in the polar liquids govern their static and
   dynamic dielectric properties on the same footing. We performed
   systematic ultrabroadband (0-10 THz) spectroscopy experiments with
   monohydric alcohols of different (0.4-1.6 nm) molecular lengths and show
   that the finite lifetime of molecular species and the proton-hole
   correlation length are the two principle parameters responsible for the
   dielectric response of all the studied alcohols across the entire
   frequency range. Our results demonstrate that a quantum nonrotational
   intermolecular mechanism drives the polarization in alcohols while the
   rotational mechanism of molecular polarization plays a secondary role,
   manifesting itself in the sub-terahertz region only.}},

Abstract = {{Alkali-based semiconductor photocathodes have attracted considerable
   attention because of their high quantum efficiency and low electron
   emittance, which can be potentially utilized in the next-generation
   electron sources in ultrafast electron imaging and novel accelerators.
   The alkali-based photocathodes, for example, Cs3Sb, suffer from severe
   degradation issue, while stability can be enhanced by coating protected
   materials such as ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials. However,
   looking for high-performance photocathodes still remains challenging,
   especially the lack of efficient protected 2D nanomaterials to
   simultaneously maintain high quantum efficiency and prolonged lifetime
   of photocathodes. Herein, a series of 222 types of 2D
   nanomaterial-coated Cs3Sb(111) heterojunctions were modeled by our
   home-built script, and the corresponding structural and electronic
   properties were systematically investigated using first-principles
   calculations based on density functional theory. Compared to the
   pristine Cs3Sb basement with a work function (W) of 1.919 eV, the
   Rb2Cl2-Cs3Sb and Na2PdH2-Cs3Sb heterostructures were computationally
   screened with reduced W, and the Na-2(OH)(2)-Cs3Sb, Ca(OH)(2)-Cs3Sb,
   K2Ag2Se2-Cs3Sb, Li-2(OH)(2)-Cs3Sb, LiBH4-Cs3Sb, Mg(OH)(2)-Cs3Sb,
   Al2O2Cl2-Cs3Sb, Cd(OH)(2)-Cs3Sb, and BN-Cs3Sb heterostructures have
   almost unchanged W of 1.919 +/- 0.15 eV. Further, the intrinsic
   relationship between the electronic energy of the 2D materials and the
   change of W was revealed, indicating a strong correlation between the W
   of the 2D-Cs3Sb heterostructure and the electron affinity of the 2D
   materials with a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.904 and a
   coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.818. The underlying mechanism
   for the reduction of W is further revealed by analyzing the charge
   density difference and band alignment of 2D-Cs3Sb. In addition, the
   result indicates that the charge redistribution occurring at the
   interlayer leads to surface dipole moment and change of W. We also
   believe that the present work provides deep insights into the related
   electronic and optical properties of 2D-Cs3Sb heterostructures and
   useful guidelines for screening potential candidates of high-performance
   alkali-based semiconductor photocathodes.}},

   Validation: Determination of Heavy Metals in Dietary Supplements}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY}},

Abstract = {{Dietary supplements may contain heavy metals with the property of
   bioaccumulation in humans. The aim of this research was to validate and
   apply two analytical methods to determine Pb, As, Cr, and Hg in dietary
   supplements by Total Reflection X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (TXRF).
   Methods validation was conducted through a multivariate analysis using a
   central composite design (CCD) and a desirability function. Critical
   values for each study variable were established. The TXRF\_DS\_1 method
   was proposed for Pb, As, and Cr determinations, while the TXRF\_DS\_2
   was established for Hg analysis. The digestion method with an acid
   mixture (HNO3 + HCl + H2O2) was used to break down the organic material
   of dietary supplements. A solution of 10 mu g L-1 Ga was used as an
   internal standard. Excellent analytical performance was obtained as LODs
   of 0.59, 0.41, 0.57, and 0.75 mu g L-1 and LOQs of 1.95, 1.35, 1.90, and
   2.50 mu gL (-1) for Pb, As, Cr, and Hg, respectively. Calibration curves
   showed a good linearity for all elements (R-2>0.999). Excellent accuracy
   and precision in measurements (\% RSD) was achieved. The real and spiked
   samples analysis demonstrated the applicability of the TXRF technique
   (percentage recovery 91-108\%). Besides, two samples were analyzed in a
   comparison study between the TXRF\_DS\_1 method and the ICP-OES method.
   The results obtained showed good agreement between both techniques. The
   TXRF technique allows the analysis of toxic heavy metals in dietary
   supplements, which are marketed in a wide variety of presentations.}},

Abstract = {{Background The Texas/Chihuahua (US/Mexico) border is a medically
   underserved region with many reported barriers for health care access.
   Although Hispanic ethnicity is associated with health disparities for
   many different diseases, the population-based estimates of incidence and
   survival for patients with blood cancer along the border are unknown.
   The authors hypothesized that Hispanic ethnicity and border proximity is
   associated with poor blood cancer outcomes.
   Methods Data from the Texas Cancer Registry (1995-2016) were used to
   investigate the primary exposures of patient ethnicity (Hispanic vs
   non-Hispanic) and geographic location (border vs non-border). Other
   confounders and covariates included sex, age, year of diagnosis,
   rurality, insurance status, poverty indicators, and comorbidities. The
   Mantel-Haenszel method and Cox regression analyses were used to
   determine adjusted effects of ethnicity and border proximity on the
   relative risk (RR) and survival of patients with different blood cancer
   types.
   Results Hispanic patients were diagnosed at a younger age than
   non-Hispanic patients and presented with increased comorbidities.
   Whereas non-Hispanics had a higher incidence of developing blood cancer
   compared with Hispanics overall, Hispanics demonstrated a higher
   incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (RR, 1.48; 95\% CI, 1.44-1.52;
   P < .001) with worse outcomes. Hispanics from the Texas/Chihuahua border
   demonstrated a higher incidence of chronic myeloid leukemia (RR, 1.28;
   95\% CI, 1.07-1.51; P = .02) and acute myeloid leukemia (RR, 1.17; 95\%
   CI, 1.04-1.33; P = .0009) compared with Hispanics living elsewhere in
   Texas.
   Conclusions Hispanic ethnicity and border proximity were associated with
   a poor presentation and an adverse prognosis despite the younger age of
   diagnosis. Future studies should explore differences in disease biology
   and treatment strategies that could drive these regional disparities.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To evaluate the feasibility of using umbilical artery (UA)
   Doppler waveforms to measure fetal heart rate (FHR) short-term variation
   (STV) across gestation.
   Methods This was a prospective longitudinal study, conducted at two
   study sites, of 195 pregnancies considered low risk. Pulsed-wave Doppler
   of the UAs was performed at 4-weekly intervals, between 14 and 40 weeks
   of gestation, using a standardized imaging protocol. Up to 12
   consecutive UA Doppler waveforms were analyzed using offline processing
   software. FHR STV was calculated using average R-R intervals extracted
   from the waveforms and baseline corrected for FHR.
   Results Baseline-corrected FHR STV increased significantly with
   gestational age (conditional R-2 = 0.37; P < 0.0001) and was correlated
   inversely with FHR (conditional R-2 = 0.54; P < 0.0001). The STV ranged
   (median (interquartile range)) from 3.5 (2.9-4.1) ms at 14-20 weeks'
   gestation to 6.3 (4.8-7.7) ms at 34-40 weeks' gestation. The change in
   heart rate STV did not differ between study sites or individual
   sonographers.
   Conclusions UA Doppler waveforms offer a robust and feasible method to
   derive STV of the FHR. It should be emphasized that the UA
   Doppler-derived STV is not interchangeable with measurements derived
   with computerized cardiotocography. Accordingly, further investigations
   are needed to validate associations with outcome, in order to determine
   the value of concurrent fetal cardiovascular and heart rate evaluations
   that are possible with the technique described here. (c) 2020

Title = {{AC Pulsed Field Ablation Is Feasible and Safe in Atrial and Ventricular
   Settings: A Proof-of-Concept Chronic Animal Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{Introduction
   Pulsed field ablation (PFA) exploits the delivery of short high-voltage
   shocks to induce cells death via irreversible electroporation. The
   therapy offers a potential paradigm shift for catheter ablation of
   cardiac arrhythmia. We designed an AC-burst generator and therapeutic
   strategy, based on the existing knowledge between efficacy and safety
   among different pulses. We performed a proof-of-concept chronic animal
   trial to test the feasibility and safety of our method and technology.
   Methods
   We employed 6 female swine - weight 53.75 +/- 4.77 kg - in this study.
   With fluoroscopic and electroanatomical mapping assistance, we performed
   ECG-gated AC-PFA in the following settings: in the left atrium with a
   decapolar loop catheter with electrodes connected in bipolar fashion;
   across the interventricular septum applying energy between the distal
   electrodes of two tip catheters. After procedure and 4-week follow-up,
   the animals were euthanized, and the hearts were inspected for tissue
   changes and characterized. We perform finite element method simulation
   of our AC-PFA scenarios to corroborate our method and better interpret
   our findings.
   Results
   We applied square, 50\% duty cycle, AC bursts of 100 mu s duration, 100
   kHz internal frequency, 900 V for 60 pulses in the atrium and 1500 V for
   120 pulses in the septum. The inter-burst interval was determined by the
   native heart rhythm - 69 +/- 9 bpm. Acute changes in the atrial and
   ventricular electrograms were immediately visible at the sites of AC-PFA
   - signals were elongated and reduced in amplitude (p < 0.0001) and
   tissue impedance dropped (p = 0.011). No adverse event (e.g., esophageal
   temperature rises or gas bubble streams) was observed - while twitching
   was avoided by addition of electrosurgical return electrodes. The
   implemented numerical simulations confirmed the non-thermal nature of
   our AC-PFA and provided specific information on the estimated treated
   area and need of pulse trains. The postmortem chest inspection showed no
   peripheral damage, but epicardial and endocardial discolorations at
   sites of ablation. T1-weighted scans revealed specific tissue changes in
   atria and ventricles, confirmed to be fibrotic scars via trichrome
   staining. We found isolated, transmural and continuous scars. A
   surviving cardiomyocyte core was visible in basal ventricular lesions.
   Conclusion
   We proved that our method and technology of AC-PFA is feasible and safe
   for atrial and ventricular myocardial ablation, supporting their
   systematic investigation into effectiveness evaluation for the treatment
   of cardiac arrhythmia. Further optimization, with energy titration or
   longer follow-up, is required for a robust atrial and ventricular
   AC-PFA.}},

   Pandemic}},
Journal = {{CUREUS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{Background
   With the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, medical systems and providers
   have been forced to undertake substantial changes to staffing structure,
   hospital policy, and surgical indications to remain able to care for
   patients and protect the providers. Here, we present a survey of
   orthopaedic trauma fellowship directors to assess when and what changes
   these individual units have made in order to cope with this global
   pandemic.
   Methods
   The survey was distributed via email to all 62 programs listed in the
   Orthopaedic Trauma Association web site.
   Results
   Twenty four responses were received. The majority of programs
   implemented changes between March 1st and 14th, with nearly all
   splitting teams into individual units, incorporating virtual sign out,
   and reducing the number of available, i.e. exposed, staff, fellows, and
   residents at any particular time.
   Conclusions
   These changes have been implemented in order to proactively maintain the
   functionality of these vital teams to patient care with no definite end
   point to this pandemic in sight. We hope this study provides other
   trauma centers and orthopaedic practices insight into possible
   precautions that can be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.}},

Title = {{Implementation of a Protocol for Peripheral Intravenous Norepinephrine:
   Does It Save Central Line Insertion, Is It Safe?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHARMACY PRACTICE}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Central venous catheters (CVC) are generally recommended for
   norepinephrine administration due to risk of tissue ischemia. Early
   resuscitation, leading to decreased infusion duration, may minimize the
   need for CVCs if norepinephrine can be administered safely through a
   peripheral intravenous catheter (PIV).
   Objective
   A protocol was developed for peripheral administration. Safety, CVC
   placement, and adherence with protocol elements were evaluated.
   Methods
   A single-center, prospective, observational pilot was conducted for
   patients receiving norepinephrine in the Medical Intensive Care Unit
   (MICU). Patients were considered for PIV administration of low dose
   norepinephrine for less than 24 hours based on clinical status and
   anticipated short-term use. Protocolized interventions for PIV's
   included criteria for gauge, number, and site as well as visual
   inspection and evaluation every 2 hours. Data was collected on protocol
   elements to evaluate safety and effectiveness of the protocol.
   Results
   There were 316 occurrences of norepinephrine infusions including 92 via
   PIV (patients may have received multiple treatments). 34\% (31/92) did
   not require a CVC. 3 had infiltrated PIV's without tissue injury.
   Maximum dose adherence was 73\%. 97\% of infusions ran less than 24
   hours. Nursing adherence included: 91\% gauge, 65\% proper site, 99\%
   adequate number, 49\% blood return on initiation, 55\% ongoing blood
   return, and 61\% IV site checked.
   Conclusion
   Our results suggest that norepinephrine is safe to administer through a
   PIV at low doses for less than 24 hours using a protocol. Prevention of
   unnecessary CVC insertion is beneficial by minimizing the risk of
   central line complications thus improving patient morbidity.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss holographic models of extremal and non-extremal black holes
   in contact with a bath in d dimensions, based on a brane world model
   introduced in {[}1]. The main benefit of our setup is that it allows for
   a high degree of analytic control as compared to previous work in higher
   dimensions. We show that the appearance of quantum extremal islands in
   those models is a consequence of the well-understood phase transition of
   RT surfaces, and does not make any direct reference to ensemble
   averaging. For non-extremal black holes the appearance of quantum
   extremal islands has the right behaviour to avoid the information
   paradox in any dimension. We further show that for these models the
   calculation of the full Page curve is possible in any dimension. The
   calculation reduces to numerically solving two ODEs. In the case of
   extremal black holes in higher dimensions, we find no quantum extremal
   islands for a wide range of parameters. In two dimensions, our results
   agree with {[}2] at leading order; however a finite UV cutoff introduced
   by the brane results in subleading corrections. For example, these
   corrections result in the quantum extremal surfaces moving further
   outward from the horizon, and shifting the Page transition to a slightly
   earlier time.}},

Abstract = {{DEL selections are binding assays conducted with mixtures of chemically
   diverse DNA-tagged ligands and a screening target. DEL selections use
   DNA sequence counts to measure target binding, where ideally higher
   affinity ligands will have higher counts than weaker affinity ligands.
   However, there is not always a clear relationship between DNA sequence
   count (assay signal) and binding affinity. This disconnect may be due to
   the fidelity of library chemistry, where reactions often do not go to
   completion, and also to repetitive rounds of binding and elution that
   are standard practice in most DEL selection experiments. We describe
   here a strategy that addresses both of these issues and provides a means
   to calculate ligand affinity from primary selection data. The reaction
   yields of selected compounds during DEL library synthesis can also be
   predicted with this method. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Title = {{Attitudes and beliefs in Swedish midwives and obstetricians towards

Journal = {{BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{Background Gestational weight interventions are important in maternity
   care to counteract adverse pregnancy events. However, qualitative
   findings indicate potential obstacles in the implementation of
   interventions due to the sensitivity of the subject and existing obesity
   stigma. Pregnant women have reported disrespectful or unhelpful
   communication, while some midwives seem to avoid the topic, as not to
   upset women. This descriptive study aimed to provide knowledge about
   maternity care providers' beliefs about obesity, and their attitudes
   towards gestational weight management. Method A web survey was emailed
   to Swedish maternity care clinics. Existing questionnaires, ``Beliefs
   About Obese People{''} (BAOP), ``Perceived weight bias in health
   care{''} and ``Attitudes toward obese patients{''} was used,
   supplemented with questions formulated for this study. An open free-text
   question allowed participants to provide a deeper and more nuanced
   picture of the topic. Results 274 respondents (75\% midwives and 25\%
   obstetricians) participated. One third of respondents found obesity to
   be a more sensitive topic than smoking or alcohol habits, and 17\% of
   midwives agreed to the statement: ``I sometimes avoid talking about
   weight so as not to make the pregnant woman worried or ashamed{''}.
   Having had training in motivational interviewing seemed positively
   associated with midwives' inclination to talk about body weight,
   especially with women with obesity (p = .001), whereas years of working
   experience were not associated. Having received obesity education
   increased confidence in providing adequate information, but still only
   46\% felt they had enough knowledge to provide diet and exercise advice
   to pregnant women with obesity. Qualitative data revealed great empathy
   for women with obesity, and a wish to have more obesity education and
   access to other professionals. Conclusion Swedish maternity care staff
   displayed empathy for women with obesity and found gestational weight
   interventions important, but almost one fifth of midwives sometimes
   avoid the subject of body weight for fear of upsetting women. Education
   about obesity facts, training in person-centered communication, i.e.
   motivational interviewing, and access to dieticians may facilitate
   gestational weight management implementation.}},

Title = {{Proteasome-Bound UCH37/UCHL5 Debranches Ubiquitin Chains to Promote
   Degradation}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR CELL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{80}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{The linkage, length, and architecture of ubiquitin (Ub) chains are all
   important variables in providing tight control over many biological
   paradigms. There are clear roles for branched architectures in
   regulating proteasome-mediated degradation, but the proteins that
   selectively recognize and process these atypical chains are unknown.
   Here, using synthetic and enzyme-derived ubiquitin chains along with
   intact mass spectrometry, we report that UCH37/UCHL5, a
   proteasome-associated deubiquitinase, cleaves K48 branched chains. The
   activity and selectivity toward branched chains is markedly enhanced by
   the proteasomal Ub receptor RPN13/ADRM1. Using reconstituted proteasome
   complexes, we find that chain debranching promotes degradation of
   substrates modified with branched chains under multi-turnover
   conditions. These results are further supported by proteome-wide
   pulse-chase experiments, which show that the loss of UCH37 activity
   impairs global protein turnover. Our work therefore defines UCH37 as a
   debranching deubiquitinase important for promoting proteasomal
   degradation.}},

Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{An evaluation of energy thresholding and acquisition mode for metal
   artifact reduction in Photon-counting detector CT (PCD-CT) compared to
   conventional energy-integrating detector CT (EID-CT) was performed.
   Images of a hip prosthesis phantom placed in a water bath were acquired
   on a scanner with PCD-CT and EID-CT (tube potentials: 100, 120 and 140
   kVp) and energy thresholds (above 55-75 keV) in Macro and Chess mode.
   Only high-energy threshold images (HTI) were used. Metal artifacts were
   quantified by a semi-automated segmentation algorithm, calculating
   artifact volumes, means and standard deviations of CT numbers. Images of
   a human cadaver with hip prosthesis were acquired on the PCD-CT in Macro
   mode as proof-of-concept. Images at 140 kVp showed less metal artifacts
   than 120 kVp or 100 kVp. HTI (70, 75 keV) had fewer artifacts than low
   energy thresholds (55, 60, 65 keV). Fewer artifacts were observed in the
   Macro-HTI (8.9-13.3\%) for cortical bone compared to Chess-HTI
   (9.4-19.1\%) and EID-CT (10.7-19.0\%) whereas in bone marrow Chess-HTI
   (19.9-45.1\%) showed less artifacts compared to Macro-HTI (21.9-38.3\%)
   and EID-CT (36.4-54.9\%). Noise for PCD-CT (56-81 HU) was higher than
   EID-CT (33-36 HU) irrespective of tube potential. High-energy
   thresholding could be used for metal artifact reduction in PCD-CT, but
   further investigation of acquisition modes depending on target structure
   is required.}},

Abstract = {{Background Virtual teamwork as a new way of working is characterized by
   specific challenges and associated job demands. Leadership influence on
   the health of employees has already been proven in direct and personal
   team constellations. Objectives The goal of this article is to provide
   an overview of healthy leadership concepts and illustrate them in a
   virtual working environment. Materials and methods In an explorative
   literature review, currently available findings on healthy leadership
   concepts are evaluated and summarized. Based on this, a suitable
   approach to healthy leadership is identified and the empirical state of
   research in virtual teamwork is presented. Results Our review identified
   health-oriented leadership as the dominant approach among all
   theoretical concepts of healthy leadership. The central results of
   previous studies show that health-oriented leadership can have a
   significantly positive influence on the health of employees. Overall,
   leadership represents a relevant health factor for workplace health
   promotion. Conclusions The empirical state of research shows that there
   is still much need for research on health-oriented leadership in virtual
   teamwork. The relevance of further empirical studies for virtual work
   environments is discussed for science and practice.}},

Abstract = {{Perovskites have attracted much attention due to their remarkable
   optical properties. While it is well established that excitons dominate
   their optical response, the impact of higher excitonic states and
   formation of phonon sidebands in optical spectra still need to be better
   understood. Here, we perform a theoretical study of excitonic properties
   of monolayered hybrid organic perovskites-supported by
   temperature-dependent photo-luminescence measurements. Solving the
   Wannier equation, we obtain microscopic access to the Rydberg-like
   series of excitonic states including their wave functions and binding
   energies. Exploiting the generalized Elliot formula, we calculate the
   photoluminescence spectra demonstrating a pronounced contribution of a
   phonon sideband for temperatures up to 50 K, in agreement with
   experimental measurements. Finally, we predict temperature-dependent
   line widths of the three energetically lowest excitonic transitions and
   identify the underlying phonon-driven scattering processes.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the diet composition of western Baltic cod Gadus
   morhua based on 3150 stomachs sampled year-round between 2016 and 2017
   using angling, gillnetting and bottom trawling, which enhanced the
   spatio-temporal coverage of cod habitats. Cod diet composition in
   shallow areas (<20 m depth) was dominated by benthic invertebrate
   species, mainly the common shore crab Carcinus maneas. Compared to
   historic diet data from the 1960s and 1980s (limited to depth >20 m),
   the contribution of herring Clupea harengus decreased and round goby
   Neogobius melanostomus occurred as a new prey species. Statistical
   modelling revealed significant relationships between diet composition,
   catch depth, fish length and season. Generalized additive modelling
   identified a negative relationship between catch depth and stomach
   content weight, suggesting reduced food intake in winter when cod use
   deeper areas for spawning and during peak summer when cod tend to avoid
   high water temperatures. The results of this study highlight the
   importance of shallow coastal areas as major feeding habitats of adult
   cod in the western Baltic Sea, which were previously unknown because
   samples were restricted to deeper trawlable areas. The results strongly
   suggest that historic stomach analyses overestimated the role of forage
   fish and underestimated the role of invertebrate prey. Eventually, this
   study shows the importance of a comprehensive habitat coverage for
   unbiased stomach sampling programmes to provide a more reliable
   estimation of top predator diet, a key information for food web analyses
   and multispecies models.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Background
   High-intensity functional training (HIFT) has become more popular, and
   the number of practitioners has increased; however, it remains unclear
   whether perturbations in the immune parameters occur, even after one
   single bout. Our aim was to examine acute leucocyte, muscle damage, and
   stress marker responses following a single `Cindy' workout session, and
   compare the results between novice and experienced participants.
   Material and methods
   Twenty-three HIFT practitioners (age 31.0 +/- 1.0 years) completed the
   `Cindy' workout. They were categorized as novice (3-8 months of
   experience; n = 10) and experienced (>= 18 months; n = 13). White blood
   cell (WBC) count, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity, blood cortisol
   level, and lactate concentration were measured. Blood analysis was
   performed before (pre-ex), immediately after (post-ex), 30 min after
   (post-30 min), and 24 h after (post-24 h) a single `Cindy' workout
   session.
   Results
   WBC count was higher post-ex (6.8 to 11.8x10(3)/mu L) and returned to
   baseline values within post-30 min (p<0.01). Neutrophil (3.3 to
   4.5x10(3)/mu L) and lymphocyte levels (2.8 to 5.9x10(3)/mu L) were
   higher post-ex and returned to baseline values after post-24 h, yet
   lymphocytopoenia (2.2x10(3)/mu L) was observed at post-30 min (p<0.01).
   CK increased post-ex (174.9 to 226.7 U.L-1) and remained elevated
   post-24 h. Cortisol (14.7 to 17.0 mu g/dL) and lactate (1.9 to 13.5
   mmol.l(-1)) responses increased post-ex, but only the lactate level was
   reduced at post-30 min (p<0.01). The experienced participants had higher
   WBC, lymphocyte, and cortisol concentrations post-ex than the novice
   ones (p<0.01).
   Conclusions
   A single HIFT session elicited significant acute perturbations in WBC
   count, stress markers, and muscle tissue, which is like other similar
   regimens. Importantly, the experienced participants showed greater
   lymphocyte and cortisol responses than the novice ones.}},

Abstract = {{The new knowledge on the bio-transformations to which the plastic
   material is subjected, raise concerns about their role as environmental
   contaminants. Microplastic have been reported to be responsible for the
   release and distribution of aquatic contaminants such organophosphorus
   esters, pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated
   biphenyls, and phthalate esters. The occurrence, spatiotemporal trends,
   and ecological risk of phthalic acid esters (PAEs) and non phthalate
   plasticizers (NPPs) released from microplastic were investigated in
   water and fish (Sparus aurata) from five sites along the coast of Mahdia
   governorate (Tunisia), during April 2018-March 2019. In seawater the
   most abundant and frequently detected congeners were dibutyl phthalate
   (DBP, 0.017 mg L-1 and 0.055 mg L-1), diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP, 0.075
   mg L-1 and 0.219 mg L-1), di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP, 0.071 mg L-1
   and 4.594 mg L-1), and di(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (DEHT, 0.634 mg
   L-1 and 2.424 mg L-1). (EPAEs: 1.416 mg L-1 and 5.581 mg L-1; ENPPs:
   9.191 mg L-1 and 26.296 mg L-1), confirming that such compounds
   bioconcentrate through the food chain. DBP (0.389 and 0.817 mg L-1),
   DiBP (0.101 and 0.921 mg L-1), DEHP (0.726 and 1.771 mg L-1) and DEHT
   (9.191 and 23.251 mg L-1) were predominant also in S. aurata affirming
   that such compounds bioconcentrate through the food chain. Overall,
   Tunisian samples i) were much more contaminated than counterparts
   previously investigated for the same pollutants from other world areas,
   and ii) revealed NPPs at higher levels than PAEs, confirming that such
   plasticizers are increasingly replacing conventional PAEs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the effects of political pressure groups (lobbies)
   on transboundary emissions of individual countries and on the stability
   of international environmental agreements to reduce emissions. We
   consider two types of lobbies, industry and environmentalists, and we
   allow for asymmetric countries to consider differences in lobby
   strengths to study strategic international spillovers of national lobby
   activities. In our model, lobby groups in countries that are
   non-signatories to the agreement will impact abatement of the lobby's
   home country only. In contrast, lobby activities in signatory countries
   have spillover effects on the abatement decisions of other member
   countries. As lobby strength impacts abatement, it will, in turn, impact
   the incentives to participate in the agreement. We find that lobby
   activities from both lobby groups, industry and environmentalists, can
   have the potential to facilitate international cooperation to abate
   global pollution. This, however, depends on the distribution of lobby
   activities across countries and on whether green lobby groups have a
   national or international focus.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of next generation DNA sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized
   clinical medicine by enabling wide-spread testing for genomic anomalies
   and polymorphisms. With that explosion in testing, however, come several
   informatics challenges including managing large amounts of data,
   interpreting the results and providing clinical decision support. We
   present Flype, a web-based bioinformatics platform built by a small
   group of bioinformaticians working in a community hospital setting, to
   address these challenges by allowing us to: (a) securely accept data
   from a variety of sources, (b) send orders to a variety of destinations,
   (c) perform secondary analysis and annotation of NGS data, (d) provide a
   central repository for all genomic variants, (e) assist with tertiary
   analysis and clinical interpretation, (f) send signed out data to our
   EHR as both PDF and discrete data elements, (g) allow population
   frequency analysis and (h) update variant annotation when literature
   knowledge evolves. We discuss the multiple use cases Flype supports such
   as (a) in-house NGS tests, (b) in-house pharmacogenomics (PGX) tests,
   (c) dramatic scale-up of genomic testing using an external lab, (d)
   consumer genomics using two external partners, and (e) a variety of
   reporting tools. The source code for Flype is available upon request to
   the authors.}},

Abstract = {{Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is used worldwide to screen for
   fetal aneuploidy. Although previous studies on the psychosocial aspects
   of NIPT have focused on satisfaction regarding the test, we surveyed
   women who experienced negative emotions after receiving NIPT. From
   January 2018 to March 2019, we surveyed pregnant women whose NIPT
   results were negative, one year after the test. Of the 526 respondents,
   35 (6.7\%) regretted receiving NIPT and blamed themselves for taking it.
   We assigned this 6.7\% of respondents to the negative emotion group.
   Although, 76.5\% of the participants in the negative emotion group
   reported they would like to take NIPT for their next pregnancy, it was
   significantly lower as compared to the control group (92\%).
   Furthermore, 31.9\% of respondents in the control group reported that
   they would recommend similar tests to their relatives and friends.
   Conversely, in the negative emotion group, this proportion was lower at
   17.1\%. This suggests that guilt over testing may be meaningful. Thus,
   this study showed that some NIPT examinees regretted taking the test and
   blamed themselves. Respondents reported experiencing stress, anxiety,
   and depression even before NIPT affirming that it is important to
   address pregnant women's psychosocial status during pre-test genetic
   counseling.}},

Title = {{Repeating History: Soviet Offensive Counterintelligence Active Measures}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE}},
Abstract = {{Drawing on the formerly classified in-house journal KGB Collection, this
   article argues that active measures, commonly known as Soviet foreign
   influence operations, were the concept and practice in which offensive
   counterintelligence encroached on foreign intelligence functions. In the
   1960s, KGB counterintelligence officers were urged to implement active
   measures, instead of passive surveillance, by cultivating and recruiting
   foreign visitors and Soviet citizens with the aim of using them to
   penetrate Western institutions and collect sensitive intelligence. The
   counterintelligence directorate occasionally supervised foreign
   operations to implement offensive tactics. Given the parallels between
   the Soviet and Russian intelligence services, the expansion of the
   counterintelligence agency (the Federal Security Service) in post-Soviet
   Russia can be interpreted as its increased interest in and capabilities
   for active measures abroad.}},

Abstract = {{Complex fuzzy sets are the novel extension of Zadeh's fuzzy sets. In
   this paper, we comprise the introduction to the concept of xi-complex
   fuzzy sets and proofs of their various set theoretical properties. We
   define the notion of (alpha,delta)-cut sets of xi-complex fuzzy sets and
   justify the representation of an xi-complex fuzzy set as a union of
   nested intervals of these cut sets. We also apply this newly defined
   concept to a physical situation in which one may judge the performance
   of the participants in a given task. In addition, we innovate the
   phenomena of xi-complex fuzzy subgroups and investigate some of their
   fundamental algebraic attributes. Moreover, we utilize this notion to
   define level subgroups of these groups and prove the necessary and
   sufficient condition under which an xi-complex fuzzy set is xi-complex
   fuzzy subgroup. Furthermore, we extend the idea of xi-complex fuzzy
   normal subgroup to define the quotient group of a group G by this
   particular xi-complex fuzzy normal subgroup and establish an isomorphism
   between this quotient group and a quotient group of G by a specific
   normal subgroup GA xi.}},

   construct a separable potential to reproduce the S-1(0) phase shift

   data. We include superfluid fluctuations within a strong-coupling
   approximation developed by Nozieres and Schmitt-Rink and determine
   self-consistently the superfluid order parameter as well as the chemical
   potential. We show that the quantum depletion, which gives a fraction of
   noncondensed neutrons at zero temperature due to quantum pairing
   fluctuations, plays an important role not only near the critical
   temperature from superfluid states to normal states but also at zero
   temperature. We derive the dispersion relation of Anderson-Bogoliubov
   modes associated with phase fluctuations and show also that there is a
   nonzero fraction of noncondensed components in the neutron number as a
   result of the strong-coupling effect. Our results indicate that

Title = {{Sequential Epiphyseal Cartilage Changes of Femoral Heads in C57BL/6
   Female Mice Treated with Excessive Glucocorticoids}},
Journal = {{CARTILAGE}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   Excessive use of glucocorticoids (GCs) may cause adverse effects on the
   skeletal system in children. However, only a few studies have reported
   the effects of GCs on the epiphyseal cartilage. This study aimed to
   uncover the subsequent epiphyseal cartilage changes of immature femoral
   heads after excessive GC treatment in a mouse model and explain the
   pathological changes preliminarily.
   Design
   Female C57BL/6 mice were divided into control and model (excessive GC
   treatment) groups. The structure of the femoral heads was evaluated by
   using micro-computed tomography, hematoxylin-eosin staining, and
   safranin staining analyses. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect
   angiogenesis and cartilage metabolism. Western blotting and TUNEL
   staining were used to examine epiphyseal cartilage chondrocyte
   apoptosis. Primary chondrocytes were isolated from the femoral heads of
   healthy mice for in vitro studies. The effects of GCs on chondrocyte
   apoptosis and metabolism were determined by flow cytometry and Western
   blotting.
   Results
   The epiphyseal cartilage ossification had started at 4 weeks
   posttreatment in a portion of mice; the ossification presented as a
   sequential process in the model group, while the epiphyseal cartilage
   maintained an unossified state in the control group. Vascular invasion
   into the epiphyseal cartilage of the model mice was observed at 4 weeks
   posttreatment. GCs induced chondrocyte apoptosis and altered chondrocyte
   metabolism in the epiphyseal cartilage.
   Conclusions
   The epiphyseal cartilage ossification accelerated in the femoral heads
   of female C57BL/6 mice after excessive GC treatment. Increased
   chondrocyte apoptosis, altered chondrocyte metabolism, as well as
   increased vascular invasion, are the potential factors influencing
   epiphyseal cartilage ossification.}},

Title = {{A cost-benefit analysis of implementing urban heat island adaptation
   measures in small- and medium-sized cities in Austria}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{Urban heat islands are an increasing concern even in small- to
   medium-sized cities, although these areas are still understudied
   especially in terms of the economic feasibility of adaptation options.
   This paper uses adaptation scenarios produced by an urban climate model
   as inputs to a social cost-benefit analysis in three small- to
   medium-sized cities in Austria: Modling, Klagenfurt, and Salzburg. The
   adaptation scenarios, which consider measures such as increasing the
   reflectivity of different sealed surfaces (referred to as the White City
   scenario) as well as greening measures (i.e. the Green City scenario),
   show decreases in the number of hot days (T-max >= 30 degrees C) when
   implemented. Benefits include reductions in heat-related mortality,
   which are modeled based on trends of daily mortality and climate data,
   reduced morbidity, productivity loss, and numerous urban ecosystem
   services. The results demonstrate favorable benefit-cost ratios of a
   combination of measures (White and Green City) of 1.27, 1.36, and 2.68
   for Modling, Klagenfurt, and Salzburg, respectively, indicating positive
   economic grounds for supporting policies in line with the adaptation
   scenarios. Furthermore, results of the Green City vs. White City showed
   higher benefits for the combined and Green City scenarios despite higher
   costs for each of the cities.}},

Abstract = {{Due to their unique hysteretic energy dissipation capacity, shape memory
   alloy (SMA) wires are particularly interesting for the development of
   new-type of intelligent vibration control systems for structures.
   However, in structural control, most of the vibrations occur in high
   strain rate regimes, which interfere the release of self-generated heat
   and thus influence the hysteretic dissipation. This paper proposes a
   strain rate dependent formulation of the latent heat evolution and aims
   to improve the accuracy of existing macroscopic modeling approaches
   developed for SMA wires particularly for the dynamic load cases. The
   proposed formulation is determined phenomenologically and implemented in
   a continuum thermomechanical framework based constitutive SMA wire model
   without impairing the simplicity and robustness of the solution process.
   The proposed formulation is validated by cyclic tensile tests conducted
   on SMA wires. Results show that the calculations using the formulation
   can predict the wire response more accurately than the strain rate
   independent formulation. For the simulation of multistory frame
   structures incorporating multiple SMA wires, the governing equations are
   driven. Shaking table tests are conducted on a 3-story frame structure
   under harmonic and seismic excitation. The responses of the structure
   are successfully replicated using the strain rate dependent latent heat
   formulation.}},

Abstract = {{The EU's external promotion of norms and the idea of normative power
   Europe itself are increasingly contested, which is especially true in
   the EU's southern neighbourhood. However, whereas scholars of EU foreign
   policy acknowledge the contestation of external norms, they find it
   difficult to understand why other normative frameworks could be equally
   or more appealing to Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) countries,
   as they entail norms that are less prominent in the Western catalogue of
   liberal values. To facilitate the detection and analysis of a wider set
   of norms, we situate them along several continua of norm orientations
   and apply this framework to the EU's southern neighbourhood. EU foreign
   policy scholars can then examine whether different norms overlap or
   compete or are complementary or even incompatible, and the extent to
   which values promoted by European actors are congruent with normative
   frameworks in the MENA region.}},

Title = {{Evaluating the Performance of Indian Domestic Banks Through the Lens of
   Pareto-Koopmans Efficiency}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL BUSINESS REVIEW}},
Abstract = {{In this article, we use data envelopment analysis to obtain
   Pareto-Koopmans (PK) measures of technical efficiency (TE) of India's
   domestic commercial banks for the period between the global financial
   crisis and merger of the State Bank of India and its associates. This
   article aims to contribute to the growing body of literature on the
   efficiency of Indian banks by adopting the concept of PK efficiency to
   overcome the restrictive nature of radial and orientation-specific TE
   measures. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first of its
   kind where one can disaggregate overall TE into two separate components
   by measuring input and output efficiency in the Indian banking sector.
   We assume a three-input three-output technology for both groups and
   utilize a balanced panel of 26 public sector banks (PSBs) and 19 private
   banks (PVBs) from 2010-2011 to 2016-2017. The mean PK efficiencies
   across the study period are 0.86 and 0.72 for PSBs and PVBs,
   respectively. Hence, there is considerable scope of improvement in the
   productive performance of PVBs. The disaggregation of PK efficiencies
   into input- and output-specific components reveals that for PSBs, the
   inefficiencies primarily result from physical assets, while for PVBs,
   they emerge mainly from other incomes. Hence, the management should
   specifically target these aspects of banking operations to improve their
   performance. Second-stage regression analysis reveals that PK-TE has a
   non-linear relationship with the size of a bank. Deposit to liability
   ratio and management quality negatively impact PK efficiency, while
   priority sector lending positively influences it.}},

Abstract = {{Background: To analyze mean corneal powers and astigmatisms on anterior,
   posterior, and total cornea in patients with keratoconus as calculated
   according to various keratometric measurements using a Scheimpflug
   camera.
   Methods: We examined the left eyes of 64 patients (41 males and 23
   females; mean age 29.94 +/- 6.63 years) with keratoconus. We measured
   simulated K (Sim-K), posterior K, true net power (TNP) and four types of
   total corneal refractive powers (TCRP). We then used the obtained values
   to analyze mean K, and corneal astigmatism. TCRP were measured at 2.0
   +/- 5.0 mm.
   Results: Mean corneal powers from Sim K, posterior K, and TNP were 49.12
   +/- 3.99, - 7.39 +/- 0.79, and 47.78 +/- 4.09 diopters, respectively.
   For TCRP centered on the pupil, mean K tended to decrease with
   measurement area (all p < 0.01). While, both mean K and astigmatism
   measured using TCRP centered on the apex decreased with measurement area
   (all p < 0.001). TCRP centered on the apex were greater than those
   centered on the pupil for mean K values calculated using TCRP (all p <
   0.001). The proportion of WTR was greatest on the anterior and total
   cornea. As the measurement area moved to the periphery, the proportion
   of WTR increased.
   Conclusions: Mean corneal powers and astigmatisms on total cornea with
   keratoconus change depending on calculation methods and measurement
   areas.}},

Abstract = {{The site of Maucallacta (Pampacolca district, department of Arequipa,

   Although the presence of shell and-probably-bird offerings has been
   observed, the vast majority of animal remains belong to Andean camelids.
   The anatomical selection of camelid remains in Maucallacta, as well as
   numerous traces of cooking and tool marks, corresponding to butchering
   methods known from ethnographic observations, indicate that the animals
   were consumed. The article considers the possibility of the ritual

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{In drug repurposing approaches, the chemically diverse and potentially
   safe molecules can be explored as therapeutic potential beyond those
   originally targeted indications. However, accessible information on a
   limited number of drug pipelines can lead to competitive over-heating
   issues, and intellectual property rights also restrict the free
   investigation in chemical space. As a complementary approach to the
   drawbacks, ring systems of approved drugs (instead of clinical drugs)
   can be optimized and used for repurposing purposes. In this study,
   bi-directional target (T) and ring system (R) dual screening (TR
   screening) was developed for the repurposing of their rarely used ring
   systems from FDA approved drugs. The TR screening suggested RAR beta and

Abstract = {{Background: The inherited thrombophilic mutations of the factor V gene
   (FVG1691A Leiden-FVL), prothrombin gene (PTG20210A), and the
   methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene C677T (MTHFR C677T) are risk
   factors for thromboembolic events and are related to the pathogenesis of
   vascular diseases. Objectives: The main objective of this study was to
   explore the role of these factors in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney
   disease (CKD) and survival of patients with CKD-5 receiving
   haemodialysis. Methods: A cohort of 395 patients with CKD-5 on
   haemodialysis, from 6 dialysis units in Crete, Greece were recruited
   based on their medical records and were followed for 5 years. We
   collected data on CKD-5 aetiology, thrombophilic gene expression,
   vascular access thrombosis, time of death, and causes of death. Results:
   The mutated genes just as prevalent in patients with CKD-5 as they were
   in a control group with no renal disease (p > 0.05). FVL heterozygosity
   was significantly more prevalent (11.4 vs. 5.7\%; p = 0.036) in patients
   presented with CKD of unknown aetiology, compared to CKD secondary to
   known aetiologies. The survival of patients with CKD-5 receiving
   haemodialysis was not affected by the presence of any thrombophilic
   mutation. This held true for the whole cohort and for the cohort that
   included only lethal vascular events. Most patients with MTHFR C677T
   heterozygosity, and all patients with MTHFR C677T homozygosity, died
   from vascular events during the follow-up period. Conclusion: The FVL
   mutation may act as a risk factor for CKD. This study increases our
   understanding of molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of CKD of
   unknown aetiology. tau he presence of thrombophilic mutations did not
   affect the overall survival of patients with CKD-5. This finding
   probably reflects the effect of medical care on patient outcomes.}},

Title = {{eHealth Practices in Cancer Survivors With BMI in Overweight or Obese
   Categories: Latent Class Analysis Study}},
Journal = {{JMIR CANCER}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: eHealth technologies have been found to facilitate
   health-promoting practices among cancer survivors with BMI in overweight
   or obese categories; however, little is known about their engagement
   with eHealth to promote weight management and facilitate
   patient-clinician communication.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to determine whether eHealth
   use was associated with sociodemographic characteristics, as well as
   medical history and experiences (ie, patient-related factors) among
   cancer survivors with BMI in overweight or obese categories.
   Methods: Data were analyzed from a nationally representative
   cross-sectional survey (National Cancer Institute's Health Information
   National Trends Survey). Latent class analysis was used to derive
   distinct classes among cancer survivors based on sociodemographic
   characteristics, medical attributes, and medical experiences. Logistic
   regression was used to examine whether class membership was associated
   with different eHealth practices.
   Results: Three distinct classes of cancer survivors with BMI in
   overweight or obese categories emerged: younger with no comorbidities,
   younger with comorbidities, and older with comorbidities. Compared to
   the other classes, the younger with comorbidities class had the highest
   probability of identifying as female (73\%) and Hispanic (46\%) and
   feeling that clinicians did not address their concerns (75\%). The older
   with comothidities class was 6.5 times more likely than the younger with
   comothidities class to share eHealth data with a clinician (odds ratio
   {[}OR] 6.53, 95\% CI 1.08-39.43). In contrast, the younger with no
   comorbidities class had a higher likelihood of using a computer to look
   for health information (OR 1.93, 95\% CI 1.10-3.38), using an electronic
   device to track progress toward a health-related goal (OR 2.02, 95\% CI
   1.08-3.79), and using the internet to watch health-related YouTube
   videos (OR 2.70, 95\% CI 1.52-4.81) than the older with comothidities
   class.
   Conclusions: Class membership was associated with different patterns of
   eHealth engagement, indicating the importance of tailored digital
   strategies for delivering effective care. Future eHealth weight loss
   interventions should investigate strategies to engage younger cancer
   survivors with comorbidities and address racial and ethnic disparities
   in eHealth use.}},

Title = {{Effect of Traditional Chinese Medicine Poge Heart-Saving Decoction on
   Cardiac Function in Heart Failure Rat Model}},
Journal = {{EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{Background. Poge heart-saving decoction (PHASD) has been used as a
   medicine treating heart failure in China for many years. The study aimed
   to explore the effect of PHSD on cardiac function in heart failure
   conditions and its underlying mechanism. Methods. Adriamycin was used to
   induce the model of heart failure (HF) in rats. Sixty rats were randomly
   divided into six groups: blank control group, sham group, 9.33 g/kg
   group (low-PHSD, test group), 13.995 g/kg group (moderate-PHSD, test
   group), 18.66 g/kg group (high-PHSD, test group), and fosinopril group
   (4.67 mg/kg, comparison test group). Cardiac ultrasound was used to
   evaluate the cardiac function of the rats, and radioimmunoassay was used
   to measure aldosterone (ALD) and angiotensin II (AngII) levels in the
   serum. Results. Compared with the blank control group, the left
   ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDd) and left ventricular
   end-systolic dimension (LVEDs) in the sham group were increased (1.04
   +/- 0.12 vs. 0.67 +/- 0.13 cm; 0.75 +/- 0.13 vs. 0.28 +/- 0.10 cm; P <
   0.05), and the left ventricular ejection fraction was decreased (36.65
   +/- 5.74 vs. 76.09 +/- 4.23\%; P < 0.05). The ejection fraction of HF
   rats was increased in 9.33 g/kg group, 13.995 g/kg group, and 18.66 g/kg
   group compared with those of the sham group (57.13 +/- 1.63, 58.43 +/-
   1.98, and 59.21 +/- 1.37 vs. 36.65 +/- 5.74\%; ). PHSD also improved
   cardiac function by reducing the LVEDd and LVEDs (0.88 +/- 0.11, 0.75
   +/- 0.13, and 0.72 +/- 0.18 vs. 1.04 +/- 0.12 cm; 0.62 +/- 0.10, 0.63
   +/- 0.17, and 0.45 +/- 0.11 vs. 0.75 +/- 0.13 cm; P < 0.05 ). The levels
   of ALD and AngII in the serum of rats in the sham group were
   significantly higher than those in the blank control group (371.58 +/-
   39.25 vs. 237.12 +/- 17.35 mu g/L; 232.18 +/- 16.33 vs. 159.44 +/- 18.42
   pg/L; P < 0.05 ). The ALD and AngII of the rats in all of the three PHSD
   groups and the fosinopril group were decreased (276.81 +/- 25.63, 277.18
   +/- 21.35, 268.19 +/- 19.28, and 271.47 +/- 28.96 vs. 371.58 +/- 39.25
   mu g/L; 169.41 +/- 27.53, 168.81 +/- 19.78, 164.23 +/- 21.34, and 174.27
   +/- 22.84 vs. 232.18 +/- 16.33 pg/L; P < 0.05 ). The histopathological
   changes of the myocardium in the sham group showed the disorganized
   fiber, shaded staining, fracture, and zonation. The fracture of the
   myocardium was relieved in all groups except the sham group and the
   blank control group. Conclusion. Therefore, PHSD could shorten LVEDd and
   LVEDs of rats and reverse ventricular remodeling. The mechanism might be
   related to the inhibition of the activation level of
   renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (especially ALD and AngII) and
   decreasing the postload of the heart.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   Green human resource management (GHRM) is a new management philosophy
   and pattern that applies the concept of ``green{''} to human resource
   management, which plays an important role in realizing environmental
   goals and obtaining competitive advantage. Based on 201 effective
   samples from 3 manufacturing enterprises, this study investigates the
   relationship between GRHM, green organization identity (GOI),
   environmental values and organizational citizenship behaviors for the
   environment (OCBEs). The results show that GRHM has a significant
   positive impact on OCBEs, and GOI plays an intermediary role in the
   relationship between GRHM and OCBEs, and environmental values moderate
   the impact of GRHM on GOI and OCBEs. The findings have important
   theoretical implications for enterprises to achieve green development
   strategy.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This study selects three manufacturing enterprises certified by the
   environmental management system ISO14001, which meet the environmental
   protection requirements of the Chinese Government, local communities and
   customers. Through interviews and referring to enterprise documents, the
   researchers find that the enterprises have set environmental protection
   standards such as energy consumption, solid waste emissions, water
   consumption and waste recycling. The enterprises surveyed have adopted
   the GRHM practice, such as green training for employees, encouraging
   employees to participate in green activities and so on. This study
   collects data in two ways: on-the-spot and entrustment questionnaire
   distribution. In the first stage, the data of GRHM and environmental
   values were collected. A total of 277 questionnaires were distributed
   and 264 were sent back, among them 252 were valid.
   Findings
   GRHM has a positive impact on OCBEs. GOI mediates the influence of GRHM
   on the OCBEs, and environmental values moderate the effect of GRHM on
   organizational identity and OCBEs.
   Originality/value
   This paper investigates the effect and mechanism of GRHM in China and
   provides theoretical guidance for enterprises to implement green
   management effectively.}},

Abstract = {{For over 25 years, researchers have debated whether physically salient
   stimuli capture attention in an automatic manner, independent of the
   observer's goals, or whether the capture of attention depends on the
   match between a stimulus and the observer's task set. Recent evidence
   suggests an intermediate position in which salient stimuli automatically
   produce a priority signal, but the capture of attention can be prevented
   via an inhibitory mechanism that suppresses the salient stimulus. Here,
   proponents from multiple sides of the debate describe how their original
   views have changed in light of recent research, as well as remaining
   areas of disagreement. These perspectives highlight some emerging areas
   of consensus and provide new directions for future research on
   attentional capture.}},

Title = {{Facile method for fabricating atomic oxygen resistant polyimide films
   with excellent optical homogeneity containing hyperbranched polysiloxane}},
Journal = {{HIGH PERFORMANCE POLYMERS}},
Abstract = {{Mechanically robust optical homogeneous polyimide (PI) films with
   desirable atomic oxygen (AO) erosion duration were fabricated by
   initially synthesizing amine-functionalized hyperbranched polysiloxane
   (NH2-HBPSi), then reinforcing the pristine polyimide skeleton with it
   via copolycondensation reactions. NH2-HBPSi macromolecule imparts
   desirable AO survivability to the resulting hybrids. The mass loss per
   unit area of hybrid films had a downward trend with rising NH2-HBPSi
   content and AO dose before the complete silica protective layer was
   formed. It has been proven by the experiments in an underground
   simulated AO environment. It decreased to 1\% of that of pristine
   polyimide when NH2-HBPSi accounted for 30\% of the solid content after
   24 h AO attack. The stable thickness uniformity that can meet the
   Rayleigh criterion was achieved in a 30 wt\% HBPSi PI film, mainly due
   to the selection of the best process parameters. Meanwhile, 30 wt\%
   HBPSi PI demonstrates satisfactory mechanical properties, with a tensile
   strength of 228.9 MPa and elongation at break of 7.3\%. The
   characterization of scanning electron microscopy confirmed that pristine
   polyimide was substantially eroded after AO exposure while the surface
   morphology of 30 wt\% HBPSi polyimide showed no evident change. The low
   AO erosion yield and prominent film thickness uniformity may find
   extensive usage in ultra-lightweight space diffractive optical elements
   (DOE) working in low earth orbit (LEO).}},

Abstract = {{Lattice deformations act on the low-energy excitations of Dirac
   materials as effective axial vector fields. This allows one to directly
   detect quantum anomalies of Dirac materials via the response to axial
   gauge fields. We investigate the parity anomaly in Dirac nodal line
   semimetals induced by lattice vibrations and establish a topological
   piezoelectric effect; that is, periodic lattice deformations generate
   topological Hall currents that are transverse to the deformation field.
   The currents induced by this piezoelectric effect are dissipationless
   and their magnitude is completely determined by the length of the nodal
   ring, leading to a semiquantized transport coefficient. Our theoretical
   proposal can be experimentally realized in various nodal line
   semimetals, such as CaAgP and Ca3P2.}},

Journal = {{LETHAIA}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{457-476}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Cephalopoda is the only class of molluscs in which virtually all its
   modern representatives have a pair of powerful jaws. There is little
   doubt that jaws have contributed to the evolutionary success of
   cephalopods, but their origin still remains a mystery. Though
   cephalopods appeared at the end of the Cambrian, the oldest unequivocal
   jaws have been reported to date from the Late Devonian, though they were
   initially interpreted as phyllopod crustaceans of the suborder
   Discinocarina. After their relation with ammonoids was proven, they were
   considered as opercula, and only later their mandibular nature was
   recognized and widely accepted. Finds of discinocarins from Silurian
   deposits are still considered as opercula of ammonoid ancestors -
   nautiloids of the order Orthocerida. However, according to modern ideas,
   there is no place within their soft body for the location of such large
   opercula. Moreover, the repeated appearance of very similar structures
   in the same evolutionary line at least twice, but in different places of
   the body and for different purposes seems highly improbable. A new
   hypothesis is proposed herein, in which the Silurian fossils, earlier
   assigned to Discinocarina, are not specialized opercula, but protective
   shields, to defend orthocerids not from the predators, but from their
   own prey. The chitinous plates around the mouth likely appeared in the
   Silurian orthocerids for protection from such damage and later, during
   Silurian and Devonian, most likely gradually evolved into the jaws.}},

Title = {{The impact of funding for federally qualified health centers on
   utilization and emergency department visits in Massachusetts}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{Importance
   Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) receive federal funding to
   serve medically underserved areas and provide a range of services
   including comprehensive primary care, enabling services, and behavioral
   health care. Greater funding for FQHCs could increase the local
   availability of clinic-based care and help reduce more costly resource
   use, such as emergency department visits (ED).
   Objective
   To examine the impact of funding increases for FQHCs after the ACA on
   the use of FQHCs and EDs.
   Methods
   Retrospective study using the Massachusetts All Payer Claims Database
   (APCD) 2010-2013 that included APCD enrollees in 559 Massachusetts ZIP
   codes (N = 6,173,563 in 2010). We calculated shift-share predictions of
   changes in FQHC funding at the ZIP code-level for FQHCs that received
   Community Health Center funds in any year, 2010-13 (N = 31). Outcomes
   were the number of ZIP code enrollees with visits to FQHCs and EDs,
   overall and for emergent and non-emergent diagnoses.
   Results
   In 2010, 4\% of study subjects visited a FQHC, and they were more likely
   to be younger, have Medicaid, and live in low-income areas. We found
   that a standard deviation increase in prior year FQHC funding (+31
   percentage point (pp)) at the ZIP code level was associated with a 2.3pp
   (95\% CI 0.7pp to 3.8pp) increase in enrollees with FQHC visits and a
   1.3pp (95\% CI -2.3pp to -0.3pp) decrease in enrollees with non-emergent
   ED visits, but no significant change in emergent ED visits (0.3pp, 95\%
   CI -0.8pp to 1.4pp).
   Conclusions
   We found that areas exposed to greater FQHC funding increases had more
   growth in the number of enrollees seen by FQHCs and greater reductions
   in ED visits for non-emergent conditions. Investment in FQHCs could be a
   promising approach to increase access to care for underserved
   populations and reduce costly ED visits, especially for primary care
   treatable or non-emergent conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Chloroplast biotechnology is a route for novel crop metabolic
   engineering. The potential bio-confinement of transgenes, the high
   protein expression and the possibility to organize genes into operons
   represent considerable advantages that make chloroplasts valuable
   targets in agricultural biotechnology. In the last 3 decades,
   chloroplast genomes from a few economically important crops have been
   successfully transformed. The main bottlenecks that prevent efficient
   transformation in a greater number of crops include the dearth of proven
   selectable marker gene-selection combinations and tissue culture methods
   for efficient regeneration of transplastomic plants. The prospects of
   increasing organelle size are attractive from several perspectives,
   including an increase in the surface area of potential targets. As a
   proof-of-concept, we generated Solanum tuberosum (potato)
   macro-chloroplast lines overexpressing the tubulin-like GTPase protein
   gene FtsZ1 from Arabidopsis thaliana. Macro-chloroplast lines exhibited
   delayed growth at anthesis; however, at the time of harvest there was no
   significant difference in height between macro-chloroplast and wild-type
   lines. Macro-chloroplasts were successfully transformed by biolistic
   DNA-delivery and efficiently regenerated into homoplasmic transplastomic
   lines. We also demonstrated that macro-chloroplasts accumulate the same
   amount of heterologous protein than wild-type organelles, confirming
   efficient usage in plastid engineering. Advantages and limitations of
   using enlarge compartments in chloroplast biotechnology are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Cell culturing is a basic experimental technique in cell biology and
   medical science. However, culturing high-quality cells with a high
   degree of reproducibility relies heavily on expert skills and tacit
   knowledge, and it is not straightforward to scale the production process
   due to the education bottleneck. Although many automated culture systems
   have been developed and a few have succeeded in mass production
   environments, very few robots are permissive of frequent protocol
   changes, which are often required in basic research environments.
   LabDroid is a general-purpose humanoid robot with two arms that performs
   experiments using the same tools as humans. Combining our newly
   developed AI software with LabDroid, we developed a variable scheduling
   system that continuously produces subcultures of cell lines without
   human intervention. The system periodically observes the cells on plates
   with a microscope, predicts the cell growth curve by processing cell
   images, and decides the best times for passage. We have succeeded in
   developing a system that maintains the cultures of two HEK293A cell
   plates with no human intervention for 192 h.}},

Abstract = {{Abscisic acid (ABA) signaling components play an important role in the
   drought stress response in plants. Arabidopsis thaliana ENHANCED
   RESPONSE TO ABA1 (ERA1) encodes the beta-subunit of farnesyltransferase
   and regulates ABA signaling and the dehydration response. Therefore,
   ERA1 is an important candidate gene for enhancing drought tolerance in
   numerous crops. However, a rice (Oryza sativa) ERA1 homolog has not been
   characterized previously. Here, we show that rice osera1 mutant lines,
   harboring CRISPR/Cas9-induced frameshift mutations, exhibit similar leaf
   growth as control plants but increased primary root growth. The osera1
   mutant lines also display increased sensitivity to ABA and an enhanced
   response to drought stress through stomatal regulation. These results
   illustrate that OsERA1 is a negative regulator of primary root growth
   under nonstressed conditions and also of responses to ABA and drought
   stress in rice. These findings improve our understanding of the role of
   ABA signaling in the drought stress response in rice and suggest a
   strategy to genetically improve rice.}},

   (HMC-PDFT) that is a weighted average of complete-active-space
   self-consistent-field (CASSCF) and multiconfiguration pair-density
   functional theory (MC-PDFT) energies with a semiempirical parameter to
   control the fraction of CASSCF energy. We also explore a more general
   two-parameter hybrid method with a scaled correlation energy that allows
   us to compare to the recently proposed lambda-MC-PDFT method. We scan
   the parameter space for the scaled-correlation method using test sets
   consisting of electronic excitation energies and diatomic bond energies,
   and we find no significant improvement by introducing the scaling
   parameter. We find that unscaled HMC-PDFT offers significantly improved
   accuracy over both CASSCF and the original MC-PDFT for a wide range of
   systems, and we present as an example of this approach ``tPBEO{''}, the
   ``translated{''} MC-PDFT generalization of the popular PBEO hybrid

Abstract = {{Johne's disease (JD) caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp.
   paratuberculosis (MAP) is a chronic, wasting infectious disease in
   ruminants that causes enormous economic losses to the dairy and beef
   cattle industries. Understanding the mechanism of persistency of MAP is
   key to produce novel ideas for the development of new diagnostic methods
   or prevention techniques. We sought interactions between the host and
   MAP using epithelial passage model, which mimic initial stage of
   infection. From the transcriptomic analysis of bovine immune cells
   (PBMCs), it was suggested that infection through the epithelial cells
   elicited prolonged Th17-derived immune response, as indicated by
   upregulation of IL-17A, IL-17F and RORC until 120 h p.i., compared to
   directly infected PBMCs. Global downregulation of gene expression was
   observed after 72 h p.i., especially for genes encoding cell surface
   receptors of phagocytic cells, such as Toll-like receptors and MHC class
   II molecules. In addition, the cholesterol efflux transporters ABCA1,
   ABCG1, and APOE, which are regulated by the LXR/RXR pathway, were
   downregulated. In summary, it would be suggested that the host initiate
   immune response to activate Th17-derived cytokines, and MAP survives
   persistently by altering the host adaptive immune response by
   suppressing surface receptors and manipulating lipid metabolism in
   phagocytic cells.}},

Abstract = {{Three studies examine whether individuals might use mental accounting
   heuristics in helping decisions, budgeting their prosocial effort in
   similar ways to how money is budgeted. In a hypothetical scenario study
   (N = 283), participants who imagined that they previously helped someone
   of a specific social category (e.g., ``family,{''} ``colleagues{''})
   were less willing to help someone of that category again. Similarly,
   when reporting actual instances of day-to-day help in a diary study (N =
   443), having helped more than usual in a social category yesterday was
   associated with less effort and less time spent on helping in the same
   category today. In contrast, helping more than usual in other social
   categories did not reduce helping today. Finally, a scenario study (N =
   489) suggested that the mental accounting effect in helping decisions
   may, in part, be explained by perceived utility of help (helping others
   in the same social category is seen as less rewarding).}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis of isoxazolidine and isoxazole derivatives, versatile
   building blocks for the construction of a wide range of complex
   heterocyclic architectures in synthetic organic and medicinal chemistry,
   is efficiently achieved via the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction
   (1,3-DC). Herein, we report an extensive theoretical study on the peri-,
   regio-, stereo, and enantio-selectivities of 1,3-DC of
   7-isopropylidenebenzonorbornadiene with nitrile oxide and cyclic nitrone
   derivatives using density functional theory calculations.
   Acetophenone-substituted nitrile oxide periselectively adds across the
   endocyclic olefinic bond of the dipolarophile to furnish the
   exo-cycloadduct as the major product, a reaction that has a rate
   constant of 1.88 x 10(9) s(-1). The endo approach of this periselective
   path is the closest competing pathway with a rate constant of 4.59 x
   10(7) s(-1). Different substituents on the nitrile oxide do not affect
   the peri- and stereo-selectivity of the reaction. Diethyl ether
   solvation has no substantial effect on the energetic patterns observed
   in the gas phase computation. Also, we report a novel 1,3-DC between
   cyclic nitrone derivatives and 7-isopropylidenebenzonorbornadiene as an
   efficient way to generate isoxazolidine derivatives. Even though the
   reactions of the cyclic nitrone derivatives have slightly higher
   activation barriers than the acyclic nitrile oxide derivatives, the
   former is more enantioselective than the latter. Whereas
   electron-donating groups (EDGs) on the cyclic nitrone favor the
   formation of the exo-cycloadduct, electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs)
   favor the formation of the endo-cycloadduct. Both 1,3-dipoles add across
   the dipolarophile via a concerted asynchronous mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Based on an exploratory case study of a community food waste initiative
   in Gothenburg, Sweden, this article presents a novel analytical approach
   to studying the role of learning within sustainability transition
   niches. The article's theoretical perspective draws from pragmatist
   educational philosophy, practice theory, and sustainability transition
   studies. Proceeding from this theoretical perspective, a two-stage
   empirical analysis is conducted using dramaturgical analysis and
   practical epistemology analysis, methods from sociology and the
   educational sciences. Building on this analysis, the article introduces
   the concept of educative practices, through which it is argued that a
   role of learning at the niche level within sustainability transitions is
   to interrupt the reproduction of norms and attitudes within
   socio-technical systems. The article thus offers original analytical and
   conceptual tools for investigating sustainability transitions in
   relation to learning.}},

   apples were prepared by the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and
   safe (QuEChERS) method. The average fluxapyroxad recoveries in apple
   samples ranged from 107.9 to 118.4\%, the relative standard deviations
   ranged from 4.2 to 4.7\%, and the limit of quantification was 0.005
   mg/kg. The dissipation half-lives in Gala and Idared varieties were 8.9
   and 9.0 days, respectively. Degradation levels of the tested active
   substance after application of yeast included in a biological
   preparation Myco-Sin were 59.9\% for Gala and 43.8\% for Idared. The
   estimated dietary risk for fluxapyroxad in apples was on the acceptable
   safety level (below 9.8\% for children and 1.9\% for adults) and does

Abstract = {{The total defence (TD) concept aims to provide an effective crisis
   response structure by increasing society resilience. However, the
   complexity of its structure regarding resource mobilization and
   management process highlights the need for a complexity-oriented
   approach in the operationalising of TD. We study the application of TD
   during the COVID-19 crisis and explore what makes the TD a viable system
   with resilience capabilities in the face the crisis. We apply the Viable
   Systems Model as a methodology to compare the viability of the United
   Kingdom and Norwegian TD systems, both of which use systems networks to
   achieve resilience, and contrast the different outcomes of each country.
   Our analysis highlights that: Managing the complexity of the TDS
   requires that all of the involved agencies proactively adopt a
   transparent approach to a joint decision making. This demands a wide
   range of sources of innovative solutions at different levels. Joint
   exercises, developed by the responsible agencies, enhance mutual
   understating of roles and responsibilities and crisis response
   structure. This calls for institutionalized support to dedicate
   resources. To avoid communications challenges, involved agencies in the
   TDS need to adopt an open messaging strategy, highlighting how to deal
   with uncertainties in communicating of decisions and action.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundMNAT1 (menage a trois 1, MAT1), a cyclin-dependent
   kinase-activating kinase (CAK) complex, highly expressed in diverse
   cancers and was involved in cancer molecular pathogenesis. However, its
   deliverance profile and biological function in osteosarcoma (OS) remain
   unclear.MethodsThe expression of MNAT1 in OS was detected by western
   blot (WB) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The potential relationship
   between MNAT1 molecular level expression and OS clinical expectations
   were analyzed according to tissues microarray (TMA). Proliferation
   potential of OS cells was evaluated in vitro based on CCK8 and OS cells
   colony formation assays, while OS cells transwell and in situ tissue
   source wound healing assays were employed to analyze the OS cells
   invasion and migration ability in vitro. A nude mouse xenograft model
   was used to detect tumor growth in vivo. In addition, ordinary
   bioinformatics analysis and experimental correlation verification were
   performed to investigate the underlying regulation mechanism of OS by
   MNAT1.ResultsIn this research, we found and confirmed that MNAT1 was
   markedly over-expressed in OS tissue derived in situ, also, highly MNAT1
   expression was closely associated with bad clinical expectations.
   Functional studies had shown that MNAT1 silencing could weaken the
   invasion, migration and proliferation of OS cells in vitro, and inhibit
   OS tumor growth in vivo. Mechanism study indicated that MNAT1
   contributed to the progression of OS via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. We
   further verified that the MNAT1 was required in the regulation of OS
   chemo-sensitivity to cisplatin (DDP).ConclusionsTaken together, the data
   of the present study demonstrate a novel molecular mechanism of MNAT1
   involved in the formation of DDP resistance of OS cells.}},

Title = {{Interaction Between Smoking and Internet Gaming Disorder on Spontaneous
   Brain Activity}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{Converging lines of evidence indicates that smoking and internet gaming
   disorder (IGD) affect spontaneous brain activity, respectively. However,
   little is known about whether these two factors work together on the
   human brain. In this study, we investigated the interaction between
   smoking and IGD on local spontaneous brain activity using amplitude of
   low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) based on resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI).
   Forty-six cigarette smokers, 38 IGD individuals, 34 participants with
   both IGD and cigarette smoking (IGD-Smoking), and 60 healthy individuals
   involved in the study. Voxel-wise analysis of covariance of ALFF
   revealed that there were significant interactions between IGD by smoking
   in the right medial pre-frontal cortex (MPFC)/ventral striatum,
   bilateral cerebellar, and visual-related regions as well as the left
   temporal gyrus. In the right MPFC/ventral striatum and left temporal
   gyrus, ALFF in smoking group was significantly higher than healthy group
   while there were no significant ALFF differences between IGD-Smoking
   group and IGD group. While in the bilateral cerebellar and
   visual-related regions, ALFF in the smoking group was significantly
   lower than healthy group while ALFF in IGD-Smoking group did not show
   significant difference with IGD group. In addition, in the smoking
   group, ALFF of the right MPFC/ventral striatum was associated positively
   with anxiety and depression scores while the ALFF value in the smoking
   group had a trend toward negative correlation with SDS scores in the
   bilateral cerebellar and visual-related regions. The ALFF value in the
   smoking group was associated positively with anxiety score in the left
   temporal gyrus. These findings indicate that smoking and IGD interacted
   with each other in the human brain. Our results, in terms of spontaneous
   brain activity, may imply the fact that IGD people are more tended to
   get smoking. Moreover, it is possible to predict that smokers may be
   more easily to get internet addiction than healthy people.}},

Title = {{Determining the allowable opening-to-traffic asphalt temperature for
   airport pavements}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PAVEMENT ENGINEERING}},
Abstract = {{Newly laid asphalt must be adequately cool before it can be trafficked
   to prevent the development of costly premature damage. Selecting an
   appropriate traffic-opening temperature of newly laid asphalt airport
   runway overlay would avoid early damage - while also minimising the
   disruption to the airport service due to prolonged runway closure in a
   busy airport. This study aims to investigate the allowable
   traffic-opening temperature of freshly paved asphalt during nighttime
   construction through a series of laboratory tests with regard to asphalt
   rutting and interface shear failure potential. Additionally, a transient
   heat transfer model is developed to study the cooling response of
   freshly laid asphalt and, along with stress analysis, used to deduce the
   effect of selected critical traffic opening to traffic on airport
   closure. The results suggest that mixtures with polymer-modified bitumen
   (PMB) can be re-opened to air traffic at a considerably higher
   temperature (up to 80 degrees C) than conventional traffic-opening
   temperature as set by many agencies (60 degrees C). This result
   encourages airport authorities and agencies to be more adaptive with the
   traffic-opening temperature specification, particularly for asphalt with
   PMBs. For the cases studied, raising the critical trafficking
   temperature would reduce the runway/airport closure during nighttime
   construction by 17-114 minutes (26-63\% reductions).}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces the design principle of legibility as means to
   examine the epistemic and ethical conditions of sensing technologies.
   Emerging sensing technologies create new possibilities regarding what to
   measure, as well as how to analyze, interpret, and communicate said
   measurements. In doing so, they create ethical challenges for designers
   to navigate, specifically how the interpretation and communication of
   complex data affect moral values such as (user) autonomy. Contemporary
   sensing technologies require layers of mediation and exposition to
   render what they sense as intelligible and constructive to the end user,
   which is a value-laden design act. Legibility is positioned as both an
   evaluative lens and a design criterion, making it complimentary to
   existing frameworks such as value sensitive design. To concretize the
   notion of legibility, and understand how it could be utilized in both
   evaluative and anticipatory contexts, the case study of a vest embedded
   with sensors and an accompanying app for patients with chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease is analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{Simulation technique for the study of the structural properties and
   supramolecular organization of mesogenic lanthanum(III) complexes with
   beta-diketones and Lewis bases with the combination of high-level
   quantum chemical methods and ab initio molecular dynamics was proposed
   and approved. Three representatives of La(III) complexes with ligands of
   various nature were investigated and relations between their structural
   properties and liquid-crystalline (LC) behavior were studied. It has
   been shown that the structure of beta-diketones and their substitutes
   mostly define the number and type of LC mesophases. The Lewis base
   ligand generally determines the appearance of LC properties. Estimated
   anisotropy of geometry values for two complexes were found above the
   known threshold value defining the presence of LC phases. Thus, these
   complexes are expected to exhibit LC properties, while the third complex
   not, which is in agreement with the experimental data. We also used
   Voronoi-Dirichlet polyhedral (VDP) approach to analyze the first
   coordination sphere of the La(III) complexes. Calculated parameters of
   VDP helped to evaluate the forces of intermolecular interactions. The
   unitless normalized second moment of inertia for three exemplary La(III)
   complexes was found to correlate with the number of the LC phases of the
   corresponding complexes.}},

   Learning for Continuous Distributions}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A hybrid quantum-classical approach to model continuous classical
   probability distributions using a variational quantum circuit is
   proposed. The architecture of this quantum generator consists of a
   quantum circuit that encodes a classical random variable into a quantum
   state and a parameterized quantum circuit trained to mimic the target
   distribution. The model allows for easy interfacing with a classical
   function, such as a neural network, and is trained using an adversarial
   learning approach. It is shown that the quantum generator is able to
   learn using either a classical neural network or a variational quantum
   circuit as the discriminator model. This implementation takes advantage
   of automatic differentiation tools to perform the optimization of the
   variational circuits employed. The framework presented here for the
   design and implementation of the variational quantum generators can
   serve as a blueprint for designing hybrid quantum-classical models for
   other machine learning tasks.}},

Abstract = {{Early life trauma (ELT) exposure and posttraumatic stress disorder
   (PTSD) both affect neural structure, which predicts a variety of mental
   health concerns throughout the lifespan and may present differently
   between adolescents and adults. However, few studies have identified the
   relationship between ELT, PTSD, development, and brain structure using
   cortical thickness (CT). CT may reveal previously obscured alterations
   that are potentially clinically relevant and, furthermore, could
   identify specific structural correlates distinct to ELT from PTSD. Two
   hundred and fifty-three female adolescent and adult survivors of
   interpersonal violence and non-trauma-exposed demographically matched
   controls underwent structural MRI at two different sites. Images were
   processed and CT was estimated using FreeSurfer. Vertex-wise linear
   model tests were conducted across the cortical surface to investigate
   whether PTSD and ELT exposure uniquely affect CT, controlling for
   scanner site. Planned follow-up tests included second-level analyses of
   clinical symptoms for CT clusters that were significantly related to
   PTSD or ELT. CT in the middle cingulate cortex was inversely related to
   ELT in both age groups, such that individuals with more ELT demonstrated
   less CT in this region. Additionally, CT was significantly greater in
   the bilateral intraparietal sulcus and left angular gyrus in both
   adolescents and adults with PTSD. Furthermore, CT in these clusters was
   also significantly related to clinical symptom severity in the adult
   PTSD group. This study provides evidence for distinct CT correlates of
   ELT and PTSD that are present across adolescents and adults, suggesting
   consistent markers related to ELT and PTSD on gray matter structure in
   trauma-exposed individuals.}},

Volume = {{54}},

Pages = {{19-23}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Objective Few studies of eating disorder (ED) symptoms among young
   people in Iran have been conducted. This cross-sectional study examined
   ED symptoms, assessed by the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire
   (EDE-Q).
   Method Adolescent boys (n = 498) and girls (n = 607) aged 12-19 years,
   recruited from schools in four different regions of Iran, completed a
   survey that included the EDE-Q. ED symptoms, namely, EDE-Q global scores
   and the occurrence of specific ED behaviors, were compared between boys
   and girls.
   Results Girls had higher global scores and were more likely to report
   regular extreme dietary restriction than boys (16.6 vs. 12.0\%). The
   effect sizes for these differences were small. The regular occurrence of
   other behaviors (girls vs. boys-binge eating: 21.1 vs. 18.8\%;
   self-induced vomiting: 3.3 vs. 5.4\%; laxative misuse: 6.1 vs. 7.6\%;
   excessive exercise: 5.3 vs. 4.4\%) did not significantly differ by
   gender. Twelve percent of boys and 12.9\% of girls met criteria for an
   operational definition of ``probable ED case.{''}
   Conclusion ED symptoms appear to be relatively common among Iranian
   adolescent boys and girls. Programs designed to reduce the occurrence
   and adverse impact of these symptoms may therefore be increasingly
   important.}},

Abstract = {{Teleseismic, or distant, earthquakes regularly disrupt the operation of
   ground-based gravitational wave detectors such as Advanced LIGO. Here,
   we present EQ mode, a new global control scheme, consisting of an
   automated sequence of optimized control filters that reduces and
   coordinates the motion of the seismic isolation platforms during
   earthquakes. This, in turn, suppresses the differential motion of the
   interferometer arms with respect to one another, resulting in a
   reduction of DARM signal at frequencies below 100 mHz. Our method
   greatly improved the interferometers' capability to remain operational
   during earthquakes, with ground velocities up to 3.9 mu m s(-1) rms in
   the beam direction, setting a new record for both detectors. This sets a
   milestone in seismic controls of the Advanced LIGO detectors' ability to
   manage high ground motion induced by earthquakes, opening a path for
   further robust operation in other extreme environmental conditions.}},

Title = {{Excess forest mortality is consistently linked to drought across Europe}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{Pulses of tree mortality caused by drought have been reported recently
   in forests around the globe, but large-scale quantitative evidence is
   lacking for Europe. Analyzing high-resolution annual satellite-based
   canopy mortality maps from 1987 to 2016 we here show that excess forest
   mortality (i.e., canopy mortality exceeding the long-term mortality
   trend) is significantly related to drought across continental Europe.
   The relationship between water availability and mortality showed
   threshold behavior, with excess mortality increasing steeply when the
   integrated climatic water balance from March to July fell below -1.6
   standard deviations of its long-term average. For -3.0 standard
   deviations the probability of excess canopy mortality was 91.6\%
   (83.8-97.5\%). Overall, drought caused approximately 500,000ha of excess
   forest mortality between 1987 and 2016 in Europe. We here provide
   evidence that drought is an important driver of tree mortality at the
   continental scale, and suggest that a future increase in drought could
   trigger widespread tree mortality in Europe.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{The use of high quality facemasks is indispensable in the light of the
   current COVID pandemic. This study proposes a fully automatic technique
   to design a face specific mask. Through the use of stereophotogrammetry,
   computer-assisted design and three-dimensional (3D) printing, we
   describe a protocol for manufacturing facemasks perfectly adapted to the
   individual face characteristics. The face specific mask was compared to
   a universal design of facemask and different filter container's designs
   were merged with the mask body. Subjective assessment of the face
   specific mask demonstrated tight closure at the nose, mouth and chin
   area, and permits the normal wearing of glasses. A screw-drive locking
   system is advised for easy assembly of the filter components. Automation
   of the process enables high volume production but still allows
   sufficient designer interaction to answer specific requirements. The
   suggested protocol can be used to provide more comfortable, effective
   and sustainable solution compared to a single use, standardized mask.
   Subsequent research on printing materials, sterilization technique and
   compliance with international regulations will facilitate the
   introduction of the face specific mask in clinical practice as well as
   for general use.}},

Title = {{A metagenomic glimpse into the gut of wild and domestic animals:
   Quantification of antimicrobial resistance and more}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in bacteria is a complex subject, why one
   need to look at this phenomenon from a wider and holistic perspective.
   The extensive use of the same antimicrobial classes in human and
   veterinary medicine as well as horticulture is one of the main drivers
   for the AMR selection. Here, we applied shotgun metagenomics to
   investigate the AMR epidemiology in several animal species including
   farm animals, which are often exposed to antimicrobial treatment opposed
   to an unique set of wild animals that seems not to be subjected to
   antimicrobial pressure. The comparison of the domestic and wild animals
   allowed to investigate the possible anthropogenic impact on AMR spread.
   Inclusion of animals with different feeding behaviors (carnivores,
   omnivores) enabled to further assess which AMR genes that thrives within
   the food chain. We tested fecal samples not only of intensively produced
   chickens, turkeys, and pigs, but also of wild animals such as wild
   boars, red foxes, and rodents. A multi-directional approach mapping
   obtained sequences to several databases provided insight into the
   occurrence of the different AMR genes. The method applied enabled also
   analysis of other factors that may influence AMR of intestinal
   microbiome such as diet. Our findings confirmed higher levels of AMR in
   farm animals than in wildlife. The results also revealed the potential
   of wildlife in the AMR dissemination. Particularly in red foxes, we
   found evidence of several AMR genes conferring resistance to critically
   important antimicrobials like quinolones and cephalosporins. In
   contrast, the lowest abundance of AMR was observed in rodents
   originating from natural environment with presumed limited exposure to
   antimicrobials. Shotgun metagenomics enabled us to demonstrate that
   discrepancies between AMR profiles found in the intestinal microbiome of
   various animals probably resulted from the different antimicrobial
   exposure, habitats, and behavior of the tested animal species.}},

Abstract = {{Corporate governance has long been the subject of interest for
   researchers in business administration. Corporate social responsibility
   (CSR) practices decided by boards of directors are now a key issue in
   the decision-making process of companies. The relationship between the
   governance structure and CSR policies is crucial to defining the
   companies' strategic view. In this paper, we identify how the
   characteristics of corporate governance impact CSR disclosure. Our
   findings show that a large board of directors reduces the probability of
   adhering to practices that involve stakeholders more closely in company
   activity, while companies with more independent directors have a higher
   level of stakeholder protection almost by definition. Thus, there is a
   need for additional ways of involving stakeholders in company activity.
   Our results also reveal that an overlap between the roles of the CEO and
   the board chairman is an undesirable influence on a CSR report.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{The genetic mechanisms of childhood development in its many facets
   remain largely undeciphered. In the population of healthy infants
   studied in the Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO)
   program, we have identified a range of dependencies among the observed
   phenotypes of fetal and early childhood growth, neurological
   development, and a number of genetic variants. We have quantified these
   dependencies using our information theory-based methods. The genetic
   variants show dependencies with single phenotypes as well as pleiotropic
   effects on more than one phenotype and thereby point to a large number
   of brain-specific and brain-expressed gene candidates. These
   dependencies provide a basis for connecting a range of variants with a
   spectrum of phenotypes (pleiotropy) as well as with each other. A broad
   survey of known regulatory expression characteristics, and other
   function-related information from the literature for these sets of
   candidate genes allowed us to assemble an integrated body of evidence,
   including a partial regulatory network, that points towards the
   biological basis of these general dependencies. Notable among the
   implicated loci are RAB11FIP4 (next to NF1), MTMR7 and PLD5, all highly
   expressed in the brain; DNMT1 (DNA methyl transferase), highly expressed
   in the placenta; and PPP1R12B and DMD (dystrophin), known to be
   important growth and development genes. While we cannot specify and
   decipher the mechanisms responsible for the phenotypes in this study, a
   number of connections for further investigation of fetal and early
   childhood growth and neurological development are indicated. These
   results and this approach open the door to new explorations of early
   human development.}},

Abstract = {{Isophthalic acid (IPA) has been considered to build metal-organic
   frameworks (MOFs), owing to its facile availability, unique connection
   angle-mode, and a wide range of functional groups attached. Constructing
   titanium-IPA frameworks that possess photoresponse properties is an
   alluring characteristic with respect to the challenge of synthesizing
   new titanium-based MOFs (Ti-MOFs) Here, we report the first Ti-IPA MOF
   (MIP-208) that efficiently combines the use of preformed Ti-8
   oxoclusters and in situ acetylation of the 5-NH2-IPA linker. The mixed
   solid-solution linkers strategy was successfully applied, resulting in a
   series of multivariate MIP-208 structures with tunable chemical
   environments and sizable porosity. MIP-208 shows the best result among
   the pure MOF catalysts for the photocatalytic methanation of carbon
   dioxide. To improve the photocatalytic performance, ruthenium oxide
   nanoparticles were photo-deposited on MIP-208, forming a highly active
   and selective composite catalyst, MIP-208@RuOx, which features a notable
   visible-light response coupled with excellent stability and recycling
   ability.}},

Abstract = {{Low-dimensional nanostructures have demonstrated abundant novelty
   characteristics in the quantum field. Inspired by this, we design a
   2D/1D hybrid structure based on the graphene-like material (BC3 cluster)
   and noble metal (Ag chain) to study its optical response feature. The
   absorption spectrum illustrates that the structure obtains excellent
   performance such as high absorption strength and distinguish double
   peaks in the visible energy range (1.61-3.10 eV). Further calculations
   of induced charge distribution show that there are obviously resonant
   surface plasmon mode for the 2D/1D hybrid structure and origin surface
   plasmon mode mainly come from the 2D structure in the low energy region.
   To find out the similar characteristics of other 2D/1D hybrid structure,
   we perform the corresponding calculations of C3N and Ag hybrid
   structures. The results have proved the uniform performances for the two
   special hybrid structures in optical response, which provides attractive
   light-matter interactions in the low-dimensional nanostructures and
   tremendous potential in the developments of photosensor and optical
   energy devices.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen tunneling is essential for a wide range of chemical and
   biological processes. The description of hydrogen tunneling with
   multicomponent quantum chemistry approaches, where the transferring
   hydrogen nucleus is treated on the same level as the electrons, is
   challenging due to the importance of both static and dynamical electron-
   proton correlation. Herein the nuclear-electronic orbital multistate
   density functional theory (NEO-MSDFT) method is presented as a strategy
   to include both types of correlation. In this approach, two localized
   nuclear-electronic wave functions obtained with the NEO-DFT method are
   combined with a nonorthogonal configurational interaction approach to
   produce bilobal, delocalized ground and excited vibronic states. By
   including a correction function, the NEO-MSDFT approach can produce
   quantitatively accurate hydrogen tunneling splittings for fixed
   geometries of systems such as malonaldehyde and acetoacetaldehyde. This
   approach is computationally efficient and can be combined with methods
   such as vibronic coupling theory to describe tunneling dynamics and to
   compute vibronic couplings in many types of systems.}},

Abstract = {{Based on geological conditions of 3318 working face haulage roadway in
   Xuchang Coal Mine, as well as the space-time relationship with
   surrounding gob, theoretical analysis and numerical simulation were used
   to study the influence of fault structure on the original rock stress of
   3318 working face transport roadway. Considering the composite action of
   the leading supporting pressure of 3318 working face and the structure
   and the lateral supporting pressure of gob, the stress distribution and
   deformation law of roadway under the complex and high-stress condition
   are studied. The results show that, under the superposition of lateral
   abutment pressure of goaf and abutment pressure of adjacent working face
   and fault structure, the peak stress of roadway roof and floor moves to
   the surface of roadway surrounding rock, and its distribution law
   changes from obvious symmetry to asymmetry; surrounding rock on both
   sides of roadway forms asymmetric circular concentrated stress area;
   roof and floor and two sides of roadway show asymmetric characteristics.
   This reveals the stability characteristics of roadway surrounding rock
   under the action of multiple perturbation stresses.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery affords an ultrahigh theoretical energy
   density of 2,600 Wh kg(-1) as a promising next-generation energy storage
   technique, whose actual performance is heavily dependent on the sulfur
   redox kinetics. Lithium polysulfide intermediates play a decisive role
   on the complex sulfur redox reactions but are unfortunately insufficient
   to afford rapid kinetics, rendering reduced specific capacity especially
   at high rates. Herein, a redox comediation strategy is proposed and an
   organopolysulfide (di-t-butyl disulfide, DtbDS) is introduced as a model
   comediator to accelerate the sulfur redox kinetics. Concretely, DtbDS
   reacts with lithium polysulfides and provides a kinetically favorable
   pathway for polysulfide conversion. Consequently, high-rate (4 C),
   high-sulfur-loading (5 mg cm(-2)), or lean-electrolyte (5.0 mu L
   mgs(-1)) Li-S batteries are realized. The redox comediation strategy
   demonstrates a novel approach to promote the sulfur redox kinetics for
   high-performance Li-S batteries and inspires more redox comediators
   represented by DtbDS.}},

   Reduction Reaction in Alkaline and Acid Media}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES}},
Year = {{2021}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Single atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted much attentions due to their
   advantages of high catalysis efficiency and excellent selectivity.
   However, for industrial applications, synthesis of SACs in large and
   practical quantities is very important. The challenge is to develop
   synthesis methods with controllability and scalability. Herein, a
   well-characterized and scalable method is demonstrated to synthesize
   atomically dispersed iron atoms coordinated with nitrogen on graphene,
   SAFe @ NG, with high atomic loading (approximate to 4.6 wt\%) through a
   one-pot pyrolysis process. The method is scalable for the fabrication of
   Fe SACs with high quantities. The Fe-N-G catalyst exhibits high
   intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance, reaching half
   potential of 0.876 and 0.702 V in alkaline and acidic solutions,
   respectively, with excellent microstructure stability. Furthermore, the
   density functional theory (DFT) simulation confirms that the Fe atoms in
   coordination with four nitrogen atoms, FeN4, in graphene is the active
   center for the 4-electron ORR process. This work demonstrates an
   efficient design pathway for single atom catalysts as highly active and
   stable electrocatalysts for high-performance ORR applications.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Reactivity of thymine peroxy radical in DNA and its fate under
   oxygen-less condition are studied at DFT B3LYP and M06-2X functionals
   together with 6-31+G(d,p) and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets. The irreversible
   reaction between OH free radical-induced C6-yl and O-2 molecule leads to
   the two main conformers. The spaciously accessible H2 ` on the sugar can
   be abstracted by C6-peroxy with the estimated barriers of 15.7-21.0
   kcal/mol, dependent on various theoretical methods and the conformers.
   The calculations show that C6-peroxy has a highly more reactivity
   towards C (sp(3))-H abstraction reactions than its relative C6-yl, which
   is a counter-intuitive case. Based on the classical Arrhenius rate
   formula, we find that the vertical electron affinities and proton
   affinities of the H-atom acceptors are strongly relevant to electron
   transfer rate and proton transfer rate, respectively, in the C-H
   abstraction reactions. The formed hydroperoxide with the C6-O(a)O(b)H2 `
   constituent can ultrafastly transfer O(b)H2 ` to C2 ` radical of the
   same sugar with a very low barrier (approximately 1.6 kcal/mol) and very
   strong exothermicity. The results show that the formed hydroperoxide
   product is too unstable so that it could be quickly transformed into
   other species and thus is very hard to be experimentally observed.
   Afterwards, H2 ` can be again abstracted by C6-oxyl radical to result in
   formation of thymine glycol. The parallel C5-C6 bond scission reaction
   leads to formation of the precursor to 5-hydroxy-5-methylhydantion. The
   two competitive reactions have very low or even negative barriers,
   dependent on the used functional. Thus, the new radical reaction paths
   to formation of both thymine glycol and 5-hydroxy-5-methylhydantion are
   discovered under oxygen-less condition, which is different from the
   previously suggested paths under high oxygen concentration surroundings.
   The influences of the relevant side reactions on formation of the two
   oxidation damage biomarker molecules are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Impacts of global climate change on the occurrence and development of
   air pollution have attracted more attention. This study investigates
   impacts of the warming Tibetan Plateau on air quality in the Sichuan
   Basin. Meteorological observations and ERA-Interim reanalysis data
   reveal that the plateau has been rapidly warming during the last 40
   years (1979-2017), particularly in winter when the warming rate is
   approximately twice as much as the annual warming rate. Since 2013, the
   winter temperature over the plateau has even risen by 2 degrees C. Here
   we use the WRF-Chem model to lay emphasis on the impact of the 2 degrees
   C warming on air quality in the basin. The model results show that the 2
   degrees C warming causes an enhanced easterly wind, an increase in the
   planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) and a decrease in the relative
   humidity (RH) in the basin. Enhanced easterly wind increases PM2.5
   transport from the basin to the plateau. The elevated PBLH strengthens
   vertical diffusion of PM2.5, while the decreased RH significantly
   reduces secondary aerosol formation. Overall, PM2.5 concentration is
   reduced by 17.5 \% (similar to 25.1 mu g m(-3)), of which the reduction
   in primary and secondary aerosols is 5.4 and 19.7 mu g m(-3)
   respectively. These results reveal that the recent warming plateau has
   improved air quality in the basin, to a certain extent mitigating the
   air pollution therein. Nevertheless, the climate system is particularly
   complicated, and more studies are needed to demonstrate the impact of
   climate change on air quality in the downstream regions as the plateau
   is likely to continue warming.}},

   and handwashing mechanisms. Thus, this study attempts to investigate the
   effectiveness and efficiency of these mechanisms by residents and
   tourists in George Town Heritage City traditional shophouses and proffer
   possible ways to mitigate future pandemics, especially concerning
   interior design components of a typical traditional shophouse. To
   achieve this, a phenomenology type of qualitative research was adopted.
   Data were collected via observations of selected traditional shophouses
   in George Town Heritage City, face-to-face interviews conducted, and
   validated via secondary sources. Findings show that it is difficult to
   practice some of the precautionary measures as recommended by
   appropriate authorities in majority of the George Town Heritage City
   traditional shophouses because of renovation and modernization to the
   original design. As part of the practical implications, this study is
   advocating for the modification of future design and construction to
   mitigate the spread of the contagious pandemic in shophouses. Also, this

   used a sediment fingerprinting technique to determine sources of
   sedimentation and identifying hotspots of soil erosion in Sebeya River
   Catchment (area of 357 km(2)), a sub-catchment of Lake Kivu located in
   Northwest Rwanda. Five soil samples were collected from each of the six
   geological classes, and 34 suspended sediment samples were taken within
   key locations of the hydrological network in the catchment. X-Ray
   Spectrometry was used to determine the geochemical composition of
   suspended sediments and soil. A multi-step statistical procedure with a
   Bayesian mixing model was used to determine the contribution of each
   geologic group and sub-catchment to the suspended sediments in the
   river. Erosion hotspots were classified based on the underlying land use
   and their contribution to the suspended sediments. The resulting erosion
   hotspot map shows that about 70.9\% of the Sebeya Catchment area
   contributes at least 50\% of sediment load in the river and currently
   experiences unsustainable land use and land cover. The erosion hotspots
   identified and culpable factors should be used to guide best land use
   practices, prioritizing the areas with high contribution to the river
   sedimentation in Sebeya Catchment.}},

Abstract = {{Septic arthritis of the sternoclavicular joint (SC) is rare. The most
   accepted technique for reconstruction of the defect after SC joint
   resection is the use of muscle flaps. We hypothesized that resection of
   ribs with the SC joint impacts timing, type and outcomes of
   reconstruction. This is a retrospective review of 44 patients who
   underwent wound closure with muscle flap following resection of the SC
   joint for septic arthritis over 14 years period from a single
   institution. Patients were divided into two groups based on the
   resection of the adjacent ribs with the SC joint. We found 18 (40.9\%)
   patients with SC joint resection only and 26 (59.1\%) with concomitant
   resection of the adjacent ribs. Patients in the rib resection group were
   younger, did not need SC joint fluid aspiration, and had higher tissue
   culture positivity (p < .05). Rib resection with the SC joint was found
   to be associated with delayed reconstruction (57.7\% vs 22.2\%, p =
   .030), need for serial debridement's (2 vs 1, p = .009), increased days
   from debridement to reconstruction for a subset of patients (75\%
   percentile of 8 days vs. 0 days, p = .024), and longer hospital stay (18
   vs 9, p = .006). Flap complications were higher in rib resection group
   (26.9\% vs 5.6\%, p = .67). Reconstruction following resection of the SC
   joint for septic arthritis is guided by the surgeon's impression
   regarding source control of infection. Rib resection concomitantly with
   joint resection appears to be a useful indicator of disease extent and
   may help guide clinical decision making in this challenging scenario.}},

Abstract = {{Background To evaluate the clinical presentation of pregnant women in
   Iran who died due to COVID-19.
   Methods Data were evaluated of pregnant women who died following a
   laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19. The data were obtained from electronic
   medical records. Additionally, a questionnaire was completed for each
   patient, including demographic, clinical, laboratorial, imaging, and
   treatment data. In case of missing information, a member of the research
   team contacted the first-degree relatives via phone.
   Results Of 32 pregnant women who tested positive for COVID-19, 15 were
   enrolled into the study (mean age 30.0 +/- 5.0 years). The mean time
   from first symptoms to death was 12 +/- 7.0 days. Pre-existing
   comorbidities were seen in six patients. The main presentations at
   admission were fatigue and coughing, but most of the women had a fever
   below 38 degrees C. Increased white blood cell count and neutrophils
   were noticeable. A significant drop of saturation of O-2 with ground
   glass and consolidation seen in both lungs were prominent. The most
   common complications were acute respiratory distress syndrome followed
   by respiratory failure.
   Conclusion Computed tomography findings, O-2 pressure, and regular blood
   assessment may be considered suitable indicators for the surveillance of
   patients.}},

Title = {{The effects of exterior boundary conditions on a internally heated tumor
   tissue with a thermoporoelastic model}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{113}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Modeling flow field in tumor regions interstitial space is of primary
   importance, because of the importance of advection in macromolecule drug
   delivery. Its deformation has also to be taken into account because of
   the forces caused by the fluid; if the tumor region is not isothermal,
   this deformation can be also strongly affected by temperature fields.
   In this paper, the effects of thermal boundary conditions on a tumor
   region periphery with an internal heat source are investigated. The
   tumor region is modeled as a deformable sphere, in which two phases can
   be distinguished. The fluid phase is the interstitial fluid, while the
   rest of the tumor is modeled as the solid phase, including also
   capillaries and tissues. Transient-state governing equations for mass,
   momentum and energy are written for both phases, by also considering
   tumor deformation under the linear elastic material assumption. A
   situation of Tumor Blood Flow (TBF) rapid decay, in which vascular
   pressure rapidly approaches to zero, is considered, while the heat
   source is modeled as a fourth-grade radial-decay function. Boundary
   conditions for the energy equation are varied on the external surface of
   the sphere, in order to appreciate the effects of the surrounding on
   flow and temperature fields inside the tumor. After scaling equations, a
   finite-element scheme is employed for the numerical solution.
   Comparisons with analytical solutions from literature show a good
   agreement. Results are shown for different dimension less parameters
   that are referred to temperature, volumetric strain, pressure and
   velocity, showing in which case external boundary conditions strongly
   affect tumor region flow fields and a third-kind boundary condition is
   needed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ACTA MECHANICA}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{232}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{741-760}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a numerical solution strategy is proposed for studying
   the large deformations of rectangular plates made of hyperelastic
   materials in the compressible and nearly incompressible regimes. The
   plate is considered to be Mindlin-type, and material nonlinearities are
   captured based on the Neo-Hookean model. Based on the Euler-Lagrange
   description, the governing equations are derived using the minimum total
   potential energy principle. The tensor form of equations is replaced by
   a novel matrix-vector format for the computational aims. In the solution
   strategy, based on the variational differential quadrature technique, a
   new numerical approach is proposed by which the discretized governing
   equations are directly obtained through introducing differential and
   integral matrix operators. Fast convergence rate, computational
   efficiency and simple implementation are advantages of this approach.
   The results are first validated with available data in the literature.
   Selected numerical results are then presented to investigate the
   nonlinear bending behavior of hyperelastic plates under various types of
   boundary conditions in the compressible and nearly incompressible
   regimes. The results reveal that the developed approach has a good
   performance to address the large deformation problem of hyperelastic
   plates in both regimes.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ETHNIC AND MIGRATION STUDIES}},
Abstract = {{Focusing on a key dimension of transnational family relations, this
   article explores the impact of uncertain migratory contexts and
   citizenship status on migrant mothering. Based on participant
   observations and semi-structured interviews with French migrant mothers
   living in Manchester, this paper explores how the UK's decision to leave
   the European Union ('Brexit') affects their identities as migrant
   mothers and their mothering practices. The paper explores the
   construction of the continuum of identities of female movers, wives/
   female partners and migrant mothers in times of unprecedented social
   changes in modern Britain. It examines how Brexit affects European
   migrant mothers' lives with particular reference to cultural and
   linguistic maintenance and migrant community building. This article
   points to the affective, racialised and gendered dimensions of
   citizenship statuses and their susceptibility to changing political
   contexts. It underlines the need for conceptual developments to capture
   the affective, racialised and gendered dimensions of different migrant
   statuses to reveal some of their subtler dynamics. The findings
   highlight that, independent of actual policy and regulatory changes,
   shifting contextual norms of people's entitlement to family rights may
   induce changes in how migrants strategise and practise transnational
   family relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Placental growth factor (PlGF) is a mitogen for endothelial cells, but
   it can also act as a proinflammatory cytokine. Because it promotes early
   stages of plaque formation in experimental models of atherosclerosis and
   was implicated in epidemiological associations with risk of
   cardiovascular disease (CVD), PlGF has been attributed a pro-atherogenic
   role. Here, we investigated whether PlGF has a protective role in CVD
   and whether elevated PlGF reflects activation of repair processes in
   response to vascular stress. In a population cohort of 4742 individuals
   with 20 years of follow-up, high baseline plasma PlGF was associated
   with increased risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and
   stroke, but these associations were lost or weakened when adjusting for
   cardiovascular risk factors known to cause vascular stress. Exposure of
   cultured endothelial cells to high glucose, oxidized low-density
   lipoprotein (LDL) or an inducer of apoptosis enhanced the release of
   PlGF. Smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells treated with PlGF small
   interference RNA demonstrated that autocrine PlGF stimulation plays an
   important role in vascular repair responses. High expression of PlGF in
   human carotid plaques removed at surgery was associated with a more
   stable plaque phenotype and a lower risk of future cardiovascular
   events. When adjusting associations of PlGF with cardiovascular risk in
   the population cohort for plasma soluble tumor necrosis factor-related
   apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor-2, a biomarker of cellular
   stress, a high PlGF/TRAIL receptor-2 ratio was associated with a lower
   risk. Our findings provide evidence for a protective role of PlGF in
   CVD.}},

Abstract = {{Background The majority of transplant recipients undergo
   immunosuppressive treatment to prevent organ or tissue rejection.
   Consequently, they are more susceptible to infection agents including a
   number of viruses causing a significant morbidity and mortality. Only a
   limited number of viruses are currently tested for in transplant donors
   and recipients due to the cost and complexity. Taqman low density array
   (TLDA) may provide a suitable format to address more systematic testing
   approach.
   Methods One hundred and one liver transplant recipient samples were
   retrospectively tested for 48 viral targets including two controls
   (bovine viral diarrhea virus and MS2) and two common viruses (TTV and
   HPgV), using a custom designed TLDA. Eight samples were analysed
   simultaneously on 384-well TLDA. Samples giving a signal considered
   positive/indeterminant were re-tested by different individual
   confirmatory assays.
   Results Infections with six previously untested for viruses-EBV, HPIV3,
   HuPuV9, KIV, HMPV and HPV-were detected in fourteen patients. Previously
   detected HCV infections were also confirmed. These infections did not
   seem have an effect on 5 year post-transplant outcome. 55 of 79 and 17
   of 87 samples available for confirmatory assays were positive for TTV
   and HPgV, included for the evaluation of the TLDA performance.
   Conclusions The custom viral TLDA can be successfully used for
   simultaneous detection of a range of post-transplant viral infections.
   To fully exploit its potential for monitoring and intervention, a whole
   blood testing should be applied in a prospective setting.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Whilst excision biopsy is traditionally preferred, advances
   in radiological and histological techniques warrant a re-look at core
   biopsy as a viable primary diagnostic method.
   Method Over a 3-year period, all patients who underwent core biopsy to
   investigate lymphoma at our centre were included.
   Results 554 consecutive patients were included (40.1\% prior lymphoma
   and 59.4\% new presentations). Three or more cores were taken in 420
   (75.8\%) cases. Median time from request to biopsy and biopsy to
   histology report was 2 (0-40) days and 7 (1-24) days, respectively.
   510/544 (93.8\%) biopsies were diagnostic. There was no difference in
   whether the biopsy was diagnostic based on indication (new vs. relapsed
   lymphoma) (P = .445), whether biopsy was PET-directed (P = .507), for
   T-cell lymphoma (P = .468) or nodal vs. extra-nodal (P = .693).
   Thirty-eight patients (6.9\%) required a second biopsy due to inadequate
   tissue. In a patient experience survey, only 13.9\% reported any
   complications (1 self-limiting minor bleeding, 4 bruising) whilst 16.7\%
   reported any discomfort beyond 12 hours.
   Conclusion Core biopsy performed by experienced radiologists and
   analysed by expert haemato-pathologists is a reliable, well-tolerated
   method for diagnosing lymphoma and confirming relapse. Multiple cores
   can be obtained under local anaesthetic yielding sufficient material in
   the majority of cases.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL HISTORY REVIEW}},
Abstract = {{Accepting the Democratic nomination for president in July 1960, John F.
   Kennedy exhorted his fellow Americans to join him in a mission of
   national sacrifice on the `New Frontier'. This article will explore the
   influence of frontier mythology on the foreign policy rhetoric of the
   Kennedy administration. It will show how the prevalence of the Western
   in U.S. popular culture led Kennedy and his advisers to carefully
   construct a meaningful Cold War discourse, one which attempted to
   situate the administration's foreign policy within a heroic narrative of
   westward expansion. Yet this rhetorical strategy proved something of a
   double-edged sword; at key moments during his presidency, Kennedy found
   his `New Frontier' rhetoric being turned against him by critics of his
   foreign policy. Led by Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, these opponents
   accused the president of deviating from the mythic narratives he
   appealed to in his speeches, charging that the `New Frontier' was but a
   pale imitation of the old. By exploring this contest over frontier
   mythology and its interaction with U.S. foreign policy, this article
   seeks to add a new dimension to the recent `narrative turn' in
   international history.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{The rise of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a digital world
   has expectedly called upon technologies, such as wearables and mobile
   devices, to work in conjunction with public health interventions to
   tackle the pandemic. One significant example of this integration is the
   deployment of proximity tracking apps on smartphones to enhance
   traditional contact tracing methods. Many countries have adopted
   proximity tracking apps; however, there is a large degree of global
   differentiation in the voluntariness of the apps. Further, the concept
   of a mandatory policy-forcing individuals to use the apps-has been met
   with ethical concerns (e.g., privacy and liberty). While ethical
   considerations surrounding deployment have been put forth, such as by
   the World Health Organization, ethical justifications for a mandatory
   policy are lacking. Here, we use the Faden-Shebaya framework, which was
   formed to justify public health interventions, to determine if the
   compulsory use of proximity tracking apps is ethically appropriate. We
   show that while theoretically justified, due to the current state of
   proximity tracking applications and societal factors, it is difficult to
   defend a mandatory policy in practice.}},

Abstract = {{Biological and heterogeneous catalysts for the electrochemical CO2
   reduction reaction (CO2RR) often exhibit a high degree of electronic
   delocalization that serves to minimize overpotential and maximize
   selectivity over the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we report
   a molecular iron(II) system that captures this design concept in a
   homogeneous setting through the use of a redox non-innocent
   terpyridine-based pentapyridine ligand (tpyPY2Me). As a result of strong
   metal-ligand exchange coupling between the Fe(II) center and ligand,
   {[}Fe(tpyPY2Me)](2+) exhibits redox behavior at potentials 640 mV more
   positive than the isostructural {[}Zn(tpyPY2Me)](2+) analog containing
   the redoxinactive Zn(II) ion. This shift in redox potential is
   attributed to the requirement for both an open-shell metal ion and a
   redox noninnocent ligand. The metal-ligand cooperativity in
   {[}Fe(tpyPY2Me)](2+ )drives the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO
   at low overpotentials with high selectivity for CO2RR (>90\%) and
   turnover frequencies of 100 000 s(-1) with no degradation over 20 h. The
   decrease in the thermodynamic barrier engendered by this coupling also
   enables homogeneous CO2 reduction catalysis in water without
   compromising selectivity or rates. Synthesis of the two-electron
   reduction product, {[}Fe(tpyPY2Me)](0) (,) and characterization by X-ray
   crystallography, Mossbauer spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy
   (XAS), variable temperature NMR, and density functional theory (DFT)
   calculations, support assignment of an open-shell singlet electronic
   structure that maintains a formal Fe(II) oxidation state with a doubly
   reduced ligand system. This work provides a starting point for the
   design of systems that exploit metal-ligand cooperativity for
   electrocatalysis where the electrochemical potential of redox
   non-innocent ligands can be tuned through secondary metal-dependent
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate estimation of the tibiofemoral contact forces relies on exact
   kinematics and joint geometry. Subject-specific kinematic constraints
   representing contact point trajectories derived from fluoroscopic
   measurements during lunge are introduced in a musculoskeletal model of
   the lower limb and compared to generic kinematic constraints. The
   medial, lateral, and total contact forces during gait and squat are
   validated using the data of four patients with an instrumented
   prosthesis. The accuracy of the estimated contact forces (both with
   subject-specific and generic kinematic constraints) remains close to the
   level reported in the literature. The mean root mean square errors range
   from 0.32 to 0.52 body weights for gait and from 0.27 to 0.72 body
   weights for squat. The impact of the subject-specific contact point
   trajectories is not found substantial or consistent between patients and
   tasks. Indeed, the kinematics of the total knee prostheses remains close
   to the kinematics of a hinge joint and the contact point locations
   remain generally centred at 20 mm from the tibia centreline (close to
   the constant value defined in the generic constraints). The contact
   point trajectories are also suspected to differ between tasks (lunge vs.
   gait and squat). While the contact point trajectories have been reported
   to be sensitive model parameters, no clear improvement of the contact
   force accuracy is demonstrated on patients with instrumented prosthesis.
   The introduction (as kinematic constraints) of fluoroscopy-based contact
   point trajectories may be considered in cases where these trajectories
   are significantly altered, as reported for osteoarthritis patients. (C)

Abstract = {{Gravity drainage is known as the controlling mechanism of oil recovery
   in naturally fractured reservoirs. The efficiency of this mechanism is
   controlled by block-to-block interactions through capillary continuity
   and/or reinfiltration processes. In this study, at first, several
   free-fall gravity drainage experiments were conducted on a well-designed
   three-block apparatus and the role of tilt angle, spacers' permeability,
   wettability and effective contact area (representing a different status
   of the block-to-block interactions between matrix blocks) on the
   recovery efficiency were investigated. Then, an experimental-based
   numerical model of free-fall gravity drainage process was developed,
   validated and used for monitoring the saturation profiles along with the
   matrix blocks. Results showed that gas wetting condition of horizontal
   fracture weakens the capillary continuity and in consequence decreases
   the recovery factor in comparison with the original liquid wetting
   condition. Moreover, higher spacers' permeability increases oil recovery
   at early times, while it decreases the ultimate recovery factor. Tilt
   angle from the vertical axis decreases recovery factor, due to greater
   connectivity of matrix blocks to vertical fracture and consequent
   channelling. Decreasing horizontal fracture aperture decreases recovery
   at early times but increases the ultimate recovery due to a greater
   extent of capillary continuity between the adjacent blocks. Well match
   observed between the numerical model results and the experimental data
   of oil recovery makes the COMSOL multiphysics model attractive for
   application in multi-blocks fractured systems considering block-to-block
   interactions. The findings of this research improve our understanding of
   the role of different fracture properties on the block-to-block
   interactions and how they change the ultimate recovery of a multi-block
   system.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{113}},

Abstract = {{Asa composite material, the mechanical properties of bone are highly
   dependent on its hierarchical organisation, thus, macroscopic mechanical
   properties are dictated by local phenomena, such as micro damage
   resulting from repetitive cyclic loading of daily activities. Such
   microdamage is associated with plastic deformation and appears as a
   gradual accumulation of residual strains. The aim of this study is to
   investigate local residual strains in cortical bone tissue following
   compressive cyclic loading, using in situ X-ray computed tomography
   (XCT) and digital volume correlation (DVC) to provide a deeper insight
   on the three-dimensional (3D) relationship between residual strain
   accumulation, cortical bone microstructure and failure patterns. Through
   a progressive in situ XCT loading-unloading scheme, localisation of
   local residual strains was observed in highly compressed regions. In
   addition, a multi-scale in situ XCT cyclic test highlighted the
   differences on residual strain distribution at the microscale and tissue
   level, where high strains were observed in regions with the thinnest
   vascular canals and predicted the failure location following
   overloading. Finally, through a continuous in situ XCT compression test
   of cycled specimens, the full-field strain evolution and failure pattern
   indicated the reduced ability of bone to plastically deform after damage
   accumulation due to high number of cyclic loads. Altogether, the novel
   experimental methods employed in this study, combining high-resolution
   in situ XCT mechanics and DVC, showed a great potential to investigate
   3D full-field residual strain development under repetitive loading and
   its complex interaction with bone microstructure, microdamage and
   fracture. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{375}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{We study the Quillen metric on the determinant line bundle associated
   with a family of complex singular curves with hyperbolic cusp
   singularities.
   More precisely, we fix a family of complex curves, which admit at most
   double-point singularities. We endow the fibers of this family with
   Kahler metrics, which are defined away from a finite set of points, a
   divisor on the total space of the family, in the vicinity of which the
   metric has Poincare-type singularities. We fix a holomorphic vector
   bundle over the total space of the family and endow it with a Hermitian
   metric with at most logarithmic singularities on the divisor, coming
   from the power of the relative canonical line bundle twisted by the
   divisor. An important example is the family of stable surfaces with
   marked points endowed with constant scalar curvature metric.
   The associated determinant line bundle is naturally endowed with the
   Quillen metric defined using the analytic torsion from the first paper
   of this series, generalizing the classical definition of Ray-Singer. We
   study the regularity of this Quillen metric near the locus of singular
   curves. The singularities turn out to be reasonable enough, so that the
   curvature of the Chern connection of the determinant line bundle endowed
   with the Quillen norm is well-defined as a current. We derive the
   explicit formula for this current, which gives a refinement of
   Riemann-Roch-Grothendieck theorem at the level of currents. This
   generalizes the curvature theorems of Takhtajan-Zograf and Bismut-Bost.

Abstract = {{The underlying nature of the process of star formation quenching in the
   central regions of barred disc galaxies that is due to the action of
   stellar bar is not fully understood. We present a multi-wavelength study
   of four barred galaxies using the archival data from optical,
   ultraviolet, infrared, CO, and HI imaging data on star formation
   progression and stellar and gas distribution to better understand the
   process of bar quenching. We found that for three galaxies, the region
   between the nuclear or central sub-kiloparsec region and the end of the
   bar (bar region) is devoid of neutral and molecular hydrogen. While the
   detected neutral hydrogen is very negligible, we note that molecular
   hydrogen is present abundantly in the nuclear or central sub-kiloparsec
   regions of all four galaxies. The bar co-rotation radius is also devoid
   of recent star formation for three out of four galaxies. One galaxy
   shows significant molecular hydrogen along the bar, which might mean
   that the gas is still being funnelled to the centre by the action of the
   stellar bar. Significant star formation is also present along the bar
   co-rotation radius of this galaxy. The study presented here supports a
   scenario in which gas redistribution as a result of the action of
   stellar bar clears the bar region of fuel for further star formation and
   eventually leads to star formation quenching in the bar region.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate prediction of the discharge through radial gates is difficult.
   Existing calibration methods typically provide sufficient accuracy for
   free flows and submerged flows with jet Froude number at vena contracta
   larger than 1.7. However, their predictions are poor for submerged flows
   with jet Froude number less than 1.7. Based on the analysis of
   experimental data collected by the US Bureau of Reclamation, an
   empirical indicator was proposed to predict the approximate range of jet
   Froude number for submerged flows. Accordingly, submerged flows were
   subdivided into partially submerged flows with fully developed hydraulic
   jump, and totally submerged flows with undular or no jump. A new
   discharge calibration method, referred to as the identification method,
   was developed for the three distinct flow conditions. Verification of
   the proposed method indicated the discharge prediction accuracies were
   significantly improved for totally submerged flows.}},

Title = {{Febio finite element models of the human cervical spine}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{113}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Finite element (FE) analysis has proven to be useful when studying the
   biomechanics of the cervical spine. Although many FE studies of the
   cervical spine have been published, they typically develop their models
   using commercial software, making the sharing of models between
   researchers difficult. They also often model only one part of the
   cervical spine. The goal of this study was to develop and evaluate three
   FE models of the adult cervical spine using open-source software and to
   freely provide these models to the scientific community. The models were
   created from computed tomography scans of 26-, 59-, and 64-year old
   female subjects. These models were evaluated against previously
   published experimental and FE data. Despite the fact that all three
   models were assigned identical material properties and boundary
   conditions, there was notable variation in their biomechanical behavior.
   It was therefore apparent that these differences were the result of
   morphological differences between the models. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{INFANT AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{When identifying parental socialization processes influencing children's
   reading achievement, building self-regulation is a potential underlying
   mechanism. Yet socialization (i.e., warmth, stress) of self-regulation
   may vary based on the sociocultural context of ethnic minority families.
   Using the ECLS-K: 2011 (N = 17,020; M-Age = 73.43 mos, SD = 4.48 mos),
   we explored: (RQ1) Do kindergarten approaches to learning (ATL), a
   composite of self-regulation behaviours in the classroom context,
   mediate the association between parental warmth and stress and first
   grade reading? and (RQ2) Is mediation moderated by race/ethnicity
   (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian)? ATL mediated the association between
   parental warmth and stress and reading, such that parental warmth
   contributed positively to reading through higher ATL, and parental
   stress contributed negatively to reading through lower ATL. However, the
   lack of moderation suggests that the adaptiveness of parental warmth and
   maladaptiveness of parental stress for children's reading through ATL
   may be similar across race/ethnicity. Findings inform intervention and
   practice targeting children's school readiness.
   Highlights
   The current study explored whether parental warmth and stress influenced
   reading through approaches to learning skills, considering variation by
   race/ethnicity.
   The mediation model and conditional process analysis reveal that across
   race/ethnicity, warmth benefits reading and stress is detrimental for
   reading.
   Parental warmth and stress should inform interventions promoting
   children's school readiness, with attention to cultural practices of
   ethnically diverse families.}},

Abstract = {{The human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP) was developed
   to estimate the intensity of human activities in natural ecosystems,
   which is still unclear in the Xinjiang grasslands. Using the
   Biome-Biogeochemical Cycle (Biome-BGC) grazing model in combination with
   field data, we assessed the HANPP and explored its spatiotemporal
   patterns in the Xinjiang grasslands. Our results showed that (1) the
   HANPP increased from 38 g C/m(2)/yr in 1979 to 88 g C/m(2)/yr in 2012,
   with an average annual increase of 1.47\%. The HANPP was 80 g C/m(2)/yr,
   which represented 51\% of the potential net primary production (NPPpot),
   and the HANPP efficiency was 70\% in this region. (2) The areas with
   high HANPP values mainly occurred in northern Xinjiang and northwest of
   the Tianshan Mountains, while areas with low HANPP values mainly
   occurred in southern Xinjiang and southwest of the Tianshan Mountains.
   (3) Interannual variations in HANPP and NPPpot were significantly
   positively correlated (P<0.01). Interannual variations in HANPP
   efficiency and grazing intensity were negatively correlated (P<0.01).
   These results can help identify the complex impacts of human activities
   on grassland ecosystems and provide basic data for grassland management.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) receives
   increasing attention in membrane separation field based on its
   advantages such as high mechanical strength, thermal and chemical
   stability. However, controlling the microporous structure is still
   challenging. In this work, we attempted to tailor the morphology of
   PVDF-HFP membrane via a one-step reactive vapor induced phase separation
   method. Namely, PVDF-HFP was dissolved in a volatile solvent and then
   was cast in an ammonia water vapor atmosphere. After complete
   evaporation of solvent, membranes with adjustable porous structure were
   prepared, and the microstructures of the membranes were analyzed by
   scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction
   characterizations. Based on the results, a mechanism of
   dehydrofluorination induced cross-linking of PVDF-HFP has been suggested
   to understand the morphology tailoring. To our knowledge, this is the
   first report of one-step reactive vapor induced phase separation
   strategy to tailor morphology of PVDF-HFP membrane. In addition, the
   membranes prepared in the ammonia water vapor exhibited enhanced
   mechanical strength and achieved satisfactory separation efficiency for
   water-in-oil emulsions, suggesting promising potential.}},

Abstract = {{Physical unclonable function (PUF) is a cornerstone of
   anticounterfeiting. However, conventional PUF key-based secure tags
   encounter several bottlenecks, such as complicated manufacturing,
   specialized and tedious readout, long authentication time, and
   insufficient stability. Here, we utilize various two-dimensional
   materials (2DMs), including Ti3C2Tx MXene and graphene oxide, to
   construct multigenerational microstructures as PUF patterns. Two
   intermediate treatments, cation intercalation and moisture-induced
   lubrication, are introduced in between sequential contractions to
   engineer the multiscale patterns in a transfer-free and scalable
   fashion. A deep learning (DL)-facilitated software is developed to
   pre-categorize the hierarchical topographies with classifiable features.
   Thereafter, the search-and-compare is conducted within a smaller
   database to shorten the overall authentication time. The synergy between
   2DM tags and DL-facilitated software enables a reliable and
   environmentally stable anticounterfeiting technology, DeepKey, showing
   superior encoding capacity (>10(144)(,)(494)) and short authentication
   time (similar to 3.5 min). Our 2DM anticounterfeiting tag is finally
   integrated with QR codes to provide two-layer information security.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium-oxygen batteries have attracted research attention due to their
   low cost and high theoretical capacity. Developing inexpensive and
   highly efficient cathode materials without using noble metal-based
   catalysts is highly desirable for practical applications in
   lithium-oxygen batteries. Herein, a heterostructure of NiFe and NiCx
   inside of N-doped carbon (NiCx-NiFe-NC) derived from bimetallic Prussian
   blue supported on biochar was developed as a novel self-standing cathode
   for lithium-oxygen batteries. The specific discharge capacity of the
   best sample was 27.14 mAh.cm(-2) at a stable discharge voltage of 2.75
   V. The hybridization between the d-orbital of Ni and s and p-orbitals of
   carbon in NiCx, formed at 900 degrees C, enhanced the electrocatalytic
   performance due to the synergistic effect between these components. The
   structure of NiCx-NiFe-NC efficiently improved the electron and ion
   transfer between the cathode and the electrolyte during the
   electrochemical processes, resulting in superior electrocatalytic
   properties in lithium-oxygen batteries. This study indicates that nickel
   carbide supported on N-doped carbon is a promising cathode material for
   lithium-oxygen batteries.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a soft luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) with superior
   light propagation. The rubbery poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (EVA) was
   adopted to replace the conventional brittle poly(methyl methacrylate)
   (PMMA). We analyzed the transmittance, photoluminescence efficiency,
   crystallinity, and surface properties of LSC to understand the optical
   and structural properties of the LSC. In addition, we modified the
   optical slab model to provide insights into the optical phenomenon in
   plate-type LSC devices; we evaluated the solar absorption efficiency of
   the glass and emitting layers. We also evaluated the solar concentration
   performances of the LSC devices by measuring the photocurrent density
   generated using a monocrystalline silicon solar cell. We compared the
   transporting ability of emitted light into an edge by calculating the
   collection efficiency based on the concentration factor and optical
   efficiencies (absorption and photoluminescence). The concentration
   factor, optical efficiency, and collection efficiency of the EVA-LSC
   with 4000 ppm of Lumogen F Red 305 were 0.31, 3.1, and 40\%,
   respectively. The overall optical properties of the EVA-LSC were
   comparable to those of the PMMA-LSC. Moreover, the light decay property
   of EVA-LSC was superior by 1.2 times than PMMA-LSC. Therefore, we
   suggest EVA can replace PMMA and be used for flexible and large-area LSC
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Fiber lasers, owing to the high beam quality and super robustness, are
   widely used in fields from optical communications, fiber sensing,
   biomedicine to material processing. The use of glass fibers as the gain
   medium has, however, posed a strong obstacle for improving efficiency
   and, especially, achieving efficient lasing action in the mid-infrared
   (MIR) region, because of the relatively large nonradiative energy loss.
   Here, the fabrication of a Tm3+-doped tellurate glass-ceramic (GC) fiber
   is demonstrated, which enables enhanced lasing action at approximate to
   2 mu m. Compared with the as-prepared fiber, the optical conversion
   efficiency of GC fiber is increased from 8.8\% to 14.1\%. The
   microstructure and spectral characterization analyses suggest that the
   improvement of the laser performance in GC fiber is induced by the
   significant change of the local environment surrounding Tm3+ ions due to
   the formation of nanocrystals within the glass fibers. Moreover, the
   developed GC fiber also enables Q-switched pulsed laser output at
   approximate to 2 mu m with a pulse energy of 3.2 J and pulse width of
   4.1 ns. The results demonstrated here may have strong implications in
   the development of MIR fiber lasers and the applications of GC fibers in
   MIR photonics.}},

Abstract = {{Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is rapidly becoming a crucial tool in
   disease research. Fresh-frozen tissue is ideal for MSI because the
   protein and lipid structures are undisturbed by chemical fixatives;
   however, that means long-term preservation is limited. Formalin-fixed
   paraffin-embedded tissue has a virtually infinite shelf life, but whole
   proteins are difficult or impossible to image directly. To bridge this
   gap, we examine the use of ethanol-fixed, paraffin-embedded (EFPE)
   tissue for the localization of intact proteins and lipids and comment on
   implications in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. The new sample
   preparation methods for EFPE tissues have allowed us to greatly broaden
   the information we can extract from MSI experiments. Our methods involve
   a xylene-free deparaffination for lipid analysis and an intact protein
   method for visualizing amyloid-beta plaques from human AD brain tissue.
   This unique combination streamlines the MSI sample preparation process
   while allowing for the most biologically and pathologically relevant
   information to be extracted from a single tissue source.}},

Abstract = {{Fermentation of waste activated sludge (WAS) is an alternative approach
   to reduce solid wastes while providing valuable soluble products, such
   as volatile fatty acids and alcohols. This study systematically
   identified optimal fermentation conditions and key microbial populations
   by conducting two sets of experiments under different combinations of
   biochemical and physical parameters. Based on fermentation product
   concentrations, methane production, and solid removal, fermentation
   performance was enhanced under the combined treatments of inoculum heat
   shock (>60 degrees C), pH 5, 55 degrees C, and short solid retention
   time (<10 days). An ecogenomics-based mass balance (EGMB) approach was
   used to determine the net growth rates of individual microbial
   populations, and classified them into four microbial groups: known
   syntrophs, known methanogens, fermenters, and WAS-associated
   populations. Their growth rates were observed to be affected by the
   treatment conditions. The growth rates of syntrophs and fermenters, such
   as Syntrophomonas and Parabacteroides increased with a decrease in SRT.
   In contrast, treatment conditions, such as inoculum heat shock and high
   incubation temperature inhibited the growth of WAS-associated
   populations, such as Terrimonas and Bryobacter. There were also
   populations insensitive to the treatment conditions, such as those
   related to Microbacter and Rikenellaceae. Overall, the EGMB approach
   clearly revealed the ecological roles of important microbial guilds in
   the WAS fermentation system, and guided the selection of optimal
   conditions for WAS fermentation in future pilot-scale operation.}},

Abstract = {{The sponge implant has been applied as an important in vivo model for
   the study of inflammatory processes as it induces the migration,
   proliferation, and accumulation of inflammatory cells, angiogenesis, and
   extracellular matrix deposition in its trabeculae. The characterization
   of immune events in sponge implants would be useful in identifying the
   immunological events that could support the selection of an appropriate
   experimental model (mouse strain) and time post-implant analysis in
   optimized protocols for novel applications of this model such as in
   biomolecules screening. Here, the changes in histological/morphometric,
   immunophenotypic and functional features of infiltrating leukocytes
   (LEU) were assessed in sponge implants for Swiss, BALB/c, and C57BL/6
   mice. A gradual increase of fibrovascular stroma and a progressive
   decrease in LEU infiltration, mainly composed of polymorphonuclear cells
   with progressive shift toward mononuclear cells at late time-points were
   observed over time. Usually, Swiss mice presented a more prominent
   immune response with late mixed pattern
   (pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory: IL-2/IFN-gamma/IL-4/IL-10/IL-17) of
   cytokine production. While BALB/c mice showed an early activation of the
   innate response with a controlled cytokine profile (low inflammatory
   potential), C57BL/6 mice presented a typical early pro-inflammatory
   (IL-6/TNF/IFN-gamma) response with persistent neutrophilic involvement.
   A rational selection of the ideal time-point/mouse-lineage would avoid
   bias or tendentious results. Criteria such as low number of increased
   biomarkers, no recruitment of cytotoxic response, minor cytokine
   production, and lower biomarker connectivity (described as biomarker
   signature analysis and network analysis) guided the choice of the best
   time-point for each model (Day5/Swiss; Day7/BALB/c; Day6/C57BL/6) with
   wide application for screening purposes, such as identification of
   therapeutic biomolecules, selection of antigens/adjuvants, and follow-up
   of innate and adaptive immune response to vaccines candidates.}},

Abstract = {{Background Recruitment of committed unrelated hematopoietic stem cell
   donors from the most-needed demographics remains a challenge for donor
   recruitment organizations worldwide. Multimedia resources are gaining
   attention as a modality to support recruitment efforts; however, there
   is a lack of guidance for the development of such tools. This
   qualitative study explores the perspectives of eligible stem cell donors
   on an educational whiteboard video about stem cell donation, generating
   insights into how whiteboard videos and related multimedia may be
   optimized for donor recruitment.
   Study Design and Methods Eight semistructured focus groups were
   conducted with 38 potential donors from the most-needed demographics
   (young, male, and non-Caucasian) after they had watched a 3.5-minute
   whiteboard video explaining key concepts in stem cell donation ().
   Constructivist grounded theory was used to identify themes and to
   develop a framework for understanding participants' preferred features
   of recruitment multimedia.
   Results Participants identified a range of features contributing to the
   effectiveness of recruitment multimedia, adding that the whiteboard
   video is an effective, integrated, and readily accessible format for
   supporting donor recruitment. Topics that participants felt are
   important to address include knowledge gaps regarding donation
   procedures, concerns about donor safety, and the particular need for
   specific donor demographics. Suggested avenues for improvement include
   the addition of donor/recipient/patient personal experiences,
   attention-grabbing hooks, and a call to action including opportunities
   for further learning.
   Conclusions Several considerations were generated to inform the
   development of future multimedia for donor education/recruitment and are
   relevant to donor recruitment organizations worldwide.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we provide a generalized version of Voiculescu's theorem
   for normal operators by showing that, in a von Neumann algebra with
   separable pre-dual and a faithful, normal, semifinite, tracial weight
   tau, each normal operator is an arbitrarily small (max\{parallel
   to.parallel to, parallel to.parallel to(2)\})-norm perturbation of a
   diagonal operator. Furthermore, in a countably decomposable, properly
   infinite von Neumann algebra with a faithful normal semifinite tracial
   weight, we prove that each self-adjoint operator can be diagonalized
   modulo normed ideals satisfying a natural condition. An analogue, for
   nuclear C{*}-algebras, of Voiculescu's absorption theorem {[}33, Theorem
   2.4] is also proved in the case of semifinite factors. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Title = {{The Possession of Coccoliths Fails to Deter Microzooplankton Grazers}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Phytoplankton play a central role in the regulation of global carbon and
   nutrient cycles, forming the basis of the marine food webs. A group of
   biogeochemically important phytoplankton, the coccolithophores, produce
   calcium carbonate scales that have been hypothesized to deter or reduce
   grazing by microzooplankton. Here, a meta-analysis of mesocosm-based
   experiments demonstrates that calcification of the cosmopolitan
   coccolithophore, Emiliania huxleyi, fails to deter microzooplankton
   grazing. The median grazing to growth ratio for E. huxleyi (0.56 +/-
   0.40) was not significantly different among non-calcified nano- or
   picoeukaryotes (0.71 +/- 0.31 and 0.55 +/- 0.34, respectively).
   Additionally, the environmental concentration of E. huxleyi did not
   drive preferential grazing of non-calcified groups. These results
   strongly suggest that the possession of coccoliths does not provide E.
   huxleyi effective protection from microzooplankton grazing. Such
   indiscriminate consumption has implications for the dissolution and fate
   of CaCO3 in the ocean, and the evolution of coccoliths.}},

Title = {{People as security risks: the framing of migration in the UK
   security-development nexus}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ETHNIC AND MIGRATION STUDIES}},
Abstract = {{The migration of people across international borders has long been an
   area of concern for the UK and was a key issue in the public debate
   surrounding Brexit. This paper examines this preoccupation with the
   movement of people in the context of the coordination of security and
   development in UK government policy. The UK responded to the migration
   crisis of 2015 by announcing the diversion of significant development
   funding to prevent the movement of people. This paper examines the UK
   development policy discourse of the past 2 decades through an analysis
   of key policy documents from the UK's Department for International
   Development (DfID) and traces the changing ways in which the issue of
   migration has been framed in DfID's policy. It argues that in UK
   development policy, whereas migration used to be discussed in terms of
   how it impacts on poorer countries, migration is now framed as a risk to
   UK national security. Development aid is now framed as a solution to the
   problem of migration. This paper argues that this is consistent with a
   broader shift in the merging of security and development in UK policy
   where development aid is expected to address potential risks to UK
   national security.}},

Title = {{Towards a feminist political economy of time: labour circulation, social
   reproduction \& the `afterlife' of cheap labour}},
Journal = {{REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY}},
Abstract = {{This article explores `time' as a crucial category of analysis shaping
   and shaped by the dynamics of exploitation and social reproduction
   across the global assembly line. Focusing on the Indian garment
   industry, the article develops a feminist political economy of time
   stressing the productive and reproductive temporalities of exploitation,
   which give rise to multiple forms of labour circulation, including early
   exit from industrial work. Then, the study places this early exit under
   the microscope, and analyses the `afterlife' available to women workers
   outside the factory, which often involves a transition back to informal
   occupations. The narrative draws both on extensive knowledge of India's
   garment sweatshops, and on the detailed analysis of twenty life
   histories of women former factory workers in Bengaluru. The
   investigation of the feminist political economy of time of the global
   assembly line developed here suggests the presence of a revolving door
   between industrial and informal work in the lives of the working
   classes. It disproves linear global industrial development narratives
   constructing industrial work as `better work' and contributes to
   feminist IPE debates by illustrating how social reproduction - its
   rhythms, temporalities, and everyday necessities - concretely
   co-constitutes the world of work across the global economy.}},

Abstract = {{In muscle rehabilitation and training, it is important to evaluate a

   evaluation index of muscle fatigue based on electromyography and the use
   ratio of the muscle fiber type. MFT is the time when the use ratio of
   the slow muscle fiber (Type I) and the fast muscle fiber (Type IIb)
   intersects. Furthermore, the authors also proposed a method to estimate
   MFT by modeling the relationship between each muscle load and MFT. This
   paper examines the appropriate evaluation method for MFT containing

   solution of various optimization problems such as nonlinear, nonconvex,
   and highly constrained engineering design problem. In the proposed
   research, the phase of exploration and exploitation of the existing HHO
   algorithm has been further improved using GWO algorithm and its
   performance has been tested for various benchmarks problems including
   CEC2005 (unimodal, multimodal, and fixed dimensions functions),
   multimodal functions with variable dimensions, and CEC-BC-2017 test
   functions. Further, the developed hybrid optimizer has been tested for

Abstract = {{Strawberries are often consumed fresh or only receive minimal
   processing, inducing a significant health risk to the consumer if
   contamination occurs anywhere from farm to fork. Outbreaks of foodborne
   illness associated with strawberries often involve a broad range of
   microbiological agents, from viruses (human norovirus) to bacteria
   (Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes). The addition of sanitizers
   to water washes is one of the most commonly studied strategies to remove
   or inactivate pathogens on berries as well as avoid cross contamination
   due to reuse of process wash water. The risk posed with the safety
   issues of by-products from chlorine disinfection in the fruit industry
   has led to a search for alternative sanitizers. We evaluated the
   applicability of different chemical sanitizers (peracetic acid (PA),
   hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), citric acid (CA), lactic acid (LA) and acetic
   acid (AA)) for the inactivation of S. enterica, L. monocytogenes and
   murine norovirus (MNV-1) on strawberries. A control treatment with
   chlorine (NaClO) (100 ppm) was included. For each sanitizer, different
   doses (40, 80 and 120 ppm for PA and 1, 2.5 and 5\% for H2O2, LA, AA and
   CA) and time (2 and 5 min) were studied in order to optimize the
   decontamination washing step. The best concentrations were 80 ppm for
   PA, 5\% for H2O2 and 2.5\% for organic acids (LA, AA and CA) after 2 min
   treatment. Results indicate that the sanitizers selected may be a
   feasible alternative to chlorine (100 ppm) for removing selected
   pathogenic microorganisms (P > 0.05), with reductions about >= 2 log for
   bacterial strains and >= 1.7 log for MNV-1. As the washing water may
   also increase the microbial counts by cross-contamination, we observed
   that no pathogenic bacteria were found in wash water after 5\% H2O2 and
   80 ppm PA after 2 min treatment. On the other hand, we also reported
   reductions about total aerobic mesophyll (TAM) (0.0-1.4 log CFU/g) and
   molds and yeasts (M\&Y) (0.3-1.8 log CFU/g) with all alternative
   sanitizers tested. Strawberries treated did not shown significant
   differences about physio-chemical parameters compared to the untreated
   samples (initial). For this study, the optimal sanitizer selected was
   PA, due to the low concentration and cost needed and its microbiocidal
   effect in wash water and fruit. Notwithstanding the results obtained,
   the effect of PA in combination with other non-thermal technologies such
   as water-assisted ultraviolet (UV-C) light should be studied in future
   research to improve the disinfection of strawberries.}},

Abstract = {{Importance Obesity is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular
   disease (CVD), but little is known about the role that circulating
   protein biomarkers play in this association. Objective To examine the
   observational and genetic associations of adiposity with circulating
   protein biomarkers and the observational associations of proteins with
   incident CVD. Design, Setting, and Participants This subcohort study
   included 628 participants from the prospective China Kadoorie Biobank
   who did not have a history of cancer at baseline. The Olink platform
   measured 92 protein markers in baseline plasma samples. Data were
   collected from June 2004 to January 2016 and analyzed from January 2019
   to June 2020. Exposures Measured body mass index (BMI) obtained during
   the baseline survey and genetically instrumented BMI derived using 571
   externally weighted single-nucleotide variants. Main Outcomes and
   Measures Cross-sectional associations of adiposity with biomarkers were
   examined using linear regression. Associations of biomarkers with CVD
   risk were assessed using Cox regression among those without prior cancer
   or CVD at baseline. Mendelian randomization was conducted to derive
   genetically estimated associations of BMI with biomarkers. Findings In
   observational analyses of 628 individuals (mean {[}SD] age, 52.2
   {[}10.5] years; 385 women {[}61.3\%]), BMI (mean {[}SD], 23.9 {[}3.6])
   was positively associated with 27 proteins (per 1-SD higher BMI; eg,
   interleukin-6: 0.21 {[}95\% CI, 0.12-0.29] SD; interleukin-18: 0.13
   {[}95\% CI, 0.05-0.21] SD; monocyte chemoattractant protein-1: 0.12
   {[}95\% CI, 0.04-0.20] SD; hepatocyte growth factor: 0.31 {[}95\% CI,
   0.24-0.39] SD), and inversely with 3 proteins (Fas ligand: -0.11 {[}95\%
   CI, -0.19 to -0.03] SD; TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis, -0.14
   {[}95\% CI, -0.23 to -0.06] SD; and carbonic anhydrase 9: (-0.14 {[}95\%
   CI, -0.22 to -0.05] SD), with similar associations identified for other
   adiposity traits (eg, waist circumference {[}r = 0.96]). In mendelian
   randomization, the associations of genetically elevated BMI with
   specific proteins were directionally consistent with the observational
   associations. In meta-analyses of genetically elevated BMI with 8
   proteins, combining present estimates with previous studies, the most
   robust associations were shown for interleukin-6 (per 1-SD higher BMI;
   0.21 {[}95\% CI, 0.13-0.29] SD), interleukin-18 (0.16 {[}95\% CI,
   0.06-0.26] SD), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (0.21 {[}95\% CI,
   0.11-0.30] SD), monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (0.12 {[}95\% CI,
   0.03-0.21] SD), TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (0.23 {[}95\% CI,
   0.13-0.32] SD), and hepatocyte growth factor (0.14 {[}95\% CI,
   0.06-0.22] SD). Of the 30 BMI-associated biomarkers, 10 (including
   interleukin-6, interleukin-18, and hepatocyte growth factor) were
   nominally associated with incident CVD. Conclusions and Relevance
   Mendelian randomization shows adiposity to be associated with a range of
   protein biomarkers, with some biomarkers also showing association with
   CVD risk. Future studies are warranted to validate these findings and
   assess whether proteins may be mediators between adiposity and CVD.
   Question Is adiposity associated with differences in circulating protein
   concentrations, and might these proteins potentially explain the
   associations of adiposity with risk of cardiovascular disease? Findings
   In a cohort study of 628 individuals in China, there was evidence of
   genetic associations of body mass index with protein biomarkers
   consistent with observational associations, particularly for
   interleukin-6, interleukin-18, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1,
   monocyte chemotactic protein-3, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand,
   and hepatocyte growth factor. Several of these proteins were
   observationally associated with risk of incident cardiovascular disease.
   Meaning In this study of Chinese adults, adiposity was associated both
   cross-sectionally and through genetic analyses with a range of protein
   biomarkers, which might partly explain the association between adiposity
   and cardiovascular disease.
   This subcohort study of Chinese adults examines the observational and
   genetic associations of adiposity with proteomics and the observational
   associations of adiposity with cardiovascular disease.}},

Abstract = {{Background To develop a questionnaire to facilitate the inventorying of
   women's expectations for the assessment and treatment of recurrent
   urinary tract infection (UTI) in secondary care. Methods Semi-structured
   interviews were conducted among women with recurrent UTI referred to our
   urology department. The interviews were conducted by one interviewer,
   recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed thematically by two
   researchers. We first developed 35 questions to identify potential
   themes, and we then tested them among women with and without recurrent
   UTI. Changes were made according to the feedback received. Results Six
   interviews were conducted before saturation was reached. Thematic
   analysis identified three themes: patient pathway, personal knowledge,
   and social implications. All respondents had received multiple
   antibiotic courses but no prophylactic antibiotic therapy, and although
   all were aware of some preventive measures, they wanted more information
   about their disease. However, some women were afraid to access
   information for fear of what they might learn. Recurrent UTI also
   significantly affected the daily lives all respondents. Some women
   expressed fears over frequent antibiotic use, and others felt that there
   must be something wrong with their body to have so many UTIs. Women
   expected the urologist to provide an explanation and to start adequate
   therapy for their recurrent UTI. We created a 32-item questionnaire
   based on these themes Conclusion This study not only developed a
   questionnaire for use when assessing patient expectations of recurrent
   UTI management in secondary care but also provided novel insights into
   the thoughts, opinions, and expectations of women who are referred.}},

Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Decreasing sandpiles model the dynamics of configurations where each
   position i epsilon N contains contains a finite number of stacked grains
   h(i), such that h(i) >= h(i+1)(decrease property). Grains move according
   to a decreasing local rule R =(r(1), r(2),..., r(p)) such that r(j) >=
   r(j+1), meaning that r(j) grains move from columns i to i + j for all 1
   <= j <= p, if it does not contradict the decrease property. We are
   interested in the fixed point reached starting from a finite number of
   grains on a unique column.
   In {[}21], we proved the emergence of wave patterns periodically
   covering fixed points, for rules of the form (1,..., 1)(Kadanoff
   sandpile models). The present work is a significative extension: for
   large classes of decreasing sandpile model instances, we prove the
   emergence of patterns of various shapes periodically covering fixed
   points. We introduce new automata to analyze their asymptotic structure,
   and use the least action principle. The difficulty of understanding the
   behavior of sandpile models, despite the simplicity of the rules, is
   what makes the problem challenging. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{In international governance circles it has become common to refer to
   gender interventions as ``the gender thing.{''} The article takes this
   formulation as an opportunity to interrogate what a new materialist
   approach, such as that formulated in Laura Zanotti's Ontological
   Entanglements, Agency, and Ethics in International Relations, could mean
   for international feminist theory and praxis. It first discusses the
   different ways in which gender emerges as an `apparatus', juxtaposing
   Foucauldian formulations of gender as a biopolitical tool to Barad's
   conceptualization of an apparatus as a measuring instrument and her
   understanding of gender as an apparatus of bodily production. Second,
   the article explores Zanotti's development of the notion of
   intra-agential ethos and brings it into conversation with reflections on
   ethics and praxis in feminist IR. It critiques the erasure of languages
   of power from Barad's theory and the failure to attend to difference in

Abstract = {{The physical properties of AHfO(3) (A = Ca, Ba) are revealed using the
   density functional theory (DFT) based FP-LAPW+lo approach. The existing
   work investigates the pressure dependence of mechanical, electronic
   characteristics for specifying the optical and thermoelectric device
   applications of alkaline rare-earth hafnate perovskites. The PBEsol-GGA
   functional has been applied for the dealing of the exchange-correlation
   energy. The lattice constants of the stable cubic phases are extracted
   by structural optimization, which is similar to the existing
   experimental and theoretical literature. The bulk moduli (B) and cubic
   elastic constants are computed for evaluating the mechanical strength
   against external pressure up to 15 GPa. The electronic properties reveal
   that Hf-3d states primarily construct conduction band minima, while O-2p
   states construct valence band maxima at 0 GPa, exhibiting an indirect
   bandgap (Gamma -M), which has been transformed to direct bandgap
   (Gamma-Gamma) at 15 GPa. Investigations of the optical properties
   illustrate that change in pressure can tune the optical parameters of
   these materials within ultraviolet (UV) energies suggesting commercial
   optoelectronic utilities. Our analysis shows that BAHfO(3) exhibits
   better thermoelectric properties than CAHfO(3) at room temperature
   whereas, thermoelectric performance both the compounds become comparable
   at a higher temperature.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to test a model of factors associated with
   participating in function focused care. Function focused care is a
   philosophy of care in which residents are encouraged to engage in

   secondary data analysis using data from the Dissemination and
   Implementation of Function Focused Care for Assisted Living Using the
   Evidence Integration Triangle (FFC-AL-EIT) study. Residents (n = 550)
   were recruited from 59 AL settings. The majority were female (n = 380,
   69\%) and White (n = 536, 97\%). Model testing was done. Comorbidities,
   quality of interactions, environments, profit status, cognitive
   impairment, depression, and function were associated with function
   focused care and accounted for 17\% of the variance. Next steps should
   include intervening on changeable factors (e.g., environments) and
   adding factors to better explain performance of function focused care
   such as motivation, resilience, and staff satisfaction.}},

Title = {{Foveal macular pigment dip in offspring of age-related macular
   degeneration patients is inversely associated with omega-3 index}},
Journal = {{BMC OPHTHALMOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Background Offspring of parent(s) with age-related macular degeneration
   (AMD) have a 45\% lifetime risk of developing the disease. High foveal
   macular pigment optical density (MPOD) is protective, whereas
   individuals with a ``foveal macular pigment dip{''} (FMPD) are at
   increased risk. Shortage of the dietary carotenoids lutein, zeaxanthin
   as well as fish consumption are reported AMD risk factors. This Early
   Biomarkers of AMD (EBAMD) study evaluates serum factors that protect
   foveal MPOD architecture in Caucasian offspring of parent(s) with AMD.
   Methods N = 130 subjects {[}mean (SD) age 62.8 (8.6) years; 36/94
   male/female] were recruited from Scripps Health/ Scripps Memorial
   Hospital/ Scripps Mericos Eye Institute between 2012 and 2017. Macula
   pigment 3D topography was evaluated using specular reflectance. Buccal
   genetic cheek swab, circulating serum dietary carotenoids and long-term
   RBC omega-3 fatty acid status, as well as common secondary clinical
   structural and vision function parameters were obtained. Results 41 \%
   of offspring of AMD parent(s) presented with FMPD. These offspring were
   about 4 years younger than those without FMPD (controls; P = 0.012) and
   had thinner foveas (P = 0.010). There were no differences in gender,
   BMI, \% body fat, visual acuity or contrast sensitivity between those
   with and without FMPD. \% RBC membrane docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was
   reduced in FMPD offspring vs. control offspring (P = 0.04). The Omega-3
   Index was significantly decreased in the FMPD group (P = 0.03).
   Conclusions The percentage of FMPD in AMD offspring is nearly twice that
   reported for the general population in the scientific literature.
   Offspring presenting FMPD had similar AMD genetic risk, but
   significantly reduced \% RBC membrane omega-3 fatty acids and thinner
   foveas compared with those without FMPD. Our data supports the
   importance of `essential fatty' acids as an independent AMD risk factor.}},

Title = {{Antimicrobial Dressing versus Standard Dressing in Obese Women
   Undergoing Cesarean Delivery: A Randomized Controlled Trial}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Objective This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a novel
   antimicrobial dressing on patient satisfaction and health-related
   quality of life (HRQoL) following a cesarean delivery.
   Study Design This was an open-label, single-center, two-arm randomized
   controlled trial. This study was done at the tertiary center, maternal
   unit, Galveston, TX. Pregnant women with body mass indices >= 35 kg/m2
   were screened for eligibility. Women were randomized to ReliaTect
   Post-Op Dressing (RELIATECT) or standard wound dressing (STANDARD).
   Primary outcome was patient satisfaction and HRQoL using validated
   questionnaires. Secondary outcomes were provider satisfaction, surgical
   site infection (SSI) rates, and wound complications.
   Results In total, 160 women were randomized. Population characteristics
   were not significant among groups. RELIATECT dressing group had an
   overall higher score of satisfaction and HRQoL compared with STANDARD
   group. Women in the RELIATECT group reported less incision odor and
   incisional pain. Compared with the STANDARD group, most women in
   RELIATECT dressing group reported better daily activities, self-esteem,
   personal hygiene, body image, and sleep. Providers reported that the
   RELIATECT dressing allowed better assessment of the surgical incision
   site, allowed patients to shower early, and did observe less wound
   dressing leakage. No differences were found in other secondary end
   points.
   Conclusion Postcesarean RELIATECT dressing for wound care in pregnant
   women with obesity had better patient and provider satisfaction as well
   as better HRQoL scores. Further, level 1 evidence is needed to assess
   its impact on SSI rates and wound complication, as this trial was not
   powered to accomplish this goal.}},

Title = {{Spatial thinning and class balancing: Key choices lead to variation in
   the performance of species distribution models with citizen science data}},
Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{216-226}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Spatial biases are a common feature of presence-absence data from
   citizen scientists. Spatial thinning can mitigate errors in species
   distribution models (SDMs) that use these data. When detections or
   non-detections are rare, however, SDMs may suffer from class imbalance
   or low sample size of the minority (i.e. rarer) class. Poor predictions
   can result, the severity of which may vary by modelling technique.
   To explore the consequences of spatial bias and class imbalance in
   presence-absence data, we used eBird citizen science data for 102 bird
   species from the northeastern USA to compare spatial thinning, class
   balancing and majority-only thinning (i.e. retaining all samples of the
   minority class). We created SDMs using two parametric or semi-parametric
   techniques (generalized linear models and generalized additive models)
   and two machine learning techniques (random forest and boosted
   regression trees). We tested the predictive abilities of these SDMs
   using an independent and systematically collected reference dataset with
   a combination of discrimination (area under the receiver operator
   characteristic curve; true skill statistic; area under the
   precision-recall curve) and calibration (Brier score; Cohen's kappa)
   metrics.
   We found large variation in SDM performance depending on thinning and
   balancing decisions. Across all species, there was no single best
   approach, with the optimal choice of thinning and/or balancing depending
   on modelling technique, performance metric and the baseline sample
   prevalence of species in the data. Spatially thinning all the data was
   often a poor approach, especially for species with baseline sample
   prevalence <0.1. For most of these rare species, balancing classes
   improved model discrimination between presence and absence classes using
   machine learning techniques, but typically hindered model calibration.
   Baseline sample prevalence, sample size, modelling approach and the
   intended application of SDM output-whether discrimination or
   calibration-should guide decisions about how to thin or balance data,
   given the considerable influence of these methodological choices on SDM
   performance. For prognostic applications requiring good model
   calibration (vis-a-vis discrimination), the match between sample
   prevalence and true species prevalence may be the overriding feature and
   warrants further investigation.}},

Title = {{Is the DLOQ learning-oriented leadership isomorphic? Learning-oriented
   leadership mediates hierarchical teams' learning dimensions}},
Journal = {{LEARNING ORGANIZATION}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   Learning organizations are often theorized at a team level, yet there is
   a lack of team-level studies. This study aims to evaluate if team-level
   dimensions of a learning organizational questionnaire (DLOQ) measures
   are reliable and reflect real team properties and if both
   individual-level and team-level DLOQ leadership mediates the effect of
   rank on other DLOQ measures.
   Design/methodology/approach
   An empirical analysis evaluated if team-level DLOQ measures are reliable
   and reflected real team properties and if DLOQ learning-oriented
   leadership mediates the effect of rank or team hierarchy on all other
   DLOQ measures. A novel approach (random group resampling) was used to
   evaluate if team level measures reflected either a real team property or
   a statistical artifact. Next, a series of mediation models evaluated if
   learning-oriented leadership was isomorphic, namely, displays a similar
   pattern at both individual and team levels.
   Findings
   The analysis found team-level DLOQ measures reflected real properties of
   the teams and were reliable and learning-oriented leadership mediates
   between rank and team hierarchy and the other six dimensions at both
   individual and team-levels (i.e. DLOQ team and individual level were
   isomorphic).
   Practical implications
   The results show that hierarchical teams' learning capacities can be
   improved by focusing on the learning-oriented leadership, which
   overcomes the typically negative effect of hierarchical differences
   within teams.
   Originality/value
   This study provides a significant step forward by applying an innovative
   analysis that shows that the DLOQ team level measures reflect real team
   properties and DLOQ leadership displays isomorphic characteristics.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},

Abstract = {{In two-dimensional turbulent systems the redistribution of energy can be
   described by quadratic nonlinear three-wave interactions, which are
   limited by resonance conditions. The set of coupling modes can be
   understood as resonant manifold. It has been predicted by theory that,
   in the presence of a shear flow, the resonant manifold in wave-number
   space shrinks in time favoring large-scale structures. The phenomenon of
   manifold shrinking in the presence of shear flows is studied the first
   time experimentally in drift wave turbulence at the stellarator TJ-K by
   bicoherence analysis. By estimating effective mode numbers
   characterizing the width of the manifold, it is demonstrated that
   increasing shear leads to a shrinking of the resonance manifold.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a succinct history of how multilateral dialogue on
   intellectual property (IP) enforcement developed since the Agreement on
   Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement)
   came into effect in 1995. The early years of multilateral IP enforcement
   dialogue were politically volatile and turbulent; while some states
   strove for a further increased level of international IP enforcement,
   others requested to extend the transitional period to implement the
   minimum standards under the TRIPS Agreement. With the adoption of the
   WIPO Development Agenda in 2007, however, this situation started to
   change, and international dialogue shifted from a merely punitive
   conception of IP enforcement to the more holistic concept of building
   respect for IP. To understand the trajectory of this evolution, this
   article describes several IP enforcement initiatives that were
   undertaken somewhat contemporaneously at different international
   organizations, but which ultimately did not secure consensus. From this
   point, this paper elaborates on the concept of building respect for IP,
   examining its origins, its development at WIPO and the profound impact
   it has had on multilateral dialogue on IP enforcement, demonstrating how
   a development-oriented shift in international IP policy has triggered a
   multilateral transformation in a more balanced, inclusive light.}},

   designed to evaluate the expression of PAK1 across various grades and
   its correlation with Ki-67 LI and overall survival rates among a total
   number of 140 clinical brain tumors of glioma patients. We also studied
   the activation status of phospho PAK1 in glioma tissues and established
   the role of PAK1 in proliferation of glioblatoma cell lines under

Title = {{Higher Atmospheric CO2 Levels Favor C-3 Plants Over C-4 Plants in
   Utilizing Ammonium as a Nitrogen Source}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Photosynthesis of wheat and maize declined when grown with NH4+ as a
   nitrogen (N) source at ambient CO2 concentration compared to those grown
   with a mixture of NO3- and NH4+, or NO3- as the sole N source.
   Interestingly, these N nutritional physiological responses changed when
   the atmospheric CO2 concentration increases. We studied the
   photosynthetic responses of wheat and maize growing with various N forms
   at three levels of growth CO2 levels. Hydroponic experiments were
   carried out using a C-3 plant (wheat, Triticum aestivum L. cv. Chuanmai
   58) and a C-4 plant (maize, Zea mays L. cv. Zhongdan 808) given three
   types of N nutrition: sole NO3- (NN), sole NH4+ (AN) and a mixture of
   both NO3- and NH4+ (Mix-N). The test plants were grown using
   custom-built chambers where a continuous and desired atmospheric CO2
   (C-a) concentration could be maintained: 280 mu mol mol(-1)
   (representing the pre-Industrial Revolution CO2 concentration of the
   18th century), 400 mu mol mol(-1) (present level) and 550 mu mol mol(-1)
   (representing the anticipated futuristic concentration in 2050). Under
   AN, the decrease in net photosynthetic rate (P-n) was attributed to a
   reduction in the maximum RuBP-regeneration rate, which then caused
   reductions in the maximum Rubisco-carboxylation rates for both species.
   Decreases in electron transport rate, reduction of electron flux to the
   photosynthetic carbon {[}Je(PCR)] and electron flux for photorespiratory
   carbon oxidation {[}Je(PCO)] were also observed under AN for both
   species. However, the intercellular (C-i) and chloroplast (C-c) CO2
   concentration increased with increasing atmospheric CO2 in C-3 wheat but
   not in C-4 maize, leading to a higher Je(PCR)/ Je(PCO) ratio.
   Interestingly, the reduction of P-n under AN was relieved in wheat
   through higher CO2 levels, but that was not the case in maize. In
   conclusion, elevating atmospheric CO2 concentration increased C-i and
   C-c in wheat, but not in maize, with enhanced electron fluxes towards
   photosynthesis, rather than photorespiration, thereby relieving the
   inhibition of photosynthesis under AN. Our results contributed to a
   better understanding of NH4+ involvement in N nutrition of crops growing
   under different levels of CO2.}},

Title = {{Effective inhibition of MYC-amplified group 3 medulloblastoma by

Abstract = {{Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor
   that can be categorized into four major molecular subgroups. Group 3 MB
   with MYC amplification (MYCamp-G3-MB) has been shown to be highly
   aggressive and exhibited worst prognosis, indicating the need for novel
   effective therapy most urgently. A few epigenetic targeted therapeutic
   strategies have recently been proven to effectively treat preclinical
   models of MYCamp-G3-MB, including BET inhibition, HDAC inhibition and
   SETD8 inhibition, unveiling a promising direction for further
   investigation. In this study, we carried out systemic bioinformatic
   analyses of public-available MB datasets as well as functional genomic
   screening datasets of primary MYCamp-G3-MB lines to search for other
   potential therapeutic targets within epigenetic modulators. We
   identified SSRP1, a subunit of histone-chaperone FACT complex, to be the
   top drug target candidate as it is highly cancer-dependent in
   whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 screening across multiple MYCamp-G3-MB lines;
   significantly upregulated in MYCamp-G3-MB compared to normal cerebellum
   and most of the rest MB subtypes; its higher expression is correlated
   with worse prognosis; and it has a blood-brain-barrier penetrable
   targeted drug that has entered early phase human clinical trials
   already. Then we utilized RNA-interference approach to verify the
   cancer-dependency of SSRP1 in multiple MYCamp-G3-MB lines and further
   confirmed the therapeutic efficacy of FACT-targeted curaxin drug CBL0137
   on treating preclinical models of MYCamp-G3-MB in vitro and in vivo,
   including an orthotopic intracranial xenograft model. Mechanistically,
   transcriptome analyses showed CBL0137 preferentially suppressed
   cell-cycle and DNA-repair related biological processes. Moreover, it
   selectively disrupted transcription of MYC and NEUROD1, two critical
   oncogenic transcription factors of MYCamp-G3-MB, via depleting FACT
   complex from their promoter regions. In summary, our study demonstrates
   FACT-targeted CBL0137 works effectively on treating MYCamp-G3-MB,
   presenting another promising epigenetic-targeted therapeutic strategy
   against the most devastating form of MB.}},

Abstract = {{The eutrophication of lake ecosystems due to anthropogenic activities
   has impacted lakes worldwide and shallow lakes are particularly
   vulnerable. The retention of phosphorus (P) in lake sediments and its
   subsequent release to the water column is often a key factor in degraded
   water quality, algal blooms and delayed responses to lake restoration
   efforts. Despite this link between sedimentary P and poor ecosystem
   outcomes, a limited amount of research has been conducted on P dynamics
   in New Zealand's lakes. In this study, sediments in six shallow lakes
   across the country were analysed for geochemistry and P fractionation.
   Total sedimentary P content varied widely and was related to inflow
   concentrations and hydrological retention times. The P binding capacity
   of the sediments was related to iron (Fe) and aluminium (Al)
   concentrations, while the Fe:P ratio was correlated to the release of P
   under anoxic conditions. P fractions and release rates were poorly
   correlated with traditional water quality parameters, however the
   mobile-P-SL and reducible-P fractions were strongly correlated with the
   frequency of summertime algal blooms. This relationship may provide an
   indicator to assess harmful algal bloom frequency in unmonitored lakes,
   and a valuable tool to assess internal loading risk and inform lake
   restoration methods.}},

Abstract = {{Background Preoperative diagnosis of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC)
   is often difficult, given the poor sensitivity of fine-needle aspiration
   (FNA) cytology for MTC. This study investigates this issue and presents
   recommendations for improving preoperative diagnostic paradigms in MTC
   cases.
   Design/Method Histopathologically confirmed MTC patients with
   preoperative cytologic assessment of index nodules were enrolled. FNA
   diagnosis, final pathology, and surgery details were collected.
   Results Out of 71 patients, 49 (69\%) were diagnosed by FNA as either
   definitive MTC (35, 49\%) or suspected MTC (14, 20\%) and 22 (31\%)
   patients had no indication of MTC on FNA.
   Conclusion In a tertiary-care setting, one-third of subjects had an FNA
   interpretation that did not suggest the possibility of MTC. The
   limitations of preoperative diagnosis are especially problematic for MTC
   as they can cause delayed or incomplete treatment. Additional testing is
   proposed to improve preoperative diagnosis and surgical care of MTC
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet has become one of the important channels for users to
   obtain information and knowledge. It is crucial to work out how to
   acquire personalized requirement of users accurately and effectively

   an information system for group participation in common activities that
   meets the common interests of all members in the group. This paper
   proposes a group recommendation system for network document resource
   exploration using the knowledge graph and LSTM in edge computing, which
   can solve the problem of information overload and resource trek
   effectively. An extensive system test has been carried out in the field
   of big data application in packaging industry. The experimental results
   show that the proposed system recommends network document resource more
   accurately and further improves recommendation quality using the
   knowledge graph and LSTM in edge computing. Therefore, it can meet the

Title = {{Self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety among informal
   caregivers of persons with dementia: a cross-sectional comparative study
   between Sweden and Italy}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Background Around 50 million people worldwide are diagnosed with
   dementia and this number is due to triple by 2050. The majority of
   persons with dementia receive care and support from their family,
   friends or neighbours, who are generally known as informal caregivers.
   These might experience symptoms of depression and anxiety as a
   consequence of caregiving activities. Due to the different welfare
   system across European countries, this study aimed to investigate
   factors associated with self-reported depression and anxiety among
   informal dementia caregivers both in Sweden and Italy, to ultimately
   improve their health and well-being. Methods This comparative
   cross-sectional study used baseline data from the Italian UP-TECH (n =
   317) and the Swedish TECH@HOME (n = 89) studies. Main outcome variables
   were the severity of self-reported anxiety and depression symptoms, as
   measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). HADS
   scores were investigated using descriptive and bivariate statistics to
   compare means and standard deviations. Linear regressions were used to
   test for associations between potential factors and self-reported
   symptoms of depression and anxiety. Results Italian informal caregivers
   reported more severe symptoms of depression and anxiety than Swedish
   caregivers. In Italy, a higher number of hours of caregiving was
   associated with anxiety symptoms (beta = - 1.205; p = 0.029), being
   40-54 years-old with depression symptoms (beta = - 1.739; p = 0.003),
   and being female with symptoms of both depression (beta = - 1.793; p <
   0.001) and anxiety (beta = 1.474; p = 0.005). In Sweden, a higher number
   of hours of caregiving and being < 39 years-old were associated with
   depression symptoms (beta = 0.286; p < 0.000; beta = 3.945; p = 0.014)
   and a higher number of hours of caregiving, the lack of additional
   informal caregivers and dementia severity were associated with anxiety
   symptoms (beta = 0.164; p = 0.010; beta = - 1.133; p = 0.033; beta = -
   1.181; p = 0.031). Conclusion Multiple factors are associated with
   self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety among informal
   caregivers in Sweden and Italy. Factors found in this study partly
   differ between the two countries, suggesting the important role of
   cultural and social factors affecting the experience of caregiving. A
   deeper knowledge of these factors may increase the knowledge on
   potential protective and risk factors, provide information to
   policymakers and ultimately improve the psychological well-being of
   informal caregivers to people with dementia across Europe.}},

Title = {{A robust service composition and optimal selection method for cloud
   manufacturing}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH}},
Abstract = {{During the process of cloud manufacturing, various uncertainties in the
   real world could have a significant impact on the smooth execution of
   task, and could render the planned composite manufacturing service (CMS)
   inefficient or even ineffective. Therefore, this paper proposes an
   optimal selection method to enhance the robustness of CMS during the
   planning stage. Firstly, the structure of robust CMS is proposed by
   arranging the preferred and alternative services for each subtask, and a
   robust service composition and optimal selection (rSCOS) model of cloud
   manufacturing is constructed by defining the expected Quality of
   Service. Then, the gABC-GWO (guiding artificial bee colony - grey wolf
   optimisation) algorithm is proposed to solve the rSCOS model
   efficiently, in which three improvement strategies for ABC algorithm are
   designed according to the characteristics of GWO. Finally, two
   experiments are implemented and the results show that QoS of the
   preferred scheme of robust CMS is approximately 1.29\% lower than that
   of CMS on average, while its robustness is improved by 1.81\% and
   13.14\% depending on the two robustness indexes. Compared with other
   commonly-used intelligence optimisation algorithms, gABC-GWO algorithm
   possesses better search performance without significantly increasing
   time consumption, which makes it more suitable for solving rSOCS
   problems.}},

Abstract = {{Inspired by inorganic oligomers and their polymerization, we herein
   develop a heterogeneous inorganic polymerization tactic that can be used
   to prepare a muscle-like hybrid hydrogel by inducing the polymerization
   of calcium phosphate oligomers (CPO) onto a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)
   molecular chain network. In this heterogeneous process, the CPO units
   bond with PVA molecules via assistance from sodium alginate (SA), and
   then gradually polymerize along the organic chains to form ultrafine
   hydroxyapatite nanolines with a diameter of similar to 1 nm. Because of
   the well integration of organic and inorganic phases from the
   heterogeneous polymerization, the hierarchical structured hydrogel can
   exhibit ultratough mechanical properties of similar to 17.84 MPa in
   strength and similar to 8.97 kJ m(-2) in fracture energy, which exceed
   natural muscles and almost synthetic hydrogels. Moreover, the damaged
   hydrogel can be repaired readily by adding the precursors of CPO, PVA,
   and SA, which can induce in situ re-polymerization. The hydrogel also
   exhibits muscle-like rotational motion under aqueous conditions, which
   can be developed into a water-driven biomimetic motor. This study
   indicates that inorganic polymerization can achieve a novel
   organic-inorganic integration rather than conventional organic-inorganic
   composition, and it provides a novel tactic for design and manufacture
   of advanced materials.}},

Abstract = {{In order to ease the pressure on oil price, the downhole oil-water
   separation system has been adopted to preseparate the output production.
   However, both the gravity separator and the conventional hydrocyclone in
   this system have some restrictions, which hinder their widespread
   application. Therefore, it is necessary to innovate and improve the
   performance of the oil-water separation device. This paper presents a
   novel axial separator for oil-water separation based on analysis of
   droplet trajectory, and an experimental system was fabricated to test
   the separator. A high-speed camera was used to observe the droplet
   trajectories at the swirler, and the formation of the oil core was
   presented. Additionally, experimental investigation was carried out to
   evaluate the novel separation device in the water flow rate range of 3
   to 7 m(3)/h with different inlet oil fractions. In addition, the effect
   of heavy phase outlet (HPO) pressure on separation efficiency was also
   studied. The results show that the separator exhibits good performance
   under the abovementioned experimental conditions. It was also found that
   the separation efficiency depends on the flow rate and the inlet oil
   fraction. Furthermore, increasing the HPO pressure is conducive to
   improve the separation performance.}},

Abstract = {{There is solid evidence for an association between physical activity and
   metabolic health outcomes in children and youth, but for methodological
   reasons most studies describe the intensity spectrum using only a few
   summary measures. We aimed to determine the multivariate physical
   activity intensity signature associated with metabolic health in a large
   and diverse sample of children and youth, by investigating the
   association pattern for the entire physical intensity spectrum. We used
   pooled data from 11 studies and 11,853 participants aged 5.8-18.4 years
   included in the International Children's Accelerometry Database. We
   derived 14 accelerometryderived (ActiGraph) physical activity variables
   covering the intensity spectrum (from 0-99 to >= 8000 counts per
   minute). To handle the multicollinearity among these variables, we used
   multivariate pattern analysis to establish the associations with indices
   of metabolic health (abdominal fatness, insulin sensitivity, lipid
   metabolism, blood pressure). A composite metabolic health score was used
   as the main outcome variable. Associations with the composite metabolic
   health score were weak for sedentary time and light physical activity,
   but gradually strengthened with increasing time spent in moderate and
   vigorous intensities (up to 4000-5000 counts per minute). Association
   patterns were fairly consistent across sex and age groups, but varied
   across different metabolic health outcomes. This novel analytic approach
   suggests that vigorous intensity, rather than less intense activities or
   sedentary behavior, are related to metabolic health in children and
   youth.}},

   prevalence 16.96\%). Corresponding rates for prediabetes for the normal
   BMI category: 9.79\% and underweight 8.99\%. Multivariate logistic
   regression modeling for normal BMI individuals, showed a significantly
   increased risk of T2DM with increasing age (odds ratio {[}OR] 2.1, 3.3,
   4.5 and 4.8, P < 0.001 for 31-40, 41-50, 51-60 and 61 years and above
   respectively, compared to age decade 20-30 years). Similarly, there was
   a significantly high risk of T2DM with lower education level {[}OR for
   no vs graduate 2.4, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.5-3.8]. There was a
   significantly increased risk of T2DM in individuals having a positive
   family history {[}OR 4.3 (95\% CI 7.0-11.5)]. Overall the influence of
   overweight/obese on T2DM occurrence (20\% increased risk) was much less
   than in other regions of the world.
   Conclusion There are higher than expected rates of T2DM/prediabetes in
   Pakistani ethnicity normal BMI individuals. Targeted screening of older
   individuals with historical lack of educational opportunity, with a
   family history of T2DM even if of normal BMI may result in a significant
   benefit in the Pakistan population. Copyright (c) 2020 Wolters Kluwer

Abstract = {{The objective of the research was to investigate the effects of
   artichoke (Cynara scolumus L.) on the egg productivity and some

   artichoke in the diet (2.2 g/kg and 3 g/kg). The analysis of the egg
   productivity was done. The following some biochemical parameters were
   analyzed: total protein, albumin, urea, glucose, alkaline phosphatase
   (ALP), aspartat amino transferase (AST), alanin amino transferase (ALT)
   and elements as potassium, sodium and calcium. Artichoke supplementation
   to the laying hens' diet for a period about of 5 weeks had not
   significant effect on the final body weight and egg productivity during
   both experiments. However, the glucose level as well as ALP and AST
   contents significantly decreased (P < 0.05). Artichoke supplementation
   lead to an increase of potassium (K) and calcium (Ca) in the blood serum
   of laying hens (P < 0.05).}},

Title = {{Geography of public service delivery in rural Ethiopia}},
Journal = {{WORLD DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{136}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Remote areas are often characterized by lower welfare outcomes due to
   economic disadvantages and higher transaction costs for trade. But their
   poorer situation may also be linked to worse public service delivery.
   Relying on large household surveys in rural Ethiopia, we explore this by
   assessing the association of two measures of remoteness - (1) the
   distance of service centers to district capitals and (2) the distance of
   households to service centers (the last mile) - with public service
   delivery in agriculture and health sectors. In the agriculture sector,
   we document statistically significant and economically meaningful
   associations between exposure to agriculture extension and the two
   measures of remoteness. For health extension, only the last mile
   matters. These differences between the two sectors could be due to the
   fact that more remote villages tend to have fewer agriculture extension
   workers who also put in fewer hours than their peers in more connected
   areas. This does not apply in the health sector. These findings provide
   valuable inputs for policymakers aiming to improve inclusiveness in poor
   rural areas. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   poverty, insecurity, hatred, and disposability in the global postcolony.
   We are asked to remember that capital and colony are inseparable, that
   the nation-state is too suspicious a source of comfort, that the eroding
   claims of citizenship across the postcolonial and post-democratic
   fascist failed states are instructive and prophetic, and that the
   assumptions of place and movement in our frames of the democratic

   external debt distress in selected South Asian countries are large and
   increasing current account deficits, lower gross capital formation,
   foreign direct investment and large military expenditures. Among
   selected socio-economic variables, the increase in life expectancy
   increases external debt distress, whereas urbanization reduces it
   considerably. The study urges selected South Asian countries to correct
   highly unfavourable current account balance, resolve regional conflicts
   leading to the reduction of the arms race and make the macroeconomic
   environment friendly for domestic and foreign investment to reduce

   therapeutic strategies, the recurrence rate for hiatal hernia is
   significant, and no existing treatments have had much success in
   reducing this rate. Total gastrectomy, as in this case, represents an
   additional challenge because of the absence of gastric tissue, which can
   buttress the pillars' repair. This case report introduces a novel

Abstract = {{Background: Chronic primary insomnia is characterized by long-term
   difficulties in maintaining and initiating sleep, too early waking up,
   poor mood, fatigue, impaired concentration and poor quality of life.
   Exercise training is recommended to prevent and alleviate sleep
   disorders.
   Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of
   aerobic exercise training on quality of sleep, psycho- logical wellbeing
   and immune system among subjects with chronic primary insomnia. Material
   and methods: Eighty previously sedentary subjects with chronic primary
   insomnia subjects enrolled in this study, their age ranged from 35-56
   years. All participants were randomly assigned to supervised aerobic
   exercise intervention group (group A, n=40) or control group (group B,
   n=40). Polysomnographic recordings for sleep quality assessment, Beck
   Depression Inventory (BDI), Profile of Mood States(POMS), Rosenberg
   Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), number of CD3+,CD4+,CD8+ T cells count and
   CD4/CD8 ratio were measured before and at the end of the study after six
   months.
   Results: There was a significant increase in the total sleep duration,
   sleep efficiency and sleep onset latency in group(A) after six months of
   aerobic exercise training, while, wake time after sleep onset and rapid
   eye movement (REM) latency significantly reduced after six months of
   aerobic training compared with values obtained prior to aerobic exercise
   training. Also, the mean values of BDI, POMS, CD3 count, CD4 count and
   CD8 count decreased significantly and the mean value of RSES
   significantly increased in group (A) after the aerobic exercise
   training, while the results of the control group were not significant.
   Moreover, there were significant differences between both groups at the
   end of the study.
   Conclusion: Exercise training can be considered as a non-pharmacological
   modalty for modifying sleep quality, psychological wellbeing and immune
   system among subjects with chronic primary insomnia.}},

Abstract = {{Helical-coil steam generator (HCSG) technology is a major design
   candidate for small modular reactors due to its compactness and
   capability to produce superheated steam with high generation efficiency.
   In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of the passively
   autonomous power maneuvering by coupling the 3-D transient multi-physics
   of a soluble-boron-free (SBF) core with a time-dependent HCSG model. The
   predictor corrector quasi-static method was used to reduce the cost of
   the transient 3-D neutronic solution. In the numerical system
   simulations, the feedwater flow rate to the secondary of the HCSGs is
   adjusted to extract the demanded power from the primary loop. This
   varies the coolant temperature at the inlet of the SBF core, which
   governs the passively autonomous power maneuvering due to the strongly
   negative coolant reactivity feedback. Here, we simulate a 100-50-100
   load-follow operation with a 5\%/minute power ramping speed to
   investigate the feasibility of the passively autonomous load-follow in a
   450 MWth SBF PWR. In addition, the passively autonomous frequency
   control operation is investigated. The various system models are
   coupled, and they are solved by an in-house Fortran-95 code. The results
   of this work demonstrate constant steam temperature in the secondary
   side and limited variation of the primary coolant temperature.
   Meanwhile, the variations of the core axial shape index and the core
   power peaking are sufficiently small. (C) 2020 Korean Nuclear Society,

Abstract = {{In recent years, integrated use of demand- and supply-side resources has
   been performed by electric utilities, because of their potential
   attractiveness at both operational and economic levels. Demand Response
   Resources (DRRs) can be used as demand side options, which are the
   consequence of implementing Demand Response Programs (DRPs). DRPs
   comprise the actions taken by end-use customers to reduce their
   electricity consumption in response to electricity market's high prices
   and/or reliability problems on the electricity network. In this paper, a
   dynamic economic model of DRPs is derived based upon the concept of
   flexible elasticity of demand and the customer benefit function. Precise
   modeling of these virtual negawatt resources helps system operators to
   investigate the impact of responsive loads on power system studies. This
   paper also aims to prioritize multifarious DRPs by means of Technique
   for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and
   entropy methods. Performance of the proposed model is investigated
   through numerical studies using a standard IEEE test system. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{This paper offers new evidence on the theory of human capital
   accumulation. The current findings in developed countries have
   documented that immigrants' earnings growth exceeds that of natives and
   that immigrants upgrade their occupations over time. Three possible
   explanations for these observations are suggested in the literature: 1)
   immigrants accumulate more human capital than natives, 2) immigrants are
   not able to fully transfer their skills, so over time, they restore the
   value of source-country human capital, and 3) immigrants are more
   productive than natives because they are positively selected on ability.
   This study investigates the labor market outcomes of immigrants in
   low-income countries and finds that immigrants earn more than comparable
   natives and work in better-paid occupations. Over time the gap in
   earnings and occupational distribution between immigrants and natives
   narrows. This observation is more consistent with the predictions of
   human capital accumulation theory than with skill transferability and
   selection theories.}},

Abstract = {{Estimates of plant biomass are helpful for many applications in invasive
   plant science and management, but measuring biomass can be
   time-consuming, costly, or impractical if destructive sampling is
   inappropriate. The objective of this study was to assess feasibility of
   developing regression equations using a fast, nondestructive measure
   (cover) to estimate aboveground biomass for red brome (Bromus rubens
   L.), a widespread nonnative annual grass in the Mojave Desert, USA. At
   three study sites, including one measured for three consecutive years,
   B. rubens cover spanned 0.1\% to 85\% and aboveground biomass 1 to 321 g
   m(-2). In log(10)-transformed linear regressions, B. rubens cover
   accounted for 68\% to 96\% of the variance in B. rubens biomass among
   sites, with all coefficients of determination significant at P < 0.05.
   For every doubling of percent cover, biomass was predicted to increase
   by 78\%, 83\%, and 144\% among the three sites. At the site measured for
   three consecutive years, which ranged in rainfall from 65\% to 159\% of
   the long-term average, regression slopes each year differed from other
   years. Regression results among sites were insensitive to using cover
   classes (10 classes encompassing 0\% to 100\% cover) compared with
   simulated random distribution of integer cover within classes. Biomass
   of B. rubens was amenable to estimation in the field using cover, and
   such estimates may have applications for modeling invasive annual plant
   fuel loads and ecosystem carbon storage.}},

Title = {{The effect of functionalization on rice-husks derived carbon quantum
   dots properties and cadmium removal}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WATER PROCESS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{38}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this work, functionalized CQDs have been synthesized from rice husks
   through hydrothermal process by varying the amount of Ethylenediamine
   (EDA) and ascorbic acid as sources of amine group and carboxyl group,
   respectively. HRTEM images show the formation of functionalized CQDs
   with sizes less than 10 nm. XRD analysis shows that CQDs have graphitic
   structure of (002) plane while their thermal stabilities were analyzed
   using TGA. FTIR analysis of functionalized CQDs reveals the presence of
   oxygen containing groups which indicates their higher affinity towards
   cationic binding. UV Visible spectra show highest peak at around 240 nm
   which corresponds to electronic transition of C--C bond. In addition,
   XPS analysis shows that atomic percentages of carbon and nitrogen
   increase when using higher amount of ascorbic acid and EDA.
   Photoluminescence (PL) properties of CQDs indicate that increasing
   amount of functionalization agent can tune the intensity, with emission
   in green region wavelength (495-570 nm). Meanwhile, quenching of PL
   intensity and reduction in AAS absorbance show that carboxyl and amino
   functionalized CQDs have the potential in detection of cadmium and more
   than 70 \% removal of cadmium from aqueous solution. The cadmium removal
   fits the pseudo-second order kinetic model and Freundlich isotherm with
   kinetic rate of 0.0000243 gmg(1) min(-1) and maximum adsorption capacity
   of 332.72 mg/g, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To determine the prevalence and causes of visual impairment
   in hearing-impaired students in Lagos, Nigeria and to assess their level
   of ophthalmic care utilization.
   Methods: Descriptive cross sectional study carried out in a primary
   school for hearing impaired students in Lagos, Nigeria.
   Socio-demographic characteristics, medical and ocular history were
   obtained. Ocular examination comprised of distance and near visual
   acuity assessment; cover tests; anterior segment examination and direct
   fundoscopy. Visually impaired students had cycloplegic refraction,
   dilated fundoscopy and subjective refraction. In-depth interviews were
   carried out for parents of students requiring referral for further eye
   care.
   Results: One hundred and nine students participated in the study. The
   prevalence of visual impairment was 19\%. The causes of visual
   impairment were refractive error (11\%), amblyopia (6\%), cataract (1\%)
   and macular scarring (1\%). A lower mean age (p = 0.020) and ocular
   misalignment (p = 0.037) were associated with visual impairment on
   multivariate analysis. The spectacle correction coverage was 11\% and
   only 8\% of the students had prior ophthalmic care utilization.
   Ignorance of ocular morbidity and perceived inaccessibility of eye care
   were cited by parents/guardians as reasons for poor utilization of
   eye-care services.
   Conclusion: A high prevalence of visual impairment was found among the
   hearing impaired students; uncorrected refractive error and refractive
   amblyopia were the most prevalent causes. The level of prior ophthalmic
   service utilization was found to be low. It was recommended that
   ophthalmic services especially refractive services should be made
   available in schools for the hearing impaired.}},

   journalists tweet at statistically the same rate, but male sports
   journalists are more likely to tweet about sports than female sports
   journalists, less likely to tweet about women sports and athletes, and
   more likely to use assertive language in their tweets. Findings are

Abstract = {{This study examines the dynamic relationship between the London
   Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the inflation rate, the unemployment
   rate and economic growth in the context of the UK, for the period 1992:
   Q1 to 2016: Q4. The study aims to evaluate the impact of the LIBOR on
   the management of macroeconomic stability in the UK during the period
   under review. The study employs a vector autoregressive (VAR) model to
   examine the dynamic relationship between interest rates, unemployment
   and GDP. A co-integration test evaluates the long-run relationship
   between these variables, and the VAR Granger-causality tests the
   direction of causation among the variables.
   The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test shows that the co-integration
   conditions are not satisfied, as they do not confirm the existence of a
   long-run relationship between the LIBOR and the other variables.
   However, the VAR model indicates that there does exist a dynamic
   short-run relationship between the LIBOR and the consumer price index
   (CPI) as a measure of inflation. In contrast, the model suggests that
   there no short-run relationship exists between either the LIBOR and
   unemployment rate or the LIBOR and economic growth. Granger-causality
   Wald tests suggest that there is a directional causality between the
   LIBOR and the inflation rate. However, the test does not indicate a
   directional causality between the LIBOR and the other variables,
   suggesting that the former does not contribute to employment or economic
   growth in the UK.
   The findings suggest that while the LIBOR is sufficient for controlling
   inflation, it is not sufficient for improving economic growth and
   employment in the UK. Additionally, the study supports the likelihood of
   the Bank of England using monetary policy instruments that are
   alternatives to the LIBOR to boost economic growth in the UK.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The detection and exact localization of penetrating foreign
   bodies are crucial for the appropriate management of patients with
   dentoalveolar trauma. This study compared the efficacy of cone-beam
   computed tomography (CBCT) and spiral computed tomography (CT) scans for
   the detection of different foreign bodies composed of 5 frequently
   encountered materials in 2 sizes. The effect of the location of the
   foreign bodies on their visibility was also analyzed.
   Materials and Methods: In this in vitro study, metal, tooth, stone,
   glass, and plastic particles measuring 1 x 1 x 1 mm and 2 x 2 x 2 mm
   were prepared. They were implanted in a sheep's head in the tongue
   muscle, nasal cavity, and at the interface of the mandibular cortex and
   soft tissue. CBCT and spiral CT scans were taken and the visibility of
   foreign bodies was scored by 4 skilled maxillofacial radiologists who
   were blinded to the location and number of foreign bodies.
   Results: CT and CBCT were equally accurate in visualizing metal, stone,
   and tooth particles of both sizes. However, CBCT was better for
   detecting glass particles in the periosteum. Although both imaging
   modalities visualized plastic particles poorly, CT was slightly better
   for detecting plastic particles, especially the smaller ones.
   Conclusion: Considering the lower patient radiation dose and cost, CBCT
   can be used with almost equal accuracy as CT for detecting foreign
   bodies of different compositions and sizes in multiple maxillofacial
   regions. However, CT performed better for detecting plastic particles.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to examine the influence of two prebiotics,

   activity of probiotic Lactiplantibacillus (L. pentosus S42 and L.
   plantarum S61) and Levilactobacillus (L. brevis S27) strains isolated
   from fermented olive. The results demonstrated the ability of strains to
   ferment XOS more than FOS as a sole carbon source, resulting in pH
   reduction. The prebiotics (FOS and XOS) significantly increased (p <
   0.05) their survival in gastro-intestinal conditions (low pH and 0.3\%
   of bile salts), as well as their hydrophobicity, auto-aggregation and
   production of proteins, compared to glucose (control). The major organic
   acids produced by Lactiplantibacillus and Levilactobacillus strains,
   were oxalic, malic and lactic acids from FOS, XOS and glucose,
   respectively. No antimicrobial activity was observed from cell-free
   supernatant (CFS) of Lactiplantibacillus and Levilactobacillus strains
   obtained from FOS. In the presence of XOS the organic acids, produced by
   Lactiplantibacillus and Levilactobacillus strains, were more diverse
   with high contents, and exhibited higher antifungal and antibacterial
   activities, more than that of FOS and glucose. The combination of L.
   plantarum S61 and XOS demonstrated the highest inhibition zones ranges
   of 20.7-22.2 mm against pathogenic bacteria and 29.2-30 mm against
   yeasts. This combination can be used in production of antifungal
   preservatives and pharmaceuticals, against pathogenic and spoilage
   yeasts.

Abstract = {{Salmonella infection can pose serious health issues, especially to
   children, elders or immunosuppressed humans. Wild populations of
   reptiles can reach Salmonella prevalence of up to 100\% and the direct
   or indirect transmission from reptiles to humans have been extensively
   reported. Fernando de Noronha (FN) is an inhabited oceanic archipelago
   in the northeast coast of Brazil, with an economy based on tourism. The
   tegu (Salvator merianae) is the largest lizard native to South America
   and was introduced to the archipelago in the early 20th century. This
   study determines the prevalence, serotypes, antimicrobial resistance,
   and molecular epidemiology of Salmonella enterica in the tegu population
   from FN archipelago. Results show that S. enterica is widely distributed
   in the FN tegu population, with 43.8\% prevalence. The bacteria were
   isolated from 70.5\% of the sampled sites and a total of 15 serotypes
   were detected in 98 S. enterica isolates. Strains were further
   classified into 31 genotypes. Recaptured animals presented distinct
   genotypes in each season, demonstrating a seasonal strain turnover. Most
   S. enterica isolates from FN tegus presented low antimicrobial
   resistance. This is possibly due to geographical isolation of the island
   population, hampering contact with strains from livestock from the
   continent, where antimicrobial resistance is common.}},

Abstract = {{Background: To evaluate whether a simplified (s) version of the
   psoriatic arthritis magnetic resonance imaging score (PsAMRIS),
   sPsAMRIS, is a potential tool for therapy monitoring in psoriatic
   arthritis (PsA). Methods: Seventeen patients with active psoriatic
   arthritis (PsA) underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 T of the
   clinically dominant hand at baseline and after 6 months. Scoring was
   performed by two musculoskeletal radiologists in terms of the PsAMRIS
   and sPsAMRIS, which is a simplified version with reduced item numbers
   based on prior evaluation of responsiveness to change by standardized
   response means (SRMs). Both scores were compared by calculation of
   overall and each sub-score's SRMs and relative efficacy (RE) after
   bootstrapping. Results: PsAMRIS sub-scores of MCP joints 3 and 4, and
   proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint 4 had the highest SRM (-0.07 each),
   indicating highest responsiveness to change, and were, therefore,
   included in sPsAMRIS. Compared to PsAMRIS, sPsAMRIS was characterized by
   higher SRMs (sPsAMRIS: -0.13 vs. PsAMRIS: -0.02) and higher RE (29.46).
   sPsAMRIS and PsAMRIS were highly correlated at baseline (r = 0.75, p <
   0.01 (Pearson's correlation)) and at 6-month follow-up (r = 0.64, p =
   0.01). Mean time burden for completion of scoring per MRI study was
   significantly reduced when using PsAMRIS (469 +/- 87.03 s) as compared
   to sPsAMRIS (140.1 +/- 21.25 s) (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Due to its
   similar responsiveness to change compared to standard PsAMRIS, and time
   efficiency, sPsAMRIS might be a potential diagnostic tool to
   quantitatively assess and monitor therapy in PsA.}},

Abstract = {{New models of knowledge creation are emerging, where the user community
   is a major source of innovation development. But, how does user
   innovation impact on producer sales, and the other way round? In this
   article, the mutual benefits deriving from the user-producer interaction
   are analyzed in terms of network effects and on a basis of a unique
   panel dataset of weekly observations in the context of video games and
   their user-generated, free modifications. The estimates of a system of
   equations modeling the original good's retail demand function and the
   user innovation dynamics show that user-generated complements spur the
   demand for the original product and smooth the consumer price
   sensitivity. User innovation increases with the crowd of complementors
   up to a certain threshold and decreases afterwards, thus following a
   non-monotonic pattern.}},

Abstract = {{Growing evidence demonstrates that human mesenchymal stromal cells
   (MSCs) modify their in vivo anti-inflammatory actions depending on the
   specific inflammatory environment encountered. Understanding this better
   is crucial to refine MSC-based cell therapies for lung and other
   diseases. Using acute exacerbations of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease
   as a model, the effects of ex vivo MSC exposure to clinical
   bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples, as a surrogate for the in
   vivo clinical lung environment, on MSC viability, gene expression,
   secreted cytokines, and mitochondrial function were compared with
   effects of BALF collected from healthy volunteers. CF BALF samples that
   cultured positive for Aspergillus sp. (Asp) induced rapid MSC death,
   usually within several hours of exposure. Further analyses suggested the
   fungal toxin gliotoxin as a potential mediator contributing to CF
   BALF-induced MSC death. RNA sequencing analyses of MSCs exposed to
   either Asp+ or Asp- CF BALF samples identified a number of
   differentially expressed transcripts, including those involved in
   interferon signaling, antimicrobial gene expression, and cell death.
   Toxicity did not correlate with bacterial lung infections. These results
   suggest that the potential use of MSC-based cell therapies for CF or
   other lung diseases may not be warranted in the presence of Aspergillus.}},

Journal = {{SAGE OPEN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: An occupational injury is a global health issue, and in
   hotel industries, little is known about it. The aim of this study was
   therefore to assess the epidemiology of occupational injuries in
   international brand hotels.
   Method: An institutional cross-sectional study was conducted among 330
   workers using a systematic random sampling method. Using EpiData and
   SPSS, respectively, data were entered and analyzed. The final results
   were explained and presented with the adjusted odds ratio and the 95\%
   confidence interval, and the results of the qualitative data were
   triangulated with quantitative data.
   Results: Of the 330 study participants, 125 (37.9\%; 95\% confidence
   interval (32.7\%, 43.8\%)) reported having sustained an occupational
   injury. The study showed those who had four or less family members
   (adjusted odds ratio: 0.484, 95\% confidence interval (0.286, 0.818)),
   those who had low educational background (adjusted odds ratio: 1.466,
   95\% confidence interval (1.098, 1.959)), those who had 2 years or less
   work experience (adjusted odds ratio: 1.065, 95\% confidence interval
   (1.023, 1.108)), those who were working in shifts (adjusted odds ratio:
   2.559, 95\% confidence interval (1.197, 5.474)), and those who had sleep
   disturbance (adjusted odds ratio: 1.797, 95\% confidence interval
   (1.025, 3.151)) were factors significantly associated with occupational
   injury.
   Conclusion: The study found that the prevalence rate was very high.
   Among the variables included in the analysis, having four or less family
   sizes, low educational background, having work experience of 2 years or
   less, working in shifts, and having sleep disorders/problems were
   statistically significant. It is therefore recommended that health and
   safety training and reinforcement be provided to increase awareness and
   understand the risk factors at the workplace.}},

Abstract = {{This research evaluated the nesting habitat, nest-site preferences, and
   nest architecture of the critically endangered White-bellied Heron Ardea
   insignis in Bhutan. There are fewer than 60 wild birds left in the
   world, distributed in Bhutan, India, and Myanmar with fewer than five
   active breeding pairs in Bhutan. From 2003 to 2018, 20 successful and
   two unsuccessful nests were located from which at least 76 juveniles
   were expected to have fledged. The population in Bhutan has remained at
   22-30 individuals for the last decade. Site-specific data were collected
   from 22 nests, and additional vegetation and environmental data were
   collected from 14 nests and random sites. We used 20-m diameter circular
   plots to evaluate the site preferences. Ground vegetation, litter and
   rock cover were evaluated using four 1-m(2) quadrats in both nest and
   random sites. Nesting habitat was analysed to compare characteristics of
   nesting sites to random sites. Our results suggest that the
   White-bellied Heron builds a simple platform nest within average
   distance of 74 m from water bodies on the tallest isolated trees at an
   average height of 18.3 m on an elevated site with a clear overview of
   surroundings and are sensitive to even slight disturbance. Our results
   also suggest that the bird has a preference for an east-facing aspect at
   an average slope of approximately 40 degrees between the altitudes of
   400-1,450 m. Our observations also suggest that the bird has abandoned
   all nesting sites used prior to 2015, and the frequency of nest re-use
   has decreased. Protecting each nest site from hazards, avoiding
   disturbance, maintaining safe feeding habitats and flight routes are
   essential to ensure continued breeding in current sites and survival of
   this population. Further research to better understand the habitat
   requirements for the White-bellied Heron is vital.}},

Abstract = {{In 2016, the Flemish Government adopted the transversal policy paper
   ``Vision 2050, a long term strategy for Flanders{''}. It has set the
   ambition for Flanders for 2050 and has paved the way for a transition to
   a Circular Economy. It provided new objectives and confirmed the
   ambition to further reduce the total amount of (residual) waste by
   closing the loop and reducing the use of primary resources. More than
   before, prevention and reuse have been an integral part of materials
   management. The impact of waste behaviour needs to be measured against
   environmental and social priorities. In this context, the REPAiR project
   developed a multi-stakeholder and interdisciplinary methodology.
   Building on this methodology, this paper explores how governance in
   Flanders and Ghent has been affected by this transition and draws
   lessons to address these challenges.}},

Abstract = {{Root infestation by the tobacco cyst nematode (TCN) is a significant
   problem in Solanaceous crops in North America and Europe. Some related
   Solanaceae that are typically regarded as weeds, are known or suspected
   hosts of TCN. Cyst nematode eggs usually hatch when chemicals produced
   by the roots of their specific host plants are detected. The purpose of
   this experiment was to use root exudates obtained from hydroponically
   grown plants to identify weedy species of Solanum that may stimulate the
   hatching of TCN. A hatching assay was conducted using three
   concentrations of root exudate from nine accessions of hydroponically
   grown Solanum spp. All plants were grown under in vitro conditions.
   Linear regression and ANOVA support that hydroponically obtained root
   exudates from accessions of S. dulcamara, S. ptychanthum, and S.
   physalifolium elicited a dose-dependent hatching response. Solanum spp.
   growing in or around agricultural fields may act as reservoir hosts, or
   some accessions may be used as trap crops for TCN management.
   Hydroponically produced exudate may be a more efficient alternative to
   field grown plants for nematological studies.}},

Title = {{A calibration method for estimating mudcake thickness and porosity using
   NMR data}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{195}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Mudcake thickness affects wellbore operations such as differential
   sticking, well completion, and wellbore cleanup operations. One of the
   properties for which a drilling fluid is screened during laboratory
   tests is the thickness of the mudcake it produces. Such laboratory tests
   are routinely conducted on ceramic discs or rock samples, at a specified
   temperature and pressure. Mathematical models have also been reported
   for predicting cake thickness and mud induced formation damage. The
   problem here is that the conditions upon which both laboratory tests and
   mathematical models are run do not match all conditions in the wellbore
   during drilling. Calliper tools can be used to directly quantify mudcake
   thickness in wellbore, however, they cannot differentiate between a
   sloughing hole and a mudcake. This study therefore explores the
   potentiality of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logging tools to
   measure the thickness and porosity of mudcake, and mud induced formation
   damage in wellbores. This proposed approach utilizes measurements
   routinely taken from a multi-frequency NMR logging tool, namely T-2
   relaxation times at three depth of investigations (DOI). For this
   specific application, the first DOI captures the mudcake and the near
   wellbore region, the second DOI captures an inner radius (invaded zone),
   while the third DOI measures the virgin zone. NMR measurements in these
   three DOIs were simulated in our laboratory experiments. From the
   acquired NMR measurements, we identified characteristic T-2 - curves for
   mudcakes and solid infiltration and then defined a workflow to obtain
   them. The areas under these characteristic T-2-curves showed good
   correlations with the mudcake porosity and thickness. Based on these,
   several calibration curves were developed for mudcake thicknesses,
   porosity and formation damage. The calibration curves appear to be
   robust since they were obtained from a variety of rock types with a wide
   range of porosity and permeability.}},

Abstract = {{Engineered cementitious composite (ECC) is conventionally made up of
   high content fly ash (FA) combined with Portland cement (PC) as a
   binder. However, the growing call for sustainability is leading to
   continuous decommissioning of various coal power plants around the world
   thereby limiting the supply of fly ash available for ECC production.
   Therefore, it is of high importance to find alternative materials that
   can be incorporated into ECC as a partial replacement of the
   conventional binders. This experimental investigation was carried out to
   investigate the feasibility of incorporating glass powder (GP) as binder
   into ECC mixtures. The mechanical performance in terms of its
   compressive, tensile, and flexural properties was evaluated. Results
   from this study showed that 25\% FA can be replaced with GP without any
   significant reduction in the mechanical performance of ECC mixtures.
   Microstructural investigations of the mixtures incorporating GP show
   good bonding between the cementitious matrix and the fibres.}},

   at\% changed the precipitate morphology from spherical to cuboidal upon
   50h ageing at 900 degrees C. Also, the lattice misfit and solvus
   temperature of the alloy increased from 0.097 to 0.41\% and 1109 to 1199
   degrees C, respectively, with the complete removal of Fe from the alloy
   system. Coarsening studies at 900 degrees C (up to 550h) revealed that
   the y ` coarsening was driven by evaporation and condensation (EC)
   mechanism in Al7.8Co20.6Cr12.2FexNi52.2-xTi7.2 ( x=11.5, 5 and 0, in

Title = {{High-dimensional dynamics of generalization error in neural networks}},
Journal = {{NEURAL NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{132}},
Pages = {{428-446}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We perform an analysis of the average generalization dynamics of large
   neural networks trained using gradient descent. We study the
   practically-relevant ``high-dimensional{''}regime where the number of
   free parameters in the network is on the order of or even larger than
   the number of examples in the dataset. Using random matrix theory and
   exact solutions in linear models, we derive the generalization error and
   training error dynamics of learning and analyze how they depend on the
   dimensionality of data and signal to noise ratio of the learning
   problem. We find that the dynamics of gradient descent learning
   naturally protect against overtraining and overfitting in large
   networks. Overtraining is worst at intermediate network sizes, when the
   effective number of free parameters equals the number of samples, and
   thus can be reduced by making a network smaller or larger. Additionally,
   in the high-dimensional regime, low generalization error requires
   starting with small initial weights. We then turn to non-linear neural
   networks, and show that making networks very large does not harm their
   generalization performance. On the contrary, it can in fact reduce
   overtraining, even without early stopping or regularization of any sort.
   We identify two novel phenomena underlying this behavior in overcomplete
   models: first, there is a frozen subspace of the weights in which no
   learning occurs under gradient descent; and second, the statistical
   properties of the high-dimensional regime yield better-conditioned input
   correlations which protect against overtraining. We demonstrate that
   standard application of theories such as Rademacher complexity are
   inaccurate in predicting the generalization performance of deep neural
   networks, and derive an alternative bound which incorporates the frozen
   subspace and conditioning effects and qualitatively matches the behavior
   observed in simulation. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, RF behavior studies on a W-band continuous wave (CW)
   gyrotron for industrial, scientific, and medical applications are
   presented. Two different designs are carried out for the output power
   level of 50 and 100 kW. The mode competition with the first and second
   harmonic neighboring modes is carefully investigated, and TE6,2 and
   TE10,4 are chosen as the operating modes for these designs. The cold
   cavity design and self-consistent computations for power and efficiency
   are done to determine the geometrical and beam parameters of the desired
   modes using the in-house code, Gyrotron Design Suite Second Harmonic
   Version 2018 (GDS2H-V. 2018). The desired output power is obtained for
   two different designs at the chosen cavity modes. Additionally, electron
   guns along with magnetic guidance systems are designed to generate an
   electron beam with the required beam parameters for the two designs.}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   Long-term evidence on ustekinumab treatment response and persistence in
   patients with Crohn's disease in a real-world setting is scarce. We
   performed a retrospective nationwide chart review study of long-term
   clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease patients treated with ustekinumab.
   Methods
   The study was conducted in 17 Finnish hospitals and included adult
   Crohn's disease patients who received an initial intravenous dose of
   ustekinumab during 2017-2018. Disease activity data were collected at
   baseline, 16 weeks, and 1 year from health records.
   Results
   The study included 155 patients. The disease was stricturing or
   penetrating in 69 and 59\% had prior Crohn's disease-related surgeries,
   and 97\% had a treatment history of at least one biologic agent. Of 93
   patients with >= 1 year of follow-up, 77 (83\%) were still on
   ustekinumab at 1 year. In patients with data available, from baseline to
   the 1-year follow-up the simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease
   (SES-CD) decreased from 10 to 3 (P = 0.033), C-reactive protein from 7
   to 5 mg/L, (P 0.001) and faecal calprotectin from 776 to 305 mu g/g (P
   0.001).
   Conclusions
   Ustekinumab treatment in patients with highly refractory Crohn's disease
   resulted in high long-term treatment persistence and significantly
   reduced disease activity, assessed with objective markers for intestinal
   inflammatory activity.}},

Abstract = {{Healthcare centers are ideal settings to identify and motivate parents
   to adhere to healthier lifestyles in order to reverse their child's
   excessive weight. However, such promotions are time- and
   resource-consuming, and primary health care needs new approaches to
   engage parents. In this article, we present an app for that purpose,
   with tailored recommendations for parents regarding young children's
   lifestyles (eating, drinking, moving, and sleeping habits) with
   gamification mechanics for parents, and a serious game for their
   children, aged 3-6 years. Healthcare center based questionnaires were
   used to assess parent's acceptance of the app. We also determined their
   enrollment and retention rates with a pilot study, in order to test the
   implementation of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in the future
   (pilot trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03881280). In the pilot
   study, we tested their engagement with the app during a four-week period
   through a monitoring website. In the acceptance test (n = 13), parents
   rated the app a median score of seven on a ten-point scale. In the pilot
   study (n = 21), all parents in the intervention group used the app. The
   retention rate was 71.4\%. This study indicated some areas of
   improvement related to gaming mechanics in order to increase
   participation. Healthcare center's professionals and parents of children
   with overweight/obesity accepted this innovative approach. In addition,
   it is feasible to test its impact on children's lifestyle by conducting
   an RCT in the future.}},

Journal = {{PHOTODIAGNOSIS AND PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{32}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) as a complementary
   step of selective removal of dental caries appears as an ideal choice to
   help manage caries with minimal interventions. Sub-lethal dose of aPDT
   (sPDT) impressively effects microbial virulence, although it does not
   kill microorganisms. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate
   the influence of sPDT using diode laser plus chlorophyllin-phycocyanin
   mixture (PhotoActive(+)) on changes in gtfB gene expression and the
   subsequent protein expression of GtfB.
   Materials and methods: sPDT using PhotoActive(+) and 635 +/- 10 nm diode
   laser was used to examine the expression of gtfB mRNA and GtfB protein
   expression of Streptococcus mutans by quantitative real time PCR
   (qRT-PCR) method and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
   electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), respectively.
   Results: In this study, sPDT using 2.4 x 10(-3) mol/L PhotoActive(+)
   with 3 min irradiation time of diode laser with energy density of 104
   J/cm(2), significantly reduced the gtfB gene expression with rates of
   3.5-fold (P < 0.05). Also, PhotoActive(+) mediated sPDT demonstrated a
   significant reduction in GtfB protein expression of S. mutans up to 54
   \% (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated the potential effect of
   PhotoActive(+) mediated sPDT on one of the most important virulence
   factors of S. mutans.}},

   mud performance: Towards enhanced drilling operations}},
Journal = {{APPLIED CLAY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{199}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{A novel tailor-made TiO2 nanoparticles-bentonite (TNBT)
   nanocomposite-enhanced drilling mud was tested. The drilling mud showed
   excellent performance; (i) lubricity was enhanced, (ii) thin and
   well-intact mud cakes were created, (iii) coating was provided on shale
   and bentonite plugs, and (iv) clay and shale swelling were mitigated,
   hence these features ensured a platform for sustainable oil and gas well
   drilling. The synthesised TNBT nano composite followed the one-third
   bridging rule, i.e., these nanoparticles can bridge nanopore throats in
   shale pellets and American Petroleum Institute (API) standard bentonite
   pellets. The tailor-made TNBT nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray
   diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. The coefficient of
   friction and filtrate loss of TNBT-enhanced muds were determined with a
   lubricity tester, and an API filter press, respectively. Additionally,
   shale and clay swellings were determined with a linear swell meter. The
   coefficient of friction was reduced after 0.8 g of TNBT was added to 350
   ml drilling mud, resulting in a 35\% enhancement in mud lubricity. The
   new mud also drastically mitigated the swelling in shale and clay when
   compared to conventional mud. The swelling inhibition was attributed to
   an increase in the mud viscosity and improved nanopore plugging
   characteristics, which resulted in less water infiltration. Thus,
   drilling mud supplemented with the tailor-made TiO2
   nanoparticles-bentonite nanocomposite showed superior characteristics
   and a good potential for field operations.}},

Abstract = {{This work is the first attempt to study the physicochemical properties
   of ionogels - quasi-solid hybrid materials formed by ionic liquids (ILs)
   - 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium (BMIm(+)) salts with dicyanamide- (DCA-),
   bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide- (TFSI-), and
   trifluoromethanesulfonate- (Otf(-)) anions - and halloysite, a powdered
   clay filler with nanotube particles (at the IL:Hal molar ratio of 2:1)
   in order to find possible new applications of ionic liquids and
   industrial minerals. The electron microscopy, TG, and DSC analysis, FTIR
   spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, conductometry and cyclic
   voltammetry methods are used to investigate the anion effect on the IL
   interaction with halloysite. It has, for the first time, been found that
   the distinguishing feature of halloysite interaction with an IL
   determining the structural changes in the clay mineral and
   electrochemical characteristics of the ionogels is partial dehydration
   of the clay and absorption of the released water by the ionic liquid. It
   is shown that the halloysite dehydration effect depends on the IL
   hydrophilicity determined by the anion type, corresponds to the series:
   BMImDCA > BMImOtf > BMImTFSI. The electrochemical and thermal behaviour
   of ILs confined within a halloysite matrix differs from that of bulk ILs
   and is controlled by the anion type. Temperature dependences of the
   structural resistance of the halloysite filler are radically different
   for the ILs with high and low hydrophilicity. The effects resulting from
   the formation of halloysite-based ionogels can be of interest to those
   who develop quasi-solid ionic conductors that can work within a wide
   temperature range. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King

Abstract = {{For the first time, electroactive nanocomposite elastomers based on
   polydimethylsiloxane and filled with rod-like alpha-MnO2 nanoparticles
   have been obtained. The curing of the filled elastomer in an electric
   field, resulting in the ordering of the alpha-MnO2 particles, had a
   significant effect on the degree of polymer crosslinking, as well as on
   the electrorheological characteristics of the nanocomposites obtained
   through this process, namely the values of the storage and loss moduli.
   The dielectric spectra of filled elastomers in the frequency range
   25-10(6) Hz were analysed in terms of interfacial relaxation processes.
   It has been shown, for the first time, that the application of an
   electric field leads to a decrease in the value of the Payne effect in
   composite elastomers. Analysis of the rheological effect in the obtained
   materials has demonstrated the possibility of designing highly efficient
   electrorheological elastomers that change their elastic properties by
   4.3 times in electric fields of up to 2 kV/mm.}},

Abstract = {{Achieving compression in the fracture line gap by open reduction and
   internal fixation leads to more primary bone healing and therefore
   hastens the healing process and patient's rehabilitation. We aimed to
   evaluate the application of compression by a modification in screw
   insertion in miniplates to improve the efficiency of the previous
   relevant methods. In this in vitro experimental study 20 sheep
   hemimandibles were prepared. Following intentional fracturing of the
   hemimandibular bodies, the specimens were divided into two: the control
   and study groups (n = 10 each). The control group was fixed with
   straight four-hole dynamic compression plate (DCP) without a bar and
   with parallel screws. The study group was fixed with a straight
   four-hole miniplate without a bar. Screws were divergently inserted into
   the bone with an angle of 45 degrees. The differences in the fracture
   line gap were measured before and after fixation considering the
   indicators of compression. The strength of the fixation was also
   assessed with a universal testing machine. The control group provided
   more compression than the study group (p = 0.4). There was no difference
   in the strength of fixation between the two groups. It is concluded that
   the application of the miniplates with divergent screws instead of DCP
   could encompass the advantages of both perspectives such as intraoral
   incisions and compressive force and prevent the disadvantages of
   compression plates such as hard adaptation. (c) 2020 The British

Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology for modeling traffic responsive (or
   adaptive) ramp metering in the freeway facilities method based on the
   sixth edition of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM6). Currently, the HCM
   only provides an option to meter on-ramps as user input using 15-min
   average flow rates with a focus on planning-level analyses. As a result,
   the possibilities for simulating and modeling ramp meters with any
   traffic responsive ramp metering algorithm in the HCM context are
   limited. Moreover, the freeway facilities methodology in the HCM plays a
   vital role in the analysis of travel time reliability, which is built on
   a set of operational scenarios. However, with the lack of traffic
   responsive ramp metering, analysts are burdened with the task of
   manually entering average effective ramp metering rates for each on-ramp
   within the set of reliability scenarios. This process can require a
   substantial amount of time, in addition to increasing the potential for
   inaccuracy and bias in freeway and performance measure estimations. As a
   result, this paper is designed to fill a significant research gap by
   providing a method for analyzing traffic responsive (or adaptive) ramp
   metering, an active traffic and demand management strategy, using the
   core freeway facilities methodology in the HCM. The direct application
   of the method focuses on the MaxView metering algorithm. However, the
   proposed framework can be used to model any traffic responsive ramp
   metering algorithm. The results are validated using real-world sites
   located on the I-540 westbound freeway corridor in North Carolina.}},

Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Radars are used to retrieve physical parameters related to clouds and
   fog. With these measurements, models can be developed for several
   application fields such as climate, agriculture, aviation, energy, and
   astronomy. In Chile, coastal fog and low marine stratus intersect the
   coastal topography, forming a thick fog essential to sustain coastal
   ecosystems. This phenomenon motivates the development of cloud radars to
   boost scientific research. In this article, we present the design of a
   Ka-band cloud radar and the experiments that prove its operation. The
   radar uses a frequency-modulated continuous-wave with a carrier
   frequency of 38 GHz. By using a drone and a commercial Lidar, we were
   able to verify that the radar can measure reflectivities in the order of
   -60 dBZ at 500 m of distance, with a range resolution of 20 m. The lower
   needed range coverage imposed by our case of study enabled a significant
   reduction of the instrument cost compared to existent alternatives. The
   portability and low-cost of the designed instrument enable its
   implementation in a distributed manner along the coastal mountain range,
   as well as its use in medium-size aerial vehicles or balloons to study
   higher layers. The main features, limitations, and possible improvements
   to the current instrument are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic neurodegenerative disease.
   Population carrier screening for SMA was introduced in Israel in 2008
   through health-care services' insurance plans and expanded to the entire
   Israeli population in 2013 by a national health program. The aim of the
   study was to evaluate the impact of carrier screening on reducing the
   rate of birth of infants with SMA. All cases of prenatal and postnatal
   diagnosis of SMA in 2008-2017 were identified from databases of relevant
   government organizations, genetic laboratories in medical centers, and
   health care systems in Israel. Since 2013, screening was performed in
   309,352 individuals, of whom 5741 were found to be carriers (carrier
   rate 1:54). Given an average of 180,000 live births annually, the
   predicted rate of SMA diagnosis was 15 cases per year. Prior to 2013,
   the average rate of prenatally diagnosed SMA was 4.66 cases per year,
   compared with 7.75 cases per year following population-wide provision of
   screening. The annual rate of postnatally diagnosed cases remained
   steady since 2008, with an average of 77.25 cases per year. Screening
   has been effective in increasing prenatal detection of SMA but has had
   no effect on the rate of confirmed postnatal diagnoses. We speculate
   that screening rates may be affected by social, cultural, and religious
   factors. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Better understand knowledge, attitudes and practices of
   pregnant women and mothers of infants around coronavirus disease 2019
   (COVID-19).
   Methods: A 58-item electronic survey was distributed to pregnant and
   postpartum women (infants 12 months) who were 15 years, English-speaking
   and enrolled in prenatal programs. Data is summarized using central
   tendency, frequencies and nonparametric statistics.
   Results: Of 114 (51 \% response rate) participants, 82.5 \% reported
   negative changes in mental status measures (e.g. stress, anxious
   thoughts, changes in sleep patterns). All reported risk-reduction
   behavior changes (e.g. handwashing/use of sanitizer, social distancing).
   Significant changes were reported in employment and financial status due
   to the pandemic. Increases in alcohol consumption among postpartum women
   were also reported. Few reported changes in prenatal, infant or
   postpartum healthcare access.
   Conclusion: This study provides initial insight into the knowledge,
   attitudes and practices of pregnant and postpartum women during the
   COVID-19 pandemic. This study is limited as participants represent a
   single Midwest community and social desirability response bias may have
   impacted responses. However, results may inform future interventions to
   support pregnant women and mothers of infants during pandemics.
   Practice implications: Providers should consider the impact of such
   events on mental status, access to resources and changes in behaviors.

Abstract = {{We describe the use of Single Photon Emission Computed
   Tomography/Computed Tomography (SPECT/CT) in the investigation and
   diagnosis of Charcot neuroarthropathy (CN) in patients with a hot
   swollen foot but normal radiographs and clinical suspicion of CN,
   usually termed Stage 0. This was a retrospective cohort review of 46
   diabetes patients who underwent 3 phase bone scintigraphy with ``High
   Resolution{''} SPECT/CT. The imaging demonstrated that Stage 0 Charcot
   foot has a distinct bone pathology, which can be classified into three
   groups: (1) fractures on Computed Tomography (CT) with accompanying
   focal uptake of tracer on SPECT, (2) bony abnormalities apart from
   fracture on CT with focal uptake of tracer on SPECT, and (3) normal CT
   but focal bony uptake of tracer on SPECT. The CT component of SPECT/CT
   detected bony fractures in 59\% of patients. Early treatment with below
   knee cast and follow-up for 24 months showed only 4 patients who
   developed Stage 1 Eichenholtz Charcot foot. Our findings support the use
   of 3 phase bone scintigraphy with SPECT/CT in the characterization and
   early diagnosis of CN. Stage 0 Charcot foot has a distinct bone
   pathology which requires urgent treatment to prevent progression to
   Stage 1 Eichenholtz Charcot foot. If SPECT/CT is unavailable, CT alone
   will detect bone fracture in 59\% patients.}},

Title = {{Generalized low-rank approximation of matrices based on multiple
   transformation pairs}},
Journal = {{PATTERN RECOGNITION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{108}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Dimensionality reduction is a critical step in the learning process that
   plays an essential role in various applications. The most popular
   methods for dimensionality reduction, SVD and PCA, for instance, only
   work on one-dimensional data. This means that for higher-order data like
   matrices or more generally tensors, data should be fold to the vector
   format. Thus, this approach ignores the spatial relationships of
   features and increases the probability of overfitting as well. Due to
   the mentioned issues, several methods like Generalized Low-Rank
   Approximation of Matrices (GLRAM) and Multilinear PCA (MPCA) proposed to
   deal with multi-dimensional data in their original format. Consequently,
   the spatial relationships of features preserved and the probability of
   overfitting diminished. Besides, the time and space complexity in such
   methods are less than vector-based ones. However, since the multilinear
   approach needs fewer parameters, its search space is much smaller than
   that of the vector-based one. To solve the previous problems of
   multilinear methods like GLRAM, we proposed a novel extension of GLRAM
   in which instead one transformation pair use multiple left and right
   transformation pairs on the projected data. Consequently, this provides
   the problem with a larger feasible region and smaller reconstruction
   error. This article provides several analytical discussions and
   experimental results that confirm the quality of the proposed method.

Title = {{Traditional practices during pregnancy and birth, and perceptions of
   perinatal losses in women of rural Pakistan}},
Journal = {{MIDWIFERY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{91}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Understanding the sociocultural context and local practices
   during pregnancy and birth is imperative to identify factors related to
   perinatal mortality in countries where its burden is high. This study
   aims to explore the pregnancy and birth related cultural practices and
   the perceptions of women with a recent perinatal death in Sindh
   province, Pakistan.
   Design: This qualitative exploratory study consisted of in-depth
   interviews with women who had experienced a perinatal death in the year
   preceding the study. Women were identified and recruited with the help
   of lady health workers. After consent, women were interviewed in their
   homes and in their own language (Sindhi) by a local female interviewer.
   Setting and Participants: Interviews were conducted with women from
   predominantly rural district of the southern province of Sindh in
   Pakistan between May and August 2018. The data were coded both
   inductively and deductively and then analysed using themes.
   Findings: Twenty-five women were interviewed. Traditional home remedies
   were commonly used to alleviate pregnancy symptoms such as general aches
   and pains. The health providers often delayed the information about the
   perinatal deaths in health facilities, which saddened the women. Most
   women had fatalistic opinions about what caused their losses, and
   explained the cause based on their own interpretation, which were not
   necessarily consistent with known causes of perinatal death. The women
   also desired to use contraception and believed that it would prevent
   future pregnancy loss; however, many women were unable to make that
   decision themselves.
   Conclusions and implications: The high use of traditional home-based
   remedies may be a proxy measure for poor access to formal healthcare
   services. Many women described poor acknowledgement of their grief which
   may be harmful. Women's knowledge about the causes of perinatal
   mortality in general was very low, improving this knowledge may help
   women to seek appropriate healthcare services during pregnancy. (C) 2020

Title = {{Proton Exchange Membrane Hydrogen Fuel Cell as the Grid Connected Power
   Generator}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is
   implemented as a grid-connected electrical generator that uses hydrogen
   gas as fuel and air as an oxidant to produce electricity through
   electrochemical reactions. Analysis demonstrated that the performance of
   the PEMFC greatly depends on the rate of fuel supply and air supply
   pressure. Critical fuel and air supply pressures of the PEMFC are
   analysed to test its feasibility for the grid connection. Air and fuel
   supply pressures are varied to observe the effects on the PEMFC
   characteristics, efficiency, fuel supply, and air consumption over time.
   The PEMFC model is then implemented into an electrical power system with
   the aid of power electronics applications. Detailed mathematical
   modelling of the PEMFC is discussed with justification. The PEMFC
   functions as an electrical generator that is connected to the local grid
   through a power converter and a transformer. Modulation of the converter
   is controlled by means of a proportional-integral controller. The
   two-axis control methodology is applied to the current control of the
   system. The output voltage waveform and control actions of the
   controller on the current and frequency of the proposed system are
   plotted as well. Simulation results show that the PEMFC performs
   efficiently under certain air and fuel pressures, and it can effectively

Title = {{Biochemical and Histopathological Alterations in Different Tissues of
   Rats Due to Repeated Oral Dose Toxicity of Cymoxanil}},
Journal = {{ANIMALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Simple Summary
   Cymoxanil is a broad-spectrum fungicide used to protect many fruits,
   vegetables, and field crops against several fungal diseases.
   Investigating the potential hazards and toxicological effects of this
   fungicide is very important as cymoxanil can be a major human health
   concern. The present study investigated the effect of repeated oral
   doses of cymoxanil on different tissues of treated rats by measuring
   different biochemical parameters and investigating the histopathological
   changes. Interestingly, our study reported a dose-dependent effect of
   cymoxanil that was combined with marked alteration on biochemical
   enzymes. Moreover, the alteration was combined with marked
   histopathological changes in various tissues of treated rats, mainly
   liver, brain, and kidney tissues. Our study collectively reveals that
   cymoxanil can be a source of major concern for human health with respect
   to long-term and low dose exposure.
   Evaluating potential adverse health impacts caused by pesticides is an
   important parameter in human toxicity. This study focuses on the
   importance of subchronic toxicity assessment of cymoxanil fungicide in
   rats with special reference to target biochemical enzymes and
   histopathological changes in different tissues. In this regard, a 21-day
   toxicity study with repeated cymoxanil oral doses was conducted. It has
   been shown that low doses (0.5 mg/kg) were less effective than medium (1
   mg/kg) and high (2 mg/kg) doses. Moreover, high dose dose-treated rats
   showed piecemeal necrosis in the liver, interstitial nephritis and
   tubular degeneration in the kidneys, interstitial pneumonia and type II
   pneumocyte hyperplasia in the lungs, gliosis, spongiosis, and malacia in
   the brain, and testicular edema and degeneration in the testes.
   Cymoxanil significantly increased AST, ALT, and ALP in serum and liver,
   indicating tissue necrosis and possible leakage of these enzymes into
   the bloodstream. Creatinine levels increased, indicating renal damage.
   Similarly, significant inhibition was recorded in brain
   acetylcholinesterase, indicating that both synaptic transmission and
   nerve conduction were affected. Importantly, these histopathological and
   biochemical alterations were dose-dependent. Taken together, our study
   reported interesting biochemical and histopathological alterations in
   different rat tissues following repeated toxicity with oral doses of
   cymoxanil. Our study suggests future studies on different pesticides at
   different concentrations that would help urge governments to create more
   restrictive regulations concerning these compounds' levels.}},

Title = {{Classification of pepper seed quality based on internal structure using
   X-ray CT imaging}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{179}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The internal structure of a seed plays a vital role during germination.
   Hence, before planting the seed internal quality inspection is
   advantageous to produce healthy seedlings. In this study, an X-ray CT
   scanner was used to generate CT images of five-year-old naturally aged
   pepper seeds. Several processing techniques such as reslicing, feature
   extraction, and classification were performed on these images. The
   reslicing process was applied to construct three different planes,
   namely, transaxial, sagittal, and coronal plane images from raw CT
   images. Then, three images were selected from each sample (one from each
   plane) for feature extraction. Using a pattern recognition algorithm,
   the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) was created for each image,
   and twenty-two types of statistical derivations were performed to
   generate GLCM textural features. A supervised data matrix was
   constructed based on the germination results of the seed samples from
   the images, where the seeds were divided into two classes: normal viable
   seeds (class-1) and nonviable \& abnormal viable seeds (class-2).
   Supervised classification methods, such as partial least-squares
   discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), support vector machine (SVM), and
   K-nearest neighbor (KNN) were used to evaluate the best outcome. Among
   the tested classifiers, PLS-DA provided the highest accuracy of 88.7\%
   with five-fold cross validation, where seven important features
   extracted from different angles (theta) were found from the beta
   coefficient to be significant in the classification of the seed. Results
   from this study show that X-ray CT imaging incorporated with a pattern
   recognition system is robust technique to classify seeds based on their
   internal quality attributes.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we study the physical layer security of free-space
   optical (FSO) communications under different eavesdropping scenarios.
   More specifically, the secrecy performance of FSO communication
   employing intensity modulation/direct detection detection is analyzed
   for the well-established Malaga channels. Three different realistic
   scenarios of eavesdropping are considered by assuming different
   placement locations for the eavesdropper in the paper. Novel expressions
   for the average secrecy capacity (ASC) and secrecy outage probability
   (SOP) are derived for the considered scenarios, and useful insights are
   also provided through asymptotic analysis. The results show: (1) When
   the eavesdropper is placed near the transmitter, atmospheric condition
   imposes a less significant impact on secrecy performance; (2) Certain
   level of correlation can potentially enhance the secrecy performance for
   FSO communications; (3) The correlation imposes opposite impacts on the
   ASC and SOP of FSO communications; and the secrecy performance metrics
   exhibit a non-monotonic impact with the increase of correlation; (5)
   When the correlation of the FSO links is too small or too large (i.e.,
   the correlation parameter around 0 or 1), the correlation plays a more
   significant impact on secrecy performance; and (6) The asymptotic slope
   of the SOP is 0.5 for all eavesdropping scenarios under practical FSO
   channels.}},

Abstract = {{Positive body image refers to individuals' ability to conceptualize
   their bodies with love, respect, and appreciation. The study of positive
   body image is relatively new, and instruments used to investigate this
   multi-faceted construct have received limited use in non-English
   speaking countries. Thus, the aim of this investigation is to consider
   four measures that are associated with positive body image across eight
   different countries. Participants (n = 6272) completed the Body
   Appreciation Scale-2, the Body Areas Satisfaction Scale, the Physical
   Appearance Comparison Scale, and the Weight Bias Internalization Scale.
   Multi-group confirmatory factor analyses (MG-CFAs) and item-response
   theory (IRT) models were used to examine the measurement invariance of
   these surveys. Our results generally suggest that positive body image,
   weight bias, and appearance comparison can be assessed using brief
   assessments and that these four instruments can be used in different
   countries, but care should be taken to consider individuals' gender,
   BMI, and socio-economic position. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this research, a new method for spectral-spatial classification of
   hyperspectral images based on hierarchical segmentation algorithm is
   introduced. Among the various spectral-spatial classification
   algorithms, the marker-based hierarchical segmentation algorithm has so
   far achieved the best results in combination with the support vector
   machine (SVM) classification algorithm. In the proposed method adopted
   in this research, the dimensions of the hyperspectral image were reduced
   via the minimum noise fraction (MNF) algorithm. Then, five
   spatial/texture features of wavelet transform, Gabor transform, mean,
   entropy, and contrast were extracted from the obtained bands. Later on,
   the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network and SVM classification
   algorithms were applied to the obtained spectral and texture features,
   and their results were combined. The resulting map was then used to
   select the markers and to combine them with the marker-based
   hierarchical segmentation algorithm using the majority voting rule. The
   proposed method was applied to three hyperspectral images, Pavia,
   Telops, and Washington DC Mall. The results of the experiments
   demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the initial
   marker-based hierarchical algorithm. Quantitatively, it was better by 8,
   12, and 9\% for the Pavia, Telops, and Washington DC Mall datasets
   regarding the Kappa coefficient parameter, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{High corrosion protection performance and eco-friendly properties have
   made the plants' extracts as effective corrosion inhibitors for mild
   steel in chloride-containing media. The presence of nitrogen-based
   functionalities in the Popover somniferum leaves/stem molecules made it
   a high-efficient corrosion inhibitor in simulated seawater. The
   adsorption of graphene-like molecules of Popover sominiferum on the
   substrate was studied theoretically (by molecular dynamic (MD), Monte
   Carlo (MC), and density functional theory (DFT)) and experimentally by
   taking the advantages of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
   (FT-IR), grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD), Raman
   spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) test, atomic force microscope
   (AFM), field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), and contact
   angle (CA) method. Moreover, the corrosion inhibition degrees and
   mechanism of the Popover sominiferum extract (PSE) in different
   concentrations were examined through the potentiodynamic polarization
   spectroscopy (PPS) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). EIS
   outcomes evidenced that by addition of 1600 ppm of PSE to the 35\% wt.
   NaCl media, an inhibition efficiency (IE) of 91\%, was achieved. In
   particular, the Nyquist diagram illustrated that the system resistance
   reached approximately 15 k Omega.cm(2) in the case of the PSE1600
   sample. The FE-SEM images and Raman spectroscopy results affirmed the
   steel surface coverage by an inhibitive graphene-like film. Actually,
   the construction of some complexes such as
   p-tert-Pentyl-N,N-bis(3-phenylpropyl)aniline, and iron cyanide was
   reported by GI-XRD analysis. Additionally, the PSE molecules adsorption
   on the mild steel surface was also proved by the comprehensive
   theoretical studies. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{C-C Chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6), an important protein in inflammatory
   and immunological responses, has been previously reported to be
   associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Therefore, in order to
   replicate these findings, a case-control study was conducted on 500
   subjects (including 250 RA patients and 250 healthy controls) of
   Pakistani origin. The aim of this study was to determine the association
   of CCR6 rs3093024 variant with RA and identify its role in splicing
   events using bioinformatics tools. The clinical and demographic
   characteristics of the patients were collected using a well-designed
   questionnaire. The genotype frequencies of CCR6 rs3093024 variant were
   determined using tetra-primer ARMS-PCR (amplification of refractory
   mutation system-polymerase chain reaction) method. A significant
   difference was found between CCR6 rs3093024 genotype frequencies {[}P =
   0.0016, chi(2) = 12.915]. Similarly, a significant difference in the
   allele frequencies between RA patients and healthy controls was also
   observed {[}P = 0.0003 and OR (95\% CI) = 0.63 (0.49-0.80)]. The
   stratification of patients showed that there was a significant increase
   in AA genotype against AG + GG in patients {[}P = 0.0014, OR (95\% CI) =
   2.0 (1.32-3.02)]. Furthermore, using bioinformatics analysis, it was
   found that CCR6 rs3093024 variant might create a potential splicing
   enhancer motif (SF2/ASF (IgM-BRCA1) with score of 77.92; Threshold
   70.53), which might have important impact on the product of this gene.
   This study suggests that the A variant of CCR6 rs3093024 variant is
   significantly associated with RA-risk and its G variant is protective in
   Pakistani population but a multi-cohort large sized population study is
   needed to elucidate these results. Moreover, functional studies are
   needed to highlight the effects of this polymorphism on the function of
   CCR6 gene. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf

Abstract = {{In many economically developing countries, and especially in the rural
   regions of sub-Saharan African countries, there have been only limited
   investigations into the association between antenatal care (ANC) and
   adverse pregnancy outcomes. We obtained information on ANC and pregnancy
   outcomes between 2011 and 2016 from hospital files of pregnant women (n=
   4,960) served at a rural hospital in Rwanda, and we examined the
   associations between their ANC visits and the adverse pregnancy and
   neonatal outcomes by using univariate and multivariate logistic
   regression models to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence
   intervals (CIs). Most of the pregnant women had >= 4 ANC visits, but
   39\% (n = 1,911) did not have >= 3 visits before delivery. The
   prevalence of low birth weight (LBW) and that of preterm birth (PTB)
   were 12\% and 9.9\%, respectively. Compared to the women who attended
   only one ANC visit, those who attended >= 4 ANC visits had lower risks
   of LBW (OR 0.20; 95\%CI: 0.11-0.36) and PTB (OR 0.28; 95\%CI:
   0.11-0.76). Frequent ANC visits were also associated with better
   postnatal outcomes of the newborns. Encouraging women to attend ANC
   visits before delivery can markedly reduce PTB-related and LBW-related
   complications, especially in resource-limited settings.}},

Abstract = {{Background: We aimed to demonstrate the biochemical characteristics of
   vitamin B6-dependent epi-lepsy, with a particular focus on pyridoxal
   5'-phosphate and pyridoxal in the cerebrospinal fluid.
   Methods: Using our laboratory database, we identified patients with
   vitamin B6-dependent epilepsy and extracted their data on the
   concentrations of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, pyridoxal, pipecolic acid,
   alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde, and monoamine neurotransmitters. We
   compared the biochemical characteristics of these patients with those of
   other epilepsy patients with low pyridoxal 5'-phosphate concentrations.
   Results: We identified seven patients with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy
   caused by an ALDH7A1 gene abnormality, two patients with pyridoxal
   5'-phosphate homeostasis protein deficiency, and 28 patients with other
   epilepsies with low cerebrospinal fluid pyridoxal 5'-phosphate
   concentrations. Cerebrospinal fluid pyridoxal and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate
   concentrations were low in patients with vitamin B6 dependent epilepsy
   but cerebrospinal fluid pyridoxal concentrations were not reduced in
   most patients with other epilepsies with low cerebrospinal fluid
   pyridoxal 5'-phosphate concentrations. Increase in 3-O-methyldopa and
   5-hydroxytryptophan was demonstrated in some patients with vitamin B6-
   dependent epilepsy, suggestive of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate deficiency in
   the brain.
   Conclusions: Low cerebrospinal fluid pyridoxal concentrations may be a
   better indicator of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate deficiency in the brain in
   vitamin B6-dependent epilepsy than low cerebrospinal fluid pyr-idoxal
   5'-phosphate concentrations. This finding is especially helpful in

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate the relationship between aponeurotic expansion
   of supraspinatus tendon and disorders of biceps brachii long head (LHB),
   supraspinatus and subscapularis tendons.
   Methods: Images of 3.0 T shoulder magnetic resonance images (MRI) of a
   total of 154 patients and 157 shoulders (3 cases with bilateral imaging)
   between the ages of 18-45 were retrospectively evaluated for the
   presence of aponeumtic expansion. When identified it was further
   categorized according to its thickness. Tendinopathy and tears of LHB,
   supraspinatus and subscapularis tendons and LHB subluxations were
   evaluated individually. Statistical analyses were performed using
   Chi-square, Fisher's exact, Mann-Whitney U and Kruskall-Wallis tests.
   Odds ratio and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed when
   applicable. p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
   Results: A total of 82 male and 72 female cases with a mean age of 34
   (+/- 8.2) were included. Aponeurotic expansion could be identified in 31
   cases (19.8 \%). MRI findings for LHB disorders in this group was
   significantly higher (p = 0.01). The adjusted odds ratio of having LHB
   tendinopathy in the presence of aponeurotic expansion was 3.25 (\% 95
   CI:1.29-8.19). No significant correlation was found between presence of
   aponeurotic expansion and subscapularis or supraspinatus tendon
   disorders (p = 0.66 and p = 0.792 respectively). Age was a significant
   variable for disorders of all three tendons (p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: On 3.0 T MRI, findings of LHB tendon disorders were
   significantly more common in cases with aponeumtic expansion of
   supraspinatus tendon. This anatomical variation may have an unrecognized
   clinical significance.}},

Title = {{Medicaid member perspectives on innovation in prenatal care delivery: A
   call to action from pregnant people using unscheduled care}},
Journal = {{HEALTHCARE-THE JOURNAL OF DELIVERY SCIENCE AND INNOVATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Low-income women using prenatal care have shared concerns as
   well as unique needs not met by traditional prenatal care. Our objective
   was to explore user ideas on addressing unmet needs driving unscheduled
   care utilization and use findings to inform interventions to improve
   perinatal outcomes.
   Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of qualitative interviews
   among purposively sampled, Medicaid-insured pregnant women with varied
   degrees of unscheduled care utilization. Interviews explored barriers
   and facilitators of health and ideas for improvement in care delivery,
   with a focus on the potential role of community health workers and
   social support. We extracted material on participants' perceived gaps
   and ideas, used modified grounded theory to develop general and subset
   themes by study group, and then mapped themes to potential intervention
   features.
   Results: We identified intervention targets in three thematic domains:
   social support, care delivery, and access, noting sub-group differences.
   Participants with four or more unscheduled visits during pregnancy
   ({''}Group 1{''}) wanted individualized help navigating resources,
   coaching, and peer support, while participants with a first unscheduled
   care visit after 36 weeks of pregnancy ({''}Group 2) wanted these
   services to be optional. Group 1 participants wanted flexible
   appointments, less wait time, discharge education and improved
   communication with providers, while Group 2 participants sought stable
   insurance coverage.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest acceptable approaches to improve social
   support, care delivery, and access via stratified, targeted
   interventions.}},

Abstract = {{This case is of a 76-year-old man with a known history of hypertension,
   type 2 diabetes mellitus, and ischemic heart disease, who presented to
   our department with chest pain and palpitations. His electrocardiogram
   showed a ventricular tachycardia (VT), but fortunately our patient was
   hemodynamically stable. A trial of adenosine was given to convert the
   patient's heart back to sinus rhythm, but was unsuccessful and the
   rhythm remained as VT. Soon after, the patient suddenly became
   hemodynamically unstable as his blood pressure acutely declined; thus,
   the decision to perform a direct current cardioversion was taken.
   Bearing in mind that the patient was still awake, he was given 10 mg of
   intravenous etomidate as a pre-procedural sedative. During the time it
   took to prepare for the procedure, the patient's rhythm reverted from VT
   to a regular sinus rhythm, raising his blood pressure back to normal and
   achieving hemodynamic stablility, negating the need of any electrical or
   chemical cardioversion. Our patient was then handed over to the
   cardiology team for an emergency percutaneous coronary intervention
   procedure and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator procedure, both
   of which were successful. Etomidate was used in this case for the
   purpose of sedation, and as luck would have it, it seems that it had
   also incidentally reverted the arrhythmia back to normal.}},

Title = {{THE OMANI ABALONE HALIOTIS MARIAE (WOOD, 1828) FISHERY: CHALLENGES OVER
   THREE DECADES}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{The Omani abalone Haliotis mariae (Wood. 1828) supports one of the most
   valuable fisheries in Oman. It is specific to defined areas along the
   northern region of Dhofar in Oman. This study reviews the management of
   the Omani abalone fishery during the last 31 y, identifies the
   challenges encountered, and suggests solutions to overcome these
   difficulties. During the period 1988-2018. annual abalone landings
   ranged from 29 tonnes (mt) in 1999 to 149 mt in 2011, with an average of
   53 mt. In 2019, landings 24 t (53 t whole weight) were reported to be
   the lowest in the last three decades and landed within 10 days of
   opening. The fishery generated 1.3 million Omani rials (3.38 million
   US\$) (OR, where 1 OR = 2.6 USD) in 1993 and 8.2 million OR in 2011.
   with an average of 2.5 million OR (6.5 million IJSS). By contrast, the
   average annual price per kg was 50 OR (130 US\$). The fishery was mainly
   managed in accordance with seasonal closures, which ranged from 6 mo to
   less than 1 mo; in one case, there was a complete suspension of fishing
   for 3 y. The number of fishers engaged in this fishery was not stable,
   and fluctuated between 1,450 in 1993 and 8,539 in 2014. The seasonal
   closures between 1988 and 2003 resulted in a gradual decrease in average
   landings, reaching 2\%-45\% at the end of the season, with an average of
   27\%. The percentage of divers who participated at the end of the season
   ranged from 9\% to 90\%, with an average of 47\%. It is suggested that
   the government should conduct comprehensive research to assess the Omani
   abalone stock, population dynamics, and habitat, as well as the behavior
   of the fishermen. Furthermore, better data collection and monitoring
   systems should be established. It is strongly recommended that a ``pulse
   fishing{''} or spatial-based or temporary marine-protected area fishing
   (zonation) approach that serves the objectives of stock and habitat
   preservation be implemented. Thus, the restoration of the Omani abalone
   fishery is achievable but will require long-term research efforts.}},

Title = {{Performance analysis of Power-Domain NOMA and NOMA-2000 on AWGN and
   Rayleigh fading channels}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL COMMUNICATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{43}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) has been a hot research topic over
   the past years, because it is widely viewed as a promising technology
   for 5G cellular networks and beyond. The NOMA literature today is
   heavily based on the so-called Power-Domain NOMA (PD-NOMA), which
   consists of superposing user signals with different powers. Also, the
   focus in the literature has been on the derivation of achievable rates
   and other information theoretic measures. In contrast, the performance
   degradation that is caused by multi-user interference at practical bit
   error rate (BER) values has not attracted much attention thus far.
   Taking a major deviation from the current trend, some of the present
   authors recently revived an early NOMA concept, which had been rather
   overlooked in the literature. This concept, which we refer to as
   NOMA-2000 due to its year of introduction, consists of superposing the
   signals of two user groups instead of superposing the signals of two
   single users. In subsequent papers, performance of NOMA-2000 has been
   investigated in different scenarios, but no comparisons with PD-NOMA
   have been provided. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap and
   compare the BER performances of the two schemes using different channel
   models, channel overload factors, and power imbalance levels between
   users. For the Rayleigh fading channel, we consider both static user
   grouping and dynamic user grouping. Our results give a clear insight
   into the practical performance limitations of PD-NOMA and the
   improvements that can be achieved with NOMA-2000 in most cases. (c) 2020

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new definition of graph domination called ``Captive
   Domination{''} is introduced. The proper subset of the vertices of a
   graph G is a captive dominating set if it is a total dominating set and
   each vertex in this set dominates at least one vertex which doesn't
   belong to the dominating set. The inverse captive domination is also
   introduced. The lower and upper bounds for the number of edges of the
   graph are presented by using the captive domination number. Moreover,
   the lower and upper bounds for the captive domination number are found
   by using the number of vertices. The condition when the total domination
   and captive domination number are equal to two is discussed and obtained
   results. The captive domination in complement graphs is discussed.
   Finally, the captive dominating set of paths and cycles are determined.}},

Title = {{Discovery of novel indolyl-1,2,4-triazole hybrids as potent vascular

   anti-renal cancer activity}},
Journal = {{BIOORGANIC CHEMISTRY}},

Abstract = {{Targeting VEGFR-2 signaling pathway is well-established as an important
   approach for the treatment of solid tumors, particularly renal cancer.
   Herein, novel indolyl-1,2,4-triazole hybrids were designed and
   synthesized as VEGFR-2 kinase inhibitors with potential anti-renal
   cancer activity. The structures of the newly synthesized compounds were
   confirmed based on their spectral and elemental analyses. The results of
   in vitro kinase assay indicated that all target compounds revealed
   submicromolar inhibition of VEGFR-2 kinase enzyme. Analogs 5c, 5d and 9b
   emerged as the most active compounds (IC50 = 0.034-0.064 mu M), showing
   VEGFR-2 inhibitory activity much superior to that of sunitinib reference
   drug (IC50 = 0.075 mu M). Moreover, compounds 5a, 8c, 9d, 12c were
   equipotent to sunitinib against VEGFR-2 kinase. Additionally, the most
   potent compounds were further examined for their anticancer activity
   against two human renal cancer cell lines. All screened compounds
   effectively inhibited the growth of the two tested cell lines with IC50
   values spanning from sub-micromolar to low micromolar levels. Compounds
   5b, 5d, 11c and 12c were three to five-fold more potent than sunitinib
   against CAKI-1 cell line. Analogue 8c was superior/comparable to
   sunitinib against CAKI-1/A498 cell lines. Moreover, compound 9d showed
   double potency of sunitinib against A498 cell line. Besides, compounds
   8c and 12c demonstrated a safety profile much better than that of
   sunitinib against non-cancer human renal cells. As well, the docked
   models of title compounds revealed strong interactions with key residues
   within the active site of VEGFR-2 kinase.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The objectives of the study is to examine the prevalence and
   burden of major structures injury (pharynx, esophagus, trachea, larynx,
   lymphatic, vessels \& nerves) in patients who underwent thyroid,
   parathyroid, and neck dissection surgeries in the United States.
   Methods: The study is a retrospective cross-sectional analysis utilizing
   the Nationwide Readmissions Database, 2010-2015. The study population
   included adults (18 years) patients who underwent thyroid, parathyroid,
   and neck dissection surgeries.
   Results: A total of 54,443 patients were included. Major structures
   injury was reported in 221 (0.48\%) patients. The injured structures
   were vascular (0.22\%), lymphatic (0.18\%), pharynx/esophagus (0.06\%),
   neural (0.03\%), and trachea/larynx (0.002\%). The risk of injury
   increased annually during the study period (OR: 1.29, 95\% CI: 1.16,
   1.44, P<0.001). The risk of injury was highest in patients who underwent
   thyroidectomy with neck dissection (1.01\%) or neck dissection alone
   (1.81\%) (P<0.001 each). The risk was also highest for patients with a
   head and neck cancer diagnosis (OR: 1.80, 95\% CI: 1.24, 2.61, P=0.002).
   Patients with those injuries had a higher prevalence of blood
   transfusion (2.82\% vs. 0.17\%), postoperative fistula (3.10\% vs.
   0.03\%), readmission (28.90\% vs. 3.59\%), and postoperative mortality
   (0.87\% vs. 0.06\%) (P<0.05 each). Management of patients with those
   injuries was associated with a longer hospital stay by 4.86 +/- 0.48
   days (P<0.001), and a higher cost by \$16,151.00 +/- 173.36 (P<0.001).
   Conclusions: Injuries of major structures in thyroid and neck surgeries
   are more prevalent in cancer patients. There has been a recent increase
   in the risk of such injuries in the United States. Those injuries are
   associated with significant clinical and economic burden.}},

Abstract = {{The oil industry is an important source of economic growth in Iraq, as
   it is the largest financier of the state budget. It also differs from
   other industries. At present, there is no accounting base in Iraq
   specifically addressing the accounting practices related to the
   extractive oil industry. The industry relies on the unified accounting
   system, which applies in all sectors and is not tailored to the oil
   industry. Therefore, this research aims to develop the accounting
   practices in the oil industry in accordance with IFRS6 to enhance the
   transparency and quality of the financial reporting of the Iraqi oil
   companies.
   This paper focuses on the following goals:
   - identify the main features of oil companies in general and of Iraqi
   companies in particular
   - present and define the concept of transparency of accounting
   information in the oil industry
   - present and analyze the international financial reporting standard
   (IFRS 6) ``exploration and evaluation of mineral resources{''}
   - compare the current accounting applications in the Iraqi oil industry
   with the requirements of the International Financial Reporting Standard
   (IFRS 6)
   - Present the adaptation proposal to the international reporting
   financial standard (IFRS6) in achieving transparency of the Iraqi oil
   industry.
   The oil exploration company was selected as a sample for the analysis.
   The research reached a number of conclusions, as well as several
   recommendations based on those conclusions.}},

Journal = {{STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, significant attention has been given in previous
   studies to improve the performance of structural members. It would be
   useful to further improve in this approach. This study was undertaken in
   order to investigate the structural behaviour of newly developed
   Engineering Cementitious Composites (ECC) columns subjected to
   concentric and eccentric loading. These columns were experimentally
   formulated using a hybridization of steel and polypropylene fibers. Two
   ratios were adopted for the steel fibres 0.5\% and 1\%, whilst the
   polypropylene fibre was kept constant at a ratio of 0.5\% for all of the
   ECC columns. The eccentric loads were applied at two eccentricities:
   small (h/6) and large (5 h/12). The effect of slenderness ratio was
   taken into consideration at two values; 6 and 8. A comparison was also
   made with the behaviour of self-compacted concrete and traditional ECC
   columns containing either steel or polypropylene fibres. The vertical
   and lateral deformations as well as the maximum load at failure were
   noted. Amendments were performed on some of the related formulas
   suggested by the code of practice.
   The results obtained showed that the hybrid ECC columns exhibited higher
   load carrying capacities when compared with those of both self-compacted
   concrete and traditional ECC columns. The percentage increase reached
   30\%. The hybrid ECC column samples containing 1\% steel fibre did not
   show a signification difference in the load-deformation behaviour when
   it compared with that containing 0.5\% steel fibre. The values of
   eccentricity and slenderness ratio governed the global behaviour of the
   tested columns. The predicted load carrying capacities of the ECC
   columns using the existing code formulas need a magnification factor in
   case of concentric test, and to take into account the fibres ratio when
   calculating the area of steel reinforcement for eccentric loading.}},

Abstract = {{The chloroform (TNC), ethyl acetate (TNE) and n-butanol (TNB) fractions
   of Tephrosia nubica Bioss. growing in Saudi Arabia were investigated for
   the first time using UPLC-ESI-MS/MS in two ionization modes. The
   analysis revealed the tentative identification of 107 compounds.
   Moreover, the therapeutic potential of T. nubica fractions was
   determined by in vitro evaluation of their cytotoxic, antioxidant, and
   anti-obesity activities using MTT assay, DPPH radical scavenging
   activity and pancreatic lipase inhibitory assay, respectively. The
   results showed that TNE, TNB, TNC fractions revealed weak antioxidant
   activity with SC50 139.9 +/- 0.8, 144.9 +/- 1.5, 148.9 +/- 1.3 mu g/mL,
   respectively compared to ascorbic acid 14.2 +/- 0.5 mu g/ml. Moreover
   TNE, TNC fractions showed more significant cytotoxic activity against
   HepG-2 with IC50 82.1 +/- 3.1, 101 +/- 2.8 mu g/mL and MCF-7 with IC50
   114 +/- 3.2, 124 +/- 3.9 mu g/mL respectively. The TNB fraction showed
   weak cytotoxic activity against both cell lines compared to the other
   fractions. Ultimately, TNE fraction showed a remarkable anti-obesity
   activity with IC50 62.4 +/- 1.5 mu g/mL compared to chloroform fraction
   with IC50 535.6 +/- 2.1 mu g/mL and n-butanol fraction which did not
   show any activity. In conclusion, these findings represent the first
   insights into the phytochemical constituents and pharmacological
   properties of T. nubica. The ethyl acetate fraction of T. nubica might
   be a promising source of functional constituents with antioxidant,
   cytotoxic and anti-obesity potentials. It might be a natural alternative
   therapy and nutritional strategy, for obesity treatment without
   dangerous side effects. Isolation of the bioactive compounds from the
   ethyl acetate fraction of T. nubica and evaluating their biological
   activities are recommended. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The papain-like protease (PLPro) is vital for the replication of
   coronaviruses (CoVs), as well as for escaping innate-immune responses of
   the host. Hence, it has emerged as an attractive antiviral drug-target.
   In this study, computational approaches were employed, mainly the
   structure-based virtual screening coupled with all-atom molecular
   dynamics (MD) simulations to computationally identify specific
   inhibitors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
   (SARS-CoV-2) PLPro, which can be further developed as potential
   pan-PLPro based broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. The sequence, structure,
   and functional conserveness of most deadly human CoVs PLPro were
   explored, and it was revealed that functionally important catalytic
   triad residues are well conserved among SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and middle
   east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The subsequent
   screening of a focused protease inhibitors database composed of similar
   to 7,000 compounds resulted in the identification of three candidate
   compounds, ADM\_13083841, LMG\_15521745, and SYN\_15517940. These three
   compounds established conserved interactions which were further explored
   through MD simulations, free energy calculations, and residual energy
   contribution estimated by MM-PB(GB)SA method. All these compounds showed
   stable conformation and interacted well with the active residues of
   SARS-CoV-2 PLPro, and showed consistent interaction profile with
   SARS-CoV PLPro and MERS-CoV PLPro as well. Conclusively, the reported
   SARS-CoV-2 PLPro specific compounds could serve as seeds for developing
   potent pan-PLPro based broad-spectrum antiviral drugs against deadly
   human coronaviruses. Moreover, the presented information related to
   binding site residual energy contribution could lead to further
   optimization of these compounds. (C) 2020 Xi'an Jiaotong University.

Abstract = {{In wireless heterogeneous networks (HetNets), the spatial densification
   through small cells and the application of massive MIMO antenna arrays
   are key enablers for high data throughput, wider coverage, and improved
   energy efficiency (EE). However, ultra-dense deployment of small cells
   is envisioned to exacerbate network management and increase energy
   consumption in HetNets. To this end, this paper first identifies the
   peculiarities that make energy consumption one of the challenging
   problems in wireless communication networks. Further to this, we
   categorize the EE techniques used in wireless HetNets and discuss
   various enabling strategies under each technique. Based on these
   categories, an overview of past works carried out on EE techniques in
   HetNets is provided with reference to their major contributions and key
   findings. This work also presents EE metrics used to gauge energy
   consumption rate and performance trade-off. Finally, the paper concludes
   by discussing promising future research directions in the area of EE in
   Ultra-dense HetNets. (C) 2020 Karabuk University. Publishing services by

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Background: Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ), Quebec Back
   Pain Disability Scale (QDS), and RolandMorris Disability Questionnaire
   (RMDQ) is widely used in patients with low back pain (LBP) to assess the
   level of disability. Nonetheless, there are limited data about the
   responsiveness properties of the Arabic versions of these scales. this
   study was conducted to assess the responsiveness of the Arabic versions
   of the FABQ, QDS, and RMDQ compared to that of the Visual Analog Scale
   (VAS).
   Methods: A sample of 68 patients with LBP completed FABQ, QDS, RMDQ, and
   VAS at baseline and after 14 days. Responsiveness was evaluated by
   calculating the standard error of measurement (SEM), the minimal
   detectable difference at 95\% confidence level (MDD95\%), standardized
   response mean (SRM), Cohen's effect size (ES), Guyatt's responsiveness
   index (GRI), area under the curve (AUC), and minimal clinically
   significant difference (MCID).
   Results: The SEM, MDD95\%, SRM, ES, GRI, AUC, and MCID for FABQ, QDS,
   RMDQ, and VAS were 2.54, 2.83, 0.77, and 0.82; 7.05, 7.85, 2.14, and
   2.28; 0.67, 0.96, 0.74, and 1.04; 0.39, 0.39, 0.36, and 0.79; 0.76,

   1.5; respectively.
   Conclusion: Although the responsiveness of the Arabic versions of FABQ,
   QDS, and RMDQ was below the recommended standards and less than the
   responsiveness calculated for the VAS, it was comparable with previously
   published versions in other languages. Additional studies are necessary
   to examine the three scales' responsiveness with a more extended
   follow-up period.}},

Abstract = {{Over the years, security against adaptively chosen-ciphertext attacks
   (CCA2) is considered as the strongest security definition for public-key
   encryption schemes. With the uprise of side-channel attacks, new
   security definitions are proposed, addressing leakage of secret keys
   together with the standard CCA2 definition. Among the new security
   definitions, security against continuous and after-the-fact
   leakage-resilient CCA2 can be considered as the strongest security
   definition, which is called as security against (continuous) adaptively
   chosen-ciphertext leakage attacks (continuous CCLA2). In this paper, we
   present a construction of a public-key encryption scheme, namely LR-PKE,
   which satisfies the aforementioned security definition. The security of
   our public-key encryption scheme is proven in the standard model, under
   decision BDH assumption. Thus, we emphasize that our public-key
   encryption scheme LR-PKE is (continuous) CCLA2-secure in the standard
   model. For our construction of LR-PKE, we have used a strong one-time
   signature scheme and a leakage-resilient refreshing protocol as
   underlying building blocks. The leakage bound is 0.15n log p - 1 bits
   per leakage query, for a security parameter k and a statistical security
   parameter n, such that log p >= k and n is a function of k. It is
   possible to see that LR-PKE is efficient enough to be used for
   real-world usage.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Women with symptoms or signs of myocardial ischemia but no
   obstructive coronary artery disease (INOCA) often have coronary vascular
   dysfunction and elevated risk for adverse cardiovascular events. We
   hypothesized that u-hscTnI (ultra-high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I),
   a sensitive indicator of ischemic cardiomyocyte injury, is associated
   with coronary vascular dysfunction in women with INOCA.
   Approach and Results: Women (N=263) with INOCA enrolled in the WISE-CVD
   study (Women's Ischemic Syndrome Evaluation-Coronary Vascular
   Dysfunction) underwent invasive coronary vascular function testing and
   u-hscTnI measurements (Simoa HD-1 Analyzer; Quanterix Corporation,
   Lexington, MA). Logistic regression models, adjusted for traditional
   cardiovascular risk factors were used to evaluate associations between
   u-hscTnI and coronary vascular function. Women with coronary vascular
   dysfunction (microvascular constriction and limited coronary epicardial
   dilation) had higher plasma u-hscTnI levels (both P=0.001). u-hscTnI
   levels were associated with microvascular constriction (odds ratio, 1.38
   per doubling of u-hscTnI {[}95\% CI, 1.03-1.84]; P=0.033) and limited
   coronary epicardial dilation (odds ratio, 1.37 per doubling of u-hscTnI
   {[}95\% CI, 1.04-1.81]; P=0.026). u-hscTnI levels were not associated
   with microvascular dilation or coronary epicardial constriction.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that higher u-hscTnI is associated
   with coronary vascular dysfunction in women with INOCA. This suggests
   that ischemic cardiomyocyte injury in the setting of coronary vascular
   dysfunction has the potential to contribute to adverse cardiovascular
   outcomes observed in these women. Additional studies are needed to
   confirm and investigate mechanisms underlying these findings in INOCA.

Title = {{A two-scale maintenance policy for protection systems subject to shocks
   when meeting demands}},
Journal = {{RELIABILITY ENGINEERING \& SYSTEM SAFETY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{204}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We propose a model for a two-scale hybrid inspection and preventive
   replacement policy for protection systems subject to shocks due to
   meeting demands. The policy guides periodic inspections and also
   considers both the age of the system and the number of demands met as
   parameters for decision-making on preventive replacement. We considered
   a non-repairable single-component protection system that is subject to
   demands that arrive according to a Homogeneous Poisson Process. The
   activation of the system on demand acts as a shock that increases the
   failure rate of the system with a given probability. We also considered
   that inspections are imperfect: they may result in false positives and
   false negatives. We evaluated the performance of the policy in terms of
   the cost-rate and rate of unmet demands. Our numerical analysis shows
   the strategic role of inspections and demonstrates the following: 1. The
   greater the effect of shocks the more beneficial is the two-scale policy
   relative to a one-scale policy; 2. The proposed policy performs well
   when the rate of demands varies over time. These findings are important
   to practice because they show that maintenance policies for protection
   systems should be less time based and more use based.}},

Title = {{Multiscale measures of phase-space trajectories}},
Journal = {{CHAOS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Characterizing the multiscale nature of fluctuations from nonlinear and
   nonstationary time series is one of the most intensively studied
   contemporary problems in nonlinear sciences. In this work, we address
   this problem by combining two established concepts-empirical mode
   decomposition (EMD) and generalized fractal dimensions-into a unified
   analysis framework. Specifically, we demonstrate that the intrinsic mode
   functions derived by EMD can be used as a source of local (in terms of
   scales) information about the properties of the phase-space trajectory
   of the system under study, allowing us to derive multiscale measures
   when looking at the behavior of the generalized fractal dimensions at
   different scales. This formalism is applied to three well-known
   low-dimensional deterministic dynamical systems (the Henon map, the
   Lorenz `63 system, and the standard map), three realizations of
   fractional Brownian motion with different Hurst exponents, and two
   somewhat higher-dimensional deterministic dynamical systems (the Lorenz
   `96 model and the on-off intermittency model). These examples allow us
   to assess the performance of our formalism with respect to practically
   relevant aspects like additive noise, different initial conditions, the
   length of the time series under study, low- vs high-dimensional
   dynamics, and bursting effects. Finally, by taking advantage of two
   real-world systems whose multiscale features have been widely
   investigated (a marine stack record providing a proxy of the global ice
   volume variability of the past
   5 x
   10 6 years and the SYM-H geomagnetic index), we also illustrate the
   applicability of this formalism to real-world time series.}},

Journal = {{RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY}},

Abstract = {{By applying the standard technique of co-precipitation of ferric- and
   ferrous salts with ammonium hydroxide in an inert atmosphere, the
   magnetite nano-crystallites have been prepared labelled with Auger- and
   internal conversion electrons, beta- and alpha-emitters (Co-57, Co-60
   and Am-241 radionuclides).
   It has been confirmed by the methods of both X-ray phase analysis and
   Absorption Mossbauer Spectroscopy that for both cases (the ``pure{''}
   crystallite and the ones doped with radionuclides), it is nanoparticles
   of a spherical shape that were synthesized with a magnetite structure
   and crystallites with a diameter of 12-18 nm; there were no admixtures
   of other iron compounds detected.
   It has been shown that the governing stabilization factor for the
   daughter iron atoms that were produced in 57Co(II) as a result of
   electron capture (EC) is the size of the atom whose position is

   A comparative analysis has been conducted of radiation-induced damage
   patterns in nano-crystallites in the dependence of nuclear- and physical
   characteristics of the radioactive tracer and total fluence. It has been
   established that under irradiation there is a comminution of
   crystallites taking place, the effective magnetic fields on the iron
   atoms in the labelled nano-crystallites remaining unchanged irrespective
   of the ``dose load{''}.
   Resulting from the decay of Am-241, the daughter nucleus receives the
   energy of 92.3 keV, the range of Np-237 nuclei (while the account is
   taken of the entire cascade of possible collisions) amounting to almost
   40 nm, which is twice the size of ``nano-containers{''} (the escape of
   Np-237 from the volume of crystallites is experimentally confirmed by
   the method of 2 pi alpha-counting).}},

Title = {{Wide-area oscillation damping in low-inertia grids under time-varying

Journal = {{ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{189}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Wide-Area Control (WAC) can be efficiently used for oscillation damping
   in power systems. However, to plement a WAC, a communication network is
   required to transmit signals between the generation units and control
   center. In turn, this makes WAC vulnerable to time-varying communication
   delays that, if not appropriately considered in the control design, can
   destabilize the system. Moreover, with the increasing integration
   renewable energy resources into the grid, usually interfaced via power
   electronics, power system dynamics becoming drastically faster and
   making WAC more vulnerable to communication delays. In this paper,
   propose a design procedure for a delay-robust wide-area oscillation
   damping controller for low-inertia systems. Its performance is
   illustrated on the well-known Kundur two-area system. The results
   indicate that the obtained WAC successfully improves the oscillation
   damping while ensuring robustness against time-varying communication

Title = {{A Medium-Voltage DC-Collection Grid for Large-Scale PV Power Plants With

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing interest in deploying mediumvoltage dc-collection
   grid technologies in renewable energy applications to improve energy
   efficiency. Existing dc-collection grids incorporate medium-voltage
   dc/dc converters that suffer from bulky passive components such as a
   step-up transformer along with additional conversion stage to
   incorporate MPPT function. In response to these concerns, this article
   proposes a new medium-voltage dc-collection grid method for large-scale
   PV plants with an interleaved modular multilevel (IMMC) dc-dc boost
   converter. The proposed IMMC converter is synthesized with lower voltage
   half-bridge SiC inverter blocks connected in series to support
   medium-voltage dc-dc conversion. The half-bridge blocks of the IMMC
   employ SiC switches, along with high-frequency PWMoperation enable
   compact size/weight along with high-efficiency conversion. Simulation
   results are shown for 1500-V (dc) to 16-kV (dc) conversion with four
   series-connected IMMC inverter blocks powered from two PV plants. A
   powersharing stage is an integral part of the proposed converter. This
   enables two series-connected PV plants to supply unequal power under
   partial shading conditions. Control of the power-sharing stage for
   varying insolation from PV (1000-500 W/m2) due to the shading effect is
   shown. A design example for 1-MW PV power plant block based on the
   specifications derived from Kuwait Shagaya 60-MW solar power plant is
   discussed. Experimental results on a scaled- down laboratory prototype
   are included in this article.}},

Title = {{Transverse energy-energy correlations of jets in the electron-proton
   deep inelastic scattering at HERA}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{80}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We study the event shape variables, transverse energy-energy correlation
   TEEC (cos phi) and its asymmetry ATEEC (cos phi) in deep inelastic
   scattering (DIS) at the electron-proton collider HERA, where phi is the
   angle between two jets defined using a transverse-momentum (kT) jet
   algorithm. At HERA, jets are defined in the Breit frame, and the leading
   nontrivial transverse energy-energy correlations arise from the 3-jet
   configurations. With the help of the NLOJET++, these functions are
   calculated in the leading order (LO) and the next-to-leading order (NLO)
   approximations in QCD at the electron-proton center-of-mass energy
   <mml:msqrt>s</mml:msqrt>=314 GeV. We restrict the angular region to -0.8
   <= cos phi <= 0.8, as the forward- and backward-angular regions require
   resummed logarithmic corrections, which we have neglected in this work.
   Following experimental jet-analysis at HERA, we restrict the
   DIS-variables x, y=Q2/(xs), where Q2=-q2 is the negative of the momentum
   transfer squared q2, to 0 <= x <= 1, 0.2 <= y <= 0.6, and the
   pseudo-rapidity variable in the laboratory frame (eta lab) to the range
   -1 <= eta lab <= 2.5. The TEEC and ATEEC functions are worked out for
   two ranges in Q2, defined by 5.5<mml:mspace
   width={''}0.166667em{''}></mml:mspace>GeV2 <= Q2 <= 80<mml:mspace
   width={''}0.166667em{''}></mml:mspace>GeV2, called the low-Q2-range, and
   150<mml:mspace width={''}0.166667em{''}></mml:mspace>GeV2 <= Q2 <=
   1000<mml:mspace width={''}0.166667em{''}></mml:mspace>GeV2, called the
   high-Q2-range. We show the sensitivity of these functions on the parton
   distribution functions (PDFs), the factorization (mu F) and
   renormalization (mu R) scales, and on alpha s(MZ2</mml:msubsup>). Of
   these the correlations are stable against varying the scale mu F and the
   PDFs, but they do depend on mu R. For the choice of the scale mu
   R=<mml:msqrt>ET2+Q2</mml:msqrt>, advocated in earlier jet analysis at
   HERA, the shape variables TEEC and ATEEC are found perturbatively
   robust. These studies are useful in the analysis of the HERA data,
   including the determination of <mml:msub>alpha s(MZ2) from the shape
   variables.}},

Abstract = {{The present study aims to investigate the structural, mechanical,
   thermal, dynamic and optical properties of a new type and recently
   synthesized 212 MAX phase Ti2InB2 in comparison with other 211 MAX
   phases (Ti2InC, Ti2SnC and Ti2AlC). Our calculated lattice parameters
   show excellent agreement with the available data. The obtained elastic
   constants and phonon dispersion spectra confirm the mechanical and
   dynamical stability of the new compound. The studied MAX phases are
   found to be brittle in nature. In Ti2InB2, the B-B bonds exist with the
   larger bond population, indicating its high covalent nature, makes it
   stiffer than the typical 211 MAX phases, particularly, Ti2InC.
   Consequently, Ti2InB2 possesses high C11, C33, B, G and Y compared with
   Ti2InB2. The calculated hardness of the newly synthesized Ti2InB2 is the
   highest among all the MAX phases under consideration. Temperature and
   pressure dependent thermal properties are investigated through
   quasi-harmonic Debye model for the first time. The heat capacity of
   Ti2InB2 at room temperature with the inclusion of lattice and electronic
   contribution is higher than those of other studied 211 MAX phases. The
   optical reflectivity suggests that the studied MAX compounds can be
   promising candidates as protective coating of other materials against
   solar heating.}},

Abstract = {{The global economy is rising continuously, with a 3-4\% aggregate annual
   growth in output, which poses a severe threat to the environment due to
   a consistent rise in the use of fossil fuel. Given the disastrous
   climate change due to the industrialization and increasingly growing
   demands for energy, countries around the globe are devising strategies
   to curb the release of greenhouse gases. This study examines the role of
   environmental innovation, trade, and renewable energy consumption in the
   nexus between trade and CO2 emissions for top 10 carbon emitter
   countries. The results suggest that there is evidence of cross-sectional
   dependency, and models are suffered from slope heterogeneity problem
   test popularized by Pesaran and Yamagata. The results of Westerlund
   cointegration method suggest that in there is long equilibrium
   relationship among CO2 emissions and other variables such as
   environmental innovation, trade, and renewable energy consumption and
   income. The results of cross-sectionally augment autoregressive

   environment during mandatory and discretionary lane-changing manoeuvres}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{121}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Lane-changing manoeuvre is one of the risky manoeuvres performed by
   drivers either to reach the planned destination (i.e., mandatory
   lane-changing; MLC) or to achieve better driving conditions (i.e.,
   discretionary lane-changing; DLC). Essentially both lane-changing types
   require the driver to acquire surrounding traffic information for
   efficient and safe lane-changing decisions. However, this does not
   discount the fact that both these lane-changings are fundamentally
   different from each other as the urgency of lane-changing is much higher
   during MLC compared to DLC. Real-time driving aids in a connected
   environment promise to assist during the lane-changing decision-making
   process, but the differential effectiveness (or usefulness) of real-time
   driving aids in a connected environment for these two lane-changing
   types remains unexplored due to the novelty of a connected environment
   and the consequent scarcity of data. To fill this research gap, this
   study collected lane-changing data from 78 participants who performed
   MLC and DLC in the CARRS-Q Advanced Driving Simulator. Participants were
   asked to drive in three randomised driving conditions: baseline
   condition (without driving aids), real-time driving aids in a connected
   environment with perfect communication, and delayed driving aids in a
   connected environment. While surrogate measures of safety are analysed
   and compared using descriptive statistics, a hybrid framework of data
   mining and classical statistical modelling is employed to examine the
   usefulness of the real-time driving aids in a connected environment for
   two lane-changing types. We find that the crash risk associated with MLC
   is significantly reduced in the driving conditions providing driving
   aids compared to that of DLC. Results also reveal that the probability
   of engaging in a hard-braking event decreases for both the lane-changing
   types in the presence of real-time driving aids in the connected
   environment driving conditions, but a higher decrease in magnitude is
   found for MLC. Age and gender-related differential impact have been
   observed where young and male drivers have a higher possibility of
   engaging in a hard-braking event when driving without driving aids, but
   the presence of real-time driving aids reduces such risk. This study
   concludes that the usefulness (or effectiveness) of the real-time
   driving aids in a connected environment is a function of the urgency of
   a task, which is evidently higher during MLC, thus providing the maximum
   advantage during MLC.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Burn-specific pain anxiety and sleep disorders are common
   factors in burned patients that affect wound healing process, as well as
   the severity of burn pain. This study aimed to investigate the effect of
   foot reflexology massage on burn-specific pain anxiety and sleep
   condition of patients hospitalized in the burn ICU. Method: In this
   randomized controlled clinical trial, 52 patients were assigned by
   permuted block randomization 1:1 to the intervention (n= 26) and control
   (n= 26) groups. The intervention group received 20min of foot
   reflexology massage during 3 days on their third, fourth and fifth days
   of hospitalization and 15min before changing wound dressings. Patients
   in the control group merely received routine care. The Burn-Specific
   Pain Anxiety Scale (BSPAS) was completed for three consecutive days
   before and after changing wound dressings, and St. Mary's Hospital Sleep
   Questionnaire (SMHSQ) was filled out for four consecutive days before
   changing wound dressings for patients in both groups. The data were
   analyzed by IBM SPSS 16 software, Chicago, independent t, Chi-square,
   Friedman, Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests. Findings: We found no
   significant difference between pain-anxiety in the two groups before the
   intervention. The trend of different days in each groups were compared
   with Friedman test and showed that pain anxiety (p< 0.001), sleep
   latency (p< 0.001), duration of the last day's sleep (p< 0.001) and
   satisfaction of the last night sleep (p< 0.001) had a significant
   difference. In addition, Mann-Whitney test results showed that there
   were significant differences between the two groups at different times
   in terms of the above variables (p < 0.05). The effect size was= 0.82
   for pain anxiety between group after the intervention. Conclusion: Based
   on the results, foot reflexology massage can effectively reduce pain
   anxiety levels and improve sleep quality and quantity of patients with
   burn injuries; therefore, this nonpharmacological therapeutic method is
   recommended to be used in the burn ICUs. (Clinical trial's registration

Title = {{The ELAV/Hu protein Found in neurons regulates cytoskeletal and ECM
   adhesion inputs for space-filling dendrite growth}},
Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Dendritic arbor morphology influences how neurons receive and integrate
   extracellular signals. We show that the ELAV/Hu family RNA-binding
   protein Found in neurons (Fne) is required for space-filling dendrite
   growth to generate highly branched arbors of Drosophila larval class IV
   dendritic arborization neurons. Dendrites of fne mutant neurons are
   shorter and more dynamic than in wild-type, leading to decreased arbor
   coverage. These defects result from both a decrease in stable
   microtubules and loss of dendrite-substrate interactions within the
   arbor. Identification of transcripts encoding cytoskeletal regulators
   and cell-cell and cell-ECM interacting proteins as Fne targets using
   TRIBE further supports these results. Analysis of one target, encoding
   the cell adhesion protein Basigin, indicates that the cytoskeletal
   defects contributing to branch instability in fne mutant neurons are due
   in part to decreased Basigin expression. The ability of Fne to
   coordinately regulate the cytoskeleton and dendrite-substrate
   interactions in neurons may shed light on the behavior of cancer cells
   ectopically expressing ELAV/Hu proteins.
   Author summary
   Different types of neurons have different sizes and shapes that are
   tailored to their particular functions. In the fruit fly larva, a set of
   sensory neurons called class IV da neurons have highly branched trees of
   dendrites that cover the epidermis to sense potentially harmful stimuli.
   Neurons whose dendrites completely fill the territory they sample are
   also found in zebrafish, worms, mice and humans. We show that an
   RNA-binding protein called Fne plays an important role in coordinating
   different contributions to dendrite branching in class IV da neurons by
   impacting the organization of the cytoskeleton within the neuron and the
   ability of the dendrite to contact the substratum outside of it. The
   identification of mRNAs that code for cytoskeleton regulators and
   adhesive proteins as targets of Fne using a genome-wide approach further
   supports these results. While the ability of Fne to exert control over
   such proteins is crucial to generating the space-filling growth of
   neurons, it can be deleterious if not properly employed, such as when
   the homologs of Fne are expressed in cancer cells.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a common cause of
   cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Interferons and nucleos(t)ide
   analogs are being used for the treatment of chronic HBV infection.
   Entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) are the
   strongest oral antiviral agents. In this study, we aimed to investigate
   efficacy and safety of ETV and TDF in treatment of naive cirrhotic
   patients infected with HBV.
   Methods: A total of 58 cirrhotic patients infected with HBV who were
   treatment-naive and initiated ETV or TDF as first therapy regimen were
   included in the study. Their demographic features such as sex, age,
   Child-Pugh and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores and HBV
   DNA, HBsAg, HBeAg, serum alanine aminotransferase, creatinine,
   phosphorus and total creatine kinase levels were recorded at baseline
   and at 3rd, 6th, 12th, 18th, and 24th months of therapy. Drug side
   effects and complications of cirrhosis were also determined in the
   follow-up period. ETV and TDF groups were compared in terms of response
   to treatment.
   Results: There were 32 and 26 patients in TDF and ETV groups,
   respectively. Majority of patients in both groups were Child-Pugh class
   A. Sex and age distribution and baseline laboratory parameters were
   similar in both groups (p>0.05). Percentage of patients who were their
   HBV DNA becoming negative were higher significantly in ETV group only at
   the 6th month of therapy (p=0.04), however there were no statistically
   significant differences at 12th, 18th and 24th months between groups.
   HBV DNA was negative in 100\% of patients in TDF group and 89\% of
   patients in ETV group at the end of follow-up period (24th month)
   (p=0.31). In the followup period, there were significant increases in
   creatinine levels in both groups (p=0.04), however, this was within
   normal ranges and there was no statistically significant difference
   between the groups (p=0.71). There were significant declines in both
   mean MELD and Child-Pugh scores in TDF group (p=0.02 and p=0.001,
   respectively), and there was a significant decrease at mean ChildPugh
   score and no significant difference at MELD score in ETV group (p=0.003
   and p=0.14 respectively) at the end of the follow-up period.
   Conclusions: Both ETV and TDF are considerably safe and effective in
   treatment-naive patients with HBV-positive cirrhosis. The efficacy of
   these two drugs is similar.}},

Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Yeast are commonly used in the preparation of foods and beverages such
   as beer and bread and may also be used on their own as a source of
   nutrients and flavoring. Because of the historical connection of yeast
   to products made from wheat and barley, consumers maintaining a
   gluten-free diet can have concerns about the safety of yeast
   ingredients. Analyzing the safety of yeast and yeast-containing products
   presents some difficulties, as the yeast organisms actively degrade any
   gluten in the product, raising questions on the appropriateness of
   detection by traditional antibody-based methods. This study examines a
   variety of yeast and yeast-containing products by competitive ELISA and
   liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for the estimated level of
   gluten proteins. While samples such as yeast extracts and nutritional
   yeast contained gluten levels below the 20 mg/kg (or parts per million,
   ppm) threshold defined by Codex Alimentarius, one baking yeast and a
   nutritional yeast supplement sample contained higher levels of gluten.
   This study demonstrates that both competitive ELISA and liquid
   chromatography-mass spectrometry provide similar results in the
   detection of wheat and barley gluten in yeast-containing products.}},

Title = {{A Lightweight Three-Factor Authentication Scheme for WHSN Architecture}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Wireless Healthcare Sensor Network (WHSN) is a benchmarking technology
   deployed to levitate the quality of lives for the patients and doctors.
   WHSN systems must fit IEEE 802.15.6 standard for specific application
   criteria, unlike some standard criteria that are difficult to meet.
   Therefore, many security models were suggested to enhance the security
   of the WHSN and promote system performance. Yu and Park proposed a
   three-factor authentication scheme based on the smart card, biometric,
   and password, and their scheme can be easily employed in three-tier WHSN
   architecture. Furthermore, they claimed that their scheme can withstand
   guessing attack and provide anonymity, although, after cryptanalysis, we
   found that their scheme lacks both. Accordingly, we suggested a
   three-factor authentication scheme with better system confusion due to
   multiplex parametric features, hash function, and higher key size to
   increase the security and achieve anonymity for the connected nodes.
   Moreover, the scheme included initialization, authentication,
   re-authentication, secure node addition, user revocation, and secure
   data transmission via blockchain technology. The formal analysis of the
   scheme was conducted by BAN logic (Burrows Abadi Nadeem) and the
   simulation was carried out by Tamarin prover to validate that the
   proposed scheme is resistant to replay, session hijacking, and guessing
   attacks, plus it provides anonymity, perfect forward secrecy, and
   authentication along with the key agreement.}},

Journal = {{ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Recently, integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) and computer vision
   has been utilized in swimming pool automated surveillance systems.
   Several studies have been proposed to overcome off-time surveillance
   drowning incidents based on using a sequence of videos to track human
   motion and position. This paper proposes an efficient and reliable
   detection system that utilizes a single image to detect and classify
   drowning objects, to prevent drowning incidents. The proposed system
   utilizes the IoT and transfer learning to provide an intelligent and
   automated solution for off-time monitoring swimming pool safety. In
   addition, a specialized transfer-learning-based model utilizing a model
   pretrained on ``ImageNet{''}, which can extract the most useful and
   complex features of the captured image to differentiate between humans,
   animals, and other objects, has been proposed. The proposed system aims
   to reduce human intervention by processing and sending the
   classification results to the owner's mobile device. The performance of
   the specialized model is evaluated by using a prototype experiment that
   achieves higher accuracy, sensitivity, and precision, as compared to
   other deep learning algorithms.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{673-674}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: A number of papers exist about post-traumatic silaocele.
   Iatrogenic sialocele has been described as complication of parotid
   surgery but there is no specific data about the cases of sialocele and
   salivary duct surgical injury in condylar fracture management.
   Presentation of case: A 36-year-old man was reported to the
   maxillofacial emergency department for mandibular sub-condylar fracture
   and internal fixation of the sub-condylar fracture was planned.
   Postoperatively he presented a salivary cyst which was managed by
   conservative treatment.
   Discussion: Iatrogenic injury to the salivary duct and sialocele
   formation observed in the post-operative period of surgical treatment of
   a condylar fracture by sub-angulomandibular approach. Maxillofacial
   surgeons should be aware of this complication and the importance of
   adopting a conservative treatment whenever it is possible. Botulinum
   toxin injections can be performed as a first-line treatment for these
   complications.
   Conclusion: A conservative management was adopted by pressure dressings
   and percutaneous needle aspiration of the swelling, which was useful to
   absorb cystic content and helped healing.}},

Abstract = {{Low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) H9N2 poses significant
   threat to animal and human health. The growing interest in beneficial
   effects of probiotic bacteria on host immune system has led to research
   efforts studying their interaction with cells of host immune system.
   However, the role of lactobacilli in inducing antiviral responses in
   lymphoid tissue cells requires further investigation. The objective of
   the present study was to examine the antiviral and immunostimulatory
   effects of lactobacilli bacteria on chicken cecal tonsils (CT) cells
   against H9N2 LPAIV. CT mononuclear cells were stimulated with probiotic
   Lactobacillus spp mixture either alone or in combination with a
   Toll-like receptor (TLR)21 ligand, CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG).
   Pre-treatment of CT cells with probiotic lactobacilli, alone or in
   combination with CpG, significantly reduced H9N2 LPAIV replication.
   Furthermore, lactobacilli alone elicited cytokine expression, including
   IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-12, and IL-10, while when
   combined with CpG, a significantly higher expression of
   (interferon-stimulated gene (viperin)), IL-12, IL-6, CXCLi2, and IL-1
   beta was observed. However, none of these treatments induced significant
   changes in nitric oxide production by CT cells. In conclusion, probiotic
   lactobacilli demonstrated a modulatory effect on CT cells, and this
   correlated with enhanced antiviral immunity and reduced H9N2 LPAIV viral
   replication.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims at exploring the linguistic habits of Iraqi Arab
   speakers and the situations wherein Iraqis invoke religion and the
   lexicon of Allah in their daily online communication. Throughout this
   work, it was sought to answer the question whether the religious belief
   of Iraqis is reflected in online chats Iraqi by involving
   situation-bound rituals in their CMC and the functions these expressions
   fulfil in this communication. Although computer-mediated communication
   lacks nonverbal behaviour and prosodic features support the speakers'
   polite intention, many researchers assert that there are many resources
   whereby individuals can resort to in demonstrating their solidarity. The
   Methods is based on examining synchronic messages exchanged on WhatsApp
   and Viber in four groups with the participation of 99 participants in
   total whose age ranged from 15 to 70 years old, with different
   educational qualifications and religious orientations. Social distance
   between the participants varied from intimate to neutral, and large.
   Likewise, social rank ranged from equal footing to low-high
   relationships and high-low relationships. The setting involved different
   occasions such as congratulations, greetings, farewell, thanking,
   offering condolences as well as receiving bad news. The findings of this
   research have shown that Iraqi Arabic speakers incline to enhance the
   politeness of their message by involving religious vocabularies that
   take mostly the form of supplication. Besides, the religious lexicon
   stands as a form of etiquette that promotes the speakers' and the
   addressee's faces. FIt is hoped that this work would lead to further
   studies related to religious expressions across computer mediated
   communication.}},

Abstract = {{This study adopts the concept of institutional voids to examine the

   reporting (SER) towards sustainable development. The study uses in-depth
   semi-structured interviews with managers and decision-makers and
   policymakers of the main oil and gas companies in weak institutional
   settings (Libya). The findings suggest that the absence of environment
   general authority's role, the absence of a clear legal requirement that
   refers to SER, the shortage of knowledge and awareness, the lack of
   motivation from the government, fear of change, and the absence of civil
   society organisations are perceived as the major barriers that hinder
   the development of SER. These findings contribute to the literature on
   institutional voids and sustainable development by providing evidence on
   SER barriers in the context of a developing country. Therefore, it could
   be useful to corporate regulators and policymakers to mitigate
   institutional voids to develop a more focussed SER agenda, when

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the perception of phonotactics by Saudi English
   majors, beginners and advanced. Due to the significance of pronunciation
   of consonant clusters, which are almost absent from Arabic, this work
   attempts to find the extent to which beginner and advanced English
   majors accept or reject permissible and impermissible sounds
   combinations in the onset position. It also attempts to find whether
   there are any intervening factors that could influence students'
   perception of English phonotactics. The focus was on the consonant
   clusters occurring in onset position. These clusters included two-sound
   and three-sound clusters starting the word. Most of the words were
   pseudowords, and the focus was on whether the students would accept or
   reject these sounds, and whether there was a significant difference
   between beginner and advanced students, male and female. The paper also
   considered some intervening factors that could have influenced students'
   performance. To this end, the researcher conducted a survey to test the
   perception and rejection of certain sounds in some carefully selected
   pseudowords. The findings showed that most advanced students scored
   better in permissible sounds while the results were close in the
   impermissible sounds. There were some factors that could have had some
   impact on the results, such as living in an English-speaking community,
   watching English TV, and listening to the news in English. Suggestions
   for further research would include sounds in the coda position.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{105}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The interest in large scale automated video surveillance systems and the
   interest in using cloud in supporting such systems has increased
   dramatically. Unfortunately, building such a large system requires huge
   resources (for processing and storage) and very high network bandwidth.
   This paper, proposes a framework for resources efficient intelligent
   automated surveillance framework that utilizes edge servers. In this
   framework, multiple video sources capture and send videos to a an edge
   server which performs an intelligent computer vision based cross-layer
   optimization of the video sources hardware resources and the network
   bandwidth. The network can be a wireless network and the sources can be
   mobile. The proposed solution changes the application rates and the
   required link layer parameters (the transmission opportunities in our
   case study) of the sending video sources according to the dynamic
   network conditions to maximize the overall accuracy of the computer
   vision algorithm(s) of interest in the system. The proposed framework
   utilizes an enhanced effective airtime estimation algorithm utilizing a
   Proportional Integral Differential (PID) controller that measure the
   available useful bandwidth in the network. Furthermore, we propose a
   bandwidth pruning mechanism to reach any desired tradeoff between the
   computer vision algorithm accuracy and the energy consumption of the
   video sources. We evaluate and present the effectiveness of the proposed
   framework, the effective airtime estimation algorithm, and the proposed
   bandwidth pruning mechanism, through extensive experiments using OPNET.}},

   had appointments scheduled for their child's vaccination during the
   pandemic, and approximately 23.4\% of the parents reported a delay of
   more than one month in the immunization of their child. The most common
   reason for the delay was the fear of being infected by COVID-19
   (60.9\%). Large household size and lack of insurance were risk factors
   for immunization delay. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the
   timeliness of routine childhood immunization in Saudi Arabia. Childhood
   immunization should be prioritized, as well as the implementation of
   focused strategies to achieve significant and sustainable vaccination
   rates during pandemics.}},

Journal = {{FOOD PACKAGING AND SHELF LIFE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{26}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In the present study, zein ultrafine fibers plasticized with tributyl
   citrate (TBC) were produced via electrospinning according to the central
   composite design with two independent variables, namely zein
   concentration (31.2-36.8\%, w/v) and carvacrol level (0-8.2\%, w/w). The
   changes in morphology, structure, encapsulation efficiency, thermal,
   mechanical and water vapor barrier properties of electrospun nanofibers
   with respect to the independent variables were investigated. The average
   diameter of zein fibers ranged between 103 +/- 35 and 217 +/- 47 nm. The
   encapsulation efficiency of carvacrol varied from 40 +/- 1.9 to 81 +/-
   1.7\%. Carvacrol loaded nanofibers had better thermal stability than
   zein fibers without carvacrol. Zein fibers with TBC exhibited higher
   tensile strength than those of pure zein fibers. The tensile strength of
   films was affected by the linear effect of both zein and carvacrol
   concentrations and interaction between them. Among fibrous films, a
   decreasing trend in WVP was observed with increasing carvacrol at low
   zein concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{An 83-year-old man with a history of chronic myelogenous leukaemia in
   remission maintained with bosutinib presented with new-onset fevers. He
   denied pain and had no other focal symptoms. Ultrasound imaging revealed
   mild gallbladder wall thickening. Non-contrasted CT revealed right upper
   quadrant inflammation of indeterminate source. The diagnosis of
   acalculous cholecystitis was made on the third day when a CT with oral
   contrast demonstrated a remarkably inflamed biliary tree. The
   gallbladder was surgically removed and found to be necrotic. The case
   highlights an unusual presentation for a well-known condition. Both
   ultrasound and CT have limited diagnostic sensitivity for acalculous
   cystitis. This case adds to existing literature to support development
   of acalculous cholecystitis in non-critically ill patients. Clinicians
   should maintain awareness of this condition among patients presenting to
   the hospital or clinic with abdominal pain. Careful discussion with
   radiology and surgery is indicated to guide diagnostic testing when

   12635}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The goal of this work is to study the atmospheric heating above isolated
   AR 12635 during a period in which a quasistationary increase in
   microwave and soft X-ray emission is combined with a series of B- and
   C-class microflares. Analysis of photospheric vector magnetograms showed
   that an increase in the SXR brightness lasting 14 hours was observed
   during the simplification of the magnetic structure and the growth of
   vertical currents in the head part of the active region. A long-term
   increase of SXR and microwave emission occurred when the total unsigned
   vertical current exceeded the critical value and coincided in time with
   the increased level of the emission measure calculated from the GOES
   X-ray data. Against the background of quasistationary emission,
   microflares lasting 6-10 minutes occurred. In the hard X-ray range,
   bursts are recorded with RHESSI channels up to 25 keV. In microwave
   emission, pulsed and smooth components are distinguished during
   microflares. The first component was recorded in the 4.5-7.5 GHz range
   at the beginning of microflares and it is generated by a small
   population of relativistic electrons by the gyrosychrotron mechanism.
   The smooth component of the bursts dominated at 17 GHz and was emitted
   by bremsstrahlung. It is shown that the sources of quasistationary
   emission and microflares coincide with each other and with the
   bremsstrahlung source calculated from the differential emission measure
   obtained from the EUV maps. Coronal magnetic field reconstruction shows
   that the release of energy on both timescales occurs in a stably
   existing bundle of magnetic field lines.}},

Abstract = {{This article analyses the barriers, negotiation and forms of resistance
   during the practise and/or learning of ballroom dancing (tango and samba

   and Sao Paulo). These dances reproduce gender stereotypes, a reflection
   of a heteronormative hegemony deeply ingrained in the society. The
   objective of this work is to identify forms of resistance and
   negotiation strategies with which people, in general, and LGBTIQ groups
   face the barriers derived from gender stereotypes when dancing. The work
   is based on a qualitative methodological design, based on the study of
   multiple cases. The results confirm that the barriers related to gender
   stereotypes hinders access, participation and enjoyment of these dances,
   as leisure practices. The affected people react to barriers and seek
   negotiation strategies, in order to avoid them, eliminate them or
   mitigate their effects. Resistance is one of them.}},

Abstract = {{Agroindustrial residues are produced in large quantities from food
   processing and beneficiation. The disposal of these residues into the
   environment can result in a number of disruptions in the ecosystem due
   to their composition rich in organic matter. In this scenario, the reuse
   of industrial residues is a viable alternative for reducing the
   environmental impacts caused by improper disposal and compliance with
   legal requirements regarding the final disposal of the residues
   produced. In this context, the brewing industry stands out, whose
   production includes processing and fermentation stages of vegetable raw
   material, generating residues characterized by compositions that have
   significant potential for application in bioprocess technologies using
   sustainable biotechnological routes. Among several metabolites of
   industrial interest, the enzyme tannase has been emphasized in the
   national scenario due to its capacity to produce antioxidants used in
   the chemical, pharmaceutical and food industry. The work aims to
   optimize the solid fermentation medium for the production of this enzyme
   using residues from the brewing industry. For that, the residues were
   standardized and submitted to the fermentation process, where several
   variables of the compound production route were studied. Thus, as the
   main result, we highlight the increase in enzymatic activity, which
   changed from 0.04 U/mL to 0.19 U/mL after adjusting the extracting
   agent, moisture in the fermentation medium, incubation time and pH,
   concentration of the inducing agent and temperature and pH of the
   reaction medium. Therefore, the best standards for process optimization
   were established, reaffirming the residue from the brewing industry as a
   great substrate for biomolecule production.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorus (P) deficiency is one of the main constraints on crop
   production in Arenosols (acid sandy soil). The high cost of P
   fertilizers may represent an insurmountable obstacle in many poor
   countries, leaving the exploitation of their own calcareous and
   phosphate rocks as the only low-cost and long-term alternative. Biochar
   is suggested to have positive effects on soil properties; however, there
   is no published research on the synergistic effects of biochar and rocky
   materials in modifying soil properties. The aim of this study was to
   investigate the chemical and biochemical responses of an acid Arenosol
   treated with phosphate rock (PR), calcareous rock (CR), and biochar
   (BC), and the implications for corn yield. A soil from Marracuene
   District, Mozambique was used, where corn was grown for 90 d with the
   soil treated with: no addition (control), water-soluble zinc phosphite
   fertilizer (WSP), PR, WSP+CR, WSP+BC, WSP+CR+BC, PR+BC, and PR+CR+BC.
   Biochar was produced by pyrolysis of babycorn peels for 4 hat 450
   degrees C and applied at 11 g kg(-1). The soil pH(H2O) increased from
   about 4.54 in the control to 7.38 in the PR+CR+BC treatment. Easily

   were higher in the treatments containing BC than in the control. The
   treatments containing CR and/or BC led to the highest activities of
   alkaline phosphomonoesterase, phosphodiesterase, and a-glucosidase,
   which increased P availability and gave the greatest biomass and yields.
   We suggest that biochar provides additional soluble P and supplies
   adsorption sites for phosphate, preventing its evolution to unavailable
   forms. Thus, PR applied together with BC contributed to an 840\% yield
   increase compared to the control. The treatments containing WSP and BC
   facilitated phosphite oxidation to phosphate and increased crop yield.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to analyze the effects of fiscal and monetary policies
   interactions on public debt in Jordan during (1970 - 2019). Using Vector
   Error Correction Model (VECM) derived from VAR (Vector Auto regression),

   results indicated that the fiscal policy instruments affect public debt
   in two different directions, the expansion of government expenditure
   positively affect public debt, while tax revenues reduce indebtedness.
   The monetary policy instruments affect public debt in the same
   directions, as the results indicated that the central bank in
   controlling money supply and managing interest rate helps the fiscal
   authority in reducing the public debt in Jordan. The results confirm the
   strongest impact of government expenditure on public debt in Jordan. The
   study recommends the necessity of rationalizing government expenditures
   and combating tax evasion. In addition, more coordination between fiscal

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The astrocytes are cells which play an essential role in the functioning
   and interaction of neurons by feeding the respective neurons with
   calcium ions. Drawing inspiration from this two-way relationship in
   which the astrocytes influence and are influenced by the neurons by
   means of calcium ions, in this paper, we define and study spiking neural
   P systems with astrocytes producing calcium. Distinct from the usual
   firing rules in spiking neural P systems, the firing condition not only
   depends on the spikes collected in a neuron but also on the calcium
   units received from astrocytes. From the perspective of topological
   structure, the new variant is shown as a directed graph in which
   synapses link either astrocytes or neurons, as well as astrocytes to
   neurons and conversely. The computational power of spiking neural P
   systems with astrocytes producing calcium is investigated; it is proved
   that these systems using a limited number of rules are Turing universal
   as both number generating and number accepting devices. It is also
   presented how to obtain normal forms by removing forgetting rules and
   delays while preserving the computational power.}},

Title = {{Evolution of Urban Haze in Greater Bangkok and Association with Local
   Meteorological and Synoptic Characteristics during Two Recent Haze
   Episodes}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This present work investigates several local and synoptic meteorological
   aspects associated with two wintertime haze episodes in Greater Bangkok
   using observational data, covering synoptic patterns evolution,
   day-to-day and diurnal variation, dynamic stability, temperature
   inversion, and back-trajectories. The episodes include an elevated haze
   event of 16 days (14-29 January 2015) for the first episode and 8 days
   (19-26 December 2017) for the second episode, together with some days
   before and after the haze event. Daily PM2.5 was found to be 50 mu g
   m(-3) or higher over most of the days during both haze events. These
   haze events commonly have cold surges as the background synoptic feature
   to initiate or trigger haze evolution. A cold surge reached the study
   area before the start of each haze event, causing temperature and
   relative humidity to drop abruptly initially but then gradually
   increased as the cold surge weakened or dissipated. Wind speed was
   relatively high when the cold surge was active. Global radiation was
   generally modulated by cloud cover, which turns relatively high during
   each haze event because cold surge induces less cloud. Daytime dynamic
   stability was generally unstable along the course of each haze event,
   except being stable at the ending of the second haze event due to a
   tropical depression. In each haze event, low-level temperature inversion
   existed, with multiple layers seen in the beginning, effectively
   suppressing atmospheric dilution. Large-scale subsidence inversion aloft
   was also persistently present. In both episodes, PM2.5 showed stronger
   diurnality during the time of elevated haze, as compared to the pre- and
   post-haze periods. During the first episode, an apparent contrast of
   PM2.5 diurnality was seen between the first and second parts of the haze
   event with relatively low afternoon PM2.5 over its first part, but
   relatively high afternoon PM2.5 over its second part, possibly due to
   the role of secondary aerosols. PM2.5/PM10 ratio was relatively lower in
   the first episode because of more impact of biomass burning, which was
   in general agreement with back-trajectories and active fire hotspots.
   The second haze event, with little biomass burning in the region, was
   likely to be caused mainly by local anthropogenic emissions. These
   findings suggest a need for haze-related policymaking with an integrated
   approach that accounts for all important emission sectors for both
   particulate and gaseous precursors of secondary aerosols. Given that
   cold surges induce an abrupt change in local meteorology, the time
   window to apply control measures for haze is limited, emphasizing the
   need for readiness in mitigation responses and early public warning.}},

   Assessment Incorporating Stakeholder Perspectives}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Decentralised energy storage is increasingly seen as being important for
   decarbonising local energy systems and the global market for such
   systems is expected to grow significantly. Several studies have looked
   into the technical development of decentralised energy storage systems,
   as well as examining how different business models can enable them to
   capture a variety of value streams. Recent work has also explored public
   perceptions of energy storage, yet so far there has been little focus on
   how the different dimensions affecting deployment interact together.
   Here, we present the result of a deliberative workshop which gathers
   stakeholders' views and addresses how the interplay between these three
   dimensions affects successful deployment. Our approach is holistic and
   integrative and utilises a participatory decision-making methodology.
   The findings of the research add substantially to the understanding of
   how decentralised energy storage schemes should be implemented. The
   research reveals that there are many aspects that can help to either
   facilitate or impede a storage scheme, and stakeholders perceive
   multiple ways to engage with the deployment of the technology. We show
   that the following four principles could contribute to achieving
   success: maximizing simplicity and clarity; managing expectations,
   uncertainty and risk; generating benefits for the community; and the
   involvement of trusted actors.}},

   Results Despite the successfully implemented several record-breaking
   renewable energy projects, the rentier mentality, intermittent nature of
   the renewables, and geopolitical implications may prevent the UAE from

Abstract = {{Flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSSP) is a further expansion of
   the classical job shop scheduling problem (JSSP). FJSSP is known to be
   NP-hard with regards to optimization and hence poses a challenge in
   finding acceptable solutions. Genetic algorithm (GA) has successfully
   been applied in this regard since last two decades. This paper provides
   an insight into the actual complexity of selected benchmark problems
   through quantitative evaluation of the search space owing to their
   NP-hard nature. A four-layered genetic algorithm is then proposed and
   implemented with adaptive parameters of population initialization and
   operator probabilities to manage intensification and diversification
   intelligently. The concept of reinitialization is introduced whenever
   the algorithm is trapped in local minima till predefined number of
   generations. Results are then compared with various other standalone
   evolutionary algorithms for selected benchmark problems. It is found
   that the proposed GA finds better solutions with this technique as
   compared to solutions produced without this technique. Moreover, the
   technique helps to overcome the local minima trap. Further comparison
   and analysis indicate that the proposed algorithm produces comparative
   and improved solutions with respect to other analogous methodologies
   owing to the diversification technique. (C) 2020 CPE, University of

Title = {{Sexual Minority Status, Anxiety-Depression, and Academic Outcomes: The
   Role of Campus Climate Perceptions among Italian Higher Education
   Students}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Students from sexual minorities generally describe Higher Education
   contexts as unwelcoming and chilly environments. Based on the Minority
   Stress theory, these disparities in climate perceptions may lead sexual
   minority students to negative health and academic outcomes. To date,
   research documenting the experience of sexual minority students within
   European Higher Education Institutions is limited. Framed within campus
   climate literature, the current study aimed to expand on previous
   knowledge by investigating the associations between sexual minority
   status, students' perceptions of campus climate and psychological (i.e.,
   anxiety-depression), and academic outcomes (i.e., intellectual and
   academic success and considering leaving the university) using a
   self-selected sample of 868 Italian university students (17.9\% sexual
   minority students). The results showed that sexual minority status was
   associated with negative perceptions of campus climate, which, in turn,
   were associated with higher levels of anxiety-depression symptoms,
   lowered academic success, and a high probability of considering leaving
   university. Further research is needed to investigate the experience of
   sexual minority students within European Higher Education contexts and
   to explore possible actions that could contribute to fostering a greater
   sense of belonging to the campus community for all students, and
   particularly for students from sexual minority groups.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effectiveness of a resonance avoidance
   concept for composite rotor blades featuring extension-twist elastic
   coupling. The concept uses a tendon, attached to the tip of the blade,
   to apply a proper amount of compressive force to tune the vibration
   behavior of the blade actively. The tendon is simulated by applying a
   non-conservative axial compressive force applied to the blade tip. The
   main load carrying part of the structure is the composite spar box,
   which has an antisymmetric layup configuration. The nonlinear dynamic
   behavior of the composite blade is modelled by using the geometrically
   exact fully intrinsic beam equations. The resulting nonlinear
   differential equations are discretized using a time-space scheme, and
   the stationary and rotating frequencies of the blade are obtained. It is
   observed that the proposed resonance avoidance mechanism is effective
   for tuning the vibration behavior of composite blades. The applied
   compressive force can shift the frequencies and the location at which
   the frequency veering take place. Furthermore, the compressive force can
   also cause the composite blade to get unstable depending on the layup
   ply angle. Finally, the results, highlighting the importance of
   compressive force and ply angle on the dynamic behavior of composite
   blades, are presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Using inelastic X-ray scattering beyond the dipole limit and hard X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy we establish the dual nature of the U 5f
   electrons in UM2Si2 (M = Pd, Ni, Ru, Fe), regardless of their degree of
   delocalization. We have observed that the compounds have in common a
   local atomic-like state that is well described by the U 5f(2)
   configuration with the Gamma((1))(1) and Gamma(2) quasi-doublet
   symmetry. The amount of the U 5f(3) configuration, however, varies
   considerably across the UM2Si2 series, indicating an increase of U 5f
   itineracy in going from M = Pd to Ni to Ru and to the Fe compound. The
   identified electronic states explain the formation of the very large
   ordered magnetic moments in UPd2Si2 and UNi2Si2, the availability of
   orbital degrees of freedom needed for the hidden order in URu2Si2 to
   occur, as well as the appearance of Pauli paramagnetism in UFe2Si2. A
   unified and systematic picture of the UM2Si2 compounds may now be drawn,
   thereby providing suggestions for additional experiments to induce
   hidden order and/or superconductivity in U compounds with the tetragonal
   body-centered ThCr2Si2 structure.}},

Abstract = {{Irrigation scheduling and programming are very effective tools for
   efficient water use in a plant factory with artificial lighting (PFAL).
   In order to confirm optimal irrigation schemes for the production of
   cucumber scions and rootstocks in a PFAL, in this study, four different
   start points of irrigation were applied by measuring the weight of the
   plug tray to compare the growth of cucumber scions and rootstocks
   cultivated in a PFAL. Additionally, the growth characteristics of
   cucumber seedlings grafted with scions and rootstocks cultivated between
   in a greenhouse and in a PFAL were investigated. Although the growth of
   cucumber scions and rootstocks was highest when irrigation was conducted
   at 70\% of water content in a medium, the growth of grafted cucumber
   seedlings before and after transplanting was not significantly different
   among the irrigation treatments in a PFAL. However, water use efficiency
   (WUE) during cucumber scions and rootstock production in a PFAL was
   higher at 60\% than at 70\%. Considering seedling growth and the
   efficiency of irrigation such as WUE and irrigation schedule, the
   optimal start point of irrigation during the production of cucumber
   scions and rootstocks in a PFAL was determined as 60\% of water content
   in a medium. When the optimal irrigation regime was applied to the
   production of cucumber scions and rootstocks in a PFAL, the
   morphological characteristics of cucumber scions and rootstocks
   cultivated in a PFAL were more suitable for grafting compared with that
   of the cucumber scions and rootstocks cultivated conventionally in a
   greenhouse. The favorable environmental conditions during the
   cultivation of cucumber scions and rootstocks in a PFAL also positively
   affected the flowering response of cucumber grafted seedlings after
   transplanting.}},

Abstract = {{When the long head of the biceps tendon is diseased, tenodesis is an
   appropriate treatment strategy. The specific technique used is dependent
   on visualization, fixation method and hardware, and tenodesis location.
   For suprapectoral tenodesis techniques, those that fix the tendon within
   or below the bicipital groove can be challenging owing to the transverse
   humeral ligament covering the groove. To accurately identify the biceps
   tendon in this area, the ligament often requires resection. Ultrasound
   provides surgeons with a safe and noninvasive tool to visualize the
   biceps tendon as it exits the bicipital groove, negating the need for
   unroofing and other pitfalls associated with traditional techniques.
   This technical note describes an ultrasound-guided suprapectoral biceps
   tenodesis procedure.}},

   Si-rich and compressive SiN films exhibited a significant increase in

   SiN films showed a significant increase in the gate leakage current of
   HEMTs. In addition, pulsed I - V measurements showed the suppression in

   small current collapse and small gate leakage current were obtained
   simultaneously with good isolation, as the film stress was optimized.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate three categories of growth and

   stands. A continuous forest inventory was performed in 34 permanent
   plots of 400 m(2), in four management units, which totaled 293.43 ha.
   Model categories tested were: at the stand level (MP), by the
   simultaneous equations system of Clutter; diameter distribution model
   (MDD), by the adjustment of the Weibull-2P's probability density
   function and individual trees (MAI), by the Pienaar and Schiver model.
   The three model categories provided reliable estimates of volume with
   bark at 36, 48, 60 and 72 months. Although projections with MP and MDD
   generated similar volume estimates for ages beyond those in which the
   forest inventory was performed, MAI was the most accurate and consistent
   category in volume quantification per hectare.}},

   failure of curved composite laminates under four-point bending}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{253}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Matrix failure and delamination are the two dominant damage modes that
   govern the out-of-plane strength of the curved composite laminates. In
   this work, the out-of-plane failure behavior of curved CFRP laminates of
   different stacking sequences, namely, uni-directional {[}0](20),
   cross-ply {[}0/90](5s), and multi-angle {[}45/0/ - 45/90/0](2s), are
   studied experimentally and numerically. Digital image correlation and
   acoustic emission techniques are used for in situ monitoring of
   intra/inter-laminar damage modes under four-point bending load. A
   detailed fractography study is carried out to assess the damage modes
   and the failure mechanisms of the curved specimen. Subsequently, a
   finite element based progressive damage model (PDM) comprising of the 3D
   Hashin failure criteria and cohesive zone model is developed in Abaqus
   finite element software for simulating the intra/inter-laminar damages.
   The importance of combining matrix damage models with CZM and their
   synergy on the out-of-plane failure is studied and validated with
   experimental observations. The PDM model is then used to investigate the
   effect of stacking sequence, matrix tensile strength, and delamination
   strength on the failure of multi-angle curved laminates. This numerical
   study show insights to improve the out-ofplane strength of curved
   laminates by appropriate selection of laminate stacking sequence and
   matrix strength properties.}},

Abstract = {{A large variety of gusts that develop in the atmospheric boundary layer
   affect aerial vehicles. This study, performed in water tow tanks,
   compares the response of a flat plate wing to transverse vertical gusts
   with a top-hat and a sine-squared velocity profile at Reynolds numbers
   of 20,000-30,000. Experiments are performed for a wide range of gust
   ratios (0.5-1.5) and angles of attack (0-20 deg). Force measurements for
   a sine-squared gust show a smoother increase in lift and a lower peak
   compared with a top-hat gust for the same gust ratio. Linear models are
   found to work reasonably well predicting the force response for the
   sine-squared gust, whereas the top-hat gust exhibits significant
   nonlinear effects at the largest gust ratios. This nonlinear behavior is
   linked to high levels of circulation shed from the wing edges and the
   development of nonplanar wakes. Nevertheless, the gust momentum inflow
   on the wing is directly linked to many characteristics of the lift
   response, independently of gust velocity profile. In addition, the lift
   response for the two gusts is found to increase with angle of attack
   until the wing inclination is large enough to produce a separated wake
   before gust entry.}},

Abstract = {{Background Tumour acidosis is considered to play a central role in
   promoting cancer invasion and migration, but few studies have
   investigated in vivo how tumour pH correlates with cancer invasion. This
   study aims to determine in vivo whether tumour acidity is associated
   with cancer metastatic potential. Methods Breast cancer cell lines with
   different metastatic potentials have been characterised for several
   markers of aggressiveness and invasiveness. Murine tumour models have
   been developed and assessed for lung metastases and tumour acidosis has
   been assessed in vivo by a magnetic resonance imaging-based chemical
   exchange saturation transfer (CEST) pH imaging approach. Results The
   higher metastatic potential of 4T1 and TS/A primary tumours, in
   comparison to the less aggressive TUBO and BALB-neuT ones, was confirmed
   by the highest expression of cancer cell stem markers (CD44(+)CD24(-)),
   highlighting their propensity to migrate and invade, coinciding with the
   measurement obtained by in vitro assays. MRI-CEST pH imaging
   successfully discriminated the more aggressive 4T1 and TS/A tumours that
   displayed a more acidic pH. Moreover, the observed higher tumour acidity
   was significantly correlated with an increased number of lung
   metastases. Conclusions The findings of this study indicate that the
   extracellular acidification is associated with the metastatic potential.}},

Abstract = {{Using data related to thermal optimal and pejus of the embryos of
   Octopus americanus from Brazil and O. insularis and O. maya from Mexico,
   this study aimed to project the potential distribution areas in the Gulf
   of Mexico and predict distribution shifts under different Representative
   Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCP 6 and 8.5) for the years 2050 and
   2100. The different thermal tolerances elicited different responses to
   current and future scenarios. In this sense, O. insularis and O. maya
   thermal niches stretch from the Caribbean to Florida. Nevertheless, O.
   insularis may inhabit warmer areas than O. maya. Surprisingly, no area
   was considered thermally habitable for O. americanus, which could have
   been associated with the use of data of populations thermally adapted to
   temperate conditions south of Brazil. According to models, a warming
   scenario would cause a restriction of the available thermal niche of O.
   maya, while O. insularis could expand under RCP 6 scenarios. This
   restriction was more substantial in the RCP 8.5 scenario. Nevertheless,
   under the RCP 8.5 scenario, the temperature in 2100 may negatively
   affect even O. insularis, the species most thermal tolerant. If our
   results are accurate, the fishing yield of O. insularis will increase in
   the future, replacing the heavily exploited O. maya in the coasts of the
   southern Gulf of Mexico. Regarding O. americanus, no inference might be
   made until thermal tolerances of locally adapted populations can be
   studied.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE We aimed to compare cardiovascular (CV) events, all-cause
   mortality, and CV mortality rates among adults with and without diabetes
   in countries with differing levels of income. RESEARCH DESIGN AND
   METHODS The Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study enrolled
   143,567 adults aged 35-70 years from 4 high-income countries (HIC), 12
   middle-income countries (MIC), and 5 low-income countries (LIC). The
   mean follow-up was 9.0 +/- 3.0 years. RESULTS Among those with diabetes,
   CVD rates (LIC 10.3, MIC 9.2, HIC 8.3 per 1,000 person-years, P <
   0.001), all-cause mortality (LIC 13.8, MIC 7.2, HIC 4.2 per 1,000
   person-years, P < 0.001), and CV mortality (LIC 5.7, MIC 2.2, HIC 1.0
   per 1,000 person-years, P < 0.001) were considerably higher in LIC
   compared with MIC and HIC. Within LIC, mortality was higher in those in
   the lowest tertile of wealth index (low 14.7\%, middle 10.8\%, and high
   6.5\%). In contrast to HIC and MIC, the increased CV mortality in those
   with diabetes in LIC remained unchanged even after adjustment for
   behavioral risk factors and treatments (hazard ratio {[}95\% CI] 1.89
   {[}1.58-2.27] to 1.78 {[}1.36-2.34]). CONCLUSIONS CVD rates, all-cause
   mortality, and CV mortality were markedly higher among those with
   diabetes in LIC compared with MIC and HIC with mortality risk remaining
   unchanged even after adjustment for risk factors and treatments. There
   is an urgent need to improve access to care to those with diabetes in
   LIC to reduce the excess mortality rates, particularly among those in
   the poorer strata of society.}},

Abstract = {{High-performance Mixed-Matrix Membranes (MMMs) comprising of two kinds
   of porous fillers UiO-66 and Zeolite 4Aand their combination were
   fabricated with polysulfone (PSf) polymer matrix. For the very first
   time, UiO-66 and Zeolite 4A were jointly used as nanofillers in MMMs
   with the objective of complimenting synergistic effects. The individual
   and complimentary effects of nanofillers were investigated on membrane
   morphology and performance, pure water flux, humic acid rejection,
   static humic acid adsorption, and antifouling properties of membranes.
   Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis of membranes confirmed that
   all MMMs possessed wider macrovoids with higher nanofiller loadings than
   neat PSf membranes and the MMMs (PSf/UiO-66 and PSf/Zeolite 4A-UiO-66)
   showed tendency of agglomeration with high nanofiller loadings (1 wt\%
   and 2 wt\%). All MMMs exhibited better hydrophilicity and lower static
   humic acid adsorption than neat PSf membranes. Pure water flux of MMMs
   was higher than neat PSf membranes but the tradeoff between permeability
   and selectivity was witnessed in the MMMs with single nanofiller.
   However, MMMs with combined nanofillers (PSf/Zeolite 4A-UiO-66) showed
   no such tradeoff, and an increase in both permeability and selectivity
   was achieved. All MMMs with lower nanofiller loadings (0.5 wt\% and 1
   wt\%) showed improved flux recovery. PSf/Zeolite 4A-UiO-66 (0.5 wt\%)
   membranes showed the superior antifouling properties without sacrificing
   permeability and selectivity.}},

Title = {{Changes in the localization of ovarian visfatin protein and its possible
   role during estrous cycle of mice}},
Journal = {{ACTA HISTOCHEMICA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{122}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Visfatin is a crucial adipokine, which also regulates ovarian functions
   in many animals. Mice estrous cycle is characterized by a dynamic
   complex physiological process in the reproductive system. Expression of
   various factors changes during the estrous cycle in the ovary. To the
   best of our knowledge, no previous study has been conducted on the
   expression of visfatin in mice ovaries during the estrous cycle.
   Therefore, we investigated the localization and expression of visfatin
   protein in the ovary of mice during the estrous cycle. Western blot
   analysis showed the elevated expression of visfatin in proestrus and
   lowest in diestrus. Immunohistochemical localization of visfatin showed
   intense staining in the corpus luteum of proestrus and diestrus ovaries.
   Thecal cells, granulosa cells, and oocytes also showed the presence of
   visfatin. Expression of ovarian visfatin was correlated to BCL2 and
   active caspase3 expression and exhibited a significant positive
   correlation. Furthermore, in vivo inhibition of visfatin by FK866 in the
   proestrus ovary down-regulated active caspase3 and PCNA expression, and
   up-regulated the BCL2 expression. These results suggest the role of
   visfatin in the proliferation and apoptosis of the follicles and
   specific localization of visfatin in the corpus luteum also indicate its
   role in corpus luteum function, which may be in progesterone
   biosynthesis and regression of old corpus luteum. However, further study
   is required to support these findings. In conclusion, visfatin may also
   be regulating follicular growth during the estrous cycle by regulating
   proliferation and apoptosis.}},

Title = {{Phase Separation within a Thin Layer of Polymer Solution as Prompt
   Technique to Predict Membrane Morphology and Transport Properties}},
Journal = {{POLYMERS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the precipitation of a thin layer of a polymer solution
   was proposed to imitate the process of asymmetric membrane formation by
   a non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) technique. The phase
   inversion within the thin (<500 mu m) and bulk (similar to 2 cm) layer
   of polyamic-acid (PAA) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) by using water as
   non-solvent was considered. It was shown that polymer films formed
   within the ``limited{''} layer of polymer solution showed a good
   agreement with the morphology of corresponded asymmetric flat-sheet
   membranes even in the case of three-component casting solution
   (PAA/NMP/EtOH). At the same time, the polymer films formed on the
   interface of two bulk phases ({''}infinite{''} regime) did not fully
   correspond to the membrane structure. It was shown that up to 50\% of
   NMP solvent in PAA solution can be replaced by ethanol, which can have a
   renewable origin. By changing the ethanol content in the casting
   solution, the average size of transport pores can be varied in the range
   of 12-80 nm, and the liquid permeance from 16.6 up to 207 kg/m(2)center
   dot h center dot bar. To summarize, the precipitation of polymer
   solution within the thin layer can be considered a prompt technique and
   a powerful tool for fast screening and optimization of the complex
   composition of casting solutions using its small quantity. Furthermore,
   the prediction of membrane morphology can be done without casting the
   membrane, further post-treatment procedures, and scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer remains a foremost cause of deaths worldwide, despite several
   advances in the medical science. The conventional chemotherapeutic
   methods are not only harmful for normal body cells but also become
   inactive due to the development of resistance by cancer cells.
   Therefore, the demand of safe anticancer agents is increasing and
   enforced the bottomless research on the bacteriocins. Several studies
   have reported the selective anticancer property of bacteriocins. Current
   research is the contribution to explore the exact mechanism of action
   and in vitro application of bacteriocin (BAC-IB17) as an oncolytic
   agent. In this study, beta-lactamase mediated resistance of methicillin
   resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was studied and inhibitory
   mechanism of MRSA by BACIB17 was investigated. Cytotoxic studies were
   conducted to analyze the anticancerous potential of BAC-IB17. Results
   revealed that BAC-IB17 inhibited the beta-lactamase and produced
   profound effect on the membrane integrity of MRSA confirmed by scanning
   electron microscope (SEM). FTIR spectroscopic analysis revealed the
   changes in the functional groups of bacterial cells before and after
   treatment with BAC-IB17. BAC-IB17 also found anticancer in nature as it
   kills HeLa cell lines with the IC50 value of 12.5 mu g mL(-1) with no
   cytotoxic effect on normal cells at this concentration. This specific
   anticancer property of BAC-IB17 will make it a promising candidate for
   the treatment of cancer after further clinical trials. Moreover,
   BAC-IB17 may control MDR bacteria responsible for the secondary
   complications in cancer patients.}},

Abstract = {{Peterie et al. question one observation in our paper: associating
   pressure increases to injection volumes at distances of up to 25 km from
   an injection well. In this reply, we show that the comment
   misunderstands our analysis and the evidence that led to this
   conclusion. We also show that gauge-depth-corrected pressures, used by
   the authors to produce statewide pressure maps, are discrepant with the
   static fluid level data, provided in our original compilation and
   analysis. The discrepancies are a result of the pressure correction
   method employed, which naively substitutes formation pressure for
   bottomhole pressure to calculate wellbore fluid density. Their linearly
   interpolated pressure maps, based on sparse data, contain interpolation
   and extrapolation artifacts that contradict injection trends in the
   state, the Theis solution, and the superposition principle. We reiterate
   that pressure and static fluid level increases in Class I wells existed
   prior to 2013, most notably in central Kansas, where recent earthquakes
   are cited in the comment as evidence of a pressure plume emanating from
   the Kansas-Oklahoma border, 90 km away. We show that the space-time
   pattern of seismicity in this area is inconsistent with a northward
   propagating pressure plume and, instead, seismicity appears to be
   centered on and near a cluster of high-rate injection wells, two of
   which are among the highest rate wells in the state. These observations,
   along with recent M4 + earthquakes during continued decreases in
   wastewater injection in southern Kansas and northern Oklahoma, question
   the usefulness of the comment for understanding and managing societally
   significant earthquakes.}},

Abstract = {{In 2020 the world faced the pandemic of COVID-19 severe acute
   respiratory syndrome caused by a new type of coronavirus named
   SARS-CoV-2. To stop the spread of the disease, it is crucial to create
   molecular tools allowing the investigation, diagnoses and treatment of
   COVID-19. One of such tools are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In this
   study we describe the development of hybridoma cells that can produce
   mouse mAbs against receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)
   protein. These mAbs are able to specifically detect native and denatured
   S proteins in all tested applications, including immunoblotting,
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence staining of cells
   and immunohistochemical staining of paraffin embedded patients' tissue
   samples. In addition, we showed that the obtained mAbs can efficiently
   block SARS-CoV-2 infection in in vitro experiments. Finally, we
   determined the amino acid sequence of light and heavy chains of the
   mAbs. This information will allow the use of corresponding peptides to
   establish genetically engineered therapeutic antibodies. To date
   multiple mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been established,
   however, bigger sets of various antibodies will allow the detection and
   neutralization of SARS-CoV-2, even if the virus acquires novel
   mutations.}},

   The paper combined the exploitation of multimodal digital techniques,
   focusing a novel methodological approach aimed at integrating Immersive
   Virtual Reality (IVR) for visualization and data collection, followed
   GIS analysis, in the geological application field.
   In the present work we highlight the effectiveness of integrating
   different techniques and tools for better surveying, mapping and
   collecting data in volcanic areas. We use an Immersive Virtual Reality
   (IVR) approach for data collection, integrated with Geographic
   Information System (GIS) analysis in a well-known volcanological site in
   Santorini (Metaxa mine), a site where volcanic processes influenced the
   island's industrial development, especially with regard to pumice
   mining. Specifically, we have focused on: (i) three-dimensional (3D)
   high-resolution IVR scenario building, based on Structure from Motion
   photogrammetry (SfM) modeling; (ii) subsequent geological survey,
   mapping and data collection using IVR; (iii) data analysis, e.g.,
   calculation of extracted volumes, as well as production of new maps in a
   GIS environment using input data directly from the IVR survey; and
   finally, (iv) presentation of new outcomes that highlight the importance
   of the Metaxa Mine as a key geological and volcanological geosite.}},

Abstract = {{Transnationalism has provided an important optic for understanding
   immigrant entrepreneurship in the past three decades. However, the
   existing discourse often neglects Africa as a context for the
   articulation of immigrant entrepreneurship. Leaning on the
   constructivist epistemology with empirical base anchored in in-depth
   interviews and observational data, I explore the transnational contours
   and practices of Nigerian immigrants in Ghana and their entrepreneurial
   articulation in the country. First, I show how these immigrant
   entrepreneurs are embedded in multiple layers of transnationalism,
   namely one-way, two-way, and tripartite transnationalism. Secondly, I
   demonstrate the ways these entrepreneurial activities are embedded in
   Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) through the
   transnational economic opportunity structures it has created and are
   being exploited by the immigrants and the range of institutions,
   practices, and services that have emerged because of the existence of
   ECOWAS itself. A third dimension of transnationalism in the operation of
   Nigerian immigrant entrepreneurship in Ghana relates to labor
   recruitment through the traditional apprenticeship system, which,
   grounded in intersubjective field, crisscross the home and host
   communities. From these findings, I conclude by positioning the
   immigrants and their entrepreneurial processes as transnationally
   embedded.}},

Abstract = {{Turkish ceramics have gained a prominent place in the collections of
   many worldwide museums which are well known in the art world. Canakkale
   ceramics, which continue its production from the end of the 17th century
   until the beginning of the 20th century, are among them. These ceramics,
   known for their unique samples, have a special place in Turkish ceramic
   art with their examples in different forms in the 19th century.
   Canakkale ceramics, besides known forms such as plates, bowls and vases,
   have taken an original place in Turkish ceramic art with animal-shaped
   vessels such as horses, lions, camels and duck-headed jugs. It is
   possible to come across these ceramics with animal figures in various
   forms in museums and collections in many cities such as Istanbul Cinili
   Kosk Museum, Suna-Inan Kirac Collection, Ankara Etnografya Museum in
   Turkey. In Great Britain, these types of ceramics are in the collections
   of the Victoria and Albert Museum, British Museum, Cambridge Fitzwilliam
   Museum, Edinburg National Museum, Glasgow Burrell Collection, Oxford
   Ashmolean Museum and Durham Oriental Museum collections.
   This article focuses on the production of Canakkale ceramics with
   thirteen animal figures in the seven museum collections mentioned. In
   previous researches on the Canakkale ceramics in the international
   collections, ceramics registered in the Victoria and Albert Museum in
   the London were discussed. However, there is no known study about
   ceramics in other museums yet. It is aimed to bring new examples to the
   literature by comparing the ceramics in other museum collections with
   the examples in known publications. With this article prepared by making
   use of digital record of museums, animal figured Canakkale ceramics in
   England Museums evaluated in terms of material, technique, form and

Title = {{Non-state certification of smallholders for sustainable palm oil in
   Sumatra, Indonesia}},
Journal = {{LAND USE POLICY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{99}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Rapid expansion of oil palm plantations is one of the leading causes of
   Indonesia's continued deforestation over the past decades. To reverse
   this trend against the wave of increasing global demand for palm oil,
   non-state certification programs, such as the Roundtable on Sustainable
   Palm Oil (RSPO), have been promoted to ensure sustainable palm oil
   production. However, limited empirical studies exist for understanding
   how RSPO is perceived and practiced by various stakeholders along the
   palm oil supply chain, especially at the source by small-scale farmers.
   We surveyed 181 certified independent smallholders in two sites in
   Jambi, Sumatra to understand: (1) the challenges and benefits of
   participating in RSPO; (2) the willingness of independent smallholders
   to continue their participation; and 3) the factors affecting their
   willingness. We found that most of the challenges of RSPO certification
   are not well understood by smallholders, except the need for
   organizational support. In both sites, extensive external support from a
   local NGO was the key factor that facilitated RSPO certification. Most
   of the respondents recognize both non-financial (e.g. knowledge, market
   access, and social recognition) and financial benefits (e.g. sales from
   RSPO credits) of certification. Although overall, direct financial
   benefits may be small, they can be a motivator for farmers to continue
   with certification and for others to consider joining the group when
   disbursed equitably in non-monetary and communal form, such as in shared
   food. In contrast, indirect and long-term benefits were not enough to
   motivate smallholders to maintain RSPO certification. This study
   provides important insights about the characteristics of the leaders
   (governing members) and factors affecting RSPO participation from actual
   experiences of certified smallholders. The information can be used to
   target early adopters to initiate the RSPO process in farmers' groups
   and to develop appropriate facilitation strategies at different stages
   of certification development for independent smallholders.}},

Title = {{Episodic ground deformation associated with geothermal energy production
   at the Guayabo Caldera, Costa Rica}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{407}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{The ground response to the production of energy in geothermal fields can
   be observed in the form of ground displacement and seismic activity.
   Changes in the temperature, volume, pressure of the reservoir can
   culminate in surface deformation and in seismicity at the reservoir
   edges and/or near the production wells. Identifying the origin of the
   ground response enables controlled management of the reservoir and can
   help prevent damage to structures. Satellite remote sensing (InSAR)
   permits the study of the deformation at these sites with high spatial
   and temporal resolution. However, Central America has a dynamic
   atmosphere with considerable water vapour and constant growth of
   vegetation all year long, which leads to decorrelation between SAR
   images. Here we study the Dr. Alfredo Mainieri Protti geothermal field,
   located near Miravalles Volcano in the Northern Costa Rica volcanic arc.
   We measure the deformation associated with geothermal energy production
   using data from two satellites (ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1) between January
   2015 and January 2017. The ALOS-2 data was used to obtain the extent of
   the affected area, and two StaMPS multi-temporal methods (Persistent
   Scatter (PS) InSAR, and Small Baselines(SB)) were applied to the
   Sentinel-1 data, to obtain the temporal pattern of the ground
   displacements. Results show a direct response of the ground to the
   extraction of fluids. The pattern of deformation obtained with ALOS-2 is
   spatially correlated with the geothermal field, and with the recorded
   seismicity. Between April 2015 to October 2016, periods of uplift and
   subsidence were observed with values between-2.0 to 3.0 cm every 120
   days, linked to changes in the amount of fluids extracted from the
   reservoir. The results also show the ability of the reservoir to recover
   rapidly following a decrease in extraction rate. This work has shown
   that even in this tropical region it is possible to monitor
   anthropogenic ground motion using InSAR. This is beneficial for the
   Central American region, as satellite images are becoming more
   frequently acquired and available, and can be used to boost the
   monitoring of seismic regions, volcanic activity and anthropogenic
   activities. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Istisna' contract is a type of contract which is widely found in
   classical fiqh works and widely used among people since the period of
   the Prophet. With the development of fiqh, a wide knowledge has
   accumulated around this contract. There have been changes in the way the
   contract is applied and in its conditions based on the needs. It is seen
   that, particularly with the Majalla al-Ahkam which is adopted in the
   late periods of Ottoman Empire, the contract is widened and a preference
   is made among the case law depending on the needs of time. Today, in
   parallel with the development of Islamic finance, new financial
   techniques are under development. In this context, istisna' contract,
   which is a classical contract, has started to be popular in the field of
   Islamic finance due to the special situations it contains and is used in
   various applications. Whereas the Istisna' contract is a type of
   contract that people needed in societies where agriculture-based
   economic structure was prevalent, though not at the level of selem
   contract, it is a contract needed more in today's world where industry
   and engineering are dominant. For this, it is necessary that the
   contract is a subject of difference issues and used actively in the
   formation of new products in the field of finance. In this study, the
   account of istisna` contract as handled in the fiqh works will be
   analysed and the jurisprudence dimension of current practices will be
   tried to be studied within this framework.}},

Title = {{Fish Rescue during Streamflow Intermittency May Not Be Effective for
   Conservation of Rio Grande Silvery Minnow}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Streamflow intermittency can reshape fish assemblages and present
   challenges to recovery of imperiled species. During streamflow
   intermittency, fish can be subjected to a variety of stressors,
   including exposure to crowding, high water temperatures, and low
   dissolved oxygen, resulting in sublethal effects or mortality. Rescue of
   fishes is often used as a conservation tool to mitigate the negative
   impacts of streamflow intermittency. The effectiveness of such actions
   is rarely evaluated. Here, we use multi-year water quality data
   collected from isolated pools during rescue of Rio Grande silvery minnow
   Hybognathus amarus, an endangered minnow. We examined seasonal and diel
   water quality patterns to determine if fishes are exposed to sublethal
   and critical water temperatures or dissolved oxygen concentrations
   during streamflow intermittency. Further, we determined survival of
   rescued Rio Grande silvery minnow for 3-5 weeks post-rescue. We found
   that isolated pool temperatures were much warmer (>40 degrees C in some
   pools) compared to upstream perennial flows, and had larger diel
   fluctuations, >10 degrees C compared to similar to 5 degrees C, and many
   pools had critically low dissolved oxygen concentrations. Survival of
   fish rescued from isolated pools during warmer months was <10\%.
   Reactive conservation actions such as fish rescue are often costly, and
   in the case of Rio Grande silvery minnow, likely ineffective. Effective
   conservation of fishes threatened by streamflow intermittency should
   focus on restoring natural flow regimes that restore the natural
   processes under which fishes evolved.}},

Title = {{Assessment of Spatio-Temporal Landscape Changes from VHR Images in Three
   Different Permafrost Areas in the Western Russian Arctic}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Our study highlights the usefulness of very high resolution (VHR) images
   to detect various types of disturbances over permafrost areas using
   three example regions in different permafrost zones. The study focuses
   on detecting subtle changes in land cover classes, thermokarst water
   bodies, river dynamics, retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS) and
   infrastructure in the Yamal Peninsula, Urengoy and Pechora regions. Very
   high-resolution optical imagery (sub-meter) derived from WorldView,
   QuickBird and GeoEye in conjunction with declassified Corona images were
   involved in the analyses. The comparison of very high-resolution images
   acquired in 2003/2004 and 2016/2017 indicates a pronounced increase in
   the extent of tundra and a slight increase of land covered by water. The
   number of water bodies increased in all three regions, especially in
   discontinuous permafrost, where 14.86\% of new lakes and ponds were
   initiated between 2003 and 2017. The analysis of the evolution of two
   river channels in Yamal and Urengoy indicates the dominance of erosion
   during the last two decades. An increase of both rivers' lengths and a
   significant widening of the river channels were also observed. The
   number and total surface of RTS in the Yamal Peninsula strongly
   increased between 2004 and 2016. A mean annual headwall retreat rate of
   1.86 m/year was calculated. Extensive networks of infrastructure
   occurred in the Yamal Peninsula in the last two decades, stimulating the
   initiation of new thermokarst features. The significant warming and
   seasonal variations of the hydrologic cycle, in particular, increased
   snow water equivalent acted in favor of deepening of the active layer;
   thus, an increasing number of thermokarst lake formations.}},

   Microalgae: A Comparative Study Using Green Extraction Technologies}},
Journal = {{PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Porphyridium spp. is a debated family that produces phycoerythrin (PE)
   for use in multiple industrial applications. We compared the differences
   in the biochemical composition and phycoerythrin yield of P. cruentum
   and P. purpureum by conventional and green extraction technologies. The
   protein content in P. cruentum was 42.90 +/- 1.84\% w/w. The omega-3
   fatty acid (FA) was highlighted by eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5,
   omega-3, similar to 9.74 +/- 0.27\% FA) and arachidonic acid (ARA,
   C20:4, omega-6, similar to 18.02 +/- 0.81\% FA) represented the major
   omega-6 fatty acid. Conversely, P. purpureum demonstrated a higher lipid
   content (17.34 +/- 1.35\% w/w) and an FA profile more saturated in
   palmitic (C16:0, 29.01 +/- 0.94\% FA) and stearic acids (C18:0, 50.02
   +/- 1.72\% FA). Maceration and freeze/thaw were the conventional
   methods, whereas microwave (MW) and ultrasound (US) served as green
   procedures for PE extraction under the factorial-design methodology.
   Aqueous solvents, extraction-time and power were the main factors in the
   statistical extraction designs based on Response-Surface Methodology
   (RSM). Overall, the PE extraction yield was higher (2-to 6-fold) in P.
   cruentum than in P. purpureum. Moreover, green technologies (US > MW)
   improved the PE recovery in comparison with the conventional methods for
   both of the microalgae. The maximum PE yield (33.85 mg/g) was obtained
   under optimal US conditions (15 min and buffer solvent (PBS)) for P.
   cruentum. Finally, we proved the biochemical differences between the red
   microalgae and ratified the advantages of using green extraction for PE
   because it reduced the processing times and costs and increased the
   economic and functional-applications of bioactive compounds in the
   industry.}},

Title = {{On the use of virtual immersive reality for discrete choice experiments
   to modelling pedestrian behaviour}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHOICE MODELLING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{37}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Modelling people's behaviour is a complex task, not only because of
   their intrinsic complexity but also because of their interaction with
   the environment and other individuals. The traditional format for
   discrete choice experiments involves the use of text and images.
   However, there is a growing tendency for using tools that offer a more
   realistic representation of complex and dynamic attributes in discrete
   choice experiments. The Virtual Immersive Reality Environment (VIRE)
   emerges as a resource for a better understanding and presentation of
   variables that are difficult to understand using text-only experiments.
   Despite its advantages, VIRE experiments are costly and have additional
   complications in their practical use. This study aims to analyse the
   benefits of using VIRE in discrete choice modelling, comparing with the
   traditional text-only format with image surveys in two contexts. The
   first context considers the study of pedestrian behaviour when choosing
   alternatives for crossing an urban street. The second context deals with
   the behaviour of people during an emergency exit situation inside a
   covered sports arena. The results suggest that the assisted use of VIRE
   allows respondents to perceive environmental dynamics better than
   traditional choice experiments. VIRE adds realism and seems to improve a
   respondent's cognitive understanding of complex elements in the
   environment created by the modeller.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical lock-in prediction technique of a NACA 0012 hydrofoil,
   immersed in a flow having a Re of 3.07x10(6) is proposed in this paper.
   The technique observes the foil's response as part of a fluid-structure
   interaction analysis. The response is modelled by foil's vibration which
   is represented by spring and damper components. The technique identifies
   and predicts the foil's lock-in when it vibrates. The prediction is
   examined using the Phase Averaged Method which employs the Hilbert
   Transform Method. The aim of this paper is to propose a numerical way to
   identify a lock-in condition experienced by a NACA 0012 foil in a high
   Reynolds number flow. The foil's mechanical properties are selected and
   its motions are restricted in two modes which are in the pitch and heave
   directions. The rotational and transverse lock-in modes are identified
   in the model. The existence of lock-in is verified using pressure
   distribution plot, the history of trailing edge displacement and fluid
   regime captures. The history of total force coefficients are also shown
   to clarify the result. From the result, it can be shown that the
   technique can predict reliably the lock-in condition on the foil's
   interaction. Three main fluid induced vibration frequencies are
   generated in the interaction. None of them are similar to the foil's
   natural frequency and the phenomenon of lock-in is apparently not found
   in the typical operational condition.}},

   on criteria of significance p value <= 0.05 and fold change >= 2.0 for
   upregulated genes and fold change <= -2.0 for downregulated genes. The
   role of these genes with respect to survival of patients was validated
   through TCGA analysis. Protein-protein interaction network construction
   and network topology analysis using mathematical models revealed
   CEACAM5, SP1, USF1, CYP3A7, TMPO, ESR1, GMCL1, LMNB1, UCHL1 and CYP1B1
   as master regulators of lung cancer as a consequence of smoking.
   Functional enrichment analysis and gene ontology studies further proved
   the role of these genes in lung cancer and other pathways related to
   cancer. Among the master regulators, UCHL1 and CYP1B1 were found to be a
   potential biomarker and a promising drug targets for treating lung
   cancer. Hence inhibiting the over expression of these genes by potential
   drug molecules will ensure increase in prognosis rate of lung cancer.}},

Title = {{How to construct and validate an Integrated Socio-Economic Vulnerability
   Index: Implementation at regional scale in urban areas prone to flash
   flooding}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{746}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Flash flooding is the natural hazard provoking the largest number of
   casualties, so adequately characterizing vulnerability is key to improve
   flood risk analysis and management. Developing composite indices is the
   most widely used methodology in vulnerability analysis. However, very
   few studies have so far assessed vulnerability in urban areas prone to
   flash flooding and the resulting research presents two main drawbacks:
   i) a fragmented approach is often pursued, i.e. without jointly
   considering the vulnerability components (exposure, sensitivity and
   resilience) and the two most influential dimensions in urban
   environments (social and economic); and ii) vulnerability indices are
   not usually validated because an ancillary dataset is not generally
   available and flash flooding events do not happen simultaneously in all
   urban areas of a particular region. Considering the above gaps, this
   paper describes the construction of an Integrated Socio-Economic
   Vulnerability Index (ISEVI) at the regional scale, which considers all
   vulnerability components and social and economic dimensions. ISEVI was
   subsequently validated through an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis
   using the Monte Carlo method. Further, regional spatial patterns of
   vulnerability were identified implementing a Latent Class Cluster
   Analysis. Uncertainty analysis reveals the high stability of
   vulnerability categories of the ISEVI and sensitivity analysis shows
   that the type and the conservation state of buildings are the
   vulnerability factors that cause a greater variability in ISEVI scores.
   The method deployed here may allow specific strategies for vulnerability
   reduction to be developed based on disaggregating the validated ISEVI
   into dimensions and components and using the regional spatial patterns
   characterized. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{212}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{In the last few decades, industrialized building construction has been
   identified as the way to build with greater guarantees in terms of
   sustainability. The optimization of building components must be
   prioritized and windows have high potential for energy savings and solar
   gain use. Although the advantages of integrating phase change material
   (PCM) into glazing units have been demonstrated, studies focused on
   windows are only 8\%. Current research mainly tackles the difficulties
   for effective, reliable and practical applications of PCM. The
   functioning of PCM makes it necessary to take into account the local
   climate, the building characteristics, orientation and occupation
   profile. The objective of the present work is to design and evaluate the
   performance of an industrialized modular innovative active glazing and
   heat recovery system using PCM. First, the design and construction of
   the system focused on harnessing, storing and managing passive solar
   gains is carried out, followed by a comprehensive experimental
   comparative analysis. Savings on heating consumption in winter are up to
   48\%. The objective of harnessing solar radiation is reached and is
   reflected by a monthly consumption reduction of up to 25\%. Future
   research needs to be performed, integrating user input. (c) 2020

   provides interactive learning media with 360-degree video views. The
   first part of this paper describes the analysis, design, and
   implementation of activities in relation to the development of VirTEd.
   Later on, this paper discusses the characteristics and scope of VirTEd's
   adherence to the nature and ideas of design science research. To
   evaluate VirTEd in a real study, an experiment was conducted with 100
   second year undergraduate students at a university in Indonesia. This
   study evaluates the feasibility, effectiveness, and ability of VirTEd in
   tourism education. Usability testing on the VirTEd application was done
   to assess the capabilities of the VirTEd application. One of the
   Usability measurement tools is USE Questionnaire highlighting three main
   parameters; usefulness, satisfaction and ease of use. The results of
   this study indicated that the VirTEd application can be considered user

Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Waves in bi-ion plasmas are affected by asymmetry. The kinetic theory of
   the Maxwellian and Lorentzian/kappa-distributed bi-ion plasma is
   ameliorated to incorporate the transfer of orbital angular momentum from
   the helical electric field to the plasma modes. By operating the
   Laguerre-Gaussian function, the perturbed distribution function and
   helical electric field are decomposed into characteristic axial and
   azimuthal components. In symmetric bi-ion plasmas, the conventional ion
   modes/waves are only present if both ions have similar masses and the
   concentration of the electrons is negligible. An imbalance of the
   symmetry is considered by the contamination of a small fraction of the
   heavy immobile ions, which urges the negative ions to become heavier
   than the positive ions in the bi-ion plasma system. The distinct masses
   of the positive and negative ions provoke mass-asymmetry in the
   kappa-distributed bi-ion plasmas. The signature of the unique
   acoustic-laden twisted modes in non-Maxwellian asymmetric bi-ion plasma
   is perceived by the temperature of the lighter positive ions and the
   dynamics of the heavier negative ion. The deliberated results of Landau
   damping are displayed for distinct values of the azimuthal wave-number
   and spectral index, temperature-variation, and mass-asymmetry.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis of traffic crash severities provides significant
   information for the development of safety counter-measures. Most
   available traffic crash datasets contain rich information including
   linguistic narratives with details about crash events and contexts,
   which can reveal new insights regarding severity and associated
   causality factors. Previous research has paid insufficient attention to
   this source of information. This study proposes an approach to analyze
   traffic crash narratives to identify factors associated with high
   injury-severity levels. The proposed approach explicitly seeks global
   interpretability of the results by expanding the capabilities of the
   Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) method. Our
   proposed new approach, Global Cross-Validation LIME (GCV-LIME),
   aggregates individual LIME explanations using cross-validation. Thus,
   this study combines machine learning-based text mining with GCV-LIME to
   identify likely causality factors for injury severities while providing
   interpretability as required by traffic safety analysts. Data for heavy
   vehicle crashes collected from 2007 to 2017 in Queensland, Australia,
   were used to evaluate the proposed approach. Six different
   machine-learning models were tested, and global explanations were
   generated using GCV-LIME. The results indicated a strong association
   among a set of terms, such as ``collided\_headon,{''}
   ``side\_collided,{''} ``motorcycle,{''} ``cab,{''} and ``pedestrian{''}
   with fatal crashes. Results from GCV-LIME were compared with those
   obtained using the corresponding available tabular data and classic
   regression analysis. The comparison suggest that the proposed approach
   has great potential to provide additional insights as well as enables to
   confirm results obtained with classic analysis on tabular data. Results
   from GCV-LIME combined with knowledge and experience from safety
   analysts can help establish effective safety countermeasures based on
   factors likely causing crashes and/or increasing their severity.}},

Title = {{Performance assessment and forecasting of cyclic gas injection into a
   hydraulically fractured well using data analytics and machine learning}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{195}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Single-well application of cyclic gas injection is a promising enhanced
   oil recovery method especially in fractured and depleted reservoirs. It
   was previously shown that presence of hydraulic/natural fractures would
   increase the effectiveness of this method because of the surface area of
   fractures that supports gas diffusion into the rock matrix. Increased
   pressure and changes in the physical properties of oil after injection
   both contribute to improved oil recovery. In this study, a comprehensive
   analysis of the performance-related design aspects of kcyclic injection
   of a mixture of N-2, CO2 and CH4 in a hydraulically-fractured well is
   presented. These three types of gases can contribute to different
   mechanisms for enhanced recovery because of their unique phase behavior.
   On the other hand, their costs and availability may be different which
   may lead to different economic benefits. For the proposed analysis, a
   large number of injection scenarios were run using a compositional
   reservoir model that represents the drainage area of a hydraulically
   fractured well in a low-permeability reservoir. Design parameters such
   as the injection rate, duration (and volume), soaking duration, economic
   rate limit, and injected gas composition are varied with uniformly
   distributed values of each parameter within pre-defined ranges. Both
   volumetric and economic utilization efficiency factors are analyzed as
   the performance indicators. Discounted values of incremental oil
   produced, volume of injected gas, oil price and costs of injected gas
   for varying project periods of 5, 10, 15 and 20 years are considered for
   the efficiency calculations. It is observed that the presented method
   can be a cost-effective enhanced recovery method for
   hydraulically-fractured wells depending on the proper selection of
   operational conditions. Injection volume should be kept below 10,000 MCF
   per cycle. Economic rate limit and soaking period should be optimized.
   While N-2 is more cost effective than other gases, it mostly provides
   short-term benefits. The data set is used to train a neural network that
   can be used to forecast the economic efficiency indicator. Results show
   that machine learning is an effective approach to develop accurate
   forecasting models. R-2 values greater than 0.90 are observed for the
   correlation between real and predicted values for both training and
   testing, regardless of design considerations of the neural network.}},

Abstract = {{The present investigation elucidates the effect of different absorbing
   materials in the single slope solar still (SSSS). The said absorbing
   materials are Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) sponges, pebbles, spherical clay
   balls (SCB) and CuO nano-coated absorber plates (CuO-NCAP). The
   experiment has been conducted in the following ways: (i) SSSS with PVA
   sponges, (ii) SSSS with pebbles, (iii) SSSS with SCB, and (iv) SSSS with
   CuO-NCAP. This research also investigated the night water collection of
   all individual experiments. Four identical SSSS were designed with 0.50
   m(2) collector area each and the four absorber types were tested in the
   same climatic conditions of Chennai (13.0821 degrees N Latitude \&
   80.2702 degrees E Longitude) during the period of April to June 2018.
   Physical and chemical water quality tests were conducted for the feed
   water (well water) and treated water from the SSSS. The productivity of
   SSSS-PVA sponges, SSSS-pebbles, SSSS-SCB and SSSS with CuO-NCAP are 1.9
   L/m(2).day, 2.8 L/m(2).day, 2.6 L/m(2).day, and 2.9 L/m(2).day
   respectively. The cost of water distilled by SSSS with PVA sponges was
   approximately \$0.0120/L. Similarly, it was \$0.0073/L for SSSS with
   pebbles, \$0.0080/L for SSSS with SCB and \$0.0077/L for SSSS with

Title = {{Effect of visual stimuli on the subjective impression of pass-by sound
   transmitted into low-rise residential building}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ACOUSTICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{169}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The effect of additionally presented visual stimuli on the subjective
   impression of the vehicle pass-by sound transmitted into a low-rise
   residential building was investigated based on the environmental
   simulation method combining the binaural sound auralization technieque
   and the three-dimensional spatial visualization technique. The exterior
   scenery seen from inside a residential room largely depends on the
   spatial relationship with the neighborring buildings and driveways
   around the evaluated site. In addition, the exterior scenery generally
   includes the pass-by vehicles running on the neighborring driveways,
   which are often the main source of the sound environment around the
   site. In this study, the variation of subjective impression of a vehicle
   pass-by sound caused by presenting various kinds of visual stimuli seen
   from the window of a residential room was discussed. As a basic study,
   the vehicle pass-by sound transmitted into the room via the facade was
   simulated by using the geometrical acoustic simulation. To increase the
   presence of the reproduced sounds, the auralized sounds were reproduced
   by dynamically changing the binaural room impulse response (BRIR)
   depending on the head rotation of the subjects. In contrast, the visual
   condition inside the evaluated rooms was simulated by using
   three-dimensional modeling software. Then, the effect of the auditory
   and visual stimuli on the impression of the environments inside a
   residential room was investigated by performing the subjective
   evaluation experiment based on the audiovisual simulation scheme. The
   obtained results indicated that the sound impression of the pass-by
   noise transmitted into the room was influenced by the additionally
   presented visual stimuli, but the extent of the influence on the
   impression differs depending on the detailed information included in the
   auditory and visual stimuli. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objective: The motor is the base of learning and mental
   processes. This shows the importance of motor impairment in people with
   specific learning disorder. The purpose of this study is to compare the
   grasping, pulling\& releasing movements in children with specific
   learning disorder with normal children. Materials and Methods: The
   present study is descriptive, casual comparative (post facto), in terms
   of its methodology. The study population includes all elementary school
   students in Tehran, studying in the academic year of 2014-15. A sample
   of 40 children with specific learning disorder and 40 normal children is
   selected using available sampling method. Subjects are homogenized in
   terms of age and grade. Then the researcher-made test of fundamental
   movement is administered on them. Data are analyzed using multivariate
   analysis of variance. Results: The findings show a significant
   difference in the grasping, pulling\& releasing movements between two
   groups. According to the findings, it can be concluded that the
   grasping, pulling\& releasing movements of children with specific
   learning disorder are defective compared to normal children. Conclusion:
   The first behavioral response of the child is a type of movement that is
   significant in the learning process. The fundamental movements of
   children with specific learning disorder are much different from that of
   normal children, the rehabilitation of which can improve the focus and
   attention of these children. Findings of the present study can be useful
   to psychologists, families and schools.}},

Abstract = {{Ensuring the stability and integrity of underground gas storage salt
   caverns is a very complicated subject due to the non-linear and
   time-dependent behavior of rock salts under complicated thermal and
   mechanical loading conditions. For this reason, pressure and temperature
   fluctuations in the caverns and their surrounding strata must be
   integrated into the analysis and the numerical tools that are used for
   this purpose. LOCAS, a 2D axisymmetric finite-element code, dedicated to
   the stability analysis of underground salt spaces, was applied to assess
   the effects of various operating and geometrical parameters on the
   cavern behavior. In this paper, we aimed to give an overall assessment
   of the behavior of the salt caverns used for natural gas storage. In
   this work, some specific loading scenarios were considered first,
   followed by thorough parametric and sensitivity analyses to reveal the
   impacts of the geometrical parameters and operational parameters
   involved on the behavior of salt caverns using the modern stability
   criteria. The findings showed that the onset of dilation was more likely
   to happen within the first cavern life cycle when pressure dropped to
   the minimum level. As for the potential of tension occurrence in the
   surrounding rock, this is more likely to happen by increasing the number
   of operation cycles, especially in the upper one-third of the cavern
   wall. Finally, it was seen that the cavern depth and minimum cavern
   internal pressure had even more important influences than the others on
   the salt cavern behavior.}},

Title = {{Propensity toward ride-sourcing: Desired savings in travel time and
   mobility cost to switch from private mobility}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{121}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a study in examining the desired savings in travel
   time per trip and travel cost per month that would motivate people to
   switch to ride-sourcing options. Simultaneous regression models with
   latent constructs were employed to estimate the expected time and cost
   savings. The presence of latent constructs accounts for the endogeneity
   in personal attitudes while the simultaneity allows the analyst to
   evaluate the potential correlation between the two decisions. Various
   socioeconomic and demographic variables and personal attitudes were
   explored in the model to investigate their potential influence on the
   willingness to adopt ride-sourcing. Analysis based on the survey data
   indicated an average desired time saving of 20 min per trip, and an
   average desired cost saving of \$116 per month to switch to on-demand
   services. Accordingly, individuals younger than 25 years old, between 55
   and 59, those with lower education levels, Asians, low income
   individuals, people with previous ride-sourcing experience, and those
   who did not favor private car ownership showed lower expectations in
   view of both travel time and travel cost savings and therefore, were
   more willing to adopt on-demand services. On the contrary, people aged
   30-39 years old (older Millennials), highly auto-dependent individuals,
   self-employed, people who hardly trust strangers, and those who value
   private ownership advantages such as privacy and convenience would
   demand higher savings to convince them to adopt ride-sourcing. This
   study provides an approach to evaluating the propensity of ride-sourcing
   usage in view of the desired travel time and cost savings. A better
   understanding on the magnitude of time and cost savings needed to
   motivate the public to switch to ride-sourcing options would provide
   policy makers with valuable information in designing effective and
   efficient policies and strategies in promoting shared mobility options.}},

Abstract = {{Aims To compare microaneurysm (MA) counts using ultrawide field colour
   images (UWF-CI) and ultrawide field fluorescein angiography (UWF-FA).
   Methods Retrospective study including patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes
   mellitus receiving UWF-FA and UWF-CI within 2 weeks. MAs were manually
   counted in individual Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)
   and extended UWF zones. Fields with MAs >= 20 determined diabetic
   retinopathy (DR) severity (0 fields=mild, 1-3=moderate, >= 4=severe).
   UWF-FA and UWF-CI agreement was determined and UWF-CI DR severity
   sensitivity analysis adjusting for UWF-FA MA counts performed.
   Results In 193 patients (288 eyes), 2.4\% had no DR, 29.9\% mild
   non-proliferative DR (NPDR), 32.6\% moderate (NPDR), 22.9\% severe NPDR
   and 12.2\% proliferative DR. UWF-FA MA counts were 3.5-fold higher
   (p<0.001) than UWF-CI counts overall, 3.2x-fold higher in ETDRS fields
   (p<0.001) and 5.3-fold higher in extended ETDRS fields (p<0.001) and
   higher in type 1 versus type 2 diabetes (p<0.001). In eyes with NPDR on
   UWF-CI (n=246), UWF-FA images had 1.6x-3.5x more fields with >= 20 MAs
   (p<0.001). Fair agreement existed between imaging modalities
   (k=0.221-0.416). In ETDRS fields, DR severity agreement increased from
   k=0.346 to 0.600 when dividing UWF-FA counts by a factor of 3, followed
   by rapid decline in agreement thereafter. Total UWF area agreement
   increased from k=0.317 to 0.565 with an adjustment factor of either 4 or
   5.
   Conclusions UWF-FA detects threefold to fivefold more MAs than UWF-CI
   and identifies 1.6-3.5-fold more fields affecting DR severity.
   Differences exist at all DR severity levels, thus limiting direct
   comparison between the modalities. However, correcting UWF-FA MA counts
   substantially improves DR severity agreement between the modalities.}},

   curvidens as a food flavoring agent for years, few studies have been
   conducted on its phytochemical and biological properties. The chemical
   constituents of N. curvidens essential oil and then its biological
   properties were studied in detail in this investigation. N. curvidens
   essential oil was prepared from the aerial parts of the plant using the
   hydrodistillation method and its chemical composition was analyzed by
   the GC-MS method. Antimicrobial, antifungal, anti-Leishmania, and
   cytotoxic activities of the essential oil were investigated in vitro. In
   addition, antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated
   in vivo. Most of N. curvidens essential oil compositions are composed of
   trans-caryophyllene (17.53\%), allo-spathulenol (13.41\%), germacrene D
   (10.12\%), bicyclogermacrene (9.36\%), alpha-pinene (9.12\%), and
   beta-phellandrene (6.87\%). The highest antimicrobial and antifungal
   effects were observed against L. monocytogenes (MIC=156.25 mg/ml) and K.
   marxianus (MIC=625 mu g/ml), respectively. Concentration-dependent
   effects were detected in the treatment of L. major, so that the number
   of macrophages infected with amastigote dropped significantly with
   higher concentrations. The essential oil showed the highest effect on
   the lung cancer cell line (A549) with the lowest IC50 (133.2 mu g/mL).
   The most resistant cell line to the essential oil was bladder cancer
   (C450) with an IC50 of 430.69 mu g/mL. SI 19.49 index indicated high
   immunity of the essential oil on macrophage lines. Compared with
   morphine analgesic, the highest pain control effect of the essential oil
   was observed in primary and secondary phases at 100 mg/kg concentration
   in rats. At 100 mu g/kg concentration, reduced swelling of the paw and
   ear was observed in mice compared to the dexamethasone anti-inflammatory
   drug. The essential oil presents remarkable therapeutic properties such
   as antifungal, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory properties that probably
   attributed to the presence of an important trans-caryophyllene compound.
   Outstandingly, the essential oil has low toxic effects on the normal
   line and high antitumor properties against cancer cells. Therefore, it
   is expected to be used in the preparation of less toxic drugs than
   chemical ones, although more studies are required. (c) 2020 SAAB.

   subdiffusion equation with Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative whose
   elliptic part has the most general form and is defined in an arbitrary

   method is used to prove theorems on the existence and uniqueness of the
   classical solution of the initial-boundary value problem and on the
   unique reconstruction of the unknown right-hand side of the equation.
   The concept of generalized solution is introduced and a theorem on its
   existence is proved. The stability of classical and generalized
   solutions is proved. Requirements for the initial function and for the
   additional condition are established under which the classical Fourier
   method can be applied to the inverse problem under consideration. The
   results obtained are also new for the classical diffusion equation.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: Intestinal pathotypes of Escherichia coli
   belong to the companion animals may poses potential risk to public
   health following zoonotic transmission. Therefore, this study was
   proposed to determine the virulence genes associated to diarrheagenic E.
   coli strains isolated from healthy pet dogs and their owners in the
   southeast of Iran, Kerman province.
   Materials and Methods: Totally 168 E. coli isolates were collected from
   49 healthy household dogs and their owners. Seventy isolates were
   obtained from non-pet owners as control group. Presence or absence of
   the virulence genes including eae, stx1, stx2, st1, lt1, ipaH, cnf1 and
   cnf2 were screened by conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
   dissemination pattern of the genes were studied among the various hosts.
   Results: PCR examinations showed that the most frequent virulence gene
   was ipaH (6.1\%) in dogs followed by eae in dog owners (6.1\%) and in
   controls (8.6\%). The most frequent pathotypes in dogs, their owners and
   controls were EIEC (6.1\%), EHEC (4.08\%) and EPEC (8.5\%),
   respectively. In one of studied houses, both of dog and its owner
   harbored E. coli strains with same virulence profile (stx1/eae) and
   pathotype (EHEC).
   Conclusion: These results collectively indicate that healthy household
   dogs probably are the mild reservoir of potential virulent E. coli
   strains with possible active transmission to their contact owner.
   However, even non-pet owners seemed to be a notable source of intestinal
   pathotypes, especially EPEC, for their environment. Transmission of E.
   coli pathotypes may occurs by direct contact with the reservoirs or
   ingestion of contaminated food. These pathotypes are potentially
   virulent and creates public health hazards. Further studies are needed
   for better understanding of dissemination mechanisms of E. coli
   pathotypes among humans and their pets.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the role of early modern letters of recommendation

   ``global microhistory{''} of Thomas Vanandets'i, an Armenian archbishop
   and printer who set up an Armenian printing press in Amsterdam in 1695
   following his travels there from the South Caucasus. By examining the
   archbishop's multilingual letters of recommendation that paved his
   journey, the paper sheds light not only on how Armenians traveled across
   the many worlds of their early modern diaspora but also more generally
   on the question of how the ubiquitous yet understudied genre of the
   letter of recommendation served as the ``quintessential locus of

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{Background: Computed tomography (CT) is commonly used in children with
   mild head injuries. People in Japan are concerned about radiation
   exposure and radiation-induced cancer because of the Fukushima Daiichi
   Nuclear Power Plant accident on March 11, 2011. This study investigated
   whether the accident influenced the use of CT in children with mild head
   injuries.
   Methods: Using the Japan Medical Data Center database, we identified
   patients aged <= 15 years visiting hospitals because of mild head
   injuries from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2013. We excluded
   patients who were admitted to the hospital or received other medical
   examinations. Regression discontinuity analysis was used to compare
   proportions of patients undergoing head CT and having clinically
   important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) overlooked before versus after
   the accident, adjusting for patient characteristics, secular trends, and
   hospital effect.
   Results: Eligible patients (n = 40,440) were classified as visiting the
   hospital before (n = 11,659) or after (n = 28,781) the accident. The
   regression discontinuity analysis showed that the accident was
   associated with a reduction in the proportion of patients undergoing
   head CT (odds ratio {[}OR] 0.73; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI],
   0.63-0.86), whereas the accident was not associated with an increase in
   cases where ciTBE was overlooked (OR 0.72; 95\% CI, 0.13-4.00).
   Conclusions: The use of CT in children with mild head injuries declined
   after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. Improving
   awareness of radiation exposure risks among patients and physicians
   could reduce unnecessary CT.}},

Journal = {{PEDIATRIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: While parental education and family socioeconomic status
   (SES) are associated with an increase in children's cognitive
   functioning, and less is known about racial variation in these effects.
   Minorities' Diminished Returns (MDRs) suggest that, under racism and
   social stratification, family SES and particularly parental education
   show weaker effects on children's tangible outcomes for marginalized,
   racialized, and minoritized families, particularly Blacks, compared to
   Whites. Aim: We conducted this study to compare the effect of parental
   education on children's mental rotation abilities, as an important
   aspect of cognitive function, by race. Methods: This cross-sectional
   study included 11,135 9-10-year-old American children. Data came from
   baseline of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. The
   independent variable was parental education. The dependent variable,
   mental rotation, was measured by the Little Man Task. Ethnicity, gender,
   age, marital status, and household income were the covariates. Results:
   Parental education was positively associated with mental rotation.
   However, parental education showed a weaker association with mental
   rotation in Black than in White families. This was documented by a
   significant interaction between race and parental education on
   children's efficiency score. Conclusion: Parental education shows a
   weaker correlation with mental rotation of Black rather than White
   children, which is probably because of racism, social stratification,
   and discrimination. This finding is in line with the MDRs phenomenon and
   suggests that marginalization and racism may interfere with the
   influences of parental assets and resources and Black American
   children's development.}},

Abstract = {{Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a potentially distressing corollary of
   drug interventions, and may result in discomfort, debilitating illness,
   or even death. Existing research predominantly considers only a single
   level of interaction; however, serious health complications may result
   from multi-pathway DDIs, and so new methods are needed to enable
   predicting and preventing complex DDIs. This article introduces a novel
   method for the prediction of DDIs at two pharmacological levels
   (metabolic and transporter interactions) by means of a rule-based model
   implemented with Semantic Web technologies. The chemotherapy agent
   irinotecan is used as a case study for demonstrating the validity of
   this approach. Mechanistic and interaction data were mined from
   available sources and then used to predict interactors of irinotecan,
   including potential DDIs mediated by previously unidentified mechanisms.
   The findings also draw attention to the profound variation between DDI
   resources, indicating that clinical practice would see significant value
   from the development of an evidence-based resource to support DDI
   identification. (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on

Abstract = {{We examine the impact of Australia's Remuneration Amendment Act 2011 on
   CEO compensation and its spill-over effect on cash holdings to better
   understand how the new legislation affects the principal-agent
   relationship. Using a sample of ASX top 300 firms from 2004 to 2015, we
   find that the Act leads to more use of equity-based compensation. We
   also document that, after the introduction of the Act, CEO equity-based
   and total compensations are negatively related with cash holdings, i.e.,
   more equity and total compensations lead to lower cash holdings (a
   spill-over effect), indicating alignment of the principal-agent
   interests. Our results are robust to different estimation techniques.
   Our findings confirm that the Act is effective in driving a more
   efficient CEO pay strucure and provide important insights for the global

Title = {{Animal Welfare and Meat Quality Assessment in Gas Stunning during
   Commercial Slaughter of Pigs Using Hypercapnic-Hypoxia (20\% CO2 2\%
   O-2) Compared to Acute Hypercapnia (90\% CO2 in Air)}},
Journal = {{ANIMALS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Simple Summary
   Animals must be stunned before slaughter to avoid fear, pain, and
   distress. In pigs, the most extensively used method is exposure to
   hypercapnia (high (>80\%) concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2)).
   However, it produces irritation of the mucosa and a sense of
   breathlessness, reducing the welfare before slaughter. We investigated
   whether using hypercapnic-hypoxia (20\% CO2 and less than 2\% O-2)
   reduced aversion and discomfort compared to hypercapnia, and whether the
   quality of the stunning was adequate, meaning that no animals regain
   conscious after stunning. Moreover, we compared the impact of both
   stunning gases for meat and carcass quality. Our results suggest that
   both gases provoked aversion and discomfort, but these were lower in
   pigs stunned with the N-2 mixture compared to high CO2. On the other
   hand, the stun quality of the N-2 mixture was poorer than high CO2
   stunning, given that more animals regained consciousness before sticking
   with the N-2 gas mixture. The stunning quality of the N-2 mixture,
   however, was improved when oxygen concentration was below 2\%. Meat
   quality was slightly poorer in N-2 stunning compared to high CO2, with a
   higher percentage of carcasses showing pale, soft, and exudative pork.
   This study assessed aversion, stunning effectiveness, and product
   quality of nitrogen and carbon dioxide (CO2) mixtures used for stunning
   pigs. A total of 1852 slaughter pigs divided into two similar batches
   was assessed during routine slaughter in a Swedish commercial abattoir
   using either hypercapnic-hypoxia (20\% CO2 and less than 2\% O-2; 20C2O)
   or hypercapnia (90\% CO2; 90C) gas mixtures. Behavioral indicators of
   aversion and discomfort were recorded. After exposure, the stunning
   quality was assessed through brainstem reflexes. After slaughter, the pH
   and electric conductivity of carcasses were assessed to estimate the
   incidence of pale, soft, and exudative (PSE) pork, and the presence of
   ecchymosis were inspected. Compared to 90C, pigs exposed to 20C2O showed
   a later (p < 0.05) onset of behaviors indicative of aversion, and a
   lower (p < 0.01) incidence of breathlessness. However, unconsciousness
   (i.e., losing posture) appeared earlier (p < 0.01) in 90C compared to
   20C2O. In 90C, all (100\%) pigs were adequately stunned, whereas in
   20C2O a 7.4\% of pigs showed signs of poor stunning, especially when
   oxygen concentrations were >2\% (p < 0.001). The percentage of PSE
   carcasses was higher (p < 0.01) in 20C2O than 90C. In conclusion,
   compared to 90C, 20C2O reduced aversion and discomfort but showed lower
   stun effectiveness, especially when O-2 was above 2\%, and a slightly
   poorer pork quality.}},

Abstract = {{This paper concerns a problem that has received insufficient analysis in
   the philosophical literature so far: the conditions under which an
   information-bearing state - say a perception or recollection - yields
   belief. The paper distinguishes between belief and a psychological
   property easily conflated with belief, illustrates the tendency of
   philosophers to overlook this distinction, and offers a positive
   conception of the mind's information-responsiveness that requires far
   less belief-formation - and far less formation of other propositional
   attitudes - than has been commonly supposed to be produced by perception
   and other experiences. This conception is clarified by a partial sketch
   of the natural economy of mind. The paper then considers two important
   questions the conception raises. Does it force us to abandon the
   venerable belief-desire conception of intentional action, and does it
   require expanding the domain of intellectual responsibility and thereby
   our conception of epistemic virtue?}},

Abstract = {{This article presents the wartime state in the local context and looks
   at how the daily activity of local courts and police changed
   dramatically during the wartime period. It also assesses the complex
   role that police and local courtrooms played with regards to ethnicity
   and nationalism. The increasing authority of local courtrooms and the
   enhanced powers of policing, I argue, amplified the role of the state in
   certain aspects of London life, but reduced it in others. New demands on
   local courtrooms and policing could only be accommodated by the
   redirection of their efforts from pre-war priorities. The traditional
   roles of the police in addressing `moral' crimes such as public
   drunkenness and gambling declined dramatically as policy redirected
   police resources towards the enforcement of wartime regulations, the
   support of military conscription and discipline, and the policing of
   immigrant communities and ethnic minorities, and of `enemy aliens' in
   particular. Although the balance of power in the latter case was highly
   asymmetrical, those brought before the courtroom on accusations of being
   `outsiders' or `enemies' in the national community were not entirely
   without recourse. The public nature of courtrooms meant that, in some
   circumstances, they could become sites for the affirmation of rights and
   national belonging in wartime Britain, rather vehicles for their
   abrogation.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) genotypes are known to
   be associated with development of acute respiratory distress syndrome
   (ARDS) and resultant mortality. In the present study, we examined the
   association between distribution frequency of ACE genotypes and COVID-19
   mortality.
   Methods: We undertook an ecological study to examine the association
   between ACE genotypes and COVID-19 mortality across 25 countries to
   represent different geographical regions of the world. The population
   frequencies of ACE genotypes were drawn from previously published
   reports and data on COVID-19-related mortality were extracted from
   `Worldometer'. Multivariable analyses were also undertaken adjusting for
   age (median age), sex (percentage of females) and the number of COVID-19
   tests undertaken. Associations between genotypes deletion/deletion (DD)
   and insertion/insertion (II) prevalence and COVID-19-related mortality
   (per million people per day since the first diagnosed case) were
   evaluated.
   Results: The frequency of II genotype is highest in east Asian countries
   and lower among the European and African countries. An inverse
   geographical distribution frequency was noted for DD genotype.
   Increasing II genotype frequency was significantly associated with
   decreased COVID-19 mortality rates (adjusted incident rate ratio {[}IRR]
   0.3, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 0.002-0.7, p =0.03). However, no
   association was found between DD genotype frequency and COVID-19
   mortality rates (adjusted IRR 4.3, 95\% CI: 0.541.2, p =0.2).
   Conclusions: Distribution frequency of ACE insertion/insertion (II)
   genotype may have a significant influence on COVID-19 mortality. This
   information has potential utility for resource planning at a systemic
   level, as well as for clinical management. (C) 2020 The British

   glioblastoma. We recapitulated the immunosuppression observed in
   glioblastoma patients in the C57BL/6 mouse and investigated the
   aetiology of low CD4 T-cell counts. We determined that thymic involution
   was a hallmark feature of immunosuppression in three distinct models of
   brain cancer, including mice harbouring GL261 glioma, B16 melanoma, and
   in a spontaneous model of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. In addition
   to thymic involution, we determined that tumour growth in the brain
   induced significant splenic involution, reductions in peripheral T
   cells, reduced MHC II expression on blood leucocytes, and a modest
   increase in bone marrow resident CD4 T cells. Using parabiosis we report
   that thymic involution, declines in peripheral T-cell counts, and
   reduced major histocompatibility complex class II expression levels were
   mediated through circulating blood-derived factors. Conversely, T-cell
   sequestration in the bone marrow was not governed through circulating
   factors. Serum isolated from glioma-bearing mice potently inhibited
   proliferation and functions of T cells both in vitro and in vivo.
   Interestingly, the factor responsible for immunosuppression in serum is
   non-steroidal and of high molecular weight. Through further analysis of
   neurological disease models, we determined that the immunosuppression
   was not unique to cancer itself, but rather occurs in response to brain
   injury. Non-cancerous acute neurological insults also induced
   significant thymic involution and rendered serum immunosuppressive. Both
   thymic involution and serum-derived immunosuppression were reversible
   upon clearance of brain insults. These findings demonstrate that brain
   cancers cause multifaceted immunosuppression and pinpoint circulating
   factors as a target of intervention to restore immunity.}},

Abstract = {{Background:
   Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, is a nonfermentative, aerobic,
   Gram-negative bacilli which is intrinsically resistance to several
   antibiotics. Treatment options for this bacteria are quite different
   from the other Gram-negative bacilli, which can represent a therapeutic
   challenge. To initiate appropriate empiric treatment and to reduce
   mortality, differentiation of S. maltophilia from other Gram-negative
   bacteria is critically important. The aim of this study is to
   distinguish the risk factors of S. maltophilia blood stream infections
   (BSI) from other Gram-negative BSI.
   Methods:
   This was a retrospective, case-control study. Patients with S.
   maltophilia BSI were selected as cases and patients with non-S.
   maltophilia Gram-negative BSI were selected as controls. Demographic and
   clinical characteristics of patients were recorded.
   Results:
   Forty-eight cases with S. maltophilia BSI and 144 controls were enrolled
   in the study. Risk factors for S. maltophilia BSI compared with the
   control group includes prior use of antibiotics, especially carbapenem,
   pediatric intensive care unit stay, mechanical ventilator use,
   indwelling catheters and duration of hospitalization.
   Conclusions:
   Breakthrough infection by S. maltophilia can occur in severely ill
   patients being treated with carbapenem. In the presence of risk factors,
   to reduce morbidity and mortality, S. maltophilia should be kept in mind
   when starting empiric treatment.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, aluminum titanate (Al2TiO5)-based nanostructure with the
   outstanding photocatalytic performance was prepared via the simple
   citrate sol-gel method. The effects of thee operational variables such
   as pH, temperature, catalyst dosage, and initial dye concentration on
   the photodegradation efficiency of methylene blue (MB) were explored in
   some details. The results showed that compared to TiO2, AT benefits a
   superior photocatalytic activity due to its narrow band gap (2.88 eV)
   and low recombination rate of charge carriers. Increasing the wastewater
   temperature from 25 to 60 degrees C can improve the degradation percent
   from 22.15 to 52\%. Based on the thermokinetic calculations, the
   Arrhenius activation energy, Delta H, and Delta S values were also
   estimated as +24.69 kJ mol(-1), 21.78 J mol(-1), and 222.48 J
   K-1.mole(-1), respectively. According to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood
   kinetic model, the photocatalyst follows a first-order equation in a
   wide range of temperatures. In addition, escalating the pH value from 4
   to 9.5 may noticeably enhance the photodegradation efficiency from 7.1
   to 46.6\%. The enhanced photocatalytic activity at alkaline media was
   mainly attributed to the excessive generation of hydroxyl ions, improved
   adsorption of cationic dye on the catalyst surfaces, and effective
   separation of involved charge carriers. The maximum performance was
   obtained for the AT dosage of 20 mg/lit and MB concentration of 2.5
   mg/lit. Finally, the recycling experiments after 6 runs verified the
   high stability of the photocatalyst.}},

Abstract = {{The baryogenesis presents the theoretical mechanism that describes the

   teleparallel equivalent to the Gauss-Bonnet term respectively) and f(T,
   B) (where B denotes the boundary term between torsion and Ricci scalar)
   gravities. For f(T, T-G)-gravity, we consider two generic power law
   models while logarithmic and general Taylor expansion models for f(T,

   compute baryon to entropy ratio by assuming that the universe filled by
   perfect fluid and dark energy. We find generalized baryogenesis
   interaction which is proportional to partial derivative(mu)f (T + T-G)
   and partial derivative(mu)f (T + B) for both theories of gravity. We

Abstract = {{This study examines the drivers and implementation of intrapreneurship
   strategy in a property service company. Using a qualitative case study
   approach, the study interviewed four managers involved in related
   intrapreneurship initiatives. The data was validated by an expert and a
   practitioner from a different company. The implementation of the
   company's intrapreneurship strategy is limited to improving new ways of
   working and developing products and services. However, business
   development and the creation of new business models are still limited.
   From several intrapreneurship driving factors, it was observed that the
   company practices are considered adequate with regard to top management
   support, leadership, flexibility in carrying out work, as well as in
   fairly harmonious arrangements for ongoing business relationships with
   the intrapreneurship projects. On the other hand, human resources with
   entrepreneurial behavior are still minimal. Similarly, the driving
   factors in reward and training that promote entrepreneurial behavior are
   also considered to be insufficient. The application of intrapreneurship
   as a strategy requires understanding and commitment from all parties in
   the organization. This study provides insight into the Indonesian
   context and proposes that intrapreneurship initiatives are less likely
   to succeed if they are not supported by developing a more systematic
   entrepreneurial mindset, behavior, and culture.}},

   Patients Undergoing Spine Surgery}},
Journal = {{WORLD NEUROSURGERY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{144}},
Pages = {{E221-E226}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Interhospital patient transfer (IHT) of patients is common
   and accounts for a significant portion of health care costs, yet the
   variables driving neurosurgical IHT have not been systematically
   described. We analyzed variables that distinguished spine surgery
   patients who underwent IHT from patients who did not undergo IHT to
   report on the effect of frailty on IHT.
   METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed to collect data on
   consecutive patients undergoing spinal procedures during 2015-2017. IHT
   patients were identified and compared with non-interhospital patient
   transfer (n-IHT) patients to identify factors that distinguished the 2
   patient groups using multivariate regression analysis. Studied variables
   included case complexity, frailty (modified frailty index), age,
   insurance status, and baseline demographic variables. Postoperative
   outcomes affected by transfer status were identified in binary
   regression analysis.
   RESULTS: During 2015-2017, there were 595 n-IHT and 76 IHT spine surgery
   patients (N = 671). Increased frailty (modified frailty index >= 3; odds
   ratio = 2.4, P = 0.01) and increased spine surgery complexity (spine
   surgery complexity score >= 2; odds ratio = 2.57, P = 0.002) were
   independent risk factors associated with IHT. IHT was an independent
   risk factor for increased hospital length of stay and increased
   postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo scale; P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: IHT patients comprise a more frail and surgically complex
   surgical spine population compared with n-IHT patients. IHT was also an
   independent risk factor for increased complications and length of stay
   after spine surgery. Patients' insurance status and age did not
   distinguish between IHT and n-IHT groups. This is the first report in
   any specialty to demonstrate increasing frailty is associated with IHT.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The appropriate disposal practice of unused and expired medications has
   become a global challenge that has caught the attention of health
   policymakers, pharmaceutical organizations, healthcare professionals,
   and the wider community. The current study aimed to evaluate the
   awareness, attitudes, and behaviors relating to the disposal practice of
   unused and expired medications and medication wastage issues among the
   general public in Selangor, Malaysia. The quantitative, cross-sectional
   study was conducted using a pre-validated structured survey form. Among
   the approached individuals, 426 showed their willingness to participate
   in the study. More than 80\% of the study population reported being
   aware of the medication wastage issue and its impact on patients and the
   economy. The respondents with a higher level of education (OR = 1.85;
   95\% CI = 1.18-2.52; p < 0.003) were more likely to be cognizant of the
   detrimental consequences of inappropriate waste disposal. The female
   respondents were more likely to report comprehending that the
   availability of free healthcare resources is contributing to medication
   waste (OR = 1.33, 95\% CI = 1.015-2.34; p < 0.005). The majority of
   respondents reported throwing away unused medications (202; 47.4\%) and
   expired medications (362; 84.9\%) in the garbage. The respondents
   believed that the provision of appropriate directions by healthcare
   professionals (312; 73.2\%) and prescribing/dispensing medications in
   quantities for the duration that ensures patient adherence (114; 26.7\%)
   could minimize medication wastage. The Ministry of Health (258; 60.5\%),
   pharmaceutical organizations (212; 49.7\%), and pharmacists (193;
   45.3\%) were the respondents' perceived responsible sources of
   information. The current findings reported that respondents were
   familiar that inappropriate practices of medication wastage might have
   harmful consequences. However, a gap exists between their awareness and
   practice, and the disposal approaches practiced by the respondents were
   generally not appropriate.}},

Abstract = {{The use of mobile devices in education is becoming standardized at the
   higher education stage. However, it is necessary to evaluate good
   teaching practices of mobile learning (m-learning) in order to set
   proper application of mobile devices and favourable learning outcomes
   for students. The purposes of this paper were, on the one hand, to
   determine the degree of implementation of m-learning and good teaching
   practices in Spanish universities; on the other hand, to know the causes
   that lead university professors not to integrate mobile devices and to
   determine the socio-demographic factors that influence the development
   of good teaching practices of m-learning. In relation to the researching
   method, it was used a quantitative approach focused on the
   implementation of an online survey. A total of 1544 university
   professors attached to the Faculties of Education throughout Spain, aged
   between 20 and 77, participated in the study (M = 45.29; SD = 10.45).
   The results obtained revealed that: 1) More than 70\% of Spanish
   university professors use mobile devices in the classroom; 2) The main
   reasons whereby mobile devices are not used in the classroom are
   ignored, belief that they are a distraction, resistance to change and
   perceived uselessness; 3) Only 39.56\% carried out good teaching
   practices; 4) The main and possible influential factors good teaching
   practices of m-learning were professional category, line of research in
   educational technology, other teaching innovations, believes in the
   adequacy of mobile devices and the expansion of m-learning in the coming
   years. Finally, the practical implications of this study are discussed,
   highlighting the wealth of collected data from this pioneering research
   on the evaluation of good teaching practices of m-learning.}},

Title = {{Visual attention patterns during online video-mediated interaction in
   socially anxious individuals}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BEHAVIOR THERAPY AND EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{69}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background and objectives: These days, a growing number of social
   interactions occur through video-mediated communication (VMC). However,
   little is known about how socially anxious individuals use this
   technology. Here, we examined the visual attention patterns of high and
   low socially anxious individuals during a live interaction with a study
   confederate using a typical online VMC setup.
   Methods: High (n = 30) and low (n = 30) socially anxious participants
   completed a VMC-based social interaction task comprised of two parts: A
   one-on-one acquaintance interview followed by a one-on-one short
   presentation assignment. State anxiety was measured before and after the
   task, and gaze data was collected throughout.
   Results: High socially anxious participants experienced elevated anxiety
   following the interaction task, whereas no elevation was observed for
   low socially anxious participants. Gaze data revealed that high socially
   anxious participants dwelled longer on the confederate's image during
   the acquaintance interview compared with the presentation task, and
   dwelled longer on non-face areas during the presentation relative to
   during the acquaintance interview. This task-related gaze pattern was
   not observed among low socially anxious participants.
   Limitations: An analog sample was used in this study and future research
   should replicate its findings in a clinical sample. Future studies may
   also wish to counterbalance confederate's gender and task order across
   participants.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that during VMC, socially anxious
   individuals observe their environment differently than non-socially
   anxious individuals, depending on the context of the interaction. This
   context-dependency might help explain mixed findings in previous
   studies. Further theoretical implications of these findings are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the profitability of investment in refinery building is
   examined and the effects of the model on each agent are considered,
   using a multi-agent method. This model covers the knowledge gap in the
   literature by investigating a comprehensive situation that is currently
   a part of strategic energy plans in developing countries. Deploying
   refineries in Iran is desirable due to the high level of gasoline
   consumption in comparison with the internal production. Given the scale
   of the required investments and their high risks, private investors are
   unwilling to invest. The main objective of governments is to provide
   investors the needed information so that they can decide logically about
   investment based on it. Using a game theory approach, this paper reveals
   significant concerns from the investment point of view with implications
   for the future of the gasoline industry. The Stackelberg game theory
   with three phases is applied to conduct our analysis. The current paper
   demonstrates that by determining the amount of subsidies and
   intermediate producers' production, governments can reassure investors
   that their investments will be profitable. A sensitivity analysis and a
   numerical example are presented to validate the proposed method.
   Finally, managerial sights into the investment process are brought
   forward.}},

Title = {{The 2017 Reversal of the Beaufort Gyre: Can Dynamic Thickening of a
   Seasonal Ice Cover During a Reversal Limit Summer Ice Melt in the
   Beaufort Sea?}},

Abstract = {{During winter 2017, the semipermanent Beaufort High collapsed and the
   anticyclonic Beaufort Gyre reversed. The reversal drove eastward ice
   motion through the Western Arctic, causing sea ice to converge against
   Banks Island, and halted the circulation of multiyear sea ice via the
   gyre, preventing its replenishment in the Beaufort Sea. Prior to the
   reversal, an anomalously thin seasonal ice cover had formed in the
   Beaufort following ice-free conditions during September 2016. With the
   onset of the reversal in January 2017, convergence drove
   uncharacteristic dynamic thickening during winter. By the end of March,
   despite seasonal ice comprising 97\% of the ice cover, the reversal
   created the thickest, roughest, and most voluminous regional ice cover
   of the CryoSat-2 record. Within the Beaufort Sea, previous work has
   shown that winter ice export can precondition the region for increased
   summer ice melt, but that a short reversal during April 2013 contributed
   to a reduction in summer ice loss. Hence, the deformed ice cover at the
   end of winter 2017 could be expected to limit summer melt. In spite of
   this, the Beaufort ice cover fell to its fourth lowest September area as
   the gyre re-established during April and divergent ice drift broke up
   the pack, negating the reversal's earlier preconditioning. Our work
   highlights that dynamic winter thickening of a regional sea ice cover,
   for instance during a gyre reversal, offers the potential to limit
   summer ice loss, but that dynamic forcing during spring dictates whether
   this conditioning carries through to the melt season.}},

   characterized by elemental analysis, 31P NMR spectroscopy and mass

   crystallography. 5 is the second example to be reported with an unusual
   4 N-triazine-ligated coordination mode of the
   3-(2-pyridyl)-4,5-diphenyl-1,2,4-triazine. Calculated energies of the
   two possible bidentate modes of the ligand (2 Nand 4 N-triazine) at the
   copper center showed no significant difference, consistent with the
   absence of the steric hindrance at the metal center. Preliminary
   biological studies were conducted, highlighting the effect of the
   diimine ligands. 5 and 8 exhibited good cytotoxicity against prostate
   (PC-3), leukemia (MOLT-4) and breast (MCF-7) cancer cell lines,
   consistent with the presence of nitrogen heteroatoms and extended
   delocalized systems correlating with strong cytotoxic performance.
   Binding affinity studies against ct-DNA and docking studies with B-DNA
   and MDM2 protein highlighted the strong p interactions of 5 and 8, with
   the planarity of the diimine ligand of the latter contributing to its
   better binding and cytotoxicity. The present results afford structural
   design requirements for new copper(I) coordination compounds with
   enhanced biological/physiochemical properties. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The article presents the results of comprehensive studies of the
   influence of peloids from different geographic regions of Ukraine and
   different genesis on the course of experimental pathology.
   Methods:At the first stage of research we have determined the type of
   peloids these are medium-mineralized weakly sulfide magnesium-sodium
   silt peloids, low-ash organic sapropels, and peat low-mineralized
   high-ash sulfide-free peloids. Physicochemical parameters have been
   established: mass fraction of moisture, volumetric weight, hydrogen
   sulfide content, contamination with particles with a diameter greater
   than 0.25 x 10(-3) m, shear stress, stickiness, specific heat capacity,
   the content of organic substances, colloidal complex, the concentration
   of water conduit ions (pH), redox potential (Eh). In the second stage of
   the study, 55 white rats were examined for the state of the liver's
   detoxification function (by carrying out a metabolic test using sodium
   thiopental) and the morphological form of the liver in normal conditions
   and toxic alcoholic hepatosis. The toxic alcoholic hepatosis model was
   induced by daily (30 days) intragastric watering of animals with a 25\%
   solution of ethyl alcohol. From the 15th day, the rats received a course
   of applications: a cake with the corresponding peloids was applied to
   the bare part of the back.
   Results: It was determined that the peloids used had a positive effect
   on animals' condition, which was expressed in the restoration of the
   detoxification function of the liver and its structural and functional
   organization. The most substantial positive effect is observed when
   using silt-sulfide peloids, which, according to the authors, is due to
   the peculiarities of their physicochemical composition (increased
   content of magnesium, chlorides, sodium, as well as hydrogen sulfide).
   Conclusion: Based on the results obtained, it was concluded that the
   studied peloids meet the criteria for the quality of therapeutic peloids
   in terms of physicochemical parameters, biological activity, and expands
   the possibilities of their application in balneology.}},

Title = {{Individual, Familial, and Socio-Environmental Risk Factors of Gang
   Membership in a Community Sample of Adolescents in Southern Italy}},

Abstract = {{Despite the growing social alarm generated by the recurrent news
   concerning violent episodes involving youth gangs, systematic research
   in Italy in this field, especially within a psychological framework, is
   still limited. Following a social-ecological approach, the present study
   aimed at investigating the role of self-serving cognitive distortions
   (CDs), parental rejection, and community violence witnessing in youth
   gang membership (YGM). Furthermore, we examined the mediating and/or
   moderating role of YGM in the association between risk factors and
   involvement in antisocial behaviors (ASBs). A community sample of 817
   adolescents attending middle and high schools in a high-risk urban area
   in Southern Italy (46.9\% males; 53\% middle school students; M-age =
   14.67; SD = 1.65) were involved in the study. One hundred and
   fifty-seven participants (19.2\%) were found to be gang members.
   Employing counterfactual-based mediation analysis, we found that CDs and
   community violence witnessing were directly associated with YGM and
   ASBs. The association between CDs and ASBs was mediated by YGM. Parental
   rejection was directly related to ASBs but not to YGM. A significant
   interaction effect between parental rejection and YGM was found,
   revealing that high levels of parental rejection, along with being a
   gang member, amplified the involvement in ASBs. These findings pointed
   out that distorted moral cognitions and the experience of violence
   witnessing within the community may represent a fertile ground for gang
   involvement. Both individual and contextual factors should be considered
   in order to implement interventions aimed to prevent adolescents' risk
   of joining a gang.}},

Abstract = {{Objective(s): This study aimed to investigate the effect of bee venom, a
   form of alternative therapy, on rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease
   (PD) in mice. Moreover, the possible modulation by bee venom of the
   effect of L-dopa/carbidopa or rasagiline was examined.
   Materials and Methods: Rotenone (1.5 mg/kg, subcutaneously; SC) was
   administered every other day for two weeks and at the same time mice
   received the vehicle (DMSO, SC), bee venom (0.065, 0.13, and 0.26 mg/kg;
   intradermal; ID), L-dopa/carbidopa (25 mg/kg, intraperitoneal; IP),
   L-dopa/carbidopa+bee venom (0.13 mg/kg, ID), rasagiline (1 mg/kg, IP) or
   rasagiline+bee venom (0.13 mg/kg, ID). Then, wire hanging and staircase
   tests were performed and mice were euthanized and brains' striata
   separated. Oxidative stress biomarkers namely, malondialdehyde (MDA),
   nitric oxide (NO), reduced glutathione (GSH), paraoxonase-1 (PON-1), and
   total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were measured. Additionally,
   butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1
   (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and dopamine (DA) were
   evaluated. Brain histopathological changes and caspase-3- expression
   were done.
   Results: Bee venom significantly enhanced motor performance and
   inhibited rotenone-induced oxidative/nitrosative stress, observed as a
   reduction in both MDA and NO along with increasing GSH, PON-1, and TAC.
   Besides, bee venom decreased MCP-1, TNF-alpha, and caspase-3 expression
   together with an increase in BuChE activity and DA content.
   Conclusion: Bee venom alone or in combination with L-dopa/carbidopa or
   rasagiline alleviated neuronal degeneration compared with
   L-dopa/carbidopa or rasagiline treatment only. Bee venom via its
   antioxidant and cytokine reducing potentials might be of value either
   alone or as adjunctive therapy in the management of PD.}},

Abstract = {{This research was undertaken to optimize the Se(IV) adsorption from
   aqueous solutions by Cyperus laevigatus biomass and green-synthesized
   nanosilver (AgNPs). A full 2(4) factorial experimental design was
   utilized to distinguish the effects of pH, initial metal concentration
   (C-o), adsorbent dose concentration (C. laevigatus biomass, X-1 \&
   AgNPs, X-2) and contact time (t). Response surface methodology (RSM) was
   also applied to assess the factors interactions. The influence of
   selected variables on Se(IV) uptake capacity was studied and a factorial
   model was designed to detect the variables' effects and their
   interactions. The range of pH was 2-8, C-o was 100-400 mg L-1, X-1 was
   1-5 g L-1, X-2 was 0.025-0.1 g L-1 and t was 1-8 h. The significant
   effects for Se(IV) adsorption on C. laevigatus biomass were ascribed to
   pH, C-o, pH.X, and pH.C-o.X, while in case of AgNPs, C-o and X-2 were
   detected. Normal distribution was noted between the model values
   (predicted) and the observed (experimental). RSM design revealed the
   same results obtained from factorial design. The characterization of
   both sorbents by TEM revealed that the granulated texture of AgNPs
   possesses high porosity and clear surface that precedes the high
   sorption capacity of Se(IV). (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Strongyloidiasis is caused by Strongyloides stercoralis and is one of
   the most neglected tropical diseases in tropical and subtropical
   regions. Although several strongyloidiasis cases have been reported in
   Korea, genetic analysis of Korean isolates is still incomplete. In this
   study, a parasite was isolated from a 61-year-old man diagnosed with
   strongyloidiasis during the treatment of lymphoma on his retroperitoneal
   lymph node. Diffuse symmetric wall thickening from the ascending to
   descending colon and a nematode-infected intestine was observed
   following microscopic examination. Genomic DNA was isolated from a
   patient tissue block, and S. stercoralis was identified by PCR and
   sequencing (18S rDNA). In order to determine phylogenetic location of a
   Korean isolate (named KS1), we analyzed cox1 gene (500-bp) and compared
   it with that from 47 previous S. stercoralis isolates (28 human isolates
   and 19 canid isolates) from Asian countries. Our results showed that
   phylogenetic tree could clearly be divided into 5 different groups
   according to hosts and regions. KS1 was most closely related with the
   Chinese isolates in terms of genetic distance.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to identify the activation of lower extremity, trunk,
   and masticatory muscle and trunk kinematics of the initial foot position
   during the sit-to-stand (STS) movement. Sixteen young men participated
   in this cross-sectional pilot study and performed STS using both
   symmetrical and asymmetrical foot positions. Activation of the tibialis
   anterior (TA), gastrocnemius lateral head (GA), rectus femoris (RF),
   biceps femoris (BF), rectus abdominis, erector spinae (ES),
   sternocleidomastoid (SCM), upper trapezius (UT), temporalis (TE), and
   masseter muscles in the dominant side was determined. For trunk
   kinematics, head and trunk velocities, front-back (For-Back) and
   mediolateral (Med-Lat) weight translation rates, and trunk inclination
   were measured. GA, TA, BF, and RF activation significantly increased,
   whereas ES, SCM, UT, and TE activation significantly decreased when
   using the asymmetrical foot position. Head velocity, For-Back, Med-Lat,
   and trunk inclination were also significantly decreased. In conclusion,
   the asymmetrical foot position increases muscle activation in the lower
   extremities and decreases trunk inclination. In addition, ES, UT, and TE
   muscle activity decreases at the initial asymmetrical foot position.}},

Title = {{An Embryonic Zebrafish Model to Screen Disruption of Gut-Vascular
   Barrier upon Exposure to Ambient Ultrafine Particles}},
Journal = {{TOXICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Epidemiological studies have linked exposure to ambient particulate
   matter (PM) with gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. Ambient ultrafine
   particles (UFP) are the redox-active sub-fraction of PM2.5, harboring
   elemental and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from urban environmental
   sources including diesel and gasoline exhausts. The gut-vascular barrier
   (GVB) regulates paracellular trafficking and systemic dissemination of
   ingested microbes and toxins. Here, we posit that acute UFP ingestion
   disrupts the integrity of the intestinal barrier by modulating
   intestinal Notch activation. Using zebrafish embryos, we performed
   micro-gavage with the fluorescein isothiocynate (FITC)-conjugated
   dextran (FD10, 10 kDa) to assess the disruption of GVB integrity upon
   UFP exposure. Following micro-gavage, FD10 retained in the embryonic GI
   system, migrated through the cloaca. Conversely, co-gavaging UFP
   increased transmigration of FD10 across the intestinal barrier, and FD10
   fluorescence occurred in the venous capillary plexus. Ingestion of UFP
   further impaired the mid-intestine morphology. We performed
   micro-angiogram of FD10 to corroborate acute UFP-mediated disruption of
   GVB. Transient genetic and pharmacologic manipulations of global Notch
   activity suggested Notch regulation of the GVB. Overall, our integration
   of a genetically tractable embryonic zebrafish and micro-gavage
   technique provided epigenetic insights underlying ambient UFP ingestion
   disrupts the GVB.}},

Abstract = {{The field of IoT has blossomed and is positively influencing many
   application domains. In this article, we bring out the unique challenges
   this field poses to research in computer systems and networking. The
   unique challenges arise from the unique characteristics of IoT systems
   such as the diversity of application domains where they are used and the
   increasingly demanding protocols they are being called upon to run (such
   as video and LIDAR processing) on constrained resources (on-node and
   network). We show how these open challenges can benefit from foundations
   laid in other areas, such as fifth-generation network cellular
   protocols, machine learning model reduction, and device-edge-cloud
   offloading. We then discuss the unique challenges for reliability,
   security, and privacy posed by IoT systems due to their salient
   characteristics which include heterogeneity of devices and protocols,
   dependence on the physical environment, and the close coupling with
   humans. We again show how open research challenges benefit from the
   reliability, security, and privacy advancements in other areas. We
   conclude by providing a vision for a desirable end state for IoT
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.
   tuberculosis), is among the most serious infectious diseases worldwide.
   Adjuvanted protein subunit vaccines have been demonstrated as a kind of
   promising novel vaccine. This study proposed to investigate whether
   cytokines interliukine-7 (IL-7) and interliukine-15 (IL-15) help TB
   subunit vaccines induce long-term cell-mediated immune responses, which
   are required for vaccination against TB. In this study, mice were
   immunized with the M. tuberculosis protein subunit vaccines combined
   with adnovirus-mediated cytokines IL-7, IL-15, IL-7-IL-15, and
   IL-7-Linker-IL-15 at 0, 2, and 4 weeks, respectively. Twenty weeks after
   the last immunization, the long-term immune responses, especially the
   central memory-like T cells (T-CM like cell)-mediated immune responses,
   were determined with the methods of cultured IFN-gamma-ELISPOT, expanded
   secondary immune responses, cell proliferation, and protective efficacy
   against Mycobacterium bovis Bacilli Calmette-Guerin (BCG) challenge,
   etc. The results showed that the group of vaccine +
   rAd-IL-7-Linker-IL-15 induced a stronger long-term antigen-specific T-CM
   like cells-mediated immune responses and had higher protective efficacy
   against BCG challenge than the vaccine + rAd-vector control group, the
   vaccine + rAd-IL-7 and the vaccine + rAd-IL-15 groups. This study
   indicated that rAd-IL-7-Linker-IL-15 improved the TB subunit vaccine's
   efficacy by augmenting T-CM like cells and provided long-term protective
   efficacy against Mycobacteria.}},

Abstract = {{Based on existing measurement studies and data from Alibaba's e-commerce
   platform, this paper constructs a spillover effect model of regional
   core cities and studies spatial spillover effect of electronic commerce
   information system in China's agricultural industry. This study obtains
   the following implications and conclusions: The development of
   E-commerce information system in central cities has a direct spillover
   effect on agricultural industry in this region. As the core of regional
   economic growth, central cities play a leadership role that drives other
   cities to develop agricultural products within this region. The reserve
   of Internet talents and the scale of the express logistics industry are
   essential bases for the growth of agricultural product e-commerce in
   urban areas. However, there is no spillover effect on this domain;
   online agricultural products are enormously dependent on the processing
   industries. Agricultural products have highly similar shapes and highly
   overlapping targets in markets in different cities within the same
   region. The demands of agricultural product e-commerce are compressed,
   and its development is hindered because the processing industries that
   have developed in central cities face fierce competition from
   surrounding cities. Central cities have great appeal to talents within
   the region, which affects the development of e-commerce in other cities
   by withdrawing the human resources of surrounding cities.}},

   associated with the resulting chemical mitigation and structural
   adaptation of the solid sliding surface were clarified by
   surface/interface characterizations. The results revealed desirable
   performance in reducing friction and wear at elevated temperatures,
   which was associated with the resulting oxide composite film's adaptive
   lubricating capability, whereas severe abrasive wear occurred at
   room/ambient temperatures. The oxidative-abrasive differentials for the
   two alloys were further discussed by considering the combined effect of
   temperature and stressed-shearing conditions.}},

Title = {{Family critical time intervention with housing unstable, child
   welfare-involved families: Service providers' and families' experiences
   with the phases}},
Journal = {{CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{119}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{It is well documented that children from housing unstable families tend
   to stay longer in the foster care system and are less likely to reunify
   with their caregivers as compared to stably housed families. Various
   housing interventions have been implemented to promote reunification.
   Previous studies have primarily focused on examining the effectiveness
   of these housing interventions, however, no qualitative study has
   explored the mechanisms by which housing interventions are being
   delivered. This study aims to fill this critical literature gap by
   exploring how Family Critical Time Intervention (FCTI) is being carried
   out in the context of serving housing-unstable families with children in
   foster care. In-depth individual interviews were conducted with 16
   families, five PFS workers who delivered the intervention, and 15 child
   welfare workers involved in the families' cases. Coding and analyses
   focused on themes describing clients' and workers' experiences during
   the FCTI phases. Themes developed for each phase included (1) Pre-FCTI:
   workers built trust through compassion; (2) Phase 1: workers helped
   stabilize clients through collaborative partnerships; Phase 2: workers
   helped clients with skill development and advocacy, and Phase 3: clients
   and workers wished for service continuity rather than termination. The
   findings have implications for promoting innovative practices for
   families who are at the intersection of housing instability and child
   welfare involvement.}},

Title = {{Impact of Simulated Gastric Acid on Surface Roughness and Frictional
   Resistance of Orthodontic Archwires: An In vitro Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND DIAGNOSTIC RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{ZC10-ZC15}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Acid regurgitation caused by gastro-oesophageal reflux
   disease can lead to decreases in intraoral pH below the critical pH for
   orthodontic appliances. Exposure of brackets and archwires to such
   acidic environments causes changes in the surface properties that affect
   the frictional forces generated during orthodontic sliding mechanics and
   reduce the clinical efficacy of the wires.
   Aim: This in vitro study aimed to determine the effects of simulated
   gastric acid with pH 1.2 and pH 4 on the surface topography, surface
   roughness, and frictional resistance properties of different types of
   orthodontic archwires.
   Materials and Methods: A comparative in vitro study evaluated a total of
   135 samples of three commercially available archwires: Stainless Steel
   (SS), nickel titanium, and beta-titanium (n=45/group). Each archwire was
   divided into three subgroups (n=15) according to different pH solutions:
   distilled water (control; pH 6.7), pH 4, and pH 1.2. The samples in the
   two acidic pH subgroups were immersed in the respective solution for two
   minutes, rinsed with distilled water, and stored in distilled water at
   37 degrees C. The procedure was repeated 6 times a day for nine days
   with 24-hours interval in between each cycle. The surface topography of
   the wires was examined by scanning electron microscopy, while the
   surface roughness was inspected by noncontact surface profilometry.
   Finally, the frictional resistance was measured by a universal testing
   machine. One-way ANOVA and a Tukey's post-hoc test were used for
   analysis, with values of p=0.05 considered significant.
   Results: The results showed an increase in surface roughness of the SS
   (p<0.001) and beta-titanium (p=0.003) wires as the acidity of the
   solution increased. The SS wires showed the lowest frictional resistance
   in pH 1.2 solution among the wires used (p=0.005). No correlation was
   found between surface roughness and frictional resistance in this study.
   Conclusion: Increased acidity condition significantly affects the
   surface roughness of beta-titanium and SS wires, and has no effect on
   the frictional behaviour of the orthodontic wires expects in the SS
   wires. Thus, because the surface properties of the archwires can be
   affected by acidity in the oral cavity, it is recommended to change the
   orthodontic wires regularly throughout orthodontic treatment, especially
   in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.}},

Abstract = {{Background Current guidelines regarding surveillance after screening
   colonoscopy assume adequate bowel preparation. However, follow-up
   intervals after suboptimal cleansing are highly heterogeneous. We aimed
   to determine the diagnostic yield of early repeat colonoscopy in
   patients with suboptimal bowel preparation in fecal immuno-chemical test
   (FIT)-based screening colonoscopy.
   Methods An observational study including patients who underwent
   colonoscopy with suboptimal bowel preparation after positive FIT
   screening and then repeat colonoscopy within 1 year. Suboptimal
   preparation was defined as a Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) score
   of 1 in any segment. Patients with a BBPS score of 0 in any segment or
   incomplete examination were excluded. The adenoma detection rate (ADR),
   advanced ADR (AADR), and colorectal cancer rate were calculated for the
   index and repeat colonoscopies.
   Results Of the 2474 patients with FIT-positive colonoscopy at our center
   during this period, 314 (12.7\%) had suboptimal preparation. Of the 259
   (82.5\%) patients who underwent repeat colonoscopy, suboptimal cleansing
   persisted in 22 (9 \%). On repeat colonoscopy, the ADR was 38.7\% (95\%
   CI 32.6\% to 44.8\%) and the AADR was 14.9\% (95\% CI 10.5\% to 19.4\%).
   The per-adenoma miss rate was 27.7\% (95 \%CI 24.0\% to 31.6\%), and the
   per-advanced adenoma miss rate was 17.6\% (95\%CI 13.3\% to 22.7\%).
   After repeat colonoscopy, the post-polypectomy surveillance
   recommendation changed from 10 to 3 years in 14.7\% of the patients with
   previous 10-year surveillance recommendation.
   Conclusions Patients with suboptimal bowel preparation on FIT-positive
   colonoscopy present a high rate of advanced adenomas in repeat
   colonoscopy, with major changes in post-polypectomy surveillance
   recommendations.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbances of sensory and motor nerve conduction velocity in the
   spinal cord as well as degenerated myelin sheaths are observed in
   diabetic patients and animal models. Indeed. oligodendrocytes (OLs),
   which are important neuroglial cells. generate myelin in the central
   nervous system. Spinal enlargement, including cervical and lumbar
   enlargements, innervates all limbs. Thus, the purposes of this study
   were to examine and compare the ultrastructural alterations of OLs in
   spinal enlargements of streptozotocin (STZ)induced diabetic rats and
   controls. Thirteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were induced with STZ in
   citrate buffer and six control rats were injected with the same buffer
   solution. All rats were sacrificed after inductions at four (short-term
   DM) and twenty-four weeks (long-term DM). The selected spinal
   enlargements were processed for transmission electron microscopy. The OL
   alterations in both the cervical and lumbar enlargements were apparently
   the same. In short-term DM, the nuclei of OLs became swelled with
   chromatin clumping. Cytoplasmic organelles were moderately damaged. In
   long-term DM, OLs contained shrinkage nuclei with thick heterochromatin
   clumping. Severely degenerated mitochondria with disrupted cristae and
   broken membranes were observed. Moreover, distended and fragmented rough
   endoplasmic reticulum were observed, and large clear areas were present
   in the cytoplasm. Additionally, the loosening, splitting, and
   destruction of myelin lamellae were found. This study can provide
   important preliminary information about the alteration of OLs in the
   spinal cords of diabetic patients, which might be involve in the
   impairments of sensory and motor conduction velocities in these
   individuals.}},

Abstract = {{The increase in the production and consumption of pharmaceuticals
   increases their presence in the global environment, which may result in
   direct threats to living organisms. For this reason, there is a need for
   new methods to analyze drugs in environmental samples. Here, a new
   procedure for separating and determining selected drugs (diclofenac,
   ibuprofen, and carbamazepine) from bottom sediment and water samples was
   developed. Drugs were determined by ultra-high performance liquid
   chromatography coupled with an ultraviolet detector (UHPLC-UV). In this
   work, a universal and single-step sample treatment, based on
   supramolecular solvents (SUPRAS), was proposed to isolate selected
   anticonvulsants and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) from
   sediment samples. The following parameters were experimentally selected:
   composition of the supramolecular solvent (composition THF:H2O (v/v),
   amount of decanoic acid), volume of extractant, sample mass, extraction
   time, centrifugation time, and centrifugation speed. Finally, the
   developed procedure was validated. A Speedisk procedure was also
   developed to extract selected drugs from water samples. The recovery of
   analytes using the SUPRAS procedure was in the range of 88.8-115\%,
   while the recoveries of the Speedisk solid-phase extraction procedure
   ranged from 81.0-106\%. The effectiveness of the sorption of the tested
   drugs by sediment was also examined.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we give a new method for constructing a quadrature formula
   for a curvilinear singular integral and, based on this method, we
   construct quadrature formulas for the derivative of the logarithmic
   potential of a simple layer
   v(x) = integral(L) grad(x) Phi(x,y)rho(y)dL(y), x = (x(1),x(2)), x is an
   element of L,
   and for the normal derivative of the logarithmic potential of a double
   layer
   partial derivative W/(x)/partial derivative n(x) = partial
   derivative/partial derivative n(x) (integral(L) partial derivative
   Phi(x,y)partial derivative/n(y)rho(y)dL(y)), x is an element of L,
   where L subset of R-2 is a simple closed Lyapunov curve with the
   exponent 0 < alpha <= 1; n (y) is the external unit normal at the point
   y is an element of L; rho is a continuous function on L; and Phi( x, y)
   is the fundamental solution of the Laplace equation, i.e.,
   Phi(x, y) = 1/2 pi ln 1/vertical bar x-y vertical bar, x,y is an element
   of R-2, x not equal y.
   Assume that the curve L is defined by the parametric equation x(t) =
   (x(1)(t), x(2) (t)), t is an element of{[}a,b]. Let us partition the
   segment {[}a,b] into n > 2M(1) (b-a)/d equal parts: t(k), a + (b-a)k/n,
   k = (0,n) over bar, where M-1 = max(t is an element of{[}a,b])
   root(x'(1()t))(2)+(x(2)'(t))(2) < +infinity and d is the radius of the
   standard circle. As reference points, we take x(tau(k)), k = <(1, n)over
   bar>, where tau(k) = a + (b-a)(2k-1)/2n. Also let Q(1=)\{j broken

   max\{broken vertical bar x(tau(k)) - x(t(k-1))broken vertical bar,
   x(t(k)) - x(t(k))vertical bar\}.
   The following theorems are proved.
   Theorem 1. Let L subset of R-2 be a simple closed Lyapunov curve with
   the exponent 0 < alpha <= 1 and rho is an element of H-beta (L), 0 <
   beta <= 1. Then the expression

   V-m (x) = integral(L) partial derivative Phi(x,y)/partial derivative
   x(m) rho(y)dL(y), x = (x(1),x(2)) is an element of L (m = 1,2);
   here,
   max vertical bar V-m(x(tau(1))) - V-m(n)(x(tau(1)))vertical bar <=
   M(parallel to rho parallel to(infinity) n -alpha/1+alpha + C-p n -
   beta/1+alpha), l=l,n

   parallel to(rho)parallel to(infinity) = max(x is an element of
   L)vertical bar rho(x)vertical bar, M is a positive constant, and C-p =
   sup(x,y is an element of L) (x not equal y) vertical bar
   rho(x)-rho(y)vertical bar/vertical bar x-y vertical bar(beta)
   Theorem 2. Let L subset of R-2 be a simple closed Lyapunov curve with
   the exponent 0 < a <= 1, rho(x) be a continuously differentiable
   function on L, and
   diamL integral(0) (grad rho,t)/t dt < + infinity.
   Then the expression

Abstract = {{Detection of residual plasma viremia in antiretroviral therapy (ART)
   suppressed HIV-infected individuals is critical for characterizing the
   latent reservoir and evaluating the impact of cure interventions.
   Ultracentrifugation-based single copy assays are sensitive but labor
   intensive. Fully automated replicate testing using a standard clinical
   viral load assay was evaluated as a high-throughput alternative for the
   quantification of low-level viremia. Four plasma samples from blood
   donors with acute HIV-1 infection and one viral culture supernatant were
   serially diluted into 25-ml samples to nominal viral loads ranging from
   39 to <0.5 copies (cp)/ml. Each dilution was tested with 45 replicates
   (reps) using 0.5 ml/rep with the Aptima HIV-1 Quant assay. The nominal
   and estimated viral loads based on the single-hit Poisson model were
   compared, and a hybrid Poisson digital model for calibrated viral load
   estimation was derived. Testing performed using 45 reps on longitudinal
   plasma samples from 50 ART-suppressed individuals in the Reservoir Assay
   Validation and Evaluation Network (RAVEN) study cohort (range of 1 to 19
   years of continuous ART suppression) showed a median viral load of 0.54
   cp/ml (interquartile range {[}IQR], 0.22 to 1.46 cp/ml) and a 14\% (95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI], 9\% to 19\%) decline in viral load for each
   additional year in duration suppressed. Within the RAVEN cohort, the
   expected false-negative rate for detection at lower rep numbers using 9
   and 18 reps was 26\% and 14\%, respectively. Residual plasma viremia
   levels positively correlated with cell-associated HIV RNA and DNA. The
   performance characteristics of the replicate Aptima assay support its
   use for quantifying residual plasma viremia to study the latent HIV
   reservoir and cure interventions.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The current problem of packets generation and transformation around the
   world is router congestion, which then leads to a decline in the network
   performance in term of queuing delay (D) and packet loss (P-L). The
   existing active queue management (AQM) algorithms do not optimize the
   network performance because these algorithms use static techniques for
   detecting and reacting to congestion at the router buffer. In this
   paper, a weight queue active queue management (WQDAQM) based on dynamic
   monitoring and reacting is proposed. Queue weight and the thresholds are
   dynamically adjusted based on the traffic load. WQDAQM controls the
   queue within the router buffer by stabilizing the queue weight between
   two thresholds dynamically. The WQDAQM algorithm is simulated and
   compared with the existing active queue management algorithms. The
   results reveal that the proposed method demonstrates better performance
   in terms mean queue length, D, P-L, and dropping probability, compared
   to gentle random early detection (GRED), dynamic GRED, and stabilized
   dynamic GRED in both heavy or no-congestion cases. In detail, in a heavy
   congestion status, the proposed algorithm overperformed dynamic GRED
   (DGRED) by 13.3\%, GRED by 19.2\%, stabilized dynamic GRED (SDGRED) by
   6.7\% in term of mean queue length (mql). In terms of D in a heavy
   congestion status, the proposed algorithm overperformed DGRED by 13.3\%,
   GRED by 19.3\%, SDGRED by 6.3\%. As for P-L, the proposed algorithm
   overperformed DGRED by 15.5\%, SDGRED by 19.8\%, GRED by 86.3\% in term

   1995-2011, 2020. First published September 30, 2020;
   doi:10.1152/jn.00612.2019.-Both passive and active mechanisms are
   necessary to explain small amplitude forward-backward (FB) voluntary
   swaying. Parallel and symmetric leg inverted pendulum models with
   stiffness control are a simple way to replicate FB swaying during quiet
   stance. However, it has been more difficult to model lateral left-right
   (LR) voluntary swaying involving the dual mechanisms of hip
   loading-unloading and ankle pressure distribution. To assess these
   factors, we had subjects perform small amplitude FB and LR sways and
   circular rotation. We experimentally identified three parameters that
   characterized their two-dimensional stiffnesses: AP stiffness (K-S(AP)),
   and lateral stiffness (K-S(ML)), at the ankles and a parameter we refer
   to as the engagement-disengagement rate (K-ED) of the legs. We performed
   simulations with our engaged leg model (Bakshi A, DiZio P, Lackner JR. J
   Neurophysiol 121: 2042-2060, 2019; Bakshi A, DiZio P, Lackner JR. J
   Neurophysiol 121: 2028-2041, 2019) to test its predictions about the
   limits of balance stability during sway in the three test conditions.
   Comparing the model's predictions with the experimental data, we found
   that K-S(AP) has a task-dependent dual role in upright balance and is
   crucial to prevent falling; K-S(ML) helps overcome viscous drags but is
   not instrumental to stability; K-ED has a key role in stability and is
   dependent on the biomechanical geometry of the body, which is invariant
   across balance tasks. These findings provide new insights into balance
   control that have important clinical implications for falling,
   especially for patients who are unable to use a hip strategy during
   balance control.
   NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Our previously published Engaged Leg Model here shows
   how stiffness plays complex multicausal roles in balance. In one role,
   it is crucial to stability, with task contingent influences over
   balance. In another, it overcomes viscous drag. Task-dependent stiffness
   alone does not explain stable balance; geometrical, invariant aspects of
   body biomechanics also matter. Our model is fully applicable to clinical
   balance pathologies involving asymmetries in movement and balance
   control.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the fact that most of the data centers are software-defined, the
   multifaceted network architecture and increase in network traffic make
   data centers to suffer from overhead. Multipath TCP supports multiple
   paths for a single routing session and ensures proper utilization of
   bandwidth over all available links. As rise in number of nodes in data
   center is frequent and drastic, scalability issue limits the performance
   of many existing techniques. Segment Routing is vibrant in reducing
   scalability disputes and routing overhead. Segment routing approach
   combined with MPTCP traffic result in efficient routing approach. The
   downfall of the link capacity due to drastic incoming traffic remains as
   a major concern in data center network which enforces preventing link
   energy depletion due to high network traffic. Our proposed work, segment
   routing based energy aware routing approach for software defined data
   center aims to achieve throughput maximization through preserving link
   residual capacity and proper utilization of links. As well, our approach
   shows a decrease in length of segment label stack with respect to
   maximum segment label depth. Analysis is done by comparing the
   executions of other existing approaches in a single-controller
   environment with our energy-aware routing approach in a distributed
   environment. Distributed controller setup prevents network from single
   point of failure. It helps to prevent controller overhead and provides
   improved network performance through throughput. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Insurance and economic policy uncertainty}},
Journal = {{RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{54}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Just as the world has witnessed the increased importance of the
   insurance sector over the past few decades, it has also witnessed a
   sharp rise in risks and uncertainties. Surprisingly, studies analyzing
   the relationship between economic policy uncertainty and the insurance
   sector are almost non-existent. Another major limitation of insurance
   literature is the choice of methodology. Most studies on the insurance
   sector do not take into consideration issues of heterogeneity and
   cross-sectional dependence, and are therefore subject to errors. To
   address the identified gaps, this research investigates the impact of
   economic policy uncertainty on insurance premiums in a panel of 15
   countries over the period 1998-2016 by employing heterogeneous panel
   estimation techniques with cross-sectional dependence. The
   Durbin-Hausman cointegration tests of Westerlund (2008) confirm that a
   long-run relationship exists between the variables. Findings from the
   error correction based panel estimations show that the insurance sector
   is not immune to the effects of economic policy uncertainty. Economic
   policy uncertainty raises insurance premiums both in the short and long
   run, although the long-run impact is greater than the short-run impact.
   In addition, economic policy uncertainty exerts a bigger influence on
   non-life insurance premium than on life insurance premium, indicating
   that the economic risks covered by non-life insurance are more sensitive
   to uncertainty than the mortality and longevity risks covered by life
   insurance. Our findings further show that national income, education,
   population, financial development and institutional quality all raise
   insurance premiums, while inflation lowers insurance premiums.}},

Title = {{How may deforestation rates and political instruments affect land use
   patterns and Carbon emissions in the semi-arid Chaco, Argentina?}},
Journal = {{LAND USE POLICY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{99}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In the last decades, dry Chaco forests experienced both intensive
   deforestation and land use changes. The intensification of deforestation
   at the national level led to the enactment of the National Forest Law (N
   degrees 26.331) in 2007. However, after its implementation,
   deforestation continued at high rates in explicitly protected areas
   (Categories I and II) in the provinces of Salta, Chaco and Santiago del
   Estero. In this article we estimated carbon (C) emission due to
   deforestation in a portion of the Argentine semi-arid Chaco (around 11 M
   ha) along 12 land use scenarios. A spatial model (InVEST) was used to
   prospectively analyze land use in the next 20 years, considering 4
   levels of Forest Law compliance (denominated Current, Permissive,
   Partial and Strict) and 3 deforestation rates based on 2009-2015 records
   (denominated Expansion, Deceleration and Acceleration). We simulated the
   deforestation and its subsequent replacement by productive land uses
   (croplands, pastures and silvopastoral systems) based on a supervised
   land use classification for the year 2015. The C contents in different
   compartments (above and belowground biomass, litter and soil) were
   obtained from previous studies, based on a simulation model (CENTURY).
   The level of Forest Law compliance did not define the cleared area,
   except for those scenarios that considered a Strict compliance. Thus,
   productive land uses increased between 0.9 and 3.5 M ha after 20 years,
   depending on the deforestation rate. The total C emission was estimated
   between 51 and 169 Tg, where the burning of biomass and the
   decomposition of the remaining organic material represented about 96\%
   of the emissions. Carbon changes in the upper 20 cm of the soil,
   represented a very low proportion of total emission. Although these
   estimations were conservative, given that not all sources have been
   considered, the study area showed a high potential contribution to the C
   emission at national scale.}},

Title = {{Systematic analysis of wavelet denoising methods for neural signal
   processing}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Among the different approaches for denoising neural signals,
   wavelet-based methods are widely used due to their ability to reduce
   in-band noise. All wavelet denoising algorithms have a common structure,
   but their effectiveness strongly depends on several implementation
   choices, including the mother wavelet, the decomposition level, the
   threshold definition, and the way it is applied (i.e. the thresholding).
   In this work, we investigated these factors to quantitatively assess
   their effects on neural signals in terms of noise reduction and
   morphology preservation, which are important when spike sorting is
   required downstream. Approach. Based on the spectral characteristics of
   the neural signal, according to the sampling rate of the signals, we
   considered two possible decomposition levels and identified the
   best-performing mother wavelet. Then, we compared different threshold
   estimation and thresholding methods and, for the best ones, we also
   evaluated their effect on clearing the approximation coefficients. The
   assessments were performed on synthetic signals that had been corrupted
   by different types of noise and on a murine peripheral nervous system
   dataset, both of which were sampled at about 16 kHz. The results were
   statistically analysed in terms of their Pearson's correlation
   coefficients, root-mean-square errors, and signal-to-noise ratios. Main
   results. As expected, the wavelet implementation choices greatly
   influenced the processing performance. Overall, the Haar wavelet with a
   five-level decomposition, hard thresholding method, and the threshold
   proposed by Han et al (2007) achieved the best outcomes. Based on the
   adopted performance metrics, wavelet denoising with these
   parametrizations outperformed conventional 300-3000 Hz linear bandpass
   filtering. Significance. These results can be used to guide the reasoned
   and accurate selection of wavelet denoising implementation choices in
   the context of neural signal processing, particularly when
   spike-morphology preservation is required.}},

Abstract = {{The similar to 4500-m-deep Iceland Deep Drilling Project (IDDP) borehole
   IDDP-2 in Iceland penetrated the root of an active seawater-recharged
   hydrothermal system below the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. As direct sampling of
   pristine free fluid was impossible, we used fluid inclusions to
   constrain the in situ conditions and fluid composition at the bottom of
   the hydrothermal convection cell. The fluid temperature is similar to
   600 degrees C, and its pressure is near-hydrostatic (similar to 45 MPa).
   The fluid exists as two separate phases: an H2O-rich vapor (with an
   enthalpy of -59.4 kJ/mol) and an Fe-K-rich brine containing 2000 mu g/g
   Cu, 3.5 mu g/g Ag, 1.4 mu g/g U, and 0.14 mu g/g Au. Occasionally, the
   fluid inclusions coexist with rhyolite melt inclusions. These findings
   indicate that the borehole intersected high-energy steam, which is
   valuable for energy production, and discovered a potentially ore-forming
   brine. We suggest that similar fluids circulate deep beneath mid-ocean
   ridges worldwide and form volcanogenic massive sulfide Cu-Zn-Au-Ag ore

Abstract = {{Objective: To describe the epidemiological manifestations and assess
   major risk factors in children under the age of three years presenting
   with non-accidental injury (NAI) fractures in a level two trauma center
   in Puerto Rico.
   Methods: An IRB approved retrospective descriptive study was performed
   by reviewing case records of 75 patients who presented with a NAI
   fracture at the Pediatric University Hospital of the Puerto Rico Medical
   Center. The study time period was from October 1996 to October 2014. The
   inclusion criteria for our population consisted of: (1) patients between
   the ages of zero to three years, (2) suffered a long bone fracture, and
   (3) had a history of suspected child abuse at our academic institution.
   The exclusion criteria were: (1) patients older than three years, (2) no
   history of NAI, or (3) had a congenital bone disorder.
   Results: A total of 117 long bone fractures were observed in our
   population. Similar distribution was seen between sex{''} with 52\%
   being male and 48\% being female. The mean age was 10.8 months. The
   group with the highest frequency of NAI fractures were children under
   the age of one year (57.3 \%). The most commonly involved fractured bone
   for all age groups was the femur (48.0 \%). No statistical significance
   was observed when comparing sex, age, associated injuries or multiple
   fractures.
   Conclusion: Children younger than one year of age who present with long
   bone fracture, multiple fractures, low household income and parental
   unemployment are associated with an increased risk of NAI fractures.}},

Abstract = {{Duplex ultrasound testing after open or endovascular extracranial
   carotid artery interventions is a clinical practice guideline with a
   strong recommendation from the Society for Vascular Surgery. Neurologic
   outcomes are improved by the recognition of repair site stenosis or
   atherosclerotic disease progression in the unoperated carotid artery.
   The benefit of surveillance outweighs its risk because duplex testing is
   free of complications and accurate in the detection of internal carotid
   artery (ICA) stenosis or occlusion. Surveillance for >70\% ICA stenosis
   is recommended within 30 days of the procedure, then every 6 months for
   2 years, and annually thereafter. Repair site and contralateral ICA
   stenosis classification should be based on angle-corrected pulsed
   Doppler measurements of peak systolic velocity (PSV), enddiastolic
   velocity (EDV), and the ratio of PSV at the stenosis to a proximal,
   nondiseased common carotid artery (CCA) segment (ICA/CCA ratio).
   Interpretation criteria of PSV >300 cm/s, EDV >125 cm/s, and ICA/CCA
   ratio >4 predicts >70\% repair site stenosis. Endovascular intervention
   is recommended for a carotid repair site stenosis based on the
   occurrence of an ipsilateral neurologic event and appropriate anatomy
   for angioplasty. For asymptomatic restenosis, intervention is based on
   stenosis progression to elevated PSV and EDV >70\% stenosis threshold
   values and the patient is deemed high risk for stroke due to
   contralateral ICA occlusion or incomplete functional patency of the
   circle of Willis. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Parasitic plants have evolved to have reduced or completely lost ability
   to conduct photosynthesis and are usually characterized by sweeping
   morphological, physiological and genomic changes. The plastid genome (or
   plastome) is highly conserved in autotrophic plants and houses many key
   photosynthesis genes. This molecule is thus a useful system for
   documenting the genomic effects of a loss of autotrophy. Cuscuta
   (dodders) represents one of 12 independent transitions to a parasitic
   lifestyle in angiosperms. This near-cosmopolitan genus contains > 200
   obligate parasitic species circumscribed in four subgenera: Grammica,
   Pachystigma, Cuscuta and Monogynella. With respect to photosynthesis,
   Cuscuta is a heterogeneous group, containing both hemi- and
   holoparasitic members that are, respectively, partially or entirely
   reliant on parasitism to meet their carbon budget. Plastomes in this
   genus have been reported to show a substantial degree of diversification
   in terms of length and gene composition. Considered together with
   well-understood phylogenetic relationships, this genus presents an
   opportunity for fine-scale comparisons among closely related species of
   heterotrophic plants. This research documents changes in sequence
   composition and structure that occurred as these plants evolved along
   the trophic spectrum by using multiple whole-plastome assemblies from
   each of the four subgenera. By `triangulating' the positions of genomic
   changes, we construct a step-by-s'tep model of plastome evolution across
   the phylogenetic backbone of Cuscuta and highlight the remarkable
   retention of most photosynthetic genes in these parasitic plants.}},

Abstract = {{Hospital-acquired bloodstream infections (BSIs) cause high mortality in
   the intensive care units (ICUs) compared to wards. Furthermore, the
   isolation of multidrug resistant (MDR) organisms in ICUs add to the
   gravity of the condition making the treatment a bigger challenge. The
   present study was aimed to evaluate the prevalence, spread, and the
   possible MDR organisms contributing to ICU-acquired BSI \& the source of
   the secondary BSI in the ICUs. A prospective study was conducted in four
   ICU of tertiary teaching hospital over a period of six months. Patient
   that developed features of BSI within 48 hours after hospital admission
   were included in the present study Blood culture was performed by an
   automated BacT/ALERT (R) 3D system. The source of secondary BSI was
   identified by analysing culture results for the samples other than
   blood. These samples were taken within 48 hours of the patient's blood
   culture test being positive. A total of 50 patients (25\%) had an ICU
   acquired bloodstream infection. Out of 50 patients, 74\% of them had
   bacterial etiology. Thirty one patients (62\%) among them developed
   multidrug resistant bacteraemia. Fifty six percent of Gram negative
   bacilli were multi drug resistant. The resistance to carbapenem was
   42\%. The most common MDR Gram negative isolate was identified as
   Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=12; 38.7\%,) and the most common source was
   pulmonary infection (26.7\% (n=12). 42\% of isolates in our study were
   carbapenem resistant suggesting the need for a proper antibiotic policy
   in the ICUs. Prolonged stay in the ICU with mechanical ventilation was
   the critical risk factor and ICU mortality was high (38\%).}},

Abstract = {{There are several causes for sudden onset unilateral mydriasis, however
   impending transtentorial uncal herniation needs to be ruled out. This
   unique case highlights an uncommon adverse response to a common mode of
   treatment that leads to a diagnostic dilemma. A 3-year-old boy with a
   ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt for an obstructive hydrocephalus
   presented with an acute respiratory distress. He developed unilateral
   mydriasis with absent light reflex during treatment with nebulisers. An
   urgent CT scan of the brain did not show any new intracranial
   abnormality. A case of pharmacological anisocoria was diagnosed that
   resolved completely within 24 hours of discontinuation of ipratropium
   bromide. Although ipratropium-induced anisocoria has been reported in
   children, but to our knowledge none in a child with VP shunt for
   hydrocephalus. This emphasises the urgency in evaluating unilateral
   mydriasis to rule out life-threatening conditions. Clinicians should
   remember that ipratropium administered through ill-fitting face masks
   could cause this completely reversible adverse effect.}},

   were mechanically characterised, with and without micro-patterns, by
   means of Single Lap Offset (SLO) shear tests under compression to
   understand the effect of differently shaped micro-slots. The effects of
   the shape of the micro-slots, their interlocking or overlapping, and

Abstract = {{Antioxidant activity, anti-aging effects and cytotoxicity activity of
   cinnamon essential oils from Cinnamomum zeylanicum were investigated in
   this study. The antioxidant activities of the cinnamon essential oil at
   the concentrations of 125, 250, 500, and 1000 mu g/mL were determined
   using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis
   (3-ethylbenzo-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS). The
   inhibitory activities against collagenase, elastase and tyrosinase were
   evaluated for anti-aging effects. The antioxidant activity determined by
   DPPH and ABTS assays varied from 4.91 - 28.74\% and 4.96 - 50.17\%,
   respectively. In addition, cinnamon essential oil at all concentrations
   tested (100, 200, 500, and 1000 mu g/mL) inhibited tyrosinase activity
   by 61.68 - 93.12 \%, collagenase activity by 2.83 - 30.28 \% and
   elastase activity by 4.37 - 33.92 \%. The cytotoxicity activity
   determined by the diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) assay revealed that the
   cinnamon essential oil at the concentration less than 100 mu g/mL did
   not exhibit cytotoxicity activity on human fibroblast cells while the
   percentage of cell viability decreased when exposed to this oil at the
   concentration higher than 150 mu g/mL. These results demonstrated that
   the cinnamon essential oil has antioxidant, tyrosinase inhibitory,
   collagenase inhibitory, and elastase inhibitory activities. In addition,
   cinnamon essential oil at each effective concentration did not show any
   toxicity when tested on normal human fibroblast cell. Therefore, this
   essential oil could be a potential candidate for cosmetic and
   pharmaceutical products.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of Online Social Networks (OSNs) on human lives is foreseen
   to be very large with unprecedented amount of data and users. OSN users
   share their ideas, photos, daily life events, feelings and news. Since
   OSNs' security and privacy challenges are more potential than ever
   before, it is necessary to enhance the protection and filtering
   approaches of OSNs contents. This paper explores OSNs' threats and
   challenges, and categorize them into: account-based, URL-based and
   content-based threats. In addition, we analyze the existing protection
   methods and highlight their limitations and weaknesses. Based on that,
   we propose a comprehensive, user-level, proactive and real-time OSNs'
   protection system, called Hybrid Real-time Social Networks Protector
   (HRSP). HRSP has three components; a user-level security protocol and
   two classification models. The protocol defines a structure for OSN's
   cryptographic services, including encryption, access control and users'
   authentication. The classification models employ machine learning, black
   lists, white lists and users' feedback, in order to classify URLs into:
   Benign, Risk and Inappropriate classes, and contents into: Benign, Hate
   speech and Inappropriate classes. We constructed two data sets of
   150,000 URLs and 22,000 tweets to build and test the two classification
   models. Results show an overall accuracy of 93.2\% for the URL model and
   84.4\% for the content model, while the protocol implementation produces
   compatible size and time overhead. The components of HRSP are integrated
   and have compatible design with OSN platforms.}},

Abstract = {{In stochastic control problems delicate issues arise when the controlled
   system can jump due to both exogenous shocks and endogenous controls.
   Here one has to specify what the controller knows when about the
   exogenous shocks and how and when she can act on this information. We
   propose to use Meyer-sigma-fields as a flexible tool to model
   information flow in such situations. The possibilities of this approach
   are illustrated first in a very simple linear stochastic control problem
   and then in a fairly general formulation for the singular stochastic
   control problem of irreversible investment with inventory risk. For the
   latter, we illustrate in a first case study how different signals on
   exogenous jumps lead to different optimal controls, interpolating
   between the predictable and the optional case in a systematic manner.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decade, many firms have shifted from in-house managed
   information systems to cloud computing arrangements. Despite regulatory
   interest in the audit impact of new technologies, little empirical work
   has studied how auditors behave when clients introduce cloud platforms
   into their accounting information system. Ex ante, it is unclear whether
   cloud computing allows for increased audit efficiency through reliance
   on service organization control reports or introduces additional
   complexity and risk to the audit. Leveraging a 2015 accounting standards
   update from the Financial Accounting Standards Board to identify
   material cloud users, we find that these firms pay an audit fee premium
   of approximately 5 percent compared to nonusers. This premium attenuates
   when hiring an audit office with more cloud users in its portfolio,
   suggesting that cloud audit experience can reduce auditors' costs when
   conducting such audits. We also explore how audit lag and subsequent
   restatements vary cross-sectionally with cloud use.}},

Abstract = {{In this research work, an effort was done to improve the liquefaction
   potential of green marine macroalgae (GMM) through surfactant induced
   microwave pretreatment (SMP) in an energy efficient aspect. By coupling
   the surfactant (sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate - SDBS) with microwave,
   a greater liquefaction of 19.4\% was obtained. A microwave input power
   of 450 W, time of 15 min and the SDBS dosage of 0.04 g/g TS were
   regarded as optimum conditions for enhanced liquefaction of GMM. Results
   of anaerobic fermentation indicates that the volatile fatty acids (VFA)
   concentration was almost two times (730 mg/L) higher in SMP than
   microwave pretreatment (MP) (345 mg/L). The exponential model outcomes
   of biochemical methane potential assay (BMP) showed higher biomethane
   generation for SMP (0.205 g COD/g COD) than MP (0.12 g COD/g COD).
   Therefore, SDBS coupled microwave liquefaction makes the pretreatment

Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Photovoltaic-thermal panels are hybrid systems that combine the two
   types of conventional solar energy technologies (photovoltaic and
   thermal panels) and simultaneously generate both thermal and electrical
   energy in a micro-cogeneration system. Like any co-generation system,
   there is an optimal balance that can be achieved between the thermal and
   electrical energy produced. For this reason, it is important to
   establish the relationship and inter-connection between the two. Limited
   research is available on the cogeneration interaction in a PVT system,
   so the novelty of this article lies in the consideration of the entire
   energy system connected to the PVT panel, including the storage tank and
   the consumer demand curve, and the investigation of the thermal
   parametric variation. This study analyses the impact of the variation of
   some thermal parameters of a domestic hot water tank on the electrical
   efficiency of a photovoltaic-thermal panel. A model of a system of
   photovoltaic-thermal panels is built in a transient systems simulation
   program (TRNSYS) and a one-factor-at-a-time analysis is carried out for
   the cold-water main temperature, tank size, tank outlet flow and
   consumer demand curve. The results show that the variation of the outlet
   flow to the consumer has the highest impact on the electrical
   efficiency, of about 6.8\%. The next highest impact factor is the size
   of the tank with a variation of 4.7\%. Matching the profile of the
   consumer is also an important aspect. It was observed that the peak
   electrical efficiency occurs during peak consumer demand. Finally, the
   instantaneous variation of the thermal and electrical power of the
   system was analysed as a function of the temperature at the inlet of the
   photovoltaic-thermal panel.}},

Abstract = {{There is limited evidence about the inflammatory potential of diet in
   children. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between
   the Children's Dietary Inflammatory Index (C-DII) from 5 to 11 years
   with adiposity and inflammatory biomarkers in Mexican children. We
   analyzed 726 children from a birth cohort study with complete dietary
   information and measurements to evaluate adiposity at 5, 7 and 11 y and
   286 children with IL-6, hsCRP, leptin and adiponectin information at 11
   y. C-DII trajectories were estimated using latent class linear mixed
   models. We used linear mixed models for adiposity and logistic and
   multinomial regression for biomarkers. In girls, each one-point increase
   in C-DII score was associated with greater adiposity
   (abdominal-circumference 0.41\%, p = 0.03; skinfold-sum 1.76\%, p =
   0.01; and BMI Z-score 0.05, p = 0.01). At 11 y the C-DII was associated
   with greater leptin (34\% >= 13.0 ng/mL, p = 0.03) and hsCRP
   concentrations (29\% >= 3.00 mg/L, p = 0.06) and lower
   adiponectin/leptin ratio (75\% < 2.45, p = 0.02). C-DII trajectory 3 in
   boys was associated with a 75.2\% (p < 0.01) increase in leptin
   concentrations and a 37.9\% decrease (p = 0.02) in the

Abstract = {{Breast cancer (BC) remains a major health problem, despite the
   remarkable advances in cancer research setting. BC is the most common
   cancer affecting women worldwide. In the context of triple negative
   breast cancer (TNBC) treatment, major obstacles include late diagnoses
   and detrimental side effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Research
   effort was rewarded with the discovery of mesothelin (MSLN), an
   oncogenic Glycosyl-Phosphatidyl-Inositol (GPI) anchored protein,
   over-expressed in TNBC. GPI pathway is a post-translational modification
   that attaches proteins to cellular membrane. MSLN targeted therapy
   succeeded in early clinical trials, nevertheless, to date, the
   epigenetic regulation of MSLN and GPI pathway by non-coding RNAs
   (nc-RNAs) in BC remains an untouched area. Accordingly, our aim is to
   investigate-for the first time- the impact of simultaneous targeting of
   MSLN and its associated GPI pathway member, PIG-C, by non-coding-RNAs.
   Expression profiling of PIG-C, MSLN in BC was performed. Using
   bioinformatics tools, MALAT-1 and miR-182 were found to target MSLN and
   PIG-C. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with synthetic nc-RNAs.
   Expression profiling of MSLN, miR-182 and MALAT-1 showed a dramatic
   over-expression in BC samples. MiR-182 ectopic expression and MALAT-1
   silencing increased MSLN and PIG-C transcript levels. However, miR-182
   inhibition and miR-182/si-MALAT-1 co-transfection lowered MSLN and PIG-C
   levels. Finally, si-PIG-C decreased MSLN and PIG-C levels. To conclude,
   our investigation unravels a new axis in TNBC, where miR-182 can
   manipulate MSLN and PIG-C. Meanwhile, MALAT-1 is the culprit lncRNA in
   this novel axis, possibly a sponge for miR-182. Altogether, this sheds
   light on new targets for BC immune-therapy.}},

Title = {{CO2 Emissions from Fuel Consumption in the Logistic Stages of the
   Brazilian Bioethanol Supply Chain}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The study reports the CO2 emissions from diesel combustion in the
   following stages of the Brazilian ethanol supply chain: (a) agricultural
   operations (management), (b) sugarcane transportation to the mill, and
   (c) biofuel transportation to the destination. To assess the sensitivity
   of the results to different origins, five regions representative of
   ethanol production were selected, and the final destination was the port
   of Santos. The transportation stage from the mill to the port included
   the possible effects of using multimodal alternatives, such as road-rail
   and road-pipeline. The results indicate that diesel consumption varies
   greatly by region of origin, and agricultural management, such as
   tilling, planting, and harvesting operations, accounts for about 70\% of
   total diesel emissions to the ethanol supply chain. Rail and pipeline
   transportation are ultimately important for mitigating emissions from
   fuel consumption in logistics corridors for exporting ethanol. It is a
   valuable contribution to supporting private actions and public policies
   related to the mitigation of emissions in the logistic stages of
   bioethanol, especially related to the optimization of the agricultural
   management process and improvement of the multimodal transport
   infrastructure, respectively. It is also a lesson to countries intending
   to produce ethanol from sugarcane.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Multisensory integration can alter information processing, and previous
   research has shown that such processes are modulated by sensory switch
   costs and prior experience (e.g., semantic or letter congruence). Here
   we report an incidental finding demonstrating, for the first time, the
   interplay between these processes and experimental factors, specifically
   the presence (vs. absence) of the experimenter in the testing room.
   Experiment 1 demonstrates that multisensory motor facilitation in
   response to audiovisual stimuli (circle and tone with no prior learnt
   associations) is higher in those trials in which the sensory modality
   switches than when it repeats. Those participants who completed the
   study while alone exhibited increased RT variability. Experiment 2
   replicated these findings using the letters ``b{''} and ``d{''}
   presented as unisensory stimuli or congruent and incongruent
   multisensory stimuli (i.e., grapheme-phoneme pairs). Multisensory
   enhancements were inflated following a sensory switch; that is,
   congruent and incongruent multisensory stimuli resulted in significant
   gains following a sensory switch in the monitored condition. However,
   when the participants were left alone, multisensory enhancements were
   only observed for repeating incongruent multisensory stimuli. These
   incidental findings therefore suggest that the effects of letter
   congruence and sensory switching on multisensory integration are partly
   modulated by the presence of an experimenter.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF LUMINESCENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{228}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The present work concentrates on spectral analysis of Pr3+:lead
   phosphate (PPbKANPr) glasses for visible lasers and optical amplifier
   applications and these glasses were prepared by a melt-cast technique.
   Vibrational modes of PPbKANPr glasses have been analyzed through FTIR
   and Raman techniques. Based on the absorption spectrum and the renowned
   Judd-Ofelt (JO) formalism, the three JO parameters (Omega(2,4,6)) were
   calculated and then used to estimate the various radiative probabilities
   for characteristic excited fluorescent states of Pr3+. The derived JO
   parameters ( x 10(-20) cm(2)) were found to be Omega(2) = 1.51, Omega(4)
   = 18.03 and Omega(6) = 19.81. The luminescence spectra exhibit emission
   bands in the visible region of 480-780 nm and with the increase of Pr3+
   ion concentration, the emission intensities were decreased due to
   concentration quenching. The decay curves of the PPbKANPr glasses were
   measured with the 443 nm excitation, monitoring via the luminescence
   peak at 610 nm. The decay rates reveal bi-exponential trend with
   shortening of lifetimes with increasing of Pr3+ ion concentration. Near
   infrared luminescence properties were obtained with the excitation of
   Ar+ ion laser line (488 nm) and the spectrum consists of three emission
   bands covering from 800 nm to 1600 nm. The investigation of the results
   proved that the current PPbKANPr glasses are useful for visible lasers
   and optical amplifiers.}},

   spectrometer for low-level natural occurring radioactive material
   ex-situ measurement}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{225}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The activity concentrations in naturally occurring radioactive material
   (NORM) samples are conventionally measured using a gamma-ray
   spectrometer with a single detector (mostly HPGe or NaI:Tl) enclosed in
   a lead shield. In this work, a passive water shield to reduce background
   radiation reaching the detectors was designed using GEANT4-toolkit Monte
   Carlo simulations and then constructed. This measurement system is
   portable and cost-effective for ex-situ measurements. IAEA-375 soil and
   beach sand each placed in Marinelli beakers were measured using two
   LaBr3:Ce detectors in singles and coin-cidence modes. A novel method of
   background reduction by using photon time-of-flight was employed
   together with the measurement of the two photons energies. These samples
   were also measured in singles mode using a NaI:Tl detector inside the
   constructed water shield and HPGe detector shielded with lead to compare
   and validate the results of LaBr3:Ce detectors measurement. Both the
   simulated and measured results show that the water shield (500 mm thick)
   attenuates 2614.5 keV gamma rays by 90 \%. The minimum detectable
   activity (MDA) measured for 24 h using the NaI:Tl detector without
   shield and inside the water shield are; 546 Bq kg(-1) and 146 Bq kg(-1)
   at 1460.8 keV (K-40), 194 Bq kg(-1) and 15 Bq kg(-1) at 1764.5 keV
   (U-238 series), and 131 Bq kg(-1) and 15 Bq kg(-1) at 911.2 keV (Th-232
   series), respectively. The measured activity concentrations of U-238 and
   Th-232 series and 40K radionuclides inside IAEA-375 soil agree with
   certified values to within measurement uncertainties. The measured
   activity of La-138 in the LaBr3:Ce detector crystal is 263.8 +/- 26.8 Bq
   kg(-1). The internal activity of the LaBr3:Ce detector increases the MDA
   at 1460.8 keV and 2614.5 keV, which limits the measurement of primordial
   radionuclides with low activity concentration in singles mode. The
   activity concentrations of U-238 and Th-232 series radionuclides in
   beach sand were measured using NaI:Tl and LaBr3:Ce detectors. The
   results are consistent with those from HPGe measurement to within
   uncertainties.}},

Abstract = {{To unravel how and where coseismic and interseismic deformation impacts
   the spatial and temporal patterns of rock uplift of the Lurestan sector
   of the Zagros Mountains, we performed an investigation of the
   large-scale features of topography and river network coupled with 2-D
   finite element modeling. Geomorphological analysis and constraints from
   parameters such as elevation, local relief, normalized channel steepness
   index (k(sn)), river longitudinal profiles, and transformed river
   profiles (chi plots) were used to unravel the time-space distribution of
   vertical motions. Whereas the much longer timescale over which
   topography grows and/or rivers respond to tectonic or climatic
   perturbations with respect to even multiple seismic cycles, the outputs
   of the finite element model yield fundamental information on the source
   of the late part of the spatiotemporal evolution of surface uplift
   recorded by the geomorphology. Model outputs shed new light into the
   processes controlling relief evolution in an actively growing mountain
   belt underlain by a major blind thrust. The outputs illustrate how
   coseismic slip controls localized uplift of a prominent topographic
   feature-the Mountain Front Flexure-located above the main upper crustal
   ramp of the principal basement thrust fault of the region, while
   continuous displacement along the deeper, aseismic portion of the same
   basement fault controls generalized uplift of the whole crustal block
   located farther to the NE, in the interior of the orogen.}},

Abstract = {{Various electron- impact cross sections of 1-1-C2H2F2 molecule are
   reported in the energy range from 0.1 to 5000 eV using the cc-pVTZ basis
   set. The molecular wavefunctions of the target are obtained from the
   multi-center expansion of the Gaussian-type orbitals within a single
   determinant Hartree Fock self consistent field scheme. The elastic cross
   sections in the low energy range (below ionization threshold) are
   reported in different scattering models like static-exchange,
   static-exchange-polarization and close-coupling using the R-matrix
   approach. The resonances detected in these scattering models are
   comprehensively analysed. The computed shape resonances are in an
   excellent agreement with the experimental and theoretical values. In
   addition to elastic rate coefficients, we have also reported
   differential, momentum transfer and electronic excitation cross
   sections. The present elastic cross sections are in good accord with the
   other ab-initio calculations. However, the total cross sections obtained
   lie systematically above the experimental results. The Single Center
   Expansion (SCE) involving the use of local potentials is invoked to
   obtain differential, elastic and momentum transfer cross sections at
   energies beyond ionization threshold. The ionization cross sections are
   obtained using the Binary-Encounter-Bethe model. The total cross
   sections are obtained by incoherently summing the elastic and inelastic
   cross sections. The SCE based results and total cross sections are in
   good agreement with the experimental and theoretical results. The cross
   sections like elastic, momentum transfer and total obtained from two
   different approaches are found to match smoothly near ionization
   threshold thus helping in estimating the cross sections over a wide
   energy range.}},

Abstract = {{Stingless bees are important floral visitors in tropical ecosystems and
   through pollination, play a key role in maintaining biodiversity and
   perpetuating native plant species. In this context, knowledge about the
   flora used by stingless bees is essential to promote their conservation
   in natural environments. This study had the objective of analyzing the
   pollen stored by Tetragonisca angustula (Latreille, 1811) in an Atlantic
   Forest area. A total of 27 pollen samples were collected from six
   colonies from April 2013 to March 2014. The samples were processed using
   acetolysis, in which pollen types were identified, photomicrographs and
   their frequency values were estimated. The most representative pollen
   types had their pollen morphology described. The analysis of the pollen
   sediment revealed 53 pollen types, three of which were indeterminate and
   the others belonged to 26 families. Among the registered pollen types,
   only 13 (distributed in ten families) showed frequency values over 10\%
   in the analyzed samples, in which the majority presented a pollen
   morphology classified as microreticulated and tricolporate small monads.
   The pollen types Byrsonima (with frequency between 0.05 to 82.79\%,
   which was recorded throughout the entire study period), Tapirira
   guianensis (0.92 to 55.65\%), and Cecropia (0.24 to 49.32\%), stood out
   as an important source of trophic resources for the maintenance and
   survival of T. angustula in an Atlantic Forest area. In addition, this
   study highlights the importance of palynological analysis for the
   knowledge of trophic resources used by stingless bees.}},

Abstract = {{International guidelines suggest revascularization within 24 hours in
   non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Within a large
   population cohort study, we aimed to explore clinical practice regarding
   timing targets for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in NSTEMI.
   The Victorian Cardiac Outcomes Registry was established in 2013 as a
   state-wide clinical quality registry, pooling data from public and
   private PCI capable centers. Data were collected on 11,852 PCIs
   performed for NSTEMI from 2014 to 2018. Patients were divided into 3
   groups by time of symptom onset to PCI (<24 hours; 24 to 72 hours; >72
   hours). We performed multivariable logistic regression analysis
   conditional on several baseline covariates in investigating the impact
   of timing of PCI in NSTEMI on clinical outcomes. Patients who underwent
   PCI within 24 hours represented 18.4\% (n = 2,178); 24 to 72 hours
   45.8\% (n = 5,434); >72 hours 35.8\% (n = 4,240). Patients waiting
   longer for PCI were older (62.6 +/- 12.2 vs 64.8 +/- 12.6 vs 67.0 +/-
   12.7, p <0.001), more likely to be female (23.1\% vs 24.2\% vs 26.4\%, p
   = 0.007), and have diabetes (18.6\% vs 21.1\% vs 27.1\% , p <0.001).
   Multivariate logistic regression found that as compared with PCI <24
   hours, PCI 24 to 72 hours and PCI >72 hours of symptom onset were
   associated with a decreased risk of 30-day mortality (odds ratio 0.55;
   95\% confidence interval 0.35 to 0.86, p = 0.008 and odds ratio 0.64;
   95\% confidence interval 0.35 to 1.01, p = 0.053, respectively). There
   was no significant difference in 30-day mortality between groups
   following exclusion of patients presenting with cardiogenic shock or out
   of hospital cardiac arrest requiring intubation. In conclusion, many
   registry patients undergo PCI outside the 24-hour window following
   NSTEMI. This delay is at odds with current guideline recommendations but
   does not appear to be associated with an increased mortality risk. Crown

Abstract = {{Modeling the growth of Bertholletia excelsa Bonpl. (B. excelsa) trees in
   natural forests is important for understanding the species' ecology and
   for better defining site-specific management. In this sense, this study
   aimed to model the diameter growth rate of B. excelsa trees in
   contrasting forest environments in the Brazilian Amazon. This study was
   conducted in the Extractive Reserve Rio Cajari (RESEX Cajari). Growth
   models were fitted at species level to predict diameter growth rate in
   the two Amazonian forest environments. Subsequently, the age at which
   the B. excelsa tree in each forest environment reaches the minimum
   diameter for seed production was calculated by integrating the growth
   models. In each forest environment, the negative exponential behavior of
   the diametric growth rate of the tree species was fitted by an
   appropriate model. The time required for B. excelsa trees to reach the
   minimum diameter was shorter in the secondary forest environment when
   compared with that of the old growth terra firme forest (47 and 78 years
   to reach the diameter of 25 cm in the secondary and old growth terra
   firme forest, respectively). While the average growth pattern indicated
   higher diameter growth rates of B. excelsa in the secondary forest
   environment, the high level of uncertainty in the model's estimation
   makes this inference complex. In conclusion, the secondary forest seems
   a favorable forest environment for the growth of B. excelsa trees, which
   may be an indicator of the potential for secondary forest environments
   to produce B. excelsa seeds in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Recycled shipping containers have the potential to be successfully used
   as a net-zero ready home. This study aims to evaluate the outcomes of a
   high-performance shipping container single-family housing project
   located in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The project was awarded the Best
   Undergraduate Project in the Single-family division at the 2019 U.S.
   Department of Energy's Solar Decathlon Design Challenge.
   The Hampton University Millennial Village Design Team designed a
   marketable net-zero ready container home for the ViBe Creative District
   in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Container Homes are not suitable for every
   homeowner, but they have a particular appeal to a generation of young
   and creative people across the country. For many municipalities in
   Virginia, where container housing is not readily accepted, the ViBe
   creative district has been having discussions with City code officials
   and local architects about the benefits. The Hampton University
   Millennial Village Design Team aimed to take advantage of the
   competition as an opportunity to explore a building construction method
   that is not widely seen in this part of the country. Testing design for
   net-zero readiness is a comprehensive way to understand how this type of
   construction performs from a building science standpoint. Collaboration
   with professional industry advisors helped the team to use
   research-based design methods to work on a unique project that the team
   believes will become a reality in the future.
   For the performance assessment of a net-zero container house, several
   simulation tools were used to investigate the environmental impacts,
   daylight performance, envelope performance, Energy Use Intensity (EUI),
   Home Energy Rating System (HERS), and solar energy generation. As for
   energy standards and codes, the Virginia residential code (VRC) 2015,
   International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) 2015 and The American
   Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers
   (ASHRAE) 90.1-2013 for residential buildings were consulted to set each
   variable for the net-zero container house project. The Rem/Rate energy
   simulation software achieved the HERS index of 51 and 0 without and with
   the applications of roof photovoltaics, respectively.}},

Title = {{Fractional (PID)-D-lambda Controller Design for a Magnetic Levitation
   System}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Currently, there are no formalized methods for tuning non-integer order
   controllers. This is due to the fact that implementing these systems
   requires using an approximation of the non-integer order terms. The
   Oustaloup approximation method of the s(alpha) fractional derivative is
   intuitive and widely adopted in the design of fractional-order
   (PID)-D-lambda controllers. It requires special considerations for
   real-time implementations as it is prone to numerical instability. In
   this paper, for design and tuning of fractional regulators, we propose
   two methods.The first method relies on Nyquist stability criterion and
   stability margins. We base the second on parametric optimization via
   Simulated Annealing of multiple performance indicators. We illustrate
   our methods with a case study of the PI lambda D controller for the
   Magnetic Levitation System. We illustrate our methods' efficiency with
   both simulations and experimental verification in both nominal and
   disturbed operation.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Scanning Acoustic Microscopy (SAM) is shown here for the first time to
   be suitable for the visualization of defects like electrolyte leakage,
   faulty electrodes and gas accumulation inside coin and pouch battery
   cells. These failures are detected through the local atypical reflection
   of acoustic waves at faulty interfaces. Individual images are produced
   from the reflected wavefronts obtained at specific time delays allowing
   additionally information about the depth of the investigated failures.
   This fast and non-destructive visualization tool can be used for the
   quality control of battery cells during their production, contributing
   to a fast and economic screening of new materials or new production
   steps. SAM also brings a valuable contribution on the assistance in
   choosing representative spots of the battery for post-mortem analyses.
   SAM is in its infancy regarding the characterization of batteries.
   Fields for further development are suggested and discussed here.}},

Abstract = {{The idea of this manuscript is to convert nonlinear positive position
   feedback (PPF) controllers with symmetric cross-ply composite
   piezoelectric laminated plates among mixed excitations. A new six
   degrees of freedom model simulating nonlinear vibrations (NVs) of a
   composite plate has proposed. The perturbation technique has used to
   study the transient and steady-state response of nonlinear dynamic
   equations that presented the main system. The stability of the system
   via frequency response curves (FRCs) and force response curves (FRCs)
   have discussed and calculated. The effect on every coefficient's system
   has considered numerically. A comparison has been made between PPF
   controller and another control Nonlinear Saturation Control (NSC) to
   show the amount of vibration reduction produced by the system using PPF
   control is better than that NSC. Numerical outcomes show that PPF
   methods have big effects on reducing vibrations of the amplitudes. Then,
   the predictions from numerical simulations are in excellent harmony with
   frequency response curves. Lastly, the comparison with newly available
   papers has been reported. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem and a leading cause
   of hospitalization in western countries. Over the past decades, the goal
   has been to find the best method for monitoring congestive symptoms to
   prevent hospitalizations. Addressing this task through regular physician
   visits, blood tests, and imaging has proven insufficient for optimal
   control and has not decreased enough HF-related hospitalization rates.
   In recent years, new devices have been developed for this reason and
   CardioMEMS is one of the therapeutic monitoring options. CardioMEMS has
   shown to be effective in preventing and reducing HF hospitalizations in
   patients both with HF with reduced ejection fraction and HF with
   preserved ejection fraction. CardioMEMS' versatility has made it a great
   option for pulmonary artery pressure monitoring, both during the
   coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic and when the clinic visits
   have (partially) resumed. CardioMEMS is the remote haemodynamic
   monitoring system with the most evidence-driven efficacy, and COVID-19
   has put it in the spot as a centre-stage technology for HF monitoring.
   In a few months of the COVID-19 epidemic, CardioMEMS has grown to
   maturity, making it the new normal for high-quality, high-value remote
   HF care.}},

Title = {{Genetic and molecular evidence for complement dysregulation in patients
   with HELLP syndrome}},
Journal = {{THROMBOSIS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{196}},
Pages = {{167-174}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: HELLP (Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets)
   syndrome is a severe and acute pregnancy-related disorder that occurs in
   approximately 2.5 per 1000 deliveries and represents a major cause of
   maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. This syndrome has been
   suggested to be a microangiopathy and delivery is the only effective
   treatment.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the pathophysiology
   of HELLP syndrome by simultaneously exploring complement, haemostasis,
   autoimmunity and inflammation in relation to the clinical outcome.
   Methods: We investigated 19 HELLP patients at the time of diagnosis and
   3 months after delivery, for complement function, haemostasis and
   inflammation with immunoenzymatic methods. Complement-related gene
   variants were also analyzed by next generation sequencing and multiplex
   ligation-dependent probe amplification. Nineteen age-matched healthy
   pregnant women served as controls.
   Results: At diagnosis, HELLP patients, compared to controls, showed
   significantly higher plasma levels of SC5b-9 (median 710 ng/ml {[}range
   216-1499] vs 253 ng/ml {[}19-371], P < 0.0001) and of C5a (20.8 ng/ml
   {[}5.6-27.5] vs 12.7 ng/ml {[}3.2-24.6]; P = 0.004), which decreased
   three months after delivery (SC5b9: 190 ng/ml {[}83-446] vs 160 ng/ml
   {[}107-219]; C5a: 9.28 ng/ml {[}2.3-21.6] vs 10.7 ng/ml {[}2.5-21.2]). A
   significantly higher frequency of genetic variants involving complement
   regulatory genes was also observed (52.6\% vs 15.8\%; P = 0.016).
   Moreover, at HELLP diagnosis, patients showed increased coagulation
   markers (fragment F1 + 2 and D-dimer; P = 0.0001) while both patients
   and controls had high thrombin-generation potential that decreased after
   delivery.
   Conclusions: In the pathophysiology of HELLP syndrome, complement
   dysregulation, in addition to coagulation activation, is involved and
   may represent a potential target for treatment with the aim of delaying
   delivery.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Engagement in regular physical activity (PA) is a
   cornerstone prevention strategy for individuals at risk of developing
   type 2 diabetes. Interventions targeting PA often fail to result in
   long-term behaviour changes. ``Small Steps for Big Changes{''} is a
   3-week diabetes prevention program that promotes PA behaviour changes in
   individuals with prediabetes through motivational interviewing informed
   counselling.
   Methods: In this study, we aimed to: a) profile patterns of women's
   perceived PA journey over 1 year and b) understand strategies used to
   engage in and maintain PA. Fourteen women (mean age, 60 years) engaged
   in 4 semistructured interviews (preprogram, postprogram and 3 and 12
   months postprogram) over 1 year (56 total interviews). A trajectory
   approach was used, coupled with a deductive-inductive thematic analysis.
   Findings are presented descriptively and chronologically over 1 year.
   Results: To address the first study aim, 4 patterns emerged: a)
   consistently inactive: minimal change; b) increase and maintenance of PA
   levels; c) peak in and maintenance of PA levels and d) consistently
   active: minimal increase, yet maintenance. Generally, women reported
   higher PA levels after completing the Small Steps for Big Changes
   program compared with preprogram levels. Related to the second aim, a
   range of facilitators and barriers were identified, as well as
   strategies used to facilitate engagement in and maintenance of PA over 1
   year. Participants reporting more strategies to engage in PA were more
   likely to engage in PA. Commonly used strategies include being
   self-compassionate and practicing self regulatory techniques (e.g.
   goal-setting, planning, self-monitoring).
   Conclusions: Diabetes prevention programs that assist participants in
   utilizing relevant PA strategies during an intervention may witness
   long-term maintenance of PA behaviour. (c) 2020 Canadian Diabetes

Title = {{Foreign Object Insertion in Sexual Homicide: A New Perspective}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE}},
Abstract = {{Foreign object insertion (FOI) is considered as an unusual behavior and
   has been defined as the involuntary insertion of any object, by another
   individual, into any orifice of the victim. Although there is some
   research on the prevalence and nature of FOI in sexual homicides, there
   is very little on the characteristics of cases where FOI occurs, and no
   previous research has compared cases with and without FOI. Given the
   lack of research on FOI in general and the dissemination of untested
   ideas regarding the correlates of this behavior specifically, the
   current study aims to shine new light on sexual homicide cases involving
   FOI by examining the offender, victim, and crime characteristics
   associated with FOI. Using a sample of 662 cases of sexual homicide,
   chi-square and logistic regression analyses were used to compare cases
   with and without FOI. Results showed that offenders who experienced
   sexual dysfunction and victims who used alcohol/drugs prior to the crime
   were more likely to be involved in cases with FOI. Cases where victims
   were beaten, vaginal/anal fisting acts were perpetrated, and mutilation
   of genitals were observed, were more likely to show evidence of FOI.
   Finally, postmortem sexual activities and the use of strategies by
   offenders to avoid police detection were also more likely to occur in
   sexual homicide cases characterized by FOI. These findings are discussed
   in light of the literature on sexual homicide, the vulnerability of
   victims, and the manifestation of sadism. Practical implications are
   also discussed.}},

Title = {{Temperature monitoring of tumor hyperthermal treatments with optical
   fibers: comparison of distributed and quasi-distributed techniques}},
Journal = {{OPTICAL FIBER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{60}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Optical fiber based sensors capable of measuring temperature
   distribution over a given length are particularly attractive in the
   biomedical field, especially in the case of real-time monitoring of
   minimally invasive hyperthermal treatments of tumors, such as laser
   ablation, given their intrinsic multiplexing along a single fiber span
   and the unique properties of optical fibers in terms of flexibility,
   size and electromagnetic compatibility. The paper compares two sensing
   approaches: one is based on an array of Bragg gratings inscribed in the
   core of a single-mode fiber, the other detects Rayleigh backscattering
   from an unmodified single-mode fiber using coherent optical frequency
   domain reflectometry. Following an introduction, which describes the
   most distinctive features of the two approaches, the paper presents
   three comparative experiments, each devised to highlight a peculiar
   aspect of the sensors. In the first experiment the sensors are exposed
   to various constant temperature distributions to evaluate the uniformity
   of the readings along the fiber length. In the second experiment, a
   known temperature profile is generated through an ad hoc setup to
   evaluate the actual capability of the two approaches to reconstruct the
   temperature distribution. Finally, in the third experiment the two
   sensors are employed in a simulated tumor laser ablation procedure to
   measure the temperature distribution in the irradiated area. Both
   sensors provide results whose error, mainly due to cross sensitivity
   between temperature and strain, is acceptable for the considered
   biomedical application.}},

Title = {{Reimbursement for Hip Fractures: The Impact of Varied Current Procedural
   Terminology Coding Using Relative Value Units}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{35}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Many orthopedic practices routinely code hip fracture
   hemiarthroplasty as Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) 27125 even
   though 27236 is the correct CPT code. Our objective is to determine the
   financial impact this simple mistake has on surgeon reimbursement.
   Methods: Our data comprised cases assigned International Classification
   of Diseases, Tenth Revision code S72.001A through S72.035A and CPT code
   27125 or 27236 within the American College of Surgeons National Surgical
   Quality Improvement Program 2016-2017 database. Relative value units
   (RVUs) per CPT code and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
   reported that RVU conversion factor of \$36.0896 per 1 RVU was used to
   calculate reimbursement per case. The dollar difference and percent
   difference per case was then calculated between cases assigned CPT code
   27125 and those assigned 27236.
   Results: Our total sample consisted of 12,287 National Surgical Quality
   Improvement Program cases. Of those, 4185 (34\%) were cases of a hip
   fracture treated with hemiarthroplasty that were incorrectly coded as
   CPT code 27125. That error in coding results in a decrease in
   reimbursement of \$35.01 per case, a 5.51\% difference.
   Conclusion: Since the current healthcare reimbursement model relies
   solely on CPT codes to determine RVUs, it is imperative that orthopedic
   surgeons understand the financial impact of incorrect coding. Although
   correct coding of hemiarthroplasty procedures for hip fractures is an
   easy task to fix in the future, we hope that through this study a
   greater emphasis is placed on coding in orthopedic surgery. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Since its discovery by Hitchin in 1987, G-Hitchin systems for a
   reductive complex Lie group G have extensively been studied. For
   example, the generic fibers are nowadays well-understood. In this paper,
   we show that the smooth parts of G-Hitchin systems for a simple adjoint
   complex Lie group G are isomorphic to non-compact Calabi-Yau integrable
   systems extending results by Diaconescu-Donagi-Pantev. Moreover, we
   explain how Langlands duality for Hitchin systems is related to
   Poincare-Verdier duality of the corresponding families of
   quasi-projective Calabi-Yau threefolds. Even though the statement is
   holomorphic-symplectic, our proof is Hodge-theoretic. It is based on
   polarizable variations of Hodge structures that admit so-called abstract
   Seiberg-Witten differentials. These ensure that the associated Jacobian
   fibration is an algebraic integrable system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a combined extreme learning machine variable
   steepest gradient ascent (ELMVSGA) maximum power point tracking (MPPT)
   for a photovoltaic (PV) system. A pioneering attempt is made to develop
   the ELMVSGA technique which combines the tracking ability of variable
   steepest gradient ascent and the accuracy of a noniterative artificial
   neural network. An effort is made for the first time to apply a new
   proportional integral fractional order integral (PI-FOI) cascade
   controller in the MPPT. Controller gains and other parameters are
   optimized using a new metaheuristic salp swarm algorithm (SSA). The
   proposed ELMVSGA along with SSA optimized PI-FOI cascade controller is
   simulated using MATLAB/Simulink under various climate conditions with
   gradual and step change in irradiance and temperature, partial shading
   condition (PSC). Comprehensive analysis with perturb and observe (P\&O)
   and two recently MPPT algorithms P\&O-PI, fractional order incremental
   conductance technique have been carried out. The result has shown the
   proposed algorithm provides better tracking ability than others.
   Furthermore, to access its effectiveness in tracking the proposed
   controller is tested with real time seasonal climate data conditions.
   Under PV uncertainties it has shown a better tracking ability to track
   the maximum power point with greater accuracy.}},

Title = {{Variance-guided attention-based twin deep network for cross-spectral
   periocular recognition}},
Journal = {{IMAGE AND VISION COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{104}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Periocular region is considered as an important biometric trait due to
   its ease of collectability and high acceptability in our society. Recent
   advancements in surveillance applications require infra-red (IR) sensing
   equipments to be deployed in order to capture the activities occurring
   in low-light conditions. This gives rise to the problem of matching
   periocular images in heterogeneous environments as it is difficult to
   avail large enrollment datasets in IR modality within a short span of
   time. Although a number of approaches have studied cross-spectral
   matching of periocular images where a probe IR image is matched against
   enrolled dataset images in visible (VIS) domain and vice versa,
   significant amount of challenges still exists for such matching. In this
   paper, we propose an attention-based twin deep convolutional neural
   network (CNN) with shared parameters in order to match the periocular
   images in heterogeneous modality. We introduce a novel variance-guided
   objective function in conjunction with the attention module in order to
   guide the network to focus more into the relevant regions of the
   periocular images. The weights of the twin model based on the new
   objective function are learned so as to reduce the intra-class variance
   and to increase the inter-class variance of the cross-spectral image
   pairs. Ablation studies and experimental results on three publicly
   available cross-spectral periocular datasets containing images from VIS,
   near-infrared (NIR), and night vision domains show that the proposed
   deep network achieves the stateof-the-art recognition performances on
   all three datasets. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: An important component in the management of schizophrenia
   is insight. Schizophrenia patients that lack insight have poor clinical
   outcomes. Chronic patients of chronic schizophrenia lacking insight more
   often require hospitalisation than those recognising their illness. Poor
   insight is a good indicator of poor compliance and can predict the
   prognosis of any psychiatric patient including schizophrenia.
   Aim: This study was aimed at contrasting the gain in insight after
   treatment among various sub-groups of patients with schizophrenia.
   Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the
   Acharya Vinobha Bhave Rural Hospital, Wradha, Maharashtra. The sample
   size was collected for a period of 1 year, during which all the patients
   admitted to the psychiatry ward were screened, of which 100 eligible
   patients with schizophrenia were identified using prespecified inclusion
   and exclusion criteria. Patients of both sexes aged above 18 years and
   attendants that provided consent were included in the study. The
   Schedule for Assessment of Insight Scale (SAI) was used to determine the
   patient's level of insight. The proportion of patients with distinct
   socio-demographic characteristics, clinical profile, psychiatric
   diagnosis and SAI scores were calculated. A paired t-test was used for
   elaborating the results. The p-value <0.05 was considered significant.
   Results: The changes in insight scores from the time of admission (4.15)
   to the time of discharge (9.28) were statistically significant and
   similar in both males and females and results didn't vary according to
   marital status. Significant improvement was seen in patients
   irrespective of their employment status or their educational status.
   Conclusion: This study showed that the insight changes as the patient
   improves during the hospital stay. This study highlights that poor
   insight is commonly seen in psychotic patients and the treatment
   considerably improves their insight.}},

   serum levels of pentaxin (PTX3) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) with
   systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) susceptibility and disease activity.
   Methods: 50 SLE patients and 50 apparently healthy subjects serving as
   control group were included in this study; they were subjected to full
   history and clinical examinations and lab investigations including
   assessment of serum levels of PTX3, IL-1B using ELISA technique. Genomic
   DNA for IL-1 beta polymorphism was extracted from the peripheral blood
   of patients and controls for identification of IL-1 beta polymorphisms
   (-511T/C (rs16944) and +3954C/T (rs1143634)) using Real-time PCR.
   Results: Serum levels of PTX3 and IL1 beta were significantly higher in
   cases (8.2 ng/mL \& 45.9 pg/mL respectively) when compared to control
   group (5.4 ng/mL \& 41 pg/mL respectively). Regarding rs16944; TT
   genotype and T allele showed significantly higher frequency in SLE when
   compared to the control group (p = 0.005, <0.001 respectively) with
   susceptibility to develop SLE (OR = 4.125, 3.245 respectively). PTX3
   level was higher in rs1143634 CT + CC when compared to TT; rs16944 TC +
   TT when compared to CC. serum levels of IL1 beta increased gradually in
   rs1143634 TT, CT, CC respectively; and in rs16944 CC, TC, TT
   respectively with significant differences between genotypes. Linear
   regression analysis was conducted for prediction of higher SLEDAI,
   rs16944 (TC + TT), higher PTX3 and IL1 beta were significantly
   associated with higher SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) in univariate
   analysis, the multivariable analysis revealed that PTX3 and IL1 beta
   were independent predictors for higher SLEDAI.
   Conclusion: Serum PTX3 and IL1 beta levels were significantly elevated
   in SLE patients when compared to controls and they were associated with
   high disease activity. TT genotype and T allele of rs16944 was
   associated with increased susceptibility to SLE development, higher
   disease activity and high PTX3 and IL-1 beta serum levels.}},

Title = {{The Effect of Glutathione Peroxidase-1 Knockout on Anticancer Drug
   Sensitivities and Reactive Oxygen Species in Haploid HAP-1 Cells}},
Journal = {{ANTIOXIDANTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{The role of glutathione peroxidases (GPx) in cancer and their influence
   on tumor prognosis and the development of anticancer drug resistance has
   been extensively and controversially discussed. The aim of this study
   was to evaluate the influence of GPx1 expression on anticancer drug
   cytotoxicity. For this purpose, a GPx1 knockout of the near-haploid
   human cancer cell line HAP-1 was generated and compared to the native
   cell line with regards to morphology, growth and metabolic rates, and
   oxidative stress defenses. Furthermore, the IC50 values of two peroxides
   and 16 widely used anticancer drugs were determined in both cell lines.
   Here we report that the knockout of GPx1 in HAP-1 cells has no
   significant effect on cell size, viability, growth and metabolic rates.
   Significant increases in the cytotoxic potency of hydrogen peroxide and
   tert-butylhydroperoxide, the anticancer drugs cisplatin and carboplatin
   as well as the alkylating agents lomustine and temozolomide were found.
   While a concentration dependent increases in intracellular reactive
   oxygen species (ROS) levels were observed for both HAP-1 cell lines
   treated with either cisplatin, lomustine or temozolamide, no significant
   enhancement in ROS levels was observed in the GPx1 knockout compared to
   the native cell line except at the highest concentration of
   temozolamide. On the other hand, a ca. 50\% decrease in glutathione
   levels was noted in the GPx1 knockout relative to the native line,
   suggesting that factors other than ROS levels alone play a role in the
   increased cytotoxic activity of these drugs in the GPx1 knockout cells.}},

Abstract = {{The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
   coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is rapidly spreading across the globe due to
   its contagion nature. We hereby report the baseline permanent levels of
   two most toxic air pollutants in top ranked mega cities of India. This
   could be made possible for the first time due to the unprecedented
   COVID-19 lockdown emission scenario. The study also unfolds the
   association of COVID-19 with different environmental and weather
   markers. Although there are numerous confounding factors for the
   pandemic, we find a strong association of COVID-19 mortality with
   baseline PM2.5 levels (80\% correlation) to which the population is
   chronically exposed and may be considered as one of the critical
   factors. The COVID-19 morbidity is found to be moderately
   anti-correlated with maximum temperature during the pandemic period
   (-56\%). Findings although preliminary but provide a first line of
   information for epidemiologists and may be useful for the development of
   effective health risk management policies.}},

   South Lake, all located in the southern Mediterranean Sea. The
   accumulation of cadmium. lead. copper. iron and zinc was higher in the
   digestive glandsof clams collected from the MCA and the HCA than in
   those from the ICA, particularly during the warm season. Our results
   reveal that metallothionein, lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation
   levels and antioxidant defence systems were higher, while
   acetylcholinesterase activity was lower, in clams from the MCAand HCA
   than in those from the LCA. The results also indicate that clams from
   the MCA and the HCA are characterized by histological alterations and
   DNA damage. In conclusion, the evident changes of antioxidant defence
   systems and macromolecules between the studied lagoons reveal the
   perturbation of the physiological states of clams from polluted sites
   that cope with seasonal changes and trace element accumulations.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to appraise the role of local institutions in
   adaptation to changing climate at the local level in the Bilate Basin
   Agropastoral Livelihood Zone of Ethiopia. Thirty-one years of climate
   data were analyzed by employing the Mann-Kendall trend and Sen's slope
   test techniques. The survey was conducted on 400 households that were
   systematically randomized from 7066 households, while community-level
   data were collected through the participatory rural appraisal (PRA)
   technique. The entire analysis was framed by a tetragonal model. The
   results of the analysis indicated that temperature exhibited a
   significantly increasing trend, while rainfall, which is statistically
   related to temperature, showed a decreasing trend, resulting in
   lingering droughts and human and animal diseases. Major livestock
   declined by 69\%. As a response, while Sidama indigenous institutions
   were well-functioning and nurtured through local knowledge, and the
   governmental and civic ones were entrenched with various limitations.
   Contextual fitness and compatibility, interplay, inclusiveness, and
   sustainability of their operations in temporal and spatial scales were
   some of their limitations. Therefore, federal and local governments
   should focus on monitoring, evaluating, and learning aspects of their
   grand strategies, review general education, farmers' credit, and civic
   institutions' governance policies and strengthen the synergy of civic,
   government, and indigenous institutions.}},

Abstract = {{Materials with a positive temperature coefficient have many
   applications, including overcharge and over-temperature protection in
   lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. The thermoresistive properties of an
   electrically conductive polymer, based on a Ni(salen)-type backbone,
   known as polyNiMeOSalen, were evaluated by means of in situ resistivity
   measurements. It was found that the polymer was conductive at
   temperatures below 220 degrees C; however, the polymer increased in
   resistivity by three orders of magnitude upon reaching 250 degrees C.
   Thermogravimetric results combined with elemental analyses revealed that
   the switch from the insulation stage to the conductive stage resulted
   from thermally dedoping the polymer. Electrochemical studies
   demonstrated that a polymer retains its electroactivity when it is
   heated and can be recovered to a conductive state through oxidation via
   electrochemical doping in an electrolyte solution.}},

Title = {{Fentanyl panic goes viral: The spread of misinformation about overdose
   risk from casual contact with fentanyl in mainstream and social media}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{86}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Fueled by misinformation, fentanyl panic has harmed public
   health through complicating overdose rescue while rationalizing
   hyper-punitive criminal laws, wasteful expenditures, and proposals to
   curtail vital access to pain pharmacotherapy. To assess misinformation
   about health risk from casual contact with fentanyl, we characterize its
   diffusion and excess visibility in mainstream and social media.
   Methods: We used Media Cloud to compile and characterize mainstream and
   social media content published between January 2015 and September 2019
   on overdose risk from casual fentanyl exposure.
   Results: Relevant content appeared in 551 news articles spanning 48
   states. Misinformed media reports received approximately 450,000
   Facebook shares, potentially reaching nearly 70,000,000 users from
   2015-2019. Amplified by erroneous government statements, misinformation
   received excess social media visibility by a factor of 15 compared to
   corrective content, which garnered fewer than 30,000 shares with
   potential reach of 4,600,000 Facebook users.
   Conclusion: Health-related misinformation continues to proliferate
   online, hampering responses to public health crises. More
   evidence-informed tools are needed to effectively challenge misinformed
   narratives in mainstream and social media.}},

   depletion}},
Journal = {{PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY}},

Volume = {{157}},

Abstract = {{An efficient purification of recombinant proteins often requires a high
   ratio of recombinant to host proteins. In plants,
   Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) is the most
   abundant leaf protein, thus strongly impacting purification yield. Here,
   we describe a simple and robust purification procedure for recombinant
   proteins based on a differential precipitation of RuBisCO. In this
   context, four Legume lectin domains of Arabidopsis thaliana which belong
   to receptor-like kinases and cell wall proteins were produced from
   Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. The recombinant proteins exhibit a unique
   lectin domain consisting of around 250 amino acid residues with several
   predicted N-glycosylation sites and a six His-tag at the N-terminus.
   After ammonium sulphate precipitation of total soluble proteins,
   depletion of RuBisCO was obtained using citrate and succinate buffers
   during the salting-in step: this depletion was pH-dependent and the
   presence of di- or tri-carboxylic acids was required. The depleted
   protein extracts were then subjected to two chromatographic steps which
   were used in the negative mode to submit a protein fraction enriched as
   much as possible in recombinant lectin domains to a third
   chromatographic step (immobilized metal-ion chromatography). Three of
   the Legume lectin domains were purified near to homogeneity and revealed
   multiple N-glycosylation isoforms, particularly those from receptor-like
   kinases, which were characterised using specific lectins and
   deglycosylation enzymes. The production and purification of recombinant
   lectin domains will facilitate their biochemical characterisation in the
   context of cell-to-cell signalling and cell wall organisation.}},

Abstract = {{Supraventricular tachyarrhythmia (SVT) is the most common type of
   arrhythmia in childhood. Management can be challenging with an
   associated risk of mortality. A female neonate was diagnosed with
   episodes of SVT, controlled antenatally with digoxin. Flecainide was
   commenced prophylactically at birth. Despite treatment, the infant
   developed a narrow complex tachycardia at 5 days of age. The
   electrocardiogram features were suggestive of either re-entry
   tachycardia or of automatic atrial tachycardia (AAT). Following several
   unsuccessful treatments, a wide complex tachycardia developed. A
   transesophageal electrophysiological study led to a diagnosis of AAT.
   Stable sinus rhythm was finally achieved through increasing daily
   administrations of flecainide up to six times a day, in association with
   nadolol. The shortening of intervals to this extent has never been
   reported before and supports the evidence of a personal, age-specific
   variability in pharmacokinetics of flecainide. Larger studies are needed
   to better define the appropriate dose and timing of administration.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Rehabilitation following an anterior cruciate ligament
   reconstruction (ACLR) will allow the patient to regain his functional
   capacities and support him in the resumption of sports activity.
   Rehabilitation also aims to minimize the recurrence risk, ensuring the
   good development of the patient's muscular capacities until returning to
   sport. Isokinetisin allows the strengthening and evaluation of this
   muscular strength of the thigh muscle groups. Still, controversy exists
   about its use by resistance to knee extension in the open kinetic chain,
   which would cause the graft's distension. This study aims to determine
   the influence of muscle strengthening of the quadriceps in the open
   kinetic chain by using isokinetism on the possible laxity of the
   anterior cruciate ligament and being able to develop risk factors for
   it.
   Methods; The study is based on a population having benefited from an
   ACLR with a hamstring graft six months postoperatively. Two groups are
   differentiated; one group exposed to isokinetic during their
   rehabilitation, the other group, undergoing rehabilitation without the
   use of isokinetism is the unexposed group. An anterior knee laxity test
   is performed six months postoperatively using the unexposed group.
   According to the same protocol, the anterior knee laxity test is
   performed 6 months post-operatively using all subjects' GNRB (R)
   machine. The test results underwent statistical analysis to determine
   the relative risk of plastic surgery for each study group.
   Results: Comparing each groups results by a univariate analysis did not
   reveal any significant results. Multivariate analysis to show
   interactions between the study groups. It was found that the use of
   isokinetism would seem not to affect the risk of developing distension
   for the majority of subjects in the exposed group. A tendency towards
   protection was found for exposed subjects aged between 25 and 35
   regarding the graft's distension. Also, a tendency to protection was
   found in the exposed subjects regarding an alteration of the graft
   leading to an anatomically comparable difference.
   Conclusion: The use of isokinetism does not seem to cause distension of
   the graft in patients operated on ACLR when this method is introduced
   three months postoperatively.}},

   located at a distance from the plasma is accompanied by the activation
   of proliferative processes, as evidenced by the tendency of the activity
   of mitochondrial biogenesis and fission/fusion processes to increase.

Title = {{Heparan sulfate binds the extracellular Annexin A1 and blocks its
   effects on pancreatic cancer cells}},
Journal = {{BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{182}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In pancreatic cancer (PC) progression the protein Annexin A1 (ANXA1) has
   been described as oncogenic factor. Thus, the need to inhibit its
   action, mainly the extracellular form, has become an appealing cue for
   the anti-cancer research. Heparan sulfate (HS) is a glycosaminoglycan of
   the extracellular matrix known to bind several molecules, as growth
   factors and cytokines, generating a kind of reservoir in the
   extracellular environment.
   Here, we started our study by showing the physical calcium-dependent
   interaction between HS and ANXA1 as both full-length protein and
   N-terminal portion, Ac2-26 by biophysical techniques. HS is able to
   inhibit the migration/invasion process of human PC MIA PaCa-2 cells and
   partially revert their mesenchymal phenotype as reported through the
   expression of specific protein markers and the growth in colonies and in
   3D-spheroids. Furthermore, both on MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells, HS
   blocks the effects of Ac2-26, which enhances the aggressive behavior of
   PC cells if added alone. These effects appear evident also on
   endothelial cells whose activation is promoted by Ac2-26 but not in
   presence of HS. Thus, the interference of the interaction ANXA1-HS on
   angiogenesis strongly emerges. Moreover, once sequestered by HS, ANXA1
   is not more able to bind the formil-peptide receptors (FPRs) preventing
   the increase of calcium mobilization, peculiar for cell motility.
   These findings introduce a new important tale in the knowledge about the
   inhibition of the ANXA1 action in PC development. Further information
   will be useful to highlight the interaction of HS with the protein,
   focusing on the characterization of the glycosaminoglycan and on in vivo
   assays.}},

Journal = {{IMMUNOLOGY LETTERS}},

Volume = {{228}},
Pages = {{70-75}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: The outcome ofhepatitis B (HBV) infection is influenced by
   immune responses and host genetics. Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a
   determinant factor in controlling the balance of Th1/Th2 during
   antiviral response. Weexamine themle of two functional polymorphisms
   -607A/C and-137A/C inIL-18 gene with risk of chronic HBV infection.
   Methods and Results: Genomic DNA isolates were obtained from 200
   seropositive cases stratified according to their HBV DNA loads, and 200
   blood donorsas a control population. Genotypes of the two polymorphisms
   were identified by ARMS-PCR method. The -607A allele, the-607AA and
   -607AC genotypes were associated with increased risk to develop chronic
   HBV infection (1.98, 5.11 and 3.5-fold risks, respectively). By
   contrast, the -137C minor allele and CG genotype had protected effects
   against chronic HBV infection.
   We found that -607A allele, -607AA and -607AC genotypes were
   significantly more frequent in patient's group with high HBV DNA levels
   compared to patient group with low HBV DNA level. Additionally, they
   were associated with increased 1.72, 6.04 and 3.28-fold risk of high HBV
   DNA replication.
   Patients carrying ``-607A/-137 C{''} or ``-607A/-137 G{''} haplotypes
   presented a high risk to develop chronic HBV infection (OR = 3.27; OR =
   4.32, respectively).
   Conclusions: Taken together, our data suggest that theIL-18 -607A/C
   functional polymorphism was associated with susceptibility to enhanced
   replicative form of HBV DNA in chronic infection.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of ReviewGaming disorder can play a role in child and adolescent
   psychopathology, as research has associated gaming disorder with a range
   of negative psychosocial outcomes. Since any dysfunctional behavior can
   have important long-term consequences, approaches to prevent gaming
   behavior in youth from becoming problematic are clearly called for. In
   this paper, we discuss some of the risk factors that have been
   associated with gaming disorder in youth.Recent FindingsPotential risk
   factors for gaming disorder in youth include attention problems, emotion
   dysregulation, problematic family relationships, and in-game needs
   satisfaction at the expense of needs satisfaction in daily life. These
   factors are related not only to gaming disorders but also to some of the
   other mental health issues that gaming disorder has been associated
   with.SummaryPossible prevention strategies could focus on reducing
   attentional and cognitive issues among youth, which could be implemented
   in school settings via group training sessions. Approaches targeting
   emotion regulation skills would also be useful. Early intervention to
   alleviate poor family functioning could also be considered.}},

Title = {{Effects of a Text Messaging Smoking Cessation Intervention Among Online
   Help Seekers and Primary Health Care Visitors in Sweden: Protocol for a
   Randomized Controlled Trial Using a Bayesian Group Sequential Design}},
Journal = {{JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: A steady decline of the smoking prevalence in Sweden has
   been recorded over the past decade; however, people still start and
   continue to smoke. There is a need for effective smoking cessation
   interventions that can scale to a national level and that are designed
   to reach individuals requiring smoking cessation support in the general
   population.
   Objective: Previous randomized controlled trials of smoking cessation
   interventions among high school and university students in Sweden have
   found consistent evidence that text messaging interventions are
   effective in helping students quit smoking. However, there are no
   studies that investigate the effects of text messaging interventions in
   a more general population. The objective of this study is to estimate
   the effects of a text messaging intervention on individuals seeking help
   to quit online and individuals visiting primary health care units.
   Methods: A 2-arm, parallel-group (1:1), randomized controlled trial will
   be employed to address the study objectives. The trial will follow a
   Bayesian group sequential design. Recruitment will be conducted using
   online advertisement (Google, Bing, and Facebook) and through health
   care professionals at primary health care units. All participants will
   receive treatment as usual; however, participants who are allocated to
   the intervention arm will also be given access to a 12-week text message
   smoking cessation intervention. Primary outcomes are 8-week prolonged
   abstinence and 4-week point prevalence, measured 3 months and 6 months
   postrandomization. Mediator variables (self-efficacy, importance, and
   know-how) will be measured to estimate causal mediation models.
   Results: Recruitment commenced in September 2020 and will not exceed 24
   months. This means that a complete dataset will be available at the
   latest towards the end of 2022. We expect to publish the findings from
   this trial by June 2023.
   Conclusions: This trial will further our understanding of the effects of
   text messaging interventions among a more general population than has
   previously been studied. We also aim to learn about differential effects
   between those who seek support online and those who are given
   facilitated support at primary health care units. Trial recruitment is
   limited to the Swedish population; however, a strength of this study is
   the pragmatic way in which participants are recruited. Through online
   advertisements, individuals are recruited in reaction to their own
   interest in seeking help to quit. At primary health care units,
   individuals who were not necessarily looking for smoking cessation
   support are given information about the trial. This closely mimics the
   way the intervention would be disseminated in a real-world setting and
   may therefore strengthen the argument of generalizability of findings.}},

Title = {{A route to improving elongation of high-temperature laser sintered PEKK}},
Journal = {{ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{36}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Laser sintering (LS) is one of the most popular additive manufacturing
   (AM) techniques as it produces parts of complex geometry with high
   dimensional accuracy and good mechanical strength. However, the nature
   of the LS process often leads to brittle behavior characterized by a low
   elongation at break if compared to conventional polymer processing
   techniques, e.g., injection molding (IM). For poly(ether ketone ketone)
   (PEKK), such elongation is currently below 3\%. This study determines
   and then optimizes the relationship between cooling time and
   crystallization of PEKK during LS and the resulting elongation at break.
   The elongation at break of PEKK was successfully improved by using
   shorter cooling times. The combination of the slow crystallization
   kinetics of PEKK and a short cooling time of 1 h increased elongation at
   break to 14\%; this is a striking result never achieved for PAEKs in LS
   before. A calibration curve was developed that can be used to correlate
   PEKK structure and mechanical properties to cooling conditions according
   to the application. This methodology can also be applied to select and
   optimize the mechanical properties of other LS polymers sharing similar
   kinetics of crystallization and processing temperatures. This work
   suggests a great potential for a wide range of ``post-processing{''}
   heat treatments to be used in AM to tailor the ultimate mechanical
   properties.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives:To evaluate maternal and fetal Leptin and IL33 concentrations
   in pregnancy complicated by obesity and preeclampsia. Study design:A
   case-control study including 35 subjects with obesity (18 normotensive
   and 17 preeclamptic) and 47 normal weight controls (42 normotensive and
   5 preeclamptic). Main outcome measures:Leptin and IL33 concentrations in
   maternal serum during pregnancy and in cord blood; uterine artery and
   umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry. Results:Subjects with obesity who
   developed preeclampsia had higher first trimester maternal (41.5,
   interquartile range (IQR) = 15.7-65.1 ng/ml) Leptin concentrations
   compared to either normal weight with (25, IQR = 20.4-25.8 ng/ml) and
   without hypertension (14.26, IQR = 8.2-22.8) (p< .05) or normotensive
   subjects with obesity (30.3, IQR = 10.4-38.4) (p< .05). Subjects with
   obesity who developed preeclampsia (2.4, IQR = 1.7-3.2 pg/ml) or not
   (1.4, IQR = 0.8-2 pg/ml) had lower first trimester maternal IL33 levels
   when compared to controls without hypertension (4.8, IQR = 2.9-5.9
   pg/ml) (p< .001). Cord blood Leptin and IL33 concentrations were
   significantly correlated to third trimester maternal concentrations
   (Spearman rho = 0.51,p< .001 and Spearman rho = 0.68,p< .001,
   respectively). Uterine artery pulsatility index (PI) were significantly
   and directly correlated with maternal Leptin levels (p< .002) and
   inversely and statistically correlated with maternal IL33 concentrations
   (p< .001). Conclusions:Compared to lean controls, pregnant subjects with
   obesity had higher serum Leptin and lower IL33 concentrations at first
   trimester and during pregnancy. This difference persisted also for those
   who later developed preeclampsia. The relationship between maternal

   their careers lacking skills crucial for success. We aimed to understand
   the professional development needs of Florida early-career Extension

   building community relationships, managing volunteers, communicating
   effectively, and other Extension-related skills are areas for which
   early-career Extension agents need professional development. These
   results suggest a need for additional development opportunities beyond
   the first year, with a professional development model that is
   continually adapted as an Extension professional's skill set changes.

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Predictive Processing Theory (PP) and its foundational Free Energy
   Principle (FEP) provide a unifying theoretical groundwork that subsumes
   theories of perception, cognition, and action. Recently Colin Klein
   (2018) contends that PP-FEP cannot explain adaptive action with the same
   force that they deal with perceptions. In his answer to the objection,
   Clark (2020) points out that FEP explains action, desire and motivation
   on the basis of minimisation of energy. I argue that this answer begs
   the question of the unifying framework of FEP. I assume that FEP-PP
   alone cannot provide an ultimately compelling explanation of action.
   However, I argue that when paired with a high level theory of
   psychology, such as Theriault et al.'s (2020) theory of social
   conformation in terms of the sense of should, the coupled theories
   provide an inclusive, symmetrical explanation of action. The symmetry of
   explanations is not a gap but a feature, on this specific occasion.}},

Title = {{Muscle-strengthening exercise and sleep quality among a nationally

Journal = {{PREVENTIVE MEDICINE REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Regular physical activity is a key modifiable non-pharmacological
   treatment to enhance sleep quality, a key predictor of optimal health
   and wellbeing. Most of the evidence on physical activity and sleep
   quality is based on studies assessing the effects of aerobic
   moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (e.g. brisk walking, cycling,
   jogging). Emerging clinical evidence suggests that muscle-strengthening
   exercise (e.g. push-ups, using weight machines) may also be beneficial
   for sleep quality. However, since no studies have examined the
   associations between muscle-strengthening exercise with sleep quality
   among a large sample of community-dwelling adults, it is currently
   unknown how these findings translate to the population level. This study
   describes the associations between the weekly frequency of
   muscle-strengthening exercise and sleep quality among a nationally
   representative sample of German adults. Data were drawn for the 2014
   German Health Update Survey (n = 23,635; >= 18 years). Validated survey
   items assessed muscle-strengthening exercise (times/week) and sleep
   quality (assessed via 4 point-scale: `very poor' to `good'). Poisson
   regression with robust error variance was used to calculate prevalence
   ratios of (PR) across weekly muscle-strengthening exercise frequency
   (None {[}reference]; 1, 2, 3-4 and >= 5 times/week), adjusting for
   potential confounders (e.g. age, sex, socioeconomic status, self-rated
   health, smoking, alcohol, aerobic physical activity). Compared with
   those reporting none, any musclestrengthening exercise was associated
   with a reduced prevalence of `poor' (PR range: 0.77-0.83) and `very
   poor' (PR range: 0.57-0.70) quality sleep. Future health behavior
   modification strategies to enhance sleep quality at the population-level
   should consider promoting muscle-strengthening exercise.}},

Abstract = {{The action of the immune response in zebrafish (Danio rerio) has been a
   target of many studies. However, the energetic demands involved in the
   immune response are poorly understood in ectothermic poikilotherms, such
   as fish. This research aims to characterize the energetic response of
   zebrafish to an immune challenge of heat-killed Vibrio anguillarum at 22
   degrees C and 27.5 degrees C. Zebrafish were either not injected,
   injected intraperitoneally with 10 mu l of saline and Freund's
   incomplete adjuvant (sham), or heat-killed Vibrio anguillarum \&
   Freund's incomplete adjuvant (1.21 x 10(10) cfu/ml). Respirometry was
   then performed on these zebrafish for a period of 27 h. Following this,
   spleen was collected for quantitative PCR analysis of the catalytic
   subunit of AMPK (ampka1 \& ampka2), the nuclear factor
   kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (nf-kb), and several
   cytokines (tnfa, il-1b, il-8, il-10). While there was no increase in
   oxygen consumption with any treatment at 22 degrees C, there was a
   marked 30\% increase in oxygen consumption in zebrafish injected with
   heat-killed Vibrio at 27.5 degrees C. Furthermore, temperature had a
   strong effect on the timing of the immune response. At 22 degrees C,
   there was a 2-3fold increase in the cytokines measured associated with
   heat-killed Vibrio injection, whereas there were no differences found at
   27.5 degrees C. Furthermore, while there was an increase in ampka2 at 22
   degrees C, there was a sharp decrease in ampka2 at 27.5 degrees C,
   although the changes in ampka2 transcript abundance could not be solely
   attributed to heat-killed Vibrio, as there were similar changes
   associated with the sham group. The results of this study demonstrate
   some of the first evidence that zebrafish increase routine metabolic
   rate associated with immune stimulation.}},

Abstract = {{The application of the Industry 4.0 ` s elements-e.g., industrial
   robots-has a key role in the efficiency improvement of manufacturing
   companies. In order to reduce cycle times and increase productivity, the
   trajectory optimization of robot arms is essential. The purpose of the
   study is the elaboration of a new ``whip-lashing{''} method, which,
   based on the motion of a robot arm, is similar to the motion of a whip.
   It results in achieving the optimized trajectory of the robot arms in
   order to increase velocity of the robot arm's parts, thereby minimizing
   motion cycle times and to utilize the torque of the joints more
   effectively. The efficiency of the method was confirmed by a case study,
   which is relating to the trajectory planning of a five-degree-of-freedom
   RV-2AJ manipulator arm using SolidWorks and MATLAB software
   applications. The robot was modelled and two trajectories were created:
   the original path and path investigate the effects of using the
   whip-lashing induced robot motion. The application of the method's
   algorithm resulted in a cycle time saving of 33\% compared to the
   original path of RV-2AJ robot arm. The main added value of the study is
   the elaboration and implementation of the newly elaborated
   ``whip-lashing{''} method which results in minimization of torque
   consumed; furthermore, there was a reduction of cycle times of
   manipulator arms' motion, thus increasing the productivity
   significantly. The efficiency of the new ``whip-lashing{''} method was
   confirmed by a simulation case study.}},

Abstract = {{In the Central Unit of the South Riffian Ridges, the Toarcian succession
   is represented by two thick terrigenous detrital formations, Sned and
   Lmachkha formations, each one is divided into two members. The lower
   member of the Sned Formation, often rich in belemnite rostra and
   ammonites of the Tenuicostatum Zone, consists of grey marlstones, with
   rare marly limestone intercalations. The upper member consists of silty
   marlstones, with frequent thin limestone beds and contains rare
   ammonites of the Serpentinus Zone. Its upper part is locally rich in
   terebratulids. The lower member of the Lmachkha Formation consists of a
   silty marlstone and silty limestone alternation, and is the richest in
   benthic macrofauna, composed of rhynchonellids, gastropods, common
   bivalves, and rare ammonites of the Bifrons Zone. Seven taxa of
   gastropods and six taxa of bivalves were recorded from this member and
   described for the first time from the study area. The upper member of
   the Lmachkha Formation consists of silty marlstone and silty limestone
   alternation, and contains rare bivalves and rare ammonites of late
   Toarcian age. The lithofacies and pelagic macrofauna of the lower member
   of the Sned Formation characterise a relative deep marine environment
   unfavourable to benthic macrofauna. The second member indicates a
   gradual decrease in sea-level allowing from its upper part the
   recurrence of benthic macrofauna, especially terebratulids. The
   lithofacies and macrofauna of the lower member of the Lmachkha Formation
   indicate a shallow terrigenous shelf environment. The second member,
   containing coral reefs in the western and southern peripheries of the
   Central Unit, characterises a still shallow marine environment. This
   significant but gradual decrease in sea-level of the Central Unit from
   the latest early Toarcian to late Toarcian is likely related to the
   acceleration of sea-floor spreading in the Central Atlantic Ocean.}},

Title = {{Micronucleus Evaluation in Exfoliated Human Buccal Epithelium Cells
   among E-Waste Workers in Payatas, the Philippines}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEALTH AND POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{28}},

Abstract = {{Background. The improper recycling of electronic waste (e-waste) by
   informal recyclers often leads to contamination of the environment.
   E-waste contains organic and inorganic compounds along with heavy metals
   and trace elements. These pollutants can have a negative effect on
   humans. Biomonitoring can provide information on the sources, amount,
   geographical distribution, and adverse health effects of contaminants.
   Objectives. The present study aimed to assess risks to the health of
   informal c-waste recyclers in Payatas, the Philippines due to their
   exposure to c-waste toxicity by examining the presence of micronuclei in
   buccal epithelium cells.
   Methodology. Frequencies of binucleated cells (BNc) and abnormal cells
   were obtained from the buccal epithelium of the study population
   composed of c-waste exposed recyclers (n=40) and a control group (n=52).
   Descriptive statistics and regression analysis were employed for the
   data analysis.
   Results. Participants' gender, occupation, smoking status, alcohol
   consumption, and the number of karyolitic cells of both groups were
   significantly associated. Only occupation in e-waste recycling and
   length of c-waste exposure were significantly associated in terms of the
   number of abnormal cells and micronuclei. Similar trends were found in
   the linear regression analysis drawn from participants' length of
   c-waste exposure with a significance of R-2=7346, indicating that as the
   length of e-waste exposure increased, the number of micronuclei found in
   the participants buccal epithelium cells increased as well.
   Conclusions. Longer exposure to c-waste materials may induce genotoxic
   damage in human cells which is a serious concern, leading to adverse
   effects to human health.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most urgent matters in current medicine is the preservation
   of antibiotic treatment options due to an increasing threat of
   antibiotic resistance in pathogenic microorganisms. Therefore,
   increasing awareness by adapted science education and communication
   regarding this topic is of the utmost importance. This article shows
   that an out-of-school laboratory course using active learning techniques
   is a valuable contribution to traditional teaching inciting personal and
   social responsibility. Attitude toward science (BRAINS), value of
   science to society (MATS), situational interest and emotions were
   tested. The participants' conception of antibiotics was evaluated by
   analysing follow-up mind maps. Generally, the laboratory course created
   positive feelings and situational interest. Compared to an
   instructor-directed frame, communication within an individually adapting
   discourse-directed frame conveyed more wide-spread perception of the
   topic, including societal and personal implications. The outcome of the
   study provides evidence that an out-of-school laboratory course can be a
   valuable tool for interest development in socio-scientific issues.
   Discourse-directed framing, in this environment, improves the individual
   ability to alter social and personal responsibility regarding science
   topics.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to use life cycle assessment to estimate
   the environmental impacts (from farm to factory gate) of the 198
   hard-coded line-items included in the food frequency questionnaire of
   the Adventist Health Study-2 survey and to assess differences among food
   groups. Life cycle inventories were created using existing data sources
   and primary data, and their global warming potential (GWP), land use,
   and water consumption impacts were assessed using the ReCiPe 2016
   methodology. In addition to presenting the impacts according to weight
   and protein content across food groups, we include the novel addition of
   presenting impacts according to the NOVA classification indicating
   various levels of processing. Food categories were compared based on one
   kilogram of edible food, protein food sources were compared based on one
   kilogram of protein, and NOVA comparisons were based on one serving. In
   general, meats had the highest environmental impacts per both weight and
   protein content, while the lowest overall impacts per kilogram came from
   fruits. Meat analogs had the lowest overall impacts per kilogram of
   protein, contrary to expectations that additional processing would
   result in higher environmental impacts when compared to whole
   plant-based foods. Per serving, ultra-processed foods had the highest
   GWP, processed foods the highest land use, and minimally processed foods
   the highest water consumption. Results from this analysis were
   consistent with other studies. Results from this study suggest that meat
   and ultra-processed foods have the overall worst environmental impacts,
   but high water consumption in some minimally processed foods means that
   those should be carefully considered as well.}},

Title = {{Coastal cliff exposure and management}},
Journal = {{OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{198}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Coastal cliffs cover about 75\% of the world's coastlines. Many of these
   cliffs suffer severe erosion problems, which are mainly caused by wave
   action and lead to important damages. The main objective of this work is
   to propose and apply a methodology to characterize and map wave exposure
   levels for the management of cliff coasts. The methodology proposed
   consists of a number of steps. First, a statistical characterization of
   the wave climate in deep water is performed. Second, relevant sea states
   are propagated towards the cliff by means of a numerical model. Then,
   the results are used to assess the distribution of significant wave
   heights and wave power along the cliff toe. Finally, four exposure
   levels are defined based on the wave power values at the cliff, and
   exposure zones are mapped accordingly along the cliff. This approach is
   illustrated with a case study - the Catedrales Cliffs and Beach, a
   tourism hotspot in Galicia (NW Spain) where erosion caused loss of human
   life. We find that exposure levels are primarily influenced by the
   nearshore bed morphology, which controls wave refraction, shoaling and
   breaking, as well as by the geometry and orientation of the cliff, with
   some parts more exposed than others to the prevailing wave direction. On
   the islets off the cliff the windward faces have a greater level of
   exposure, since the leeward faces are protected by the islets themselves
   and lower water depths. The rocky outcrops that occur at the cliff toe
   in some sections act as emerged (submerged) breakwaters under low (high)
   tide conditions, dissipating wave power and thus reducing wave exposure.
   The methodology proposed in this work enables coastal managers to
   prevent the personal and material damages derived from cliff erosion by
   focusing remedial measures where they are most needed.}},

Abstract = {{Millions of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the Philippines
   experience human rights issues during their displacement. Their rights
   and access to basic life-saving services are impacted by their forced
   movement and its resulting, often prolonged, displacement. Durable
   solutions are also less prioritised in displacement management. Though a
   legal framework on disaster governance exists, it lacked a human rights
   perspective that could integrate human rights standards into
   humanitarian support. With the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spreading
   in the country, IDPs are at a higher risk of contracting the disease due
   to inadequate shelter conditions. As the government battles both the
   spread of the virus and the need to restart the economy in a
   post-COVID-19 pandemic scenario, IDPs must be included in the national
   and local frameworks for recovery. This article discusses the situation
   of IDPs in the Philippines and looks into the policy gaps that limit
   opportunities for effective displacement management. It also surfaces
   human rights issues that must be addressed by the government in its
   socio-economic revival agenda and discusses the accountability of state
   actors in providing opportunities for IDPs to achieve durable solutions.
   The article also establishes the need for an IDP law in
   institutionalising protection for IDPs post-COVID-19.}},

Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{151}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Ultra-High Molecular Weight semi-crystalline polymers, such as
   Ultra-High Molecular Weight PolyEthylene (UHMWPE) exhibit strong wear
   and impact resistance, making them good candidates for structural
   applications in many industrial fields. At high strain rate and large
   strain, mechanisms of deformation are quite different from those
   involved in classical semi-crystalline polymers, mainly because chain
   disentanglements are almost impossible for very long macromolecules even
   at temperature far above the melting point. Thus, there is a need to
   develop specific models for these materials and, from the works of
   Deplancke and her co-workers (Deplancke et al., 2019; Deplancke et al.,
   2015) who developed a scalar description based on polymer physics,
   three-dimensional constitutive equations are developed in this work. The
   developed model proposes an innovative way to take into account the
   repartition of strain for a semi-crystalline polymer and more generally
   for a two-phase material. Moreover, by modelling the evolution of
   microstructure during the plastic deformation of the material, the model
   is able to reproduce quite fairly the mechanical behavior of UHMWPE for
   both loading and unloading.}},

Abstract = {{In Bioarchaeology, the paleodemographic analysis has been widely
   questioned and is often reduced to a simple study of the age and sex
   composition in skeletal series. This work constitutes the first
   paleodemographic approach for the Medano Petroquimica site (La Pampa,
   Argentina). We discuss different paleodemographic parameters based on
   the analysis of the human bone remains recovered from the site. The
   results obtained from the study of 75 individuals show an attritional
   mortality curve, with two mortality peaks, one for infants under one
   year of age and one for young adults. This profile suggests the presence
   of high infant mortality and high exposure to risk situations in young
   adults, which is consistent with previous studies about prehistoric
   huntergatherer societies in the region. Besides, the calculated juvenile
   index (JI) suggests, on the one hand, that it would be a growing
   population and, on the other, that the sample would not be biased.}},

Abstract = {{The use of anabolic androgenic steroids is largely restricted worldwide
   since they are associated with innumerous side effects and health
   damage. However, apprehensions of formulations of anabolic agents have
   been extensively increasing throughout the world, making their analysis
   a common task in the forensic field. In this sense, a set of three
   experiments was developed and applied to undergraduate students of
   Forensic Chemistry dealing with visual inspection of apprehended
   formulations of anabolic androgenic steroids as well as chemical
   identification by Infrared Spectroscopy and Gas Chromatography-Mass
   Spectrometry. Moreover, the classroom evaluated the extraction of
   steroidal active ingredients by ultrasonic and microwave-assisted
   extraction. The experimental procedures allied with the theory behind
   these topics provided an important background to the students on
   distinct extraction methods and analytical techniques used in the
   analysis of anabolic agents. Finally, the classroom was led to
   critically evaluate and interpret the results as well as to question the
   adequacy of experimental methods used in forensic analysis to stimulate
   their critical thinking.}},

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION: In a population-based inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
   cohort, we aimed to determine whether having lower socioeconomic status
   (LSS) impacted on outcomes. METHODS: We identified all 9,298 Manitoba
   residents with IBD from April 1, 1995, to March 31, 2018 by applying a
   validated case definition to the Manitoba Health administrative
   database. We could identify all outpatient physician visits,
   hospitalizations, surgeries, intensive care unit admissions, and
   prescription medications. Their data were linked with 2 Manitoba
   databases, one identifying all persons who received Employment and
   Income Assistance and another identifying all persons with Child and
   Family Services contact. Area-level socioeconomic status was defined by
   a factor score incorporating average household income, single parent
   households, unemployment rate, and high school education rate. LSS was
   identified by any of ever being registered for Employment and Income
   Assistance or with Child and Family Services or being in the lowest
   area-level socioeconomic status quintile. RESULTS: Comparing persons
   with LSS vs those without any markers of LSS, there were increased rates
   of annual outpatient physician visits (relative risk {[}RR] = 1.10, 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI] = 1.06-1.13), hospitalizations (RR = 1.38,
   95\% CI = 1.31-1.44), intensive care unit admission (RR = 1.94, 95\% CI
   = 1.65-2.27), use of corticosteroids >2,000 mg/yr (RR = 1.12, 95\% CI =
   1.03-1.21), and death (hazard ratio 1.53, 95\% CI = 1.36-1.73).
   Narcotics (RR = 2.17, 95\% CI = 2.01-2.34) and psychotropic medication
   use (RR = 1.98, 95\% CI = 1.84-2.13) were increased. The impact of LSS
   was greater for those with Crohn's disease than for those with
   ulcerative colitis. DISCUSSION: LSS was associated with worse outcomes
   in persons with IBD. Social determinants of health at time of diagnosis
   should be highly considered and addressed.}},

Abstract = {{The seismic performance of steel frames can be efficiently evaluated via
   the Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA) approach. Generally, reference is
   made only to the transient interstory drift as a damage intensity
   measure (DM) but, as herein demonstrated, additional DMs could be
   suitably accounted for.
   The present paper is focused on the application of the IDA approach to
   Moment-Resisting (MR) steel frames by considering in total four DMs: the
   transient and the residual interstory drift, the residual load carrying
   capacity and the low-cycle fatigue of joints and members. The discussed
   numerical applications are related to four planar frames differing for
   beam-to-column connections and member cross- sections. Research outcomes
   underline how the additional information obtained from the proposed DMs
   contributes to provide a more accurate prediction of the effective
   post-earthquake performance than the one based on the sole transient
   interstory drift.}},

Abstract = {{The Lower Palaeolithic site of Guado San Nicola (GSN) is located near
   the village of Monteroduni (Molise, Central Italy). The archaeological
   layers identified date to the transition between the interglacial and
   the glacial marine isotope stages MIS 11 (i.e. 400 +/- 9 ka) and MIS 10
   (i.e. 345 +/- 9 ka). The bifaces and Levallois products found among the
   lithic assemblage of GSN make the site the earliest one bearing such
   tools in Italy and one of the most ancient ones in the Western European
   context. The aim of this work is to analyze/study/investigate the
   use-wear traces left on the lithic tools and to understand the
   activities carried out at the site. The analysis also seeks to figure
   out how the Levallois products were used, focusing on whether there were
   or not differences in the activities pursued using Levallois flakes
   rather than blanks obtained through different knapping methods.
   Moreover, the present work aims at understanding if and how
   thefaconnageproducts were used. Since the research focuses on flakes,
   the bifaces' flakes resulting from thefaconnageprocess and in some cases
   from renewal processes are also taken in consideration, while the cores
   and debris are not. Results show that there were apparently no
   differences in the use of otherwise obtained flakes and the one
   resulting from the production of bifaces. Nonetheless, the examined data
   could be considered a hint for proposing the development of the
   Levallois method from the practice offaconnagesequences.}},

Abstract = {{Circular economy offers new visions of how diversely urban spaces could
   be inhabited and managed. While the generation and management of waste
   is being treated through innovative practices, disused industrial,
   rural, and infrastructural areas are resistant to becoming included in a
   closed-loop cycle. They, in fact, establish wastelands that need to be
   completely re-imagined as a precondition for the transition. The fact of
   shifting the definition of a `neglected area' into a `waste-land', in
   line with the metaphor of urban metabolism, could be of tactical
   importance for generating alternative policies and practices. In
   exploring how the transition impacts Naples' urban region, the paper
   argues that turning wastelands into resources has the double potential
   of rehabilitating spaces and challenging the governance model in use,
   overcoming barriers in multiple sectors.}},

Abstract = {{The movement of nonindigenous aquatic species into new river systems has
   the potential to negatively impact native species and/or their
   environments. The construction of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway (TTW)
   in the 1970s and 1980s directly linked 2 evolutionarily distinct aquatic
   communities, and faunal exchange across the TTW has been documented in
   both fishes and freshwater mussels. However, to date there have been no
   recognized exchanges of the turtle fauna between the Tennessee and
   Tombigbee river systems. Herein we document the exchange of Ouachita map
   turtles (Graptemys ouachitensis), a native of the Tennessee River
   system, and Alabama map turtles (Graptemys pulchra), a native of the
   Tombigbee River system, each occurring outside its native ranges in the
   opposite river system likely via dispersal in the TTW. For G.
   ouachitensis, we observed a range displacement of similar to 55 river
   kilometers (rkm) south from the nearest specimen records in the
   Tennessee River system into upper Bay Springs Lake of the Tombigbee
   River drainage. Graptemys pulchra had a range displacement northward of
   similar to 137 rkm from the nearest specimen record in the Tombigbee
   River system to Pickwick Lake of the Tennessee River drainage. For the
   latter, it seems most parsimonious that G. pulchra historically occurred
   farther north than the specimen record suggests. Otherwise, individuals
   would have had to execute movements through and/or around 4 locks and
   dams, which seems less probable. We recommend that additional monitoring
   of nonnative turtles should be conducted to document existing range and
   potential range expansions (inclusive of Graptemys nigrinoda,
   black-knobbed sawback) while studies to assess genetic introgression
   among these closely related species are warranted.}},

Title = {{Performance differences between nations exploiting a common natural
   resource: The Icelandic-Norwegian mackerel case}},
Journal = {{MARINE POLICY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{122}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The same type of industries, located in different nations, may perform
   differently in global markets. This comparative case study of the
   Icelandic and Norwegian mackerel industries explores whether national
   resources, capabilities, and institutional environments can help
   elucidate performance differences in exporting a common natural
   resource. To gain insight into the phenomenon, the present study
   utilizes landing and export statistics from the two nations supplemented
   with qualitative data based on interviews with key stakeholders in both
   nations. The findings show that Norway achieves a significantly higher
   export price on North East Atlantic mackerel than does Iceland. The
   price premium is consistent over time. Different qualities of the fish
   exported from the two countries are considered to be the main reason for
   the price contrast. The quality differential, as the present study
   argues, is primarily due to biological conditions, which neither of the
   two nations control, as the natural quality of the mackerel is highest
   when the fish is accessible in Norwegian waters. Accordingly, Norway has
   a biological competitive advantage over Iceland in terms of mackerel
   export. However, it is argued that Norway's ability to exploit the
   advantage commercially may be related to national resources and
   capabilities but hardly to the Norwegian institutional framework, which
   does not allow firms to integrate vertically. Finally, in the paper, the
   findings are discussed, and implications are outlined.}},

   SiPM-based camera we are building one of the LST camera elements (a
   cluster of 7 pixels with the readout electronics), replacing the PMTs
   with SiPM pixels. Most of the hardware of the baseline design is

Abstract = {{Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes a
   hypercoagulable state. Several autopsy studies have found microthrombi
   in pulmonary circulation.
   Methods: In this randomized, open-label, phase II study, we randomized
   COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation to receive either
   therapeutic enoxaparin or the standard anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis.
   We evaluated the gas exchange over time through the ratio of partial
   pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen
   (FiO2) at baseline, 7, and 14 days after randomization, the time until
   successful liberation from mechanical ventilation, and the
   ventilator-free days.
   Results: Ten patients were assigned to the therapeutic enoxaparin and
   ten patients to prophylactic anticoagulation. There was a statistically
   significant increase in the PaO2/FiO2 ratio over time in the therapeutic
   group (163 {[}95\% confidence interval - CI 133-193] at baseline, 209
   {[}95\% CI 171-247] after 7 days, and 261 {[}95\% CI 230-293] after 14
   days), p = 0.0004. In contrast, we did not observe this improvement over
   time in the prophylactic group (184 {[}95\% CI 146-222] at baseline, 168
   {[}95\% CI 142-195] after 7 days, and 195 {[}95\% CI 128-262] after 14
   days), p = 0.487. Patients of the therapeutic group had a higher ratio
   of successful liberation from mechanical ventilation (hazard ratio: 4.0
   {[}95\% CI 1.035-15.053]), p = 0.031 and more ventilator-free days (15
   days {[}interquartile range IQR 6-16] versus 0 days {[}IQR 0-11]), p =
   0.028 when compared to the prophylactic group.
   Conclusion: Therapeutic enoxaparin improves gas exchange and decreases
   the need for mechanical ventilation in severe COVID-19.}},

Abstract = {{Residual herbicides remain the primary tool for efficient weed control
   in cucurbit crops because of the lack of crop tolerance to many POST
   herbicide options. Field experiments were conducted in New Jersey in
   2018 and 2019 to determine weed control efficacy and tolerance of
   direct-seeded cucumber `Python' and summer squash `Gold Prize' to
   S-metolachlor applied at 0.7 or 1.4 kg ai ha(-1) at planting (PRE) or
   when crops reached the second- to third-leaf stage (EPOST). Regardless
   of applied rate, S-metolachlor PRE or EPOST provided 96\% to 100\%
   control 3 wk after planting (WAP) of smooth pigweed, large crabgrass,
   and giant foxtail. S-metolachlor PRE significantly improved American
   black nightshade and carpetweed control 3 WAP with respect to bensulide,
   and smooth pigweed with respect to clomazone + ethalfluralin. Summer
   squash showed excellent tolerance, regardless of S-metolachlor rate or
   timing of application, with stunting not exceeding 17\% 4 WAP and 3\% 7
   WAP at the 1.4 kg ha(-1) rate. Marketable yield decreased by 15\% with
   S-metolachlor PRE or POST at 1.4 kg ha(-1) with respect to clomazone +
   ethalfluralin, a reduction not noted when comparing with bensulide or
   the handweeded control. Marketable fruit number plant(-1) and individual
   fruit weight were not affected by S-metolachlor applications.
   Conversely, cucumber was more sensitive to S-metolachlor than summer
   squash was with 30\% seedling emergence reduction and 36\% to 43\%
   stunting 4 WAP when S-metolachlor was applied PRE at 1.4 kg ha(-1).
   EPOST application resulted in 15\% to 26\% cucumber injury 1 wk after
   treatment. Marketable yield declined by 21\% and 39\% with the 0.7 and
   1.4 kg ha(-1) rates of S-metolachlor, respectively, compared with
   clomazone + ethalfluralin. Therefore, S-metolachlor may be a novel
   alternative to already labeled residual herbicides for summer squash,
   but unacceptable injury and yield reduction do not support its
   registration on cucumber.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Research on the human microbiome has flourished over the last decade due
   to the essential role that bacterial communities have in host physiology
   and health. Recent studies have indicated that exercise is an important
   modulator of the composition and activity of the gut microbiome.
   However, microbiota is present throughout the whole gastrointestinal
   tract, the oral cavity being the first place where a large community of
   microorganisms is found. Recent evidence has established the first link
   between the oral microbiome and the physiological response to exercise,
   which opens a new way to explore host-microbiota interactions. The oral
   cavity is essential for many physiological processes such as food
   digestion, the sensory experience of eating and palatability and
   immunity. Within the oral cavity, saliva is a key element for regulating
   all these functions as well as to protect the oral environment providing
   a lubricating mucoid secretion with organic and inorganic constituents.
   Here, we review what is known about the potential link between exercise
   and the oral microbiome including its role in oral health. We also
   discuss the effect of diet and the impact of pre and probiotics on the
   oral microbiome and their potential ergogenic effect.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, giant reed cellulosic fibers (Arundo donax L., RF)
   were explored as reinforcement of bisphenol A-based benzoxazine (BA-a).
   RFwere extracted from giant reed cane, and subjected to different
   chemical treatments using either alkaline, silane or their combining
   treatments. The examination of the structural, thermal, crystallinity
   and morphological properties of the untreated (NRF) and treated fibers
   (TRF) was carried out using different analytical techniques. Broadly,
   the morphology of the treated fibers is affected, their crystallinity
   and thermal stability increased. The investigation of the effect of the
   treated fibers on the curing kinetics of composites based on BA-a was
   performed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique, under
   non-isothermal conditions, and isoconversional integral kinetic methods.
   A decrease in the heat of curing as well as activation energy (Ea) was
   reported. The Avrami-Erofeev autocatalytic kinetic model was the most
   appropriate to describe the curing reactions and the predicted curves
   from the calculated kinetic parameters fitted well with experimental
   data. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives The purpose of this study was to find out if carpal
   instability played a role in the etiology of ganglion cysts.
   Materials and Methods Dynamic wrist radiographs of 33 patients with and
   without a ganglion cyst of the wrist were compared. The control group
   consisted of patients who had dynamic radiographs of both wrists after a
   traumatic event in one wrist. Measurements were performed on the
   contralateral uninjured side. Radiological parameters that may indicate
   carpal instability included: width of the scapholunate gap,
   scapholunate, radiolunate, and lunocapitate angles, and ulnar
   translocation.
   Results No statistically significant difference was found between the
   two groups except for lunocapitate angle which was higher in wrists with
   ganglion cysts. However, mean lunocapitate angle was still within the
   normal range.
   Conclusions It could be concluded that in this study we did not see a
   difference between scapholunate gap and radiocarpal angles with the
   presence or absence of a ganglion cyst.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the interrelations among political attitudes and
   negative stereotypes in U.S. undergraduates. Participants answered
   questions measuring conservatism, social dominance orientation, Global
   Belief in a Just World, and religiosity. This research employed two
   measures of stereotypes: modern sexism and feelings about 15 social
   groups. It was hypothesized that conservatives would show more evidence
   of negative stereotypes than liberals would. The study revealed that
   indeed conservatives show stronger evidence of negative stereotypes, but
   that liberals also harbor some biases. Importantly, the social groups
   against whom conservatives and liberals are stereotyped differed
   greatly. Conservatives showed considerably more negative stereotypes
   against racial and religious minorities, and particularly against those
   who do not identify with the cis-gender, heterosexual norm. Thus, the
   targets of conservatives' stereotypes were groups that have
   traditionally been subject to discrimination. Liberals held stronger
   stereotypes against groups that are more politically powerful, such as
   Caucasians and Christians.}},

   recurrent centripetal Levallois and blade technologies. Although
   absolute chronological references for the sites have yet to be
   established, the lithic finds characteristically fit to the Middle Stone
   Age (MSA) technocomplex. The inhabitants targeted locally available
   stone raw materials such as quartzite, quartz, and chert. The
   technological strategies identified in the Kilwa basin are common at
   inland MSA sites across eastern and southern Africa, suggesting that the
   coastal ecozone may have been regularly exploited by hominins that
   possessed versatile technologies to adapt to diverse eastern African
   landscapes. Our finds lay a foundational step for future
   interdisciplinary research in the Kilwa basin and other parts of the
   East African coast.}},

Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We use a semiclassical lattice approach to perform the first nonlinear
   study of preheating in R-2-healed Higgs inflation, in the ``R-2-like{''}
   regime where the curvature-squared coupling beta and nonminimal coupling
   xi of the Higgs field contribute similarly to the CMB scalar
   perturbations. Preheating occurs first through tachyonic production of
   Higgs bosons, and later scattering off the homogeneous inflaton field.
   We generalise our results for the parameter range 1.1 x 10(9) < beta <
   1.8 x 10(9) to ``Higgs-like{''} parameters with smaller beta, where
   observables saturate the bound of instantaneous preheating. All
   predictions for the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio lie within
   the 1 sigma region of measurements by the Planck satellite, but a future
   ground-based experiment optimised for 21 cm tomography may be able to
   discriminate the mixed Higgs-curvature inflation from the pure Higgs and
   R-2 theories.}},

Abstract = {{Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder,
   caused by the loss of dopamine and characterized by the presence of
   cytoplasmic protein inclusions. In Parkinson's disease, mitochondrial
   dysfunction has gained attention because number of genes like LRRK2,
   SNCA, PARK7, Parkin and PINK1 which implicates the pathogenesis of
   Parkinson's is also found to be essential for the maintenance and proper
   functioning of the mitochondria. Any mutation in these genes can
   potentially result in mitochondrial dysfunction. Amidst, PINK1 gene has
   a crucial role because it is important for the activation of the
   mitochondrial quality control mechanism and clearance of damaged
   mitochondria. Hence, the mutation in the PINK1 gene may mediate the
   accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria and may induce Parkinson's
   disease. This review elaborates interlink between PINK1 gene and

Abstract = {{This work presents an experimental analysis of a novel indirect solar
   dryer for drying chillies in the Western Himalayas. Iron scrap assorted
   with gravels are kept on the absorber plate and engine oil transported
   through the copper tube, have been applied as sensible heat storage
   (SHS) medium in the solar air collector (SAC). Paraffin wax has been
   employed as a phase change material (PCM) in the drying compartment. The
   performance evaluation of the drying system has been carried out on the
   basis of physical, thermal and quality attributes. The moisture level of
   chillies is reduced to 4.85\% from 86.50\% (wet basis) in 21 h as
   compared to 96 h and 150 h by using solar drying without thermal storage
   and in the natural sun, respectively. Outcomes of this work conclude
   that the dehydrating time is reduced by 78.12\% and 86.00\% as against
   drying conducted without the use of SHS and PCM, and natural sun;
   respectively. Using this drying system, the colour, texture, pungency
   (sensory parameters) and rehydration capacity of the dehydrated chillies
   have been found better. From the experimental results vitamin C,
   capsaicin, carotene and thiamin of the chillies were found 49.25 mg,
   0.52\%, 341.5 mu g and 0.912 mg which were 32.25 mg, 0.23\%, 217.8 mu g

Abstract = {{Purpose: To calculate a modified percentage tissue altered (mPTA) in
   post laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) eyes and to validate
   its role as an independent factor to evaluate ectasia in the Indian
   population. Methods: A total of 333 consecutive eyes with normal
   preoperative corneal topography by combined placido and scheimpflug
   imaging-based topography system (SIRIUS) who underwent LASIK using a
   microkeratome between 2011 and 2014 at a tertiary level teaching
   hospital in south India, were retrospectively analyzed. Preoperatively
   patient's refraction, flap thickness (FT), ablation depth (AD), residual
   stromal bed (RSB), and thinnest corneal thickness (TCT) were recorded.
   The formula used was mPTA = (FT + AD)/TCT. mPTA was grouped into <0.4
   (low risk), 0.40 - 0.45 (moderate risk), and >0.45 (high risk). All
   patients were called for follow-up and underwent a topography to look
   for ectasia. Results: In total 60.1\%, 29.1\%, and 10.8\% patients had
   mPTA of <0.4, 0.40 - 0.45 and >0.45, respectively. However, after a
   minimum follow-up of 2 years, none of the patients had any sign of
   ectasia. Conclusion: Careful selection of patients is mandatory before
   proceeding for LASIK. Factors like corneal thickness, RSB, degree of
   myopia, and AD are more important. The role of mPTA >0.4 as an
   independent risk factor for post LASIK ectasia is questionable in Indian
   eyes. Other factors or a modified formula suitable for Indian eyes needs
   to be investigated. A larger follow-up period is also required as
   ectasia has been known to develop even after 2 years.}},

Abstract = {{It has been hypothesised that the human neurocognitive architecture may
   include a perceptual ratio processing system (RPS) that supports
   symbolic fraction understanding. In the present study, we aimed to
   provide further evidence for the existence of the RPS by exploring
   whether individuals with a range of math skills are indeed perceptually
   sensitive to non-symbolic ratio magnitudes. We also aimed to test to
   what extent the RPS may underlie symbolic fraction processing in those
   individuals. In a match-to-sample task, typical adults, elementary
   school children, and adults with dyscalculia were asked to match a
   non-symbolic ratio (i.e., target) to one of two non-symbolic ratios
   (i.e., the match and distractor). We found that all groups of
   participants were sensitive to the ratio between the match and the
   distractor, suggesting a common reliance on the RPS. This ratio
   sensitivity was also observed in another group of typical adults who had
   to choose which of two symbolic fractions match a non-symbolic ratio,
   indicating that the RPS may also contribute to symbolic fraction
   understanding. However, no ratio dependence was observed when
   participants had to choose which of two symbolic fractions match another
   symbolic fraction, suggesting that reliance on the RPS in symbolic
   fraction processing is limited and may not support exact fraction
   processing.}},

Title = {{Deterministic Aspect of the gamma-Ray Variability in Blazars}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{905}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Linear time series analysis, mainly the Fourier transform-based methods,
   has been quite successful in extracting information contained in the
   ever-modulating light curves of active galactic nuclei, and thereby
   contribute in characterizing the general features of supermassive black
   hole systems. In particular, the statistical properties of gamma-ray
   variability of blazars are found to be fairly represented by flicker
   noise in the temporal frequency domain. However, these conventional
   methods have not been able to fully encapsulate the richness and the
   complexity displayed in the light curves of the sources. In this work,
   to complement our previous study on a similar topic, we perform
   nonlinear time series analysis of the decade-long Fermi/LAT observations
   of 20 gamma-ray bright blazars. The study is motivated to address one of
   the most relevant queries: whether the dominant dynamical processes
   leading to the observed gamma-ray variability are of deterministic or
   stochastic nature. For the purpose, we perform recurrence quantification
   analysis of the blazars and directly measure the quantities, which
   suggest that the dynamical processes in blazars could be a combination
   of deterministic and stochastic processes, while some of the source
   light curves revealed significant deterministic content. The result,
   with possible implication of strong disk-jet connection in blazars,
   could prove to be significantly useful in constructing models that can
   explain the rich and complex multiwavelength observational features in
   active galactic nuclei. In addition, we estimate the dynamical
   timescales, so-called trapping timescales, in the order of a few weeks.}},

   ACACB genes increases the risk for cancer}},
Journal = {{META GENE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{26}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Altered lipid metabolism is a characteristic feature of cancer cells.
   This systematic review assesses the risk for cancer development in
   association with the expression levels of the ACACA and ACACB genes
   which encode the rate limiting enzymes of fatty acid synthesis,
   acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACC alpha) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase beta
   (ACC beta). The literature databases PubMed and Google Scholar were
   searched for variation in incidence of cancer depending on the
   expression of the ACACA and ACACB genes. In addition, related articles
   were retrieved from OMIM and Cochrane Library. Cohort studies, case
   control studies, studies using in vivo and in vitro models and
   randomized trials were evaluated to determine the risk for cancer
   associated with the altered expression of the genes. Overexpression of
   ACACA has been reported in cancers of the breast, lung, prostate,
   gliomas and col-orectal cancer while low expression of ACACB has been
   reported in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, triple negative breast
   cancer, retinoblastoma, thyroid and melanoma. Increased expression of
   both ACACA and ACACB has been reported in hepatocellular carcinoma and
   glioblastoma. Various ACC-inhibitors with therapeutic potential have
   been developed, and several studies report the treatment of obesity
   related cancer by inhibiting ACC expression. Thus, ACC-inhibitors are
   potential therapeutic agents for effective treatment of cancer,
   especially obesity related cancers.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this article, the authors explore prejudice from Gadamerian and
   de/colonial perspectives, grounded in methodological discourses of
   qualitative inquiry. Using a vignette of a typical conversation in a
   dissertation defense, the authors perform a Gadamerian and de/colonial
   reading informed by Anzaldua, Mohanty, Smith, and Chakravorty Spivak.
   Through these readings the authors enact a fusion of horizons, a
   possibility forwarded by Gadamer as a critique of Enlightenment-based
   onto-epistemologies, which situate prejudice as a reminder to engage in
   expansive knowledge-making moves. De/colonial scholars add arguments
   about positionality and the need to engage with one's own stuck places,
   places of contradictions and tensions, and conditions that cultivate
   deep introspection. The politics of evidence-based research continues to
   stifle and discipline the ways in which qualitative research can be
   engaged. Therefore, the authors offer possibilities in this article that
   would allow movement from Enlightenment-based onto-epistemologies to
   other more fluid and culturally situated expansive spaces of knowledge
   construction.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the effect of T regulatory cells (Treg cells) and
   the impact of BCG vaccination history of donors using an in vitro model
   of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra infection of peripheral blood
   mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMCs from donors with or without prior BCG
   vaccination were depleted of Treg cells (PBMCs-Tregs) or not depleted
   with Treg cells (PBMCs + Tregs) were infected up to 8 days with Mtb
   H37Ra. Cell aggregates were smaller in PBMCs-Tregs compared to PBMCs +
   Tregs at day 8 post-infection. Mtb CFUs were higher in the PBMCs-Tregs
   compared to PBMCs + Tregs at days 3, 5 and 8. The levels of IL-17,
   IFN-gamma (at days 3 and 5), and TNF-alpha and IL-6 (at day 3) were
   lower in PBMCs-Tregs compared to PBMCs + Tregs. In contrast, the levels
   of IL-10 and IL-4 cytokines were higher at day 3 in PBMCs-Tregs compared
   to PBMCs + Tregs. BCG vaccination status of donors had no impact on the
   mycobacterial culture, level of cytokines and immune cell populations.
   This study shows that depletion of Tregs in human PBMCs infected with
   Mtb H37Ra in vitro leads to a shift from a Th1 to a Th2 cytokine rich
   environment that supports the survival of Mtb in this model.}},

   hydrolysate: A novel application for natural dyeing of silk fabric}},
Journal = {{DYES AND PIGMENTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{183}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A large amount of by products are generated during the silk processing,
   the most abundant of which are silkworm pupae. In general, efforts have
   been made to use these by-products for different applications such as
   biogas, fertilizer, human food products, medicines and pupa oil
   production. In this work a novel application of protein extracted from
   silkworm pupae was proposed for the coloration of silk fabrics within
   the context of the circular economy. In particular, for the first time a
   hydrolysis process at 170 degrees C for 1 h using only superheated water
   was performed to extract proteins from silkworm pupae and as a novelty,
   the same proteins were used to dye silk fabrics. Various parameters such
   as temperature, time, pH, dyeing time and temperature, protein
   hydrolysate concentration, mordant type (copper sulfate and ferrous
   sulfate) and mordanting step (pre-meta-post) were studied and the higher
   color strength was obtained at pH 3.8, 90 degrees C, for 60 min dyeing
   time using 30\% o.w.f. protein hydrolysate, 50\% o.w.f meta-mordanting.
   It was demonstrated that the extracted proteins can actually dye, but
   the color is more intense in the presence of the mordant which plays an
   anchoring role by formation of complex between protein hydrolysate and
   silk fabric. Dyed fabrics in the presence of mordant show washing and
   rubbing fastness from good to excellent, and light fastness from fair to
   good.}},

Title = {{Vibration analysis of motorcycle handlebar for riding comfort using

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEASUREMENTS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{142-152}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Vehicle comfort is related to vibrations induced due to surface
   irregularities and power generation and transmission parts. Long
   exposure to high vibrations may lead to numbness, stiffness, and pain in
   the rider's hand parts such as fingers, shoulders, and neck. It is a
   challenge to design a good suspension system and vibration absorber
   which isolates the driver/rider from the induced vibrations. The
   principle aim of a vehicle's suspension system/vibration absorber is to
   isolate the occupant from the induced disturbances, while still allowing
   the average driver to maintain control over the vehicle and drive it
   safely. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the
   vibrations in the motorcycle handlebar and modify the handlebar to
   reduce the vibration for good ride comfort without affecting its
   handling. A motorcycle with an under square engine is selected for the
   experimentation. The under square engine has more stroke length than
   bore diameter and hence it is more susceptible to generate vibrations. A
   tuned mass damper system is designed and developed to attenuate
   handlebar vibrations. To investigate and predict vibration attenuation
   levels in handlebar at different operating conditions, a proper design
   of experiments (DOE) is carried. In the DOE, the effects of factors such
   as motorcycle engine speed, mass on handlebar have been studied on
   vibrations at the handlebar. The objective of DOE is to develop a robust
   model that predicts the handlebar vibrations of a motorcycle which is
   highly desirable when rider exposes to vibration for a long period. The
   results of the investigation show vibration attenuation from 23 to 66 \%
   at various engine speeds. The effect of the tuned mass damper is
   substantially visible at higher engine RPM hence proper modification of
   handlebar becomes essential in case of high revving applications where
   riders are exposed to high vibrations for longer periods.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{160}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We present a study of evolutionary and structural parameters of star
   cluster candidates in the spiral galaxy M83. For this we use a
   convolutional neural network trained on mock clusters and capable of
   fast identification and localization of star clusters, as well as
   inference of their parameters from multiband images. We use this
   pipeline to detect 3380 cluster candidates in Hubble Space Telescope
   observations. The sample of cluster candidates shows an age gradient
   across the galaxy's spiral arms, which is in good agreement with
   predictions of the density wave theory and other studies. As measured
   from the dust lanes of the spiral arms, the younger population of
   cluster candidates peaks at the distance of similar to 0.4 kpc while the
   older candidates are more dispersed, but shifted toward greater than or
   similar to 0.7 kpc in the leading part of the spiral arms. We find
   high-extinction cluster candidates positioned in the trailing part of

Abstract = {{Validamycin A (VMA) is an aminoglycoside antibiotic used to control rice
   sheath blight. Although it has been reported that VMA can induce the
   plant defense responses, the mechanism remains poorly understood. Here,
   we found that reactive oxygen species (ROS) bursts and callose
   deposition in Arabidopsis thaliana, rice (Oryza sativa L.), and wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L.) were induced by VMA and were most intense with 10
   mu g of VMA per milliliter at 24 h. Moreover, we showed that VMA induced
   resistance against Pseudomonas syringae, Botrytis cinerea, and Fusarium
   graminearum in Arabidopsis leaves, indicating that VMA induces
   broad-spectrum disease resistance in both dicots and monocots. In
   addition, VMA-mediated resistance against P syringae was not induced in
   NahG transgenic plants, was partially decreased in npr1 mutants, and
   VMA-mediated resistance to B. cinerea was not induced in npr1, jar1, and
   ein2 mutants. These results strongly indicated that VMA triggers plant
   defense responses to both biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens involved
   in salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid/ethylene (JA/ET) signaling
   pathways and is dependent on NPR1. In addition, transcriptome analysis
   further revealed that VMA regulated the expression of genes involved in
   SA, JA/ET, abscisic acid (ABA), and auxin signal pathways. Taken
   together, VMA induces systemic resistance involving in SA and JA/ET
   signaling pathways and also exerts a positive influence on ABA and auxin
   signaling pathways. Our study highlights the creative application of VMA
   in triggering plant defense responses against plant pathogens, providing
   a valuable insight into applying VMA to enhance plant resistance and
   reduce the use of chemical pesticides.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{372}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{A dual peridynamics (PD) for brittle fracture is implemented in the
   commercial software Abaqus by means of UEL/VUEL and UMAT/VUMAT
   subroutines, thereby, the peridynamic finite element method (PDFEM) will
   come into being. To this end, the concept of the peridynamic node and
   element is defined, subsequently, the peridynamic element internal force
   vector and mass matrix for the explicit PDFEM and the peridynamic
   element stiffness matrix for the implicit PDFEM are derived and
   constructed for the explicit and the implicit finite element
   implementation of the dual peridynamics in Abaqus, respectively.
   Additionally, a dual-based coupling approach is developed to couple the
   PDFEM and FEM to optimize the computational efficiency and accuracy of
   the pure PDFEM. Several numerical examples involving the static and
   dynamic crack propagation are investigated and the satisfactory results
   show the availability of the PDFEM and the hybrid model between PDFEM
   and FEM. Moreover, the finite element implementation of peridynamics in
   Abaqus may pave the way to an increased application of peridynamics to
   the practical engineering problems. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Electrically assisted bicycles are anticipated to become an effective
   tool to limit not only the use of cars in cities but also their negative
   impact on health, the environment, and passenger transportation in
   cities. In this paper, we examine the effects of implementing the first
   fully electric bike (e-bike) sharing system in the Metropolitan Area of
   Gdansk-Gdynia-Sopot in Northern Poland, where no other bike sharing
   system had been introduced before. The aims of this article were to
   determine the impact of the new e-bike sharing system on the modal
   choice of citizens, identify barriers to its usage, and find differences
   between the usage of the system in the core of the metropolitan area and
   in the suburbs. We used two primary data sets: the survey data collected
   using the computer-assisted personal interviewing technique (CAPI
   technique) and the data automatically acquired from the website that
   monitored the system activities. We performed the analysis by using
   nonparametric tests and correspondence analysis. We found no evidence
   suggesting that e-bike sharing can replace large number of private car
   trips, but we found it likely to be competitive to carsharing, moped,
   and taxi services. E-bike sharing competes also with public
   transportation services, but it is also used as the first/last mile of
   the transportation supplementing public transport system. The major
   barrier to using this system in central cities of the metropolitan area
   was the lack of available public bikes, and possession of private
   bicycles, whereas for residents of the suburbs, the obstacles were the
   need to transport children, the high price of the bicycle
   rental/subscription, and the long distance to the docking stations.}},

Title = {{Climate change effect on the cooling performance and assessment of
   passive daytime photonic radiative cooler in India}},
Journal = {{RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{134}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In the long future, dependency on conventional air conditioning systems
   for thermal comfort certainly needs to be reduced, with alternate
   strategies like passive photonic radiative cooling. Recent metamaterial
   development with highly reflective in the solar spectrum pushes the
   radiative cooling technique toward application assessment. In this
   paper, the photonic radiative cooler performance is analyzed for year
   2019 at various Indian locations considering the diversity of climate
   and forecasted for year 2030. The effect of three types of climate
   change is considered: geographical, seasonal and year-wise. Some
   photonic coolers with different emissive profiles are also compared. As
   the radiative cooling depends upon air temperature, humidity, wind speed
   and solar flux intensity, the effects of influencing climatic or weather
   parameters during summer months are studied extensively and major
   performance influencing factors are identified. Photonic radiative
   cooler performance in energy-saving as rooftop envelope assisted to
   conventional air conditioning system is assessed and observed cooling
   energy saving of 25-32 kWh(th)/month for selected locations. Study
   reveals that the windshield is the necessary condition to get net
   cooling flux through the rooftop. The reduction of cooling load on
   active systems of 34\% is observed for low humidity locations with the
   integration of radiative cooler as a roof envelope.}},

Abstract = {{Down-core changes in the coiling direction of Globorotalia
   truncatulinoides in the northwestern subtropical Atlantic (KNR140-37PC
   and Ocean Drilling Program Sites 1063, 1059, 1056, 1058) provide a
   tracer for the hydrographic conditions in the western boundary current
   over the past 700 kyr (Marine Isotope Stage, MIS, 1-17). A consistent
   association between percent G. truncatulinoides (sinistral) abundances,
   total test counts, and bulk sediment CaCO3 content is established by MIS
   11 suggesting a response to ocean-atmosphere interactions during the mid
   Brunhes event. Commencing with MIS 11, interglacial maxima are
   associated with high total test counts and either distinct sinistral
   test minima (MIS 9e, 11c) or maxima (MIS 1, 5e, 7a). High sinistral test
   abundances with relatively high test counts is similar to the late
   Holocene relationship at the study sites. Low sinistral test abundances
   despite high test counts means that coiling ratios are dominated by
   dextral forms. We interpret this pattern to indicate more intense flow
   in the subtropical gyre either via the western boundary current drawing
   toward the gyre center, or a more northern influence of the North
   Equatorial and Antilles Currents. This suggests that the western
   boundary current may have been more intense during MIS 11c and MIS 9e
   then during MIS 7a, MIS 5e, and MIS 1 consistent with climate warm
   anomalies in northern Europe at these times. Regardless of the
   mechanism, the observation that minima and maxima in sinistral test
   abundances are prolonged at these times indicates that the western gyre
   boundary remained stable during relative warm intervals.}},

Title = {{Managing Market Thickness in Online Business-to-Business Markets}},
Journal = {{MANAGEMENT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We explore marketplace design in the context of a business-to-business
   platform specializing in liquidation auctions. Even when the platform's
   aggregate levels of supply and demand remain fixed, we establish that
   the platform's ability to use its design levers to manage the
   availability of supply over time yields significant value. We study two
   such levers, each using the platform's availability of supply as a means
   to incentivize participation from buyers who decide strategically
   when/how often to participate. First, the platform's listing policy sets
   the ending times of incoming auctions (hence, the frequency of market
   clearing). Exploiting a natural experiment, we illustrate that
   consolidating auctions' ending times to certain weekdays increases the
   platform's revenues by 7.3\% mainly by inducing a higher level of bidder
   participation. The second lever is a recommendation system that can be
   used to reveal information about real-time market thickness to potential
   bidders. The optimization of these levers highlights a novel trade-off.
   Namely, when the platform consolidates auctions' ending times, more
   bidders may participate in the marketplace (demand-side competition);
   but ultimately auctions for substitutable goods cannibalize one another
   (supply-side competition). To optimize these design decisions, we
   estimate a structural model that endogenizes bidders' dynamic behavior,
   that is, their decisions on whether/how often to participate in the
   marketplace and how much to bid. We find that appropriately designing a
   recommendation system yields an additional revenue increase (on top of
   the benefits obtained by optimizing the platform's listing policy) by
   reducing supply-side cannibalization and altering the composition of
   participating bidders.}},

Abstract = {{While being the third leading cause of candidemia worldwide, numerous
   studies have shown severe clonal outbreaks due to fluconazole-resistant
   (FLCR) Candida parapsilosis isolates associated with fluconazole
   therapeutic failure (FTF) with enhanced mortality. More recently,
   multidrug resistant (MDR) C. parapsilosis blood isolates have also been
   identified that are resistant to both azole and echinocandin drugs.
   Amphotericin B (AMB) resistance is rarely reported among C. parapsilosis
   isolates and proper management of bloodstream infections due to FLZR and
   MDR isolates requires prompt action at the time of outbreak. Therefore,
   using a well-established Galleria mellonella model, we assessed whether
   (a) laboratory-based findings on azole or echinocandin (micafungin)
   resistance in C. parapsilosis lead to therapeutic failure, (b) LAMB
   could serve as an efficient salvage treatment option, and (c) distinct
   mutations in ERG11 impact mortality. Our in vivo data confirm
   fluconazole inefficacy against FLCR C. parapsilosis isolates carrying
   Y132F, Y132F + K143R, Y132F + G307A, and G307A + G458S in Erg11p, while
   LAMB proved to be an efficacious accessible option against both FLCR and
   MDR C. parapsilosis isolates. Moreover, positive correlation of in vitro
   and in vivo data further highlights the utility of G. melonella as a
   reliable model to investigate azole and polyene drug efficacy.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes the structure of the capital markets for small- and
   medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and startup companies in Korea, which is
   an emerging market that has experienced drastic changes. The overall
   capital market can be divided into private and public capital markets.
   In the private capital market, most of the demand for capital comes from
   non-listed private firms, including startups and SMEs. In the case of
   SMEs and startups, the KOSDAQ, the Korea New Exchange (KONEX), and
   primary collateralized bond obligations (P-CBOs) are part of the public
   capital market. SMEs and startups are generally incapable of raising
   sufficient capital owing to their low credit ratings, and they largely
   have limited access to primary markets to issue shares and borrow money.
   The Korean government has developed a systematic financial aid program
   to provide funds to these companies. The fund for SMEs has significantly
   contributed to the development of the venture capital market. Many
   Korean banks provide substantial lending to SMEs, but this lending is
   available only because of the Korean government's loan recovery
   guarantee. Furthermore, SMEs can issue corporate debt in the form of
   primary collateralized bond obligations through government guarantees,
   but such debt issuances have placed increasing pressure on public
   guarantee institutions.}},

Title = {{Ownership (Lost) and Corporate Control: An Enterprise Entity Perspective}},
Journal = {{ACCOUNTING ECONOMICS AND LAW-A CONVIVIUM}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In recent decades, advocates of the shareholder value perspective
   regarding corporations have depicted the shareholding investor as the
   owner of the corporation and the entrepreneur proprietor of corporate
   activity. Political discourse and regulatory frameworks keep imagining
   that one single subject or legal person holds the whole bundle of rights
   and responsibilities related to corporate investment, management and
   control. This subject would be the shareholding investor (acting as the
   owner of the corporation), while the bundle would be embodied in the one
   kind of security issued by the corporation, that is, the share.
   As a matter of fact, corporate practice shows fundamental disconnection
   between equity investment, enterprise management and corporate control.
   Over time, three main legal-economic innovations have featured this
   disconnection: (i) the very introduction of the corporate legal form;
   (ii) the working of corporate groups and financial intermediaries; and
   (iii) the overwhelming web of contractual arrangements and financial
   derivatives which characterise business affairs of listed companies and
   equity markets nowadays.
   In this context, this article argues that an ownership view of corporate
   activity misleads understanding and undermines efforts to enforce
   corporate sustainability, responsibility and accountability. Ownership
   and market are insufficient to assure this enforcement, while ownership
   sovereignty is irremediably lost. Insisting on such misunderstanding
   would result in facilitating if not favouring structuring opportunities
   to circumvent control and responsibility, including through regulatory
   avoidance.
   Instead, an enterprise entity view may comprehend the corporate activity
   (of which the corporation is one possible legal form, often embedded in
   a more complex legal structure involving an enterprise group) as an
   organisation and an institution which responds to and must submit to a
   variety of inside and outside checks and balances, with a view to
   assuring its consistent and continued role in business and society. From
   this systemic perspective, consolidated accounting and disclosure may
   represent a fundamental element of the institutional system of
   protection. In particular, a comprehensive accounting system - based
   upon economic substance (rather than legal form) - may make enterprise
   groups accountable for their ongoing activities to stakeholders
   (including shareholders), human community and nature.}},

Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: High risks of falls have been reported in older adults with
   chronic pain but chronic pain similarly affects adults of all ages. This
   cross-sectional study aimed to determine the prevalence of falls and
   associated risk factors in adults of all ages living with chronic pain.
   Materials and Methods: Patient-reported data were analyzed from 591
   adults with chronic pain enrolled in a local pain clinic between
   November 2017 and April 2019. Sociodemographic, history of falls, and
   biopsychosocial measures of pain were examined to identify and describe
   adults with chronic pain who fell in the previous year. Factors
   associated with falls were examined using logistic regression. Results:
   A total of 268 (45\%) reported at least 1 fall in the previous year
   (fallers) where 194 (33\%) fell in the previous 3 months, and 185 (31\%)
   had multiple falls. The prevalence of falls in the previous year was
   over 37\% across age groups. Overall, fallers were older, had greater
   pain severity and interference, lower physical function and pain
   self-efficacy, greater depression, more reported neuropathic pain, and
   had more pain sites compared with nonfallers. Number of pain sites
   reported (odds ratio=1.12; 95\% confidence interval, 1.02-1.22) and
   lower physical function (odds ratio=0.96; 95\% confidence interval,
   0.94-0.99) were independently associated with falls. Discussion: A high
   prevalence of falls was found independent of age for adults with chronic
   pain. Although the risk of falls may increase with age, lower physical
   function and more pain sites are better indicators for falls. A better
   understanding of circumstances and consequences of falls in all adults
   with chronic pain is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Additive free, selective decomposition of formic acid to hydrogen and
   carbon dioxide at room temperature is still a challenging catalytic
   process which often requires noble metal catalyst (Pd, AuPd, AuPt) and
   sodium formate as an additive. Till date, catalyst design is targeted
   towards minimum noble metal usage along with incorporation of basic
   functionalities to produce in situ formate ion (key intermediate for
   dehydrogenation) from formic acid. In this work, we have studied the
   catalytic behaviour of amino silane-functionalized graphene oxide (GO)
   containing palladium nanoparticles for formic acid decomposition in
   ambient condition. By varying amine functionalization on GO and
   palladium content, the best performing catalyst was obtained with 5 wt\%
   palladium loading. Additionally, it was observed for the first time that
   along with stability of a catalyst in reaction medium, its interaction
   with decomposed products, i.e., carbon dioxide with amine functional
   groups plays a crucial role in recyclability of a catalyst.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{691-711}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Opposition against greenhouse gas emissions reductions is strong among
   some conservative Christian groups, especially in the United States. In
   this paper, we identify five scripture-based arguments against
   greenhouse gas mitigation put forward by a core group of Christian
   conservatives ('the Cornwallists'): the anti-paganism argument, the
   enrichment argument, the omnipotence argument, the lack of moral
   relevance argument and the cost-benefit argument. We evaluate to what
   extent the arguments express positions that can be characterised as
   climate science denialist and to what degree they are consistent with
   support for climate adaptation. Using Stefan Rahmstorf's (2004) taxonomy
   of climate science denial, we conclude that the Cornwallists could be
   labelled climate change deniers. However, their opposition is not only
   based on denial of climate science but often rests on premises that
   render the science irrelevant, a position we term `relevance denialism'.}},

Title = {{Cardiovascular Disease Events and Mortality After Myocardial Infarction
   Among Black and White Adults REGARDS Study}},
Journal = {{CIRCULATION-CARDIOVASCULAR QUALITY AND OUTCOMES}},

Abstract = {{Background:
   Despite improvements in prognosis following myocardial infarction (MI),
   racial disparities persist. The objective of this study was to examine
   disparities between Black and White adults in cardiovascular disease
   (CVD), coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure (HF), and mortality
   after MI and characteristics that may explain the disparities.
   Methods:
   This prospective cohort study included 1122 REGARDS (Reasons for
   Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) study participants with
   incident MI between 2003 and 2016. We followed participants for
   subsequent CVD events (MI, stroke, HF hospitalization, or death from
   CVD; n=431), coronary heart disease events (MI or death from coronary
   heart disease; (n=277), stroke (n=68), HF events (HF hospitalization or
   death from HF; n=191), and all-cause mortality (n=527; 3-year median
   follow-up after MI).
   Results:
   Among 1122 participants with incident MI, 37.5\% were Black
   participants, 45.4\% were women, and mean age was 73.2 (SD, 9.5) years.
   The unadjusted hazard ratio for CVD events comparing Black to White
   participants was 1.42 (95\% CI, 1.17-1.71). Adjusting for
   sociodemographic characteristics did not attenuate the association (1.41
   {[}95\% CI, 1.14-1.73]), but further adjusting for pre-MI health status
   (1.25 {[}95\% CI, 1.00-1.56]) and characteristics of the MI (1.01
   {[}95\% CI, 0.80-1.27]) resulted in substantial attenuation. Similar
   patterns were observed for the other outcomes, although the number of
   strokes was small.
   Conclusions:
   Black individuals had a higher risk of CVD events and mortality after MI
   than White individuals. The disparities were explained by health status
   before MI and characteristics of the MI. These findings suggest that
   both primordial prevention of risk factors and improved acute treatment
   strategies are needed to reduce disparities in post-MI outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this study was to build and train a deep
   convolutional neural networks (CNN) algorithm to segment muscular body
   mass (MBM) to predict muscular surface from a two-dimensional axial
   computed tomography (CT) slice through L3 vertebra.
   Materials and methods: An ensemble of 15 deep learning models with a
   two-dimensional U-net architecture with a 4-level depth and 18 initial
   filters were trained to segment MBM. The muscular surface values were
   computed from the predicted masks and corrected with the algorithm's
   estimated bias. Resulting mask prediction and surface prediction were
   assessed using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and root mean squared
   error (RMSE) scores respectively using ground truth masks as standards
   of reference.
   Results: A total of 1025 individual CT slices were used for training and
   validation and 500 additional axial CT slices were used for testing. The
   obtained mean DSC and RMSE on the test set were 0.97 and 3.7 cm(2)
   respectively.
   Conclusion: Deep learning methods using convolutional neural networks
   algorithm enable a robust and automated extraction of CT derived MBM for
   sarcopenia assessment, which could be implemented in a clinical
   workflow. (C) 2020 Societe francaise de radiologie. Published by

Abstract = {{Coastal and estuarine zones are used by fish as nursery, spawning and
   feeding grounds. However, these essential habitats are characterized by
   the presence of both natural and anthropogenic stressors that may
   represent potential threats for the wellbeing of aquatic organisms,
   particularly fish. The main objective of this study was to evaluate and
   understand the effects of environmental stressors, both natural and
   anthropogenic, on coastal fish species using Ramnogaster arcuata as
   bioindicator. Fish were captured in two zones with different human
   activity levels: a highly impacted zone in Bahia Blanca Estuary (BBE)
   and a lightly impacted zone in the adjacent coastal zone (ACZ). Various
   indicators were used to determine fish responses to environmental
   stress. Main differences found between fishes from the two zones were in
   the condition index, trophic ecology (including feeding activity and
   diet composition) and liver metabolic biomarkers (ALT/AST enzymes,
   protein levels and lipid peroxidation). On the other hand, metal
   concentration levels analyzed in muscle did not show important
   differences between both environments. Physiological responses of R.
   arcuata from both zones were strongly correlated with natural stressors.}},

Journal = {{COLLEGIAN}},

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{Background: Following stabilisation in hospitals and on hospital ships
   wounded and sick servicemen in World War 1 were transferred to auxiliary
   (also known as convalescent) hospitals for convalescence and
   rehabilitation. Exploration of the work of the auxiliary (convalescent
   or rehabilitation) nurse is sparse.
   Aim: To identify the Australian trained and untrained nurses and their
   nursing work in an Australian auxiliary hospital in England during WW1.
   Methods: Digitised primary and secondary sources were used to identify
   nurses and their work. To account for names and spelling variances a
   process of data validation was employed. Findings: Formally
   unrecognised, auxiliary (rehabilitation) nurses had a high patient load
   and worked long hours. Nursing activities spanned the acute, mental
   health and rehabilitation domains.
   Discussion: Analogies can be made between perceptions of wartime
   auxiliary nursing work and the continued debate around contemporary
   rehabilitation nurses' scope of practice.
   Conclusion: The complexity of WW1 auxiliary (rehabilitation) nurses'
   work and workload was underestimated. Rehabilitative techniques gaining
   recognition today were embraced by auxiliary nurses over a century ago.

Title = {{Particle emission measurements in three scenarios of mechanical
   degradation of polypropylene-nanoclay nanocomposites}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AEROSOL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{150}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Researchers and legislators have both claimed the necessity to
   standardize the exposure assessment of polymer nanocomposites throughout
   their life cycle. In the present study we have developed and compared
   three different and independent operational protocols to investigate
   changes in particle emission behavior of mechanically degraded
   polypropylene (PP) samples containing different fillers, including talc
   and two types of nanoclays (wollastonite-WO- and montmorillonite-MMT-)
   relative to not reinforced PP. Our results have shown that the
   mechanical degradation of PP, PP-Talc, PP-WO and PP-MMT samples causes
   the release of nano-sized particles. However, the three protocols
   investigated, simulating industrial milling and drilling and household
   drilling, have produced different figures for particles generated.
   Results suggest that it is not possible to describe the effects of
   adding nano-sized modifiers to PP by a single trend that applies
   consistently across all different protocols. Differences observed might
   be attributed to a variety of causes, including the specific operational
   parameters selected for sample degradation and the instrumentation used
   for airborne particle release characterization. In particular, a
   streamlined approach for future assessments providing a measure for
   released particles as a function of the quantity of removed material
   would seem useful, which can provide a reference benchmark for the
   variations in the number of particles emitted across a wider range of
   different mechanical processes.}},

Journal = {{MICROORGANISMS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{The global increase in antimicrobial resistance has revived the interest
   in ``old{''} substances with antimicrobial activity such as sodium
   bituminosulfonate. However, for those ``old{''} compounds, scientific
   studies are still sparse and the ones available do not mostly meet the
   current standards. Since this compound is used for topical applications,
   investigation of a potential increase in minimal inhibitory
   concentrations (MICs) is of particular importance. For selection of
   phenotypes with decreased susceptibility, a collection of 30 genetically
   diverse methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant
   Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains were cultured on bi-layered linear
   gradient agar plates containing sub-inhibitory concentrations of the
   active agents. The stability of phenotypes with increased MICs was
   determined by serial passage on agent-free medium. Within 10 passages,
   only slight and, in most cases, reversible increases in MSSA and MRSA
   MIC levels toward sodium bituminosulfonate were obtained. Fusidic acid,
   used as a control, showed exponential expansions in MIC based on
   mutations in the fusA gene (elongation factor G or EF-G) with no
   reduction during the recovery phase. The only marginal and largely
   reversible changes of S. aureus MICs after exposition to sodium
   bituminosulfonate indicate a low potential for resistance development.}},

Title = {{How I do it - Second stage revision total knee arthroplasty}},
Journal = {{KNEE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2007-2012}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Infection is a potentially devastating complication
   following primary total knee arthroplasty, and the traditional
   gold-standard treatment for chronic prosthetic joint infection has been
   in the form of a two-stage revision total knee arthroplasty. This
   involves a first stage - removal of all implants and infected material,
   with implantation of a temporary spacer - followed by a second stage
   which includes reimplantation with a definitive prosthesis.
   Indications: Although the outcomes of single-stage and two-stage
   revision arthroplasty surgeries are similar, there are certain
   indications such as atypical or more virulent organisms, patient factors
   and soft tissue factors that would favour a two-stage approach.
   Surgical technique: The second stage revision procedure consists of
   explantation of the spacer with a debridement and synovectomy. Further
   samples are sent for microbiological analysis. Once the surgical field
   is clean and lavaged, the definitive prosthesis is implanted.
   Conclusions: A second stage revision total knee arthroplasty is a
   reliable procedure for the treatment of chronic prosthetic joint
   infection. There is a significant re-revision rate, predominantly due to
   recurrent deep infection. Crown Copyright (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{An investigation has been performed of 1.55-mu m vertical-cavity
   surface-emitting lasers based on heterostructures with a buried tunnel
   junction (BTJ) with a height difference of 15 nm. The devices are
   obtained by wafer fusion of heterostructures grown by molecular beam
   epitaxy and provide single-mode lasing at a BTJ diameter of up to 8 mu
   m. A decrease in the BTJ size leads to a sharp increase in the threshold
   current, the output optical power, and the resonance frequency at the
   lasing threshold. Stable single-mode lasing takes place due to the
   smoothed boundary of the buried surface relief, which induces a gradual
   change in the profile of the effective refractive index in the lateral
   direction with the effective current confinement retained. This makes it
   possible to reduce significantly the transverse optical confinement
   factor for the higher-order modes even at a large BTJ size. However, at
   a small BTJ size, it leads to the formation of a saturable absorber in
   unpumped parts of the active region.}},

Abstract = {{`Live', or novel, metaphors continue to occupy an interesting space in
   both the philosophical and cognitive sphere. One metaphorical theory,
   offered by French philosopher Paul Ricceur, is thoroughly fleshed out in
   relation to other dominant linguistic accounts of metaphor. Ricceur's
   theory is underrepresented in much of contemporary neurolinguistic
   literature even though it bears great resemblance to many features of
   modern theories in cognitive science; as such, the current article
   attempts to establish a clear connection between Ricceur's work and the
   cognitive sciences without collapsing into `psychological
   associationism'. The present article offers this connection to
   re-establish the value of philosophy and hermeneutics to the scientific
   enterprise by embracing interdisciplinary study.}},

Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},

Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Cygnus Superbubble (CSB) is a region of soft X-ray emission
   approximately 13 degrees wide in the direction of the local spiral arm.
   Such a large region might be the result of strong stellar winds and
   supernovae from nearby stellar nurseries, or it could be the result of a
   single event-a hypernova. HaloSat observed four nonoverlapping 10 degree
   diameter fields in the CSB region over the 0.4-7 keV band. The CSB
   absorption and temperature was found to be consistent over all four
   fields, with a weighted average of 6.1 x 10(21) cm(-2) and 0.190 keV,
   respectively. These observations suggest that the CSB is a cohesive
   object with a singular origin. The total thermal energy for the CSB is
   estimated at 4 x 10(52) erg, based upon a shell-like physical model of
   the CSB. Absorption and distance estimates to Cyg OB associations are
   examined. The CSB absorption is found to be most consistent with the
   absorption seen in Cyg OB1, implying that the CSB lies at a similar
   distance of 1.1-1.4 kpc.}},

Abstract = {{Since at least 2005, drug traffickers in the cities and favelas of the

   Afro-Brazilian religions as devil worship, the traffickers have forcibly
   expelled devotees of these faiths from their homes and temples,
   destroyed shrines and places of worship, and threatened to kill priests
   if they continue to practice their religion. Scholars have often
   described this religious landscape as a ``conflict{''} and a ``spiritual
   war.{''} However, I argue that Evangelized drug traffickers and
   Afro-Brazilian religions are not engaged in a two-sided struggle;
   rather, the former is unilaterally committing gross violations of the
   latter's human rights, which contravene international norms prohibiting

   the immense green banana and palm oil plantations of the Zona Bananera,
   Colombia. Walking what was before a banana emporium built by the United
   Fruit Company involves knowing how to move within infrastructures. This
   ethnographic photo-essay is a reflection on the everyday becoming of
   both infrastructure and peasant zoneros. `The Octopus', as the United
   Fruit Company is still called by locals, expanded its tentacles through
   a wide variety of materials. As much as tentacles can violently
   suffocate they can also be tamed and tricked. By repurposing
   infrastructures speculative and creative lives are lived, felt and

Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper considers the dynamic vehicle routing problem where a fleet
   of vehicles deals with periodic deliveries of goods or services to
   spatially dispersed customers over a given time horizon. Individual
   customers may only be served by predefined (dedicated) suppliers. Each
   vehicle follows a pre-planned separate route linking points defined by
   the customer location and service periods when ordered deliveries are
   carried out. Customer order specifications and their services time
   windows as well as vehicle travel times are dynamically recognized over
   time. The objective is to maximize a number of newly introduced or
   modified requests, being submitted dynamically throughout the assumed
   time horizon, but not compromising already considered orders. Therefore,
   the main question is whether a newly reported delivery request or
   currently modified/corrected one can be accepted or not. The considered
   problem arises, for example, in systems in which garbage collection or
   DHL parcel deliveries as well as preventive maintenance requests are

Title = {{Feasibility of the Far Lateral Suboccipital Approach to the

Abstract = {{Objective: The posterolateral extradural suboccipital approach can be
   used to reach the anterior epidural space and the retro-odontoid
   regions. The extent of necessary bone removal of the atlas vertebra (C1)
   has not yet been defined. We studied the changes in the size of the
   horizontal and vertical surgical windows using stepwise bone removal of
   C1. A representative case is shown.
   Methods: The anatomical study was performed bilaterally on five
   Thiel-fixed human cadavers (mean age, 83.7 years). The surgical window
   (horizontal x vertical) required to access the retro-odontoid region via
   a posterolateral approach was measured for an intact C1 posterior arch,
   after a semicircular inferior partial resection of the C1 arch, after
   resection of the unilateral hemiarch of C1, and finally after drilling
   approximately 3 mm from the medial aspect of the lateral mass of C1.
   Results: The intact C1 resulted in a very narrow surgical window of 6.3
   mm x 9.7 mm (horizontal x vertical). The vertical window increased to a
   13 mm after the semicircular inferior partial resection of the C1 arch
   and to 17.3 nun in the case of removal of the ipsilateral C1 posterior
   arch. The bone removal from the medial aspect of the C1 lateral mass
   resulted in a widening of the horizontal surgical window to 10.3 mm. The
   final size of the surgical window was 10.3 mm x 17.3 mm. The patient
   with severe kyphoscoliosis of the craniocervical spine was successfully
   operated on using odontoid and C1-2 facet osteotomies.
   Conclusion: If only the anterior epidural space or the base of the
   odontoid needs to be reached, the semicircular inferior partial
   resection of the C1 arch allows for an adequate surgical window. The tip
   of the odontoid could only be reached if the ipsilateral posterior arch
   is resected.}},

Abstract = {{The increase of breast cancer (BC) incidence has drawn attention to BC
   risk as means of reducing mortality and morbidity of the disease. The
   aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of BC risk perception,
   evaluate factors that affect risk perception and assess the correlation

   cross-sectional study included total of 258 women with average and
   high-risk for BC according to the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool
   (BCRAT). All data were collected by face-to-face interview by three
   trained 6th year medical school students using a 54-item questionnaire.
   Each participant's actual BC risk was compared to a perceived risk and
   the accuracy of the BC risk self-assessment was determined. 72\% of
   high-risk women underestimated their BC risk (p < 0.001). One third of
   subjects with a family history of BC have also underestimated their own
   risk (p = 0.002). Women who responded to screening mammography were more
   informed about BC risk factors (p = 0.001). General knowledge about BC
   chemoprevention was surprisingly low, regardless of the accuracy of BC
   risk self-assessment. High-risk women appear to be unrealistically
   optimistic, since there was a significant difference between the
   accuracy of self-perceived risk and the objective BC risk.}},

Title = {{Off-label prescription of psychotropic medications in a sample of
   Italian psychiatrists working in private practice: a cross sectional
   study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Off-label prescription refers to the use of a drug outside the terms of
   its Marketing Authorization. According to the literature, this practice
   is particularly common in clinical psychiatry.
   Objective
   To describe patterns of off-label prescription in a sample of Italian
   psychiatrists working in private practice.
   Methods
   An ad hoc questionnaire was developed and sent by e-mail to a sample of
   Italian psychiatrists working in private practice in the Region
   Emilia-Romagna. The questionnaire assessed frequency of off-label
   prescription, reasons associated with it, diagnostic categories more
   often associated with such practice, main sources of information used to
   support off-label prescription, and psychotropic agents most commonly
   prescribed off-label, as well as medical-legal implications. Data were
   analysed by means of univariate and multivariate ordered logistic
   regressions.
   Results
   Fifty psychiatrists (female: 44\%) out of 129 who received the e-mail
   invitation responded (response rate: 39\%). Off-label prescription was
   found to be inversely proportional to clinicians' age (OR = 10.53
   {[}95\% CI 2.13-52.13]). Most commonly, second-generation antipsychotics
   (SGAs) were prescribed to patients diagnosed with personality disorders
   (PDs) (OR = 0.08 {[}95\% CI 0.02-0.36]). A higher rate of off-label
   prescription was also associated to relying more on pharmaceutical sales
   representatives (OR = 0.58 {[}95\%CI 0.01-0.30]) or personal
   professionals' clinical experience (OR = 0.05 {[}95\% CI 0.01-0.36]) and

   Conclusions
   Off-label prescription is common, especially among young psychiatrists,
   who frequently rely on previous personal clinical experience, especially
   when prescribing SGAs for treating patients with PDs. Respondents
   pointed to the need for further research and training on the topic

Journal = {{MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{To scan a vehicle's environment frequency modulated continuous wave
   (FMCW) radar sensors are essential. The implementable driver assistance
   systems based on these sensors increase the comfort of an automobile.
   When integrating them into the car, the radar sensor's cover must be
   taken into account. These parts serve as protection against external
   chemical and mechanical influences, but they should also support the
   vehicle design and appearance. Usually, painted polymer components are
   used as a radome. Depending on their material parameters (i.e. relative
   permittivity and loss-tangent) polymer covers lead to reflections and
   absorption, which may impair the radar performance, if they are not
   properly designed from a microwave point of view. For an appropriate
   design procedure, the polymer properties, have to be known precisely
   beforehand or need to be analyzed in realistic experimental
   configurations. Within this paper it is shown by measurements around the
   80 GHz automotive radar bands and calculations based on the polymers
   repeating unit that the relative permittivity can be estimated from
   knowledge of the molecule structure. This allows the calculation of the
   relative permittivity of polymer molecules that have not yet been
   measured in the W-band at 80 GHz at a very early stage of the design
   process. Additionally it is shown that it has to be taken into account
   if the polymer is semi-crystalline or amorphous. Furthermore, the
   density or crystallinity has to be known.}},

Title = {{Dual innervation of free gracilis muscle for facial reanimation: What we

Abstract = {{Background: In the last decade, some institutions have begun combining
   the CFNG and masseteric nerve to provide dual innervation to the
   gracilis muscle for dynamic facial reanimation in facial paralysis
   patients. We reviewed the various ways that these two nerves have been
   coapted to provide dual innervation, and summarized the functional
   outcome for these methods.
   Methods: A search of the Ovid EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Scopus
   databases was per formed from 1946 to May 2019 for dual innervation of
   gracilis muscle using CFNG plus masseteric nerve for facial reanimation.
   Results: A total of 184 articles were identified in the initial search,
   of which seven met our inclusion criteria. Three additional abstracts
   with 43 patients were identified but the level of details was not
   sufficient to include the results in the analysis. A total of 57
   patients were reviewed (mean age of 42.1 years (6-79 years)). The
   majority of dual innervation procedures were performed using the
   ipsilateral masseteric nerve sutured end-to-end to the obturator nerve,
   and an additional CFNG connected end-to-side to the obturator nerve. In
   the 26 patients with Terzis scores available, there were no differences
   between masseteric nerve coapted end to-end and CFNG as end-to-side to
   the obturator, or the reverse coaptation. All but two patients achieved
   function of the gracilis activated by the masseteric nerve within 2-5
   months.
   Conclusions: This review shows that dual innervation of the gracilis is
   safe; and in some cases, does appear to provide early onset gracilis
   activation as well as an eventual spontaneous smile. (C) 2020 British

   Prediction of mild parkinsonism revealed by neural oscillatory changes
   and machine learning. J Neurophysiol 124: 1698- 1705, 2020. First
   published October 14, 2020; doi:10.1152/jn.00534. 2020.-Neural
   oscillatory changes within and across different frequency bands are
   thought to underlie motor dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) and
   may serve as biomarkers for closed-loop deep brain stimulation (DBS)
   approaches. Here, we used neural oscillatory signals derived from
   chronically implanted cortical and subcortical electrode arrays as
   features to train machine learning algorithms to discriminate between
   naive and mild PD states in a nonhuman primate model. Local field
   potential (LFP) data were collected over several months from a 12channel
   subdural electrocorticography (ECoG) grid and a 6-channel custom array
   implanted in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Relative to the naive state,
   the PD state showed elevated primary motor cortex (M1) and STN power in
   the beta, high gamma, and high-frequency oscillation (HFO) bands and
   decreased power in the delta band. Theta power was found to be decreased
   in STN but not M1. In the PD state there was elevated beta-HFO
   phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) in the STN. We applied machine learning
   with support vector machines with radial basis function (SVM-RBF) kernel
   and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifiers trained by features related to
   power and PAC changes to discriminate between the naive and mild states.
   Our results show that the most predictive feature of parkinsonism in the
   STN was high beta (-86\% accuracy), whereas it was HFO in M1 (-98\%
   accuracy). A feature fusion approach outperformed every individual
   feature, particularly in the M1, where -98\% accuracy was achieved with
   both classifiers. Overall, our data demonstrate the ability to use
   various frequency band power to classify the clinical state and are also
   beneficial in developing closed-loop DBS therapeutic approaches.
   NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Neurophysiological biomarkers that correlate with
   motor symptoms or disease severity are vital to improve our
   understanding of the pathophysiology in Parkinson's disease (PD) and for
   the development of more effective treatments, including deep brain
   stimulation (DBS). This work provides direct insight into the
   application of these biomarkers in training classifiers to discriminate
   between brain states, which is a first step to ward developing
   closed-loop DBS systems.}},

Abstract = {{Aiming at reducing the temperature of CaO center dot 6Al(2)O(3) (CA6)
   formation, SiO2, ZnO, and TiO2 were evaluated as mineralizing agents in
   an Al2O3-CaCO3 based macroporous thermal insulator. For the
   concentrations tested (0.6 mol\% to 2.8 mol\%), SiO2 presented a small
   effect in the temperature of CA(6) formation. However, ZnO and TiO2
   favoured full CA(6) generation at 1400 degrees C, 200 degrees C below
   the reference composition. All analysed systems, besides 2.8Si, showed
   high porosity ( 80 \%), suitable mechanical strength and expansion after
   firing at 1600 degrees C for 5 h. Softening temperature evaluation
   highlighted that ZnO-and TiO2-containing compositions could be used at
   higher temperatures than the SiO2 ones. Thus, compositions containing
   2.8 mol\% of ZnO or TiO2 were evaluated according to their thermal
   conductivity (keff), showing lower keff than the reference composition.
   Therefore, using these mineralizing agents, which are easily available,
   may provide reductions in the energy input to produce CA(6)-containing

Title = {{Attenuation of Anxiety-Like Behavior by Helichrysum stoechas (L.) Moench
   Methanolic Extract through Up-Regulation of ERK Signaling Pathways in

Abstract = {{The long-term use of anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs can cause a
   plethora of side effects and the use of complementary and alternative
   medicine, which is generally considered safer than conventional
   medicine, is consistently increasing. Helichrysum stoechas (L.) Moench
   methanolic extract (HSE) has shown MAO-A inhibitory properties in
   previous studies. With the aim of obtaining innovative and safer
   therapies for mood disorders, this study investigated the potential
   activity of HSE in the management of anxiety- and depression-related
   symptoms. HSE showed dose-dependent (30-100 mg/kg p.o.) anxiolytic-like
   activity in the light dark box and marble burying tests, without any
   antidepressant-like activity, as shown by the results of the tail
   suspension test. Additionally, HSE did not have any effect on the
   modulation of pain, which highlights its selectivity in the control of
   anxiety-related behavior. At active doses, HSE did not produce any
   sedative effect or result in impaired motor coordination and memory
   functions. Western blotting experiments showed the ability of HSE to
   counteract the reduction in the phosphorylation of ERK44/42, to restore
   brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and to return cyclic
   AMP response element binding (CREB) levels to basal levels in
   noradrenergic hippocampal neurons of mice exposed to an anxiety-related
   environment, which indicates a protective role against anxiety behavior.
   These results suggest that oral administration of HSE might represent an
   interesting opportunity for the management of anxiety disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a mycotoxin produced mainly by Fusarium species
   and occurs predominantly in cereal grains such as wheat. Due to its
   toxic effects, in the European Union DON content in unprocessed cereals
   and processed cereal-based products for human consumption has been
   regulated, and recommended maximum limits have been established for
   animal feed. In this study, a method for degrading DON on wheat kernels,
   by exposition to ammonia (NH3) vapours, was optimized. Results have
   shown that with a simple treatment with ammonia vapours at 90 degrees C
   (for 2 h), degradations higher than 75\% were achieved in kernels
   affected by a moderated contamination up to 2000 mu g/kg DON. The study
   of the reaction between DON and NH3 allowed us to tentatively establish
   the structure of possible degradation products. In addition, in silico
   evaluation indicated, in general, lower toxicity and biological effects
   for the degradation products than for DON.}},

Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A new model of vibrational energy transfer in molecular systems taking
   into account anharmonic (third order) interactions of localized
   vibrations with a chain of harmonic oscillators is developed. The role
   of the energy spectrum of the chain and of the magnitude of the
   non-linear coupling is discussed in detail by an exact numerical
   solution of the quantum dynamical problem based on the tensor-train
   (matrix product state) representation of the vibrational wave function.
   Results show that the type of wave packet motion is determined by the
   eigen-spectrum of the chain and by its excitation time. It is found that
   when the excitation of the chain takes place on a much shorter timescale
   than the energy transfer along the chain the vibrational wave packet
   moves in a ballistic way independently of the length of the chain. On
   the other hand when the excitation of the chain takes place on the
   timescale of the energy transfer along the chain the overall motion
   becomes superballistic. These findings shed new light on recent
   observations of ballistic energy transfer along polymethylene chains.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aims of this study were to evaluate changes in

   N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or mitochondrial-enhancing agents (CT), and to
   assess the how these changes may predict and/or moderate clinical

   placebo-controlled randomised trial (n = 163). Serum samples were
   collected at baseline and week 16 of the clinical trial to determine
   changes in Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC)
   following adjunctive CT and/or NAC treatment, and to explore the
   predictability of the outcome or moderator effects of these markers.
   Results: In the NAC-treated group, no difference was observed in serum
   IL-6 and TAC levels after 16 weeks of treatment with NAC or CT. However,
   results from a moderator analysis showed that in the CT group, lower
   IL-6 levels at baseline was a significant moderator of MADRS.2 (df) =
   4.90, p = 0.027) and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I,.2
   (df) = 6.28 p = 0.012). In addition, IL-6 was a non-specific but
   significant predictor of functioning (based on the Social and
   Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS)), indicating that
   individuals with higher IL-6 levels at baseline had a greater
   improvement on SOFAS regardless of their treatment (p = 0.023).
   Conclusion: Participants with lower IL-6 levels at baseline had a better
   response to the adjunctive treatment with the mitochondrialenhancing
   agents in terms of improvements in MADRS and CGI-I outcomes.}},

   Cyclic and time-dependent behaviours}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{112}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Collagen constitutes one-third of human-body proteins, providing
   mechanical strength and structural stability. Films of collagen are
   widely used in tissue engineering as scaffolds for wound healing and
   corneal implants, among other applications, presupposing the
   investigation of their mechanical properties and performance under
   various loading and environmental conditions. Part I of this research
   (Bose et al., 2020) demonstrated a drastic change in the mechanical
   response of collagen films under in-aqua conditions when compared to dry
   specimens. It was also observed that collagen films exhibited a
   strain-rate-dependent hardening behaviour with a strain-rate
   -sensitivity exponent ranging from 0.02 to 0.2. In Part II, the cyclic
   and time-dependent behaviours of collagen films were analysed under
   different loading and environmental conditions. Strain ratchetting was
   observed for collagen subjected to cyclic loading under various stress
   levels and environmental (in-air and in-aqua) conditions, while the
   in-aqua samples demonstrated an increase in the stiffness (50\% in the
   first cycle), which may be referred to as cyclic stiffening. In
   contrast, the dry samples showed a drop in the modulus after the first
   cycle, without any subsequent changes. Additionally, time-dependent
   viscoelastic properties were analysed, using dynamic mechanical analysis
   as well as creep and stress-relaxation techniques. Tan delta values for
   dry samples ranged from 0.05 to 0.075, while for hydrated ones it varied
   from 0.12 to 0.24. Collagen films exhibited primary and secondary creep
   stages, while the initial stress-relaxation was fast followed by a
   monotonous decay. The stress-strain-time data obtained from experiments
   were fitted in Prony series to estimate the relaxation moduli and times.}},

Abstract = {{Rivers play a crucial role in collecting and transporting microplastics.
   Nonetheless, the degree to which microplastic pollution of freshwaters
   affects its biota remains understudied. Sampling of wild fishes has so
   far demonstrated that microplastic ingestion occurs commonly across
   species with alternate feeding modes, as well as in different
   environmental compartments. Due to the exploratory nature of many
   preceding studies, drawing insight about factors driving microplastic
   ingestion has remained difficult. It continues unknown for instance,
   what the importance of varying environmental microplastic concentrations
   is to predict ingestion rates in fish from those areas. Here we show
   that ingestion rates of microplastic particles (>300 mm) in the benthic
   round goby from the Rhine river were negligible (1 particle in 417
   fish). Among the 535 visually selected putative microplastic fragments,
   stringent data processing steps to reduce the number of false positives
   during reference library searches, revealed the importance of taking
   such steps into account in comparison with other data processing
   routines. Our observations remained consistent, despite having collected
   fish from a strongly polluted site of the lower Rhine, which served as
   contrast to a significantly cleaner site upstream. These results
   demonstrate that higher environmental microplastic concentrations are
   not necessarily mirrored by higher ingestion rates in a given fish
   species. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an

   around the best position with a fraction of the distance between the
   lower and upper bounds as in the SAA; rather, a modified mechanism is
   used. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on the widely
   used Loney's solenoid and TEAM Workshop Problem 22 design problems. The
   obtained results show that the proposed algorithm is much better than
   the initial one. Furthermore, a comparison with other well-known

Journal = {{MARINE DRUGS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{18}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Fucoidans from Moroccan brown seaweed Bifurcaria bifurcata and Fucus
   spiralis were tested for their elicitor activity after their
   purification and complete characterization. The fucoidans of B.
   bifurcata (BBF) and of F. spiralis (FSF) were extracted and purified
   then characterized by infrared spectroscopy, proton nuclear magnetic
   resonance spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography. The results
   show that BBF and FSF are mainly sulfated with 45.49 and 49.53\% (w/w)
   sulfate, respectively. Analysis of neutral sugars determined by gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry showed that FSF and BBF were mainly
   composed of 64\% and 91\% fucose and 20\% and 6\% galactose,
   respectively, with a few other sugars such as glucose (8\% in FSF),
   rhamnose (1\% in BBF) and mannose (8\% in FSF and, 2\% in BBF). The
   eliciting activity of these sulfated polysaccharides in stimulating the
   natural defenses of the date palm was evaluated through the activity of
   phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), and the increase in phenols and
   lignin content in the roots. The results obtained clearly show that the
   two fucoidans early and intensely stimulate the natural defenses of the
   date palm after 24 h of treatments. This remarkable elicitor effect
   seems to be linked to the sulfated groups compared to non-sulfate
   alginates extracted from the same algae. These results open promising
   perspectives for a biological control approach against date palm
   diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Background. In South Africa, there are no national guidelines for the
   conduct or quality assessment of colonoscopy, the gold standard for
   investigation and diagnosis of bowel pathology.
   Objectives. To describe the clinical profile of patients and evaluate
   the practice of colonoscopy using procedural quality indicators at the
   Wits Donald Gordon Medical Centre (WDGMC) outpatient endoscopy unit
   (OEU).
   Methods. We conducted a prospective, clinical practice audit of
   colonoscopies performed on adults (>= 18 years of age). A total of 1 643
   patients were included in the study and variables that were collected
   enabled the assessment of adequacy of bowel preparation, length of
   withdrawal time and calculation of caecal intubation rate (CIR), polyp
   detection rate (PDR) and adenoma detection rate (ADR). We stratified PDR
   and ADR by sex, age, population group, withdrawal time and bowel
   preparation. CIR, PDR and ADR estimates were compared between patient
   groups by the chi(2) test; Fisher's exact test was used for 2 x 2
   tables. A p-value <0.05 was used. Benchmark recommendations by the
   American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE)/American College
   of Gastroenterology (ACG) Task Force on Colorectal Cancer (CRC) were
   used in this audit to assess individual endoscopist performance and that
   of the endoscopy unit as a whole.
   Results. The mean age of patients was 55.7 (standard deviation (SD)
   14.4; range 18 91) years, similar to 60\% were female, and the majority
   (75.5\%) were white. Of the outpatients, 77.6\% had adequate bowel
   preparation (ASGE/ACG benchmark >= 85\%). The CIR was 97.0\% overall,
   and screening colonoscopy was 96.3\% (ASGE/ACG benchmark >= 90\% overall
   and >= 95\% for screening colonoscopies). The median withdrawal time for
   negative-result screening colonoscopies was 5.7 minutes (interquartile
   range (IQR) 4.2 9.3; range 1.1 20.6) (ASGE/ACG benchmark >= 6minutes),
   and PDR and ADR were 27.6\% and 15.6\%, respectively (ASGE/ACG benchmark
   ADR >= 25\%). We demonstrated a 23.7\% increase in PDR and 14.1\%
   increase in ADR between scopes that had mean withdrawal times of >= 6
   minutes and <6 minutes, respectively. Although the number of black
   Africans in the study was relatively small, our results showed that they
   have similar ADRs and PDRs to the white population group, contradicting
   popular belief.
   Conclusions. The WDGMC OEU performed reasonably well against the
   international guidelines, despite some inadequacy in bowel preparation
   and lower than recommended median withdrawal times on negative-result
   colonoscopy. Annual auditing of clinical practice and availability of
   these data in the public domain will become standard of care, making
   this audit a baseline for longitudinal observation, assessing the impact
   of interventions, and contributing to the development of local
   guidelines.}},

Abstract = {{Community detection is an appropriate approach for discovering and
   understanding the structure and hidden information in complex networks
   One of the most critical issues in the community detection problem is
   the low-time complexity of the algorithm while preserving the accuracy
   of the algorithm, which is important in large-scale networks such as
   social networks. Local community detection algorithms try to use local
   information and provide acceptable results in a reasonable time. This
   paper proposes a fast and accurate community detection algorithm based
   on local information for the community's label assigning. In the
   proposed algorithm, local community detection is started from low degree
   nodes by label assigning in a multi-level diffusion way, called LSMD
   algorithm, with significant low time complexity. In the first phase of
   the LSMD algorithm, at first, the community's label is assigned to the
   node with degree 1 and its direct neighbor and second level neighbors.
   In fact, we used this fact that people with a smaller number of
   neighbors are not likely to be connected to diverse communities. Next, a
   community label is respectively assigned for the nodes with degrees 2,
   3, and so forth. In the second phase, initial communities are merged
   using a new simple and fast strategy as far as possible to form the
   final communities. Besides, there is no random nature in the algorithm,
   as well as the adjustable parameter. Therefore, the obtained results
   show meaningful stability for the LSMD. Experiments are performed on
   real-world and synthetic networks to evaluate the performance and
   accuracy of the proposed algorithm. The results show that the proposed
   algorithm significantly is more accurate than the other state-of-the-art
   algorithms. In addition, it substantially is faster than other local
   algorithms such as LPA, LCCD, NIBLPA, DA, RTLCD, Louvain, G-CN, Infomap,
   and ECES on large-scale networks. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Introduction: Nasal swab culture is used to identify Staphylococcus
   aureus colonization, as this is a major risk factor for surgical site
   infection (SSI) in patients who are going to undergo major heart surgery
   (MHS). We determined nasal carriage of S. aureus in patients undergoing
   MHS by comparing the yield of a conventional culture with that of a
   rapid molecular test (Xpert SA Nasal Complete, Cepheid).
   Methods: From July 2015 to April 2017, all patients who were to undergo
   MHS were invited to participate in the study. We obtained two nasal
   cultures from each patient just before entering the operating room,
   independently of a previous test for the determination of nasal
   colonization by this microorganism performed before surgery. One swab
   was used for conventional culture in the microbiology laboratory, and
   the other was used for the rapid molecular test. We defined nasal
   colonization as the presence of a positive culture for S. aureus using
   either of the two techniques. All patients were followed up until
   hospital discharge or death.
   Results: Overall, 57 out of 200 patients (28.5\%) were colonized by S.
   aureus at the time of surgery. Thirty-three patients had both
   conventional culture- and PCR-positive results. Twenty-four patients had
   a negative culture and a positive PCR test. Only twenty-one percent
   (12/57) of colonized patients had undergone an attempt to decolonise
   before the surgical intervention.
   Conclusion: A significant proportion of patients undergoing MHS are
   colonized by S. aureus in the nostrils on entering the operating room.
   New strategies to prevent SSI by this microorganism are needed. Rapid
   molecular tests immediately before MHS, followed by immediate
   decolonisation, must be evaluated. (C) 2019 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. and

Abstract = {{In response to North Korea's nuclear weapons program, South Korea is
   quietly pursuing an independent conventional counterforce and
   countervalue strategy. This strategy is unique. Few, if any, nonnuclear
   states have sought to rely on advanced conventional capabilities to
   deter a nuclear-armed adversary. Why is South Korea pursuing a
   conventional counterforce and countervalue strategy, and what could its
   impact be on strategic stability on the Korean Peninsula? South Korea's
   approach should be understood as both a short- and long-term hedge
   against U.S. abandonment. Its deterrent effect, no matter how uncertain,
   acts as a short-term stopgap if the United States abandons South Korea.
   Over the long term, capabilities such as advanced ballistic and cruise
   missiles bolster South Korea's nuclear latency. At the same time, we
   highlight that the strategy poses numerous technological and operational
   difficulties and has negative implications for arms race and crisis
   stability. Given South Korea's approach and North Korea's response,
   disarmament efforts focused purely on the bilateral U.S.-North Korea
   relationship will not succeed. Rather, any agreement will now need to
   address the growing gap in the conventional balance of forces on the
   Korean Peninsula.}},

Abstract = {{A connectivity function on a set E is a function lambda : 2(E) -> R such

   generally, polymatroids have associated connectivity functions. In this
   paper we give a method for identifying when a connectivity function
   comes from a graph. This method uses no more than a polynomial number of
   evaluations of the connectivity function. In contrast, we show that the
   problem of identifying when a connectivity function comes from a matroid
   cannot be solved in polynomial time. We also show that the problem of
   identifying when a connectivity function is not that of a matroid cannot
   be solved in polynomial time. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR \& ORGANIZATION}},

Volume = {{180}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The demand for voluntary individual lifetime annuities is low, as merely
   10\% of soon-to be retired Canadians care to buy such contracts. To
   assess the reasons why, we design a stated-preference experiment in
   which we vary characteristics of annuity contracts to estimate
   individuals' sensitivity to an annuity's money's worth (that is, the
   value-to-cost ratio). Using different measures of longevity risk and
   survival expectations, we investigate how knowledge of annuity products
   and mortality risk misperceptions affect the take-up and the sensitivity
   of the demand for annuities. We find that annuities are objectively
   actuarially neutral in general (meaning that annuity premiums are equal
   to their expected payment), and can appear to offer great value for the
   money given an individual's subjective mortality risk. We also find that
   demand is somewhat price-inelastic so that lowering the price of
   annuities could increase demand by at most 2 percentage points for a
   base of 10\%. Lack of knowledge of annuities explains another 0.8
   percentage points. We find limited additional interest for deferred
   annuities compared to immediate annuities, although respondents are less
   sensitive to deferred annuity prices. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier

   However, they can often be inconsistent. Benign colorectal disease can

   assessed. The Flesch reading ease and Flesch-Kincaid Grade level scores
   were used to calculate objective readability. Subjective assessment of
   readability, understandability, and patient opinion was assessed using a
   questionnaire. All PILs had objective readability scores at age 14 or
   older, above recommended advice. Three hundred sixty patient
   questionnaires were collected. The relationship between subjective
   readability and understandability was significant (P < .05); the easier
   a patient was able to read the information the more likely they were to
   understand it. There was no link between objective and subjective
   readability-a more difficult calculated reading score didn't correspond
   to the patient finding it harder to read. Patients preferring paper
   information were significantly older than patients who preferred online
   information (P = .01). Patient information leaflets remain valued by
   patients, and PILs that patients find easier to read are then better
   understood; however, ease of reading is not related to objective
   readability scoring and there was no consensus that a shift to online

Abstract = {{La0.8Ca0.2Ti0.8Sc0.2O3-delta (LCTSO) complex perovskite was synthesized
   through the sol-gel synthesis method. The structural and electrical
   properties of LCTSO were investigated in this study. X-ray diffraction
   analysis revealed single-phase orthorhombic crystal structure formation
   along with a slight change in the unit cell volume after doping with
   calcium (Ca) and scandium (Sc). The morphology of the sintered pellet of
   LCTSO was studied through scanning electron microscopy and transmission
   electron microscopy techniques. The alternating-current impedance
   spectroscopy technique was used to study the total conductivity of the
   materials from 300 to 800C in air atmosphere. The substitution of
   calcium (Ca2+) and scandium (Sc3+) ions in the higher-valent cationic
   sites resulted in the creation of oxygen vacancies in the lattice. The
   created oxygen vacancies provided an energy barrier for charge
   diffusion, which led to an increase in the conductivity of LCTSO, with a
   maximum value of 2.71 x 10(-3) S/cm at 750 degrees C. The synthesized
   materials exhibit enhanced mixed conductivity compared with the undoped
   LaTiO3-delta and can be suitable for many energy generation
   applications, particularly for solid oxide fuel cells.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS}},

Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We study the possibility of explaining the recent EDGES detection by an
   energy injection in the pre-recombination era. Our aim is to show that
   the residue of this energy injection could give the resultant increase
   in the energy density at frequencies x(e) equivalent to h nu/(kT)
   similar or equal to 10, which is needed to explain the EDGES result. We
   consider two models of energy injection: Gaussian profile with a fixed
   redshift of injection and radiative decay of a non-relativistic
   particle. We show that the energy injection should occur in the redshift
   range z less than or similar to 4 x 10(3) to prevent free-free processes
   from thermalizing the injected energy. The injected energy should be
   nearly 200-1000 times the CMB intensity at x(e) similar or equal to
   10(-3) to obtain the requisite residue. A large fraction of the injected
   energy gets thermalized and therefore distorts the CMB spectrum. We
   compute CMB spectral distortion for both the models and show that the
   fractional change in CMB energy density, Delta rho(CMB)/rho(CMB) similar
   or equal to 10(-6), which might be detectable with the proposed
   experiment PIXIE. We also outline the implication of our proposed
   scenario for CMB anisotropies.}},

   tendencies of addictive SMU. In a sample of 485 users of different
   social platforms (age: M (SD) = 24.75 (6.24), range: 18-58), five main
   categories of usage reasons were identified by an inductive qualitative
   content analysis: ``Search for Information and Inspiration{''}, ``Search
   for Social Interaction{''}, ``Beat of Boredom and Pastimes{''}, ``Escape
   from Negative Emotions{''}, and ``Search for Positive Emotions{''}. Flow
   experiences positively predicted the categories ``Escape from Negative
   Emotions{''} and ``Search for Positive Emotions{''}. The last one was
   additionally predicted by less depression symptoms. Only the category
   ``Escape from Negative Emotions{''} positively predicted tendencies of
   addictive SMU. Present findings contribute to the understanding of the
   development of addictive online behavior. They should be considered when
   assessing individuals at risk for problematic use of SM like Facebook

Journal = {{ARTS}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, I seek to extend our understanding of global art markets
   by focusing on the relationships between different art world agents and
   their perceived responsibilities and roles in a market considered
   locally `incipient' and emergent on the global scene. For this purpose,
   I draw on over 50 interviews with art gallerists, independent art spaces
   and visual artists represented by them, living in Sao Paulo and Rio de
   Janeiro, the two largest clusters of the contemporary art market in
   Brazil, at a time of market expansion and internationalisation. In an
   incipient market, two main functions are considered important:
   Developing the commercial circuit and opening up the market, and;
   enhancing the value of art in society. Such functions occur against the
   backdrop of a large and complex country, where the `eixo' (axis) of the
   main cities offers greater opportunities for visibility and
   valorization. The findings help to elucidate the perceptions of
   responsibility and roles in a context of market development, as well as
   the emerging boundaries between culture and the market. Moreover, the
   paper explores the emerging dynamics and strategies of art world
   development as they are enacted, offering insights into how art market
   actors perceive their roles and responsibilities, as well as the
   strategies available to them to support market consolidation.}},

Title = {{Conflict defined by global gestalt can modulate binocular rivalry
   suppression}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VISION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Binocular rivalry suppression is thought to necessarily require local
   interocular conflict: the presence of incompatible image elements, such
   as orthogonal contours, in retinally corresponding regions of two
   monocular displays. Whether suppression can also be driven by conflict
   at the level of spatially nonlocal surface or object representations is
   unclear. Here, we kept local contour conflict constant while varying
   global conflict, defined by the gestalt formed by the two monocular
   displays. Specifically, each eye was presented with a grid of image
   elements (crosses or plusses), placed such that the two eyes' individual
   grid elements did not directly overlap but the grids as a whole did. In
   a ``shared motion{''} condition, all elements moved in unison, inviting
   a gestalt made up of all elements across both eyes; in a ``different
   motions{''} condition, the elements' trajectories differed between eyes,
   inviting a gestalt of two overlapping surfaces, each associated with one
   eye. Perceptual disappearances of image elements occurred more readily
   in the different motions condition, an observation that could not be
   explained by any between-condition differences in local contour
   conflict. In a second experiment, we furthermore established that,
   whereas perceptual disappearances in the shared motion condition tended
   to involve a single element at a time, in the different motions
   condition, multiple elements belonging to the same gestalt often
   disappeared together. These findings indicate that, even though
   binocular rivalry may critically rely on inhibition due to locally
   incompatible image elements, this inhibition also depends on the global
   gestalt to which these elements contribute.}},

Title = {{Psychological maltreatment: An international challenge to children's
   safety and well being}},
Journal = {{CHILD ABUSE \& NEGLECT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{110}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Child psychological maltreatment (PM), also known as
   emotional abuse and neglect, mental violence, and emotional
   maltreatment, is the least recognized and addressed of the four major
   forms of child maltreatment.
   Objectives: This article provides an 1) the history of PM and its
   relationship to children's rights, 2) an overview of the current state
   of knowledge, 3) implications of diversity for the topic of PM, 4) an
   example of a topic-relevant intervention, and 5) a vision for further
   progress in addressing this form of child maltreatment.
   Participants and settings: NA.
   Method: Literature review, intervention description of fabricated or
   induced illness, and expert opinion.
   Results: PM is directly implicated in seven of the articles of the
   Convention. PM is common, reliable definitions of PM exist and need to
   be applied to practice and public health surveillance, harmfulness has
   been empirically established but is not fully appreciated, and countries
   vary dramatically in terms of incidence.
   Conclusions: PM is a human rights issue that must be addressed through
   child protection and promotion of child wellbeing. Adoption of reliable
   definitions of the different aspects of PM for Child Protective Service
   practice is a top policy goal. The development of empirically supported
   curricula on PM for training professionals and parents and culturally
   sensitive interventions to change social norms on the use of
   psychologically aggressive disciplinary practices and other forms of PM
   are critical research needs. Well-validated interventions to support
   quality parent-child relationships and support families exist and need
   to be widely adopted. Individual child protective measures should be
   confined to cases of ongoing serious PM when interventions have failed
   to reduce harm to the child.}},

Journal = {{AUTOMATICA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{122}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Many vehicle control systems depend on the body sideslip angle, but
   robust and cost-effective direct measurement of this angle is yet to be
   achieved for production vehicles. Estimation from indirect measurements
   is thus the only viable option. In the paper, a sideslip estimator is
   obtained through the identification of a linear parameter varying (LPV)
   model. Although inspired by physical insights into the vehicle lateral
   dynamics, the structure of the LPV estimator is not parametrized
   beforehand. Instead, the estimator is learned by means of a
   state-of-the-art non-parametric method for linear parameter varying
   identification, namely least-squares support vector machines (LS-SVM).
   Its performance is assessed over an extensive and heterogeneous set of
   experimental data, showing the effectiveness of the proposed estimator.

Pages = {{2021-2029}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Parametric g-computation is an analytic technique that can
   be used to estimate the effects of exposures, treatments and
   interventions; it relies on a different set of assumptions than more
   commonly used inverse probability weighted estimators. Whereas prior
   work has demonstrated implementations for binary exposures and
   continuous outcomes, use of parametric g-computation has been limited
   due to difficulty in implementation in more typical complex scenarios.
   Methods: We provide an easy-to-implement algorithm for parametric
   g-computation in the setting of a dynamic baseline intervention of a
   baseline exposure and a time-to-event outcome. To demonstrate the use of
   our algorithm, we apply it to estimate the effects of interventions to
   reduce area deprivation on the cumulative incidence of sexually
   transmitted infections (STIs: gonorrhea, chlamydia or trichomoniasis)
   among women living with HIV in the Women's Interagency HIV Study.
   Results: We found that reducing area deprivation by a maximum of 1
   tertile for all women would lead to a 2.7\% {[}95\% confidence interval
   (CI): 0.1\%, 4.3\%] reduction in 4-year STI incidence, and reducing
   deprivation by a maximum of 2 tertiles would lead to a 4.3\% (95\% CI:
   1.9\%, 6.4\%) reduction.
   Conclusions: As analytic methods such as parametric g-computation become
   more accessible, epidemiologists will be able to estimate
   policy-relevant effects of interventions to better inform clinical and
   public health practice and policy.}},

Abstract = {{Short-term effects of air pollution on the health of residents in the
   Metropolitan Area of Monterrey, Mexico were assessed from 2012-2015
   using a time-series approach. Guadalupe had the highest mean
   concentrations for SO2, CO and O-3; whereas Santa Catarina showed the
   highest NO2 concentrations. Escobedo and Garcia registered the highest
   levels for PM10. Only PM10 and O-3 exceeded the maximum permissible
   values established in the Mexican official standards. Most of pollutants
   and municipalities showed a great number of associations between an
   increase of 10\% in their current concentrations and mortality,
   especially for people >60 years. Different scenarios resulting from
   climatic change were built (increases of 5-25\% in daily mean
   temperature), but only the increase of 25\% (5 degrees C) showed a
   significant association with air pollutant concentrations and mortality.
   All pollutants and municipalities showed significant increases in
   relative risk indexes (RRI) resulting from an increase of 5 degrees C
   when people >60 years was considered. Results were comparable to those
   reported by other authors around the world. The RRI were low but
   significant, and thus are of public concern. This study demonstrated
   that the elderly is strongly threatened not only by atmospheric
   pollution but also by climatic change scenarios in warm and semiarid
   places.}},

   window. This negative effect nearly doubles in magnitude for firms in
   counties with a higher infection rate (-50 bps). We test a number of

   those located in counties with a large mobility decline have worse stock
   performance. Firms sensitive to COVID-19-induced uncertainty also
   exhibit more negative returns. Finally, more negative stock returns are
   associated with downward revisions in earnings forecasts.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the depth and breadth of the existing literature on university
   entrepreneurship, research has focused almost exclusively on licensing
   patents and founding spin-offs by faculty and staff. In comparison, much
   less evidence has been produced on start-ups created by students and
   graduates, mainly due to a lack of comprehensive data. This paper
   evaluates the impact of education-academic subject and foreign education
   experience-on the creation of firms by university graduates. In terms of
   the academic subject, the focus is on the distinction between science,
   technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields and non-STEM fields.
   With respect to foreign education experience, the focus is on graduates'
   experience studying outside their home country. Our analysis extends the
   scope of existing research in two ways. First, we consider the entire
   education history of graduates, not just from the researched university.
   Second, the paper extends the traditional focus on international
   students and analyzes the foreign education experience of both domestic
   and international students. The results indicate a positive relationship
   between having a non-STEM degree and entrepreneurial activity. A
   combination of STEM and non-STEM degrees is also positively related to
   the entrepreneurial propensity of graduates. Students with foreign
   education experience are significantly more likely to become
   entrepreneurs than those without such experience. Many governments focus
   their policy on attracting and retaining foreign students, especially
   those with degrees in STEM fields. Our results suggest that it is more
   important for a government to focus on both foreign-born students and
   domestic students who have foreign study experience.}},

Title = {{The impact of constitutional property law on insolvency law in South
   Africa}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL INSOLVENCY REVIEW}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{34-53}},

Abstract = {{It is common for insolvency legislation to interfere with the property
   rights of debtors, creditors and third parties in pursuit of its purpose
   to provide an orderly and fair resolution to insolvency-related
   problems. However, the South African property clause, Section 25 of the
   Constitution, prohibits arbitrary interferences with vested property
   interests. In light of this, this article focuses on the application of
   Section 25 to insolvency law in South Africa. The question is whether
   interferences with property rights in terms of insolvency legislation
   qualify as deprivations of property for constitutional purposes and, if
   so, whether they comply with the relevant validity requirements. This
   article investigates this question by explaining the interaction between
   insolvency law and constitutional law in general, followed by a closer
   look at the application and operation of the property clause in
   particular. Thereafter, three examples from case law are discussed to
   illustrate the role of constitutional property law in evaluating the
   effects of insolvency legislation in South Africa. The conclusion is
   drawn that, as long as the relevant requirements are met, the norms
   underlying the property clause do not hinder the development and
   implementation of legitimate and necessary insolvency procedures that
   could impact on vested property rights.}},

Title = {{Effects of Horizontal Grid Spacing and Inflow Environment on Forecasts
   of Cyclic Mesocyclogenesis in NSSL's Warn-on-Forecast System (WoFS)}},
Journal = {{WEATHER AND FORECASTING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{35}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Cyclic mesocyclogenesis is the process by which a supercell produces
   multiple mesocyclones with similar life cycles. The frequency of cyclic
   mesocyclogenesis has been linked to tornado potential, with higher
   frequencies decreasing the potential for tornadogenesis. Thus, the
   ability to predict the presence and frequency of cycling in supercells
   may be beneficial to forecasters for assessing tornado potential.
   However, idealized simulations of cyclic mesocyclogenesis have found it
   to be highly sensitive to environmental and computational parameters.
   Thus, whether convective-allowing models can resolve and predict cycling
   has yet to be determined. This study tests the capability of a
   storm-scale, ensemble prediction system to resolve the cycling process
   and predict its frequency. Forecasts for three cyclic supercells
   occurring in May 2017 are generated by NSSL's Warn-on-Forecast System
   (WoFS) using 3- and 1-km grid spacing. Rare cases of cyclic-like
   processes were identified at 3 km, but cycling occurred more frequently
   at 1 km. WoFS predicted variation in cycling frequencies for the storms
   that were similar to observed variations in frequency. Object-based
   identification of mesocyclones was used to extract environmental
   parameters from a storm-relative inflow sector from each mesocyclone.
   Lower magnitudes of 0-1-km storm-relative helicity and significant
   tornado parameter are present for the two more frequently cycling
   supercells, and higher values are present for the case with the fewest
   cycles. These results provide initial evidence that highresolution
   ensemble forecasts can potentially provide useful guidance on the
   likelihood and cycling frequency of cyclic supercells.}},

Title = {{Nonlinear dynamics of the fishbone-induced alpha transport on ITER}},
Journal = {{NUCLEAR FUSION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The fishbone-induced transport of alpha particles is computed for the
   ITER 15 MA baseline scenario (ITER Physics Expert Group on Energy Drive
   1999Nucl. Fusion392471) using the non-linear hybrid Kinetic-MHD code
   XTOR-K. Two limit cases have been studied, in order to analyse the
   characteristic regimes of the fishbone instability: the weak kinetic
   drive limit (Berket al1999Phys. Plasmas63102) and the strong kinetic
   drive limit (Zoncaet al2015New J. Phys.17013052). In both those regimes,
   characteristic features of then = m = 1 fishbone instability are
   recovered, such as a strong up/down-chirping of the mode frequency,
   associated with a resonant transport of trapped and passing alpha
   particles. The effects of then = m = 0 sheared poloidal and toroidal
   plasma rotation are taken into account in the simulations. The shear is
   not negligible, which implies that the fishbone mode frequency has a
   radial dependency, impacting the wave-particle resonance condition.
   Phase space hole and clump structures are observed in both non-linear
   regimes, centered around the precessional and passing resonances. These
   structures remains attached to the resonances as the different mode
   frequencies chirp up and down. In the non-linear phase, the transport of
   individual resonant trapped particles is identified to be linked to
   mode-particle synchronization. On this basis, a partial mechanism for
   the non-linear coupling between particle transport and mode dominant
   down-chirping is proposed. The overall transport of alpha particles
   through theq = 1 surface is of order 2-5\textbackslash{}\% of the
   initial population between the simulations. The loss of alpha power is
   found to be directly equal to the loss of alpha particles.}},

   schizoaffective disorder treated with oral antipsychotics, without
   previous experience of long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs).
   They were randomised to either psychoeducation with motivational
   interviewing or a control group. Hospital admissions 18 months before
   and after the intervention, and switches to LAIs 18 months after the
   intervention, were recorded.
   Results The two groups each comprised 101 participants. Fourteen from
   the intervention group and seven from the control group switched to
   LAIs. Five in the intervention group instigated the switch themselves,
   compared with zero controls (P = 0.06). Fourteen in the intervention
   group were readmitted to hospital during follow-up, compared with 23 in
   the control group (P = 0.14).
   Clinical implications Psychoeducation with motivational interviewing may
   increase patients' involvement in their treatment and reduce the relapse
   frequency.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examined the impact of reproductive factors on the
   relationship between radiation treatment (RT) for a first breast cancer
   and risk of contralateral breast cancer (CBC).
   Methods: The Women's Environmental Cancer and Radiation Epidemiology
   (WECARE) Study is a multicenter, population-based case-control study
   where cases are women with asynchronous CBC (N = 1521) and controls are
   women with unilateral breast cancer (N = 2211). Rate ratios (RR) and
   95\% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using conditional logistic
   regression to assess the independent and joint effects of RT (ever/never
   and location-specific stray radiation dose to the contralateral breast
   {[}0, >0-1Gy, >= 1Gy]) and reproductive factors (e.g., parity).
   Results: Nulliparous women treated with RT (>= 1Gy dose) were at
   increased risk of CBC compared with nulliparous women not treated with
   RT, although this relationship did not reach statistical significance
   (RR = 1.34, 95\% CI 0.87, 2.07). Women treated with RT who had an
   interval pregnancy (i.e., pregnancy after first diagnosis and before
   second diagnosis {[}in cases]/reference date {[}in controls]) had an
   increased risk of CBC compared with those who had an interval pregnancy
   with no RT (RR = 4.60, 95\% CI 1.16, 18.28). This was most apparent for
   women with higher radiation doses to the contralateral breast.
   Conclusion: Among young female survivors of breast cancer, we found some
   evidence suggesting that having an interval pregnancy could increase a
   woman's risk of CBC following RT for a first breast cancer. While
   sampling variability precludes strong interpretations, these findings
   suggest a role for pregnancy and hormonal factors in
   radiation-associated CBC. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objective This study aims to evaluate the relationship between a single
   measurement at baseline of body mass index (BMI), glycated hemoglobin
   (HbA1c) and subsequent clinical outcomes in patients with type 2
   diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
   Method Patients with T2DM were recruited from an outpatient diabetes
   clinic in a single large teaching hospital in Kingston upon Hull, UK. At
   baseline, demographics and HbA1c were recorded. Patients were
   categorized by BMI: normal weight (18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)), overweight
   (25-29.9 kg/m(2)), and obese (>30 kg/m(2)). Multivariable Cox regression
   models that included demographic, risk factors, and comorbidities were
   separately constructed for all-cause, cardiovascular, cancer and
   sepsis-related mortality, using four groups of HbA1c (<6\%, 6.0-6.9\%,
   7.0-7.9\%, and >8\%).
   Results In total, 6220 patients with T2DM (median age 62 years, 54\%
   male) were followed for a median of 10.6 years. HbA1c levels >8.0\% were
   associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular
   death. However, this increased risk was not consistent across the weight
   categories and reached statistical significance only in overweight
   patients (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m(2)).
   Conclusions In a large cohort of patients with T2DM elevated HbA1c
   levels at baseline did not consistently predict increased risk of
   all-cause and cardiovascular mortality across the different BMI
   categories. Copyright (c) 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights

   (M-age = 25.21 months) by examining child cortisol trajectories using
   five samples collected across a standardized stress paradigm. Piecewise

   children's stress responses when controlling for time of day, last
   stress task completed, and demographics. Positive parenting also
   interacted with income such that positive parenting was especially
   protective for cortisol reactivity in families experiencing greater
   poverty. Findings suggest that positive parenting behaviors are
   important for protecting children in families experiencing low income

Abstract = {{Background: Academic integrity is viewed as honest and responsible
   scholarship and the moral code of academia. Reported incidences of
   academic dishonesty among health professional students are widespread
   and may be an indicator of future unprofessional behaviour in the
   workplace. Aim: This study investigated the potential predictors of
   academic integrity in undergraduate and graduate-entry masters
   occupational therapy students. Method: Occupational therapy students
   from five universities (n = 701 participants; 609 undergraduates; 92
   graduate-entry masters) were recruited. Data were collected via a
   two-part self-report questionnaire that included six standardised
   scales: Academic Dishonesty Scale; Academic Dishonesty in the Classroom
   Setting Scale; Academic Dishonesty in the Clinical/Practice Education
   Setting Scale; Moral Development Scale for Professionals; Academic
   Dishonesty Tendency Scale; and Perceived Academic Sources of Stress.
   Data analysis involved multi-linear regression analyses with
   bootstrapping. Result: Significant predictors of academic integrity in
   occupational therapy students included age, gender, grade point average,
   public meaning, moral practice, general tendency towards cheating,
   tendency towards dishonesty in the conduct and reporting of research
   findings, tendency towards not providing appropriate references and
   acknowledgements and pressures to perform well academically. Conclusion:
   These findings will assist educators in identifying vulnerable students
   potentially prone to academic integrity infringements and implementing
   proactive strategies with them. Further studies are recommended to
   explore further predictors of students' academic integrity.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the emergent importance of liquidity events (IPOs and trade
   sales) as performance indicators for VC-backed academic spin-offs,
   empirical research on the drivers of liquidity events relating to such
   spin-offs has been limited. In adopting a search perspective, we analyze
   how different alliance types impact on VC-backed academic spin-offs'
   chances of realizing a liquidity event. We find that market search
   alliances increase a spinoff's likelihood of a liquidity event, whereas
   technology search alliances reduce this likelihood. However, the latter
   effect is mitigated when the spin-off has a founding team with prior
   market experience. We explore the implications for practice and policy
   of the development and success of VC-backed academic spin-offs.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeThe present study aimed to investigate the actual and wished
   supports to promote a successful dual career for Italian
   student-athletes.MethodsAn ad hoc questionnaire (nine items) was
   administered to 711 academic Italian student-athletes (age=234 years). A
   binomial regression for categorical outcomes was applied to discriminate
   subcategories for each item.ResultsAccording to the items which could be
   considered as more related to the actual and wished supports to promote
   a successful dual career, student-athletes mostly answered that tutoring
   (<= 24 years old, 95\%, OR 3.55; team, 95\%, OR 2.27; elite, 97\%, OR
   3.33; not sport science path, 93-96\%, OR range 3.45-7.69), e-learning
   (last year, 95\%, OR 1.97), and extra-academic merits (team, 71\%, OR
   1.47; elite, 77\%, OR 2.13) resulted as not satisfactorily supported by
   university, but highly wished by student-athletes. Also the flexibility
   in lesson frequency and exam sustainability resulted as strongly
   considered, but perceived as limited (<= 24 years old, 84\%, OR 2.43;
   Medical and Humanistic, 87\%, with respect to Sport Science path, OR
   9.01). In addition, in terms of identity, female (68\%, OR 2.22),>24
   years old (68\%, OR 2.22), sub-elite (68\%, OR 2.22), not sport science
   (57-65\%, OR 2.48-2.03), and last year of attendance (62\%, OR 3.45)
   participants showed to be more student-oriented, whereas elite (60\%),
   sport science path (61\%), and out of course (56\%) student-athletes
   perceived themselves as mainly athletic-oriented.ConclusionItalian
   student-athletes could be better supported by University in complying
   sport and academic requirements, especially by means of an improvement
   in tutoring, e-learning and a more flexible schedule, in line with the
   European Commission guidelines.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provides clinical and public
   health laboratories an unprec-edented level of information on species
   identification, antimicrobial resistance, and epidemiologic typing.
   However, multiple barriers to widespread adoption still exist. This
   research describes bacterial WGS using the Illumina iSeq 100 instrument
   to overcome some of these barriers. Using an in-house, high-quality
   single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis pipeline and a commercial
   whole-genome multilocus sequence typing program, the sequencing of
   Acinetobacter baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Clostridioides difficile,
   Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
   Serratia marcescens, and Staphylococcus aureus isolates was validated.
   The genome coverage range was 17x to 149x, with a mean of 59x. The limit
   of detection for single-nucleotide polymorphisms was 30x. Overall
   platform base calling accuracy was >99.999\%. Reproducibility and
   repeatability of base calling inferred from whole-genome multilocus
   sequence typing was species dependent and ranged from >97\% similarity
   for P. aeruginosa to >99.9\% similarity for S. aureus. Resistance gene
   and multilocus sequence typing allele identification was 100\%
   concordant with expected results. A simple, modified library preparation
   reduces the per-sample cost by half to give overall theoretical sample
   costs ranging from approximately \$50 to \$100 for library preparation
   and sequencing. The iSeq 100 provides a cost-effective and easy-to-use
   platform for clinical and public health laboratories to sequence
   bacterial isolates for a wide range of potential applications.}},

Title = {{Fiscal neutrality: Foreign ghost in our GST machine?}},
Journal = {{EJOURNAL OF TAX RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{18}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This note argues for the orthodox view that EU neutrality is not part of
   the GST law. It is no foreign ghost in our GST machine, to use the
   metaphor selected for this note. The reasons for a negative answer on
   the issue are diverse, over-lapping, consistent, and ultimately mundane.
   They also go beyond any mere analysis of the respective legislation and
   cases in each jurisdiction. The stark differences between the two legal
   systems and, more importantly, their interpretation protocols are vital
   to explaining why the orthodox view on EU neutrality is not just the
   better one, but effectively the only viable one.
   After a review of the VAT neutrality concept generally, attention turns
   in this note to the landmark judgment of Hill J in HP Mercantile, his
   later comments on `underlying philosophy', and the way they have been
   received by the courts and commentators. This leads to a review of the
   principles which apply in our system of statutory interpretation, and
   discussion of the handful of Australian cases which directly consider EU
   neutrality. That neutrality, like our own, however, is properly to be
   understood only within its particular legal, economic and political
   milieu. A review of EU interpretation principles, the impact of EU law
   in Britain and selected EU neutrality cases then follows.
   Observations made on these matters flow into a discussion of Rio Tinto,
   consumption, practical business tax and tie-breaker issues. The central
   conclusion reached by this note is that our interpretation protocols,
   and the real differences between the respective legal systems, only
   serve to confirm that EU neutrality is not part of the GST law. This is
   a less than surprising outcome. The Div 11 neutrality we do have,
   however, works to acceptable modern VAT standards of purity and
   integrity. Final comments are made about the `life of our GST statute'
   so far and its future prospects.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the dynamics of a two-degree freedom system

   We add the dash-pot with variable damping coefficient to TMDI to study

   the non-linear characteristic of the dash-pot. We investigate devices in
   which damping coefficient change according to the relative displacement
   or the relative velocity between the damped mass and tuned mass damper.
   We also include in the investigation of different types of control
   functions. We show the two-parameter diagrams presenting the main body's
   maximum amplitude versus the frequency of excitation of the damped body
   and different control parameter. We show how the application of a
   non-linear damper lets us control the main system's oscillation

Title = {{THE INFLUENCE OF THE TYPE OF BILINGUISM ON THE COGNITIVE PROCESSING OF

Journal = {{TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Number = {{461}},
Pages = {{13-22}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The article presents the final stage of an experimental study of
   cognitive processing of Russian binomials by native speakers and
   bilinguals. A hypothesis was put forward about the influence of the type
   of bilingualism, as well as the factors of frequency and word order in
   binomials on the process of their cognitive processing. The hypothesis
   was tested by an E-prime experiment measuring the reaction time. A group
   of binomials was taken as a stimulus material. They were ranked by
   frequency, based on subjective assessments of native speakers and data
   from the Russian National Corpus (high/low frequency), by the
   irreversibility score, also based on corpus and subjective data
   (normal/inverted word order). A total of 60 binomials were used. Thirty
   high-frequency (frequency range from 3.447 to 0.3 ipm) and 30
   low-frequency units (frequency range from 0.2 to 0.007 ipm), all of them
   with the irreversibility score from 75 to 100, i.e. binomials-freezes,
   units with a fixed word order. Functional bilinguals, students from
   China studying at Tomsk universities and having a TORFL level 2
   certificate were invited as respondents. A total of 25 people took part
   in the experiment, 17 women and 8 men aged 20 to 38. 1,751 reactions
   were obtained, of which 1,322 reactions were analyzed. The results of
   the functional bilinguals group were compared with those of the natural
   bilinguals group and the group of native speakers. The following
   conclusions have been made. In all three groups of respondents, the
   effect of frequency and word order parameters is found. The following
   interactions have been revealed: the reaction time increases with
   decreasing frequency and changing the word order from normal to
   inverted. However, if in the group of native speakers and Turkic-Russian
   natural early bilinguals the difference in reaction time for binomials
   under four conditions is statistically significant, for Chinese-Russian
   functional bilinguals post hoc tests do not reveal such a difference. In
   the group of Chinese-Russian bilinguals, the frequency factor turns out
   to be the main factor in the processing of binomials, and the word order
   factor does not affect the processing speed, unlike in the other two
   groups of respondents. It is concluded that natural bilinguals process
   binomials according to the model of native speakers, while the pattern
   of processing binomials by artificial bilinguals differs from the model
   of processing in the other two groups. Thus, confirming the hypothesis
   put forward, the author states that the factor of the type of
   bilingualism affects the processing of multicomponent nominative units
   in bilinguals.}},

   writings of three colonial travellers trained in medicine at the
   University of Edinburgh: William Anderson (1750-78), Archibald Menzies
   (1754-1842) and Robert Brown (1773-1858). Each travelled widely beyond
   Scotland, enabling them to make a series of observations of non-European
   peoples in a wide variety of colonial contexts. William Anderson,
   Archibald Menzies and Robert Brown in particular travelled extensively
   in the Pacific with (respectively) James Cook on his second and third
   voyages (1771-8), with George Vancouver (1791-5) and with Matthew
   Flinders (1801-3). Together, their surviving writings from these
   momentous expeditions illustrate a growing interest in
   natural-historical explanations for diversity among human populations.
   Race emerged as a key concept in this quest, but it remained entangled
   with assumptions about the stadial historical progress or
   ``civilization{''} of humanity. A comparative examination of their
   ethnographic writings thus presents a unique opportunity to study the
   complex interplay between concepts of race, savagery and civilization in
   the varied colonial contexts of the Scottish Enlightenment.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{134}},

Abstract = {{In the upcoming decade, biofuels made from agricultural residues, wastes
   and by-products will most likely present an integral part of biofuel
   provision to achieve greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets. This study
   provides an evaluation of potential changes in GHG emissions arising
   from the introduction of alternative fuels. To this end, potential
   changes in GHG emissions arising from the introduction of 36 biorefinery
   configurations in 26 EU member states providing a broad spectrum of
   products (e.g. biofuels, chemicals, feed and food additives) are
   assessed. Additional electrofuel production using biogenic CO2 is
   evaluated. The assessment considers country specific energy supply,
   market conditions and soil characteristics. The potential changes in GHG
   emissions arising from the introduction of these facilities range from
   -206 to 135 and from -221 to -17 g CO2 per MJ of bioethanol provided
   from wheat grains and wheat straw, respectively. The analysis reveals a
   high variability in GHG intensities related to marginal feedstock and
   energy supply as well as potentially occurring displacement effects
   depending on location. A Monte Carlo simulation confirms potential
   reductions in GHG emissions. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the
   methodology used within the EU to evaluate GHG emissions provided by the
   Renewable Energy Directive (II) denies market access to certain types of
   biorefineries and production modalities that bear the potential to
   reduce GHG emissions. It is concluded that EU biofuel policy strategies
   targeting (advanced) biofuels should consider local conditions and
   markets and should especially pay attention to potential changes in
   other markets.}},

Abstract = {{Local wisdom has been coexisting with the state system in several places
   in Indonesia. The Mountain Mutis Nature Reserve in East Nusa Tenggara
   province is the strict nature reserves, but a customary land tenure
   system, called suf, exists so far in the nature reserve. The objectives
   of this study are (1) to organize the historical territorialization
   process, (2) to clarify the customary land tenure system and activities
   for livelihoods by local people, and (3) to discuss the challenges of
   its land tenure system to manage forests sustainably as well as policy
   methods to harmonize legal pluralism in Mutis Area. Field observation
   and in-depth interviews with key informants were employed for data
   collection, and the collected data were analyzed by a qualitative
   descriptive method. The findings showed the traditional reward and
   punishment systems regarding extracting non-timber forest products,
   grazing livestock, and preventing forest fires were working well for
   sustainable forest management. However, increased pressure on forests
   due to future population growth appears to have an impact on the
   traditional system. It also showed the government officers and local
   people started some discussions to recognize the suf in the formal legal
   order. However, there were institutional problems to introduce current
   state systems. Therefore, it is required to flexibly operate or revise
   the state laws according to the actual situation to harmonize society
   between state and people.}},

   silica gel-100, Amberlite XAD-7 ion-exchange resin, and Amberlite XAD-7
   ion-exchange resin to form sorbents in nature of supported ionic liquid
   phase. The influence of some factors, such as ionic liquid and solid
   carrier structure, IL/Pt molar ratio, and ionic liquid loading as well
   as sorption isotherms, was investigated. The stripping and desorption of
   Pt(IV) using different eluents and reusability of ionic liquids and

Title = {{A Parametric Computational Study of RC Building Structures under
   Corner-Column Removal Situations}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Building progressive collapse is currently one of the hottest topics in
   the structural engineering field. Most of the research carried out to
   date on this topic has been focused on the structural analysis of the
   failure of one or more columns in a building to determine the
   Alternative Load Paths (ALPs) the structure can activate. Past research
   was mainly focused on extreme situations with high loads and large
   structural deformations and, to a lesser extent, research looked at
   lower loads used in design accidental situations, which requires a
   different set of assumptions in the analysis. This paper describes a
   study aimed at analysing accidental design situations in corner-column
   removal scenarios in reinforced concrete (RC) building structures and
   evaluating the available real ALPs in order to establish practical
   recommendations for design situations that could be taken into account
   in future design codes. A wide parametric computational analysis was
   carried out with advanced Finite Element (FE) models which the authors
   validated by full-scale tests on a purpose-built building structure. The
   findings allowed us to: (i) establish design recommendations, (ii)
   demonstrate the importance of Vierendeel action and (iii) recommend
   Dynamic Amplification Factors (DAFs) for design situations.}},

Abstract = {{The geochemistry and diagnostic evaluation of Cretaceous-Tertiary
   kaolins in the Douala Sub-Basin in Cameroon were carried out in order to
   determine their potential industrial applications. The mineralogical,
   physical, physico-chemical and geochemical characteristics of the
   kaolins were determined. Quartz and kaolinite are the most dominant
   mineral phases in bulk kaolins (means of 45.25 and 33.90 wt\%,
   respectively); whereas in the <2 mu m fraction, kaolinite is the most
   dominant mineral phase (mean of 72.17 wt\%). The texture of half of the
   samples is sandy loamy clay or sandy loam texture, and the colour from
   white to light reddish brown. The moisture content is generally <2 wt\%
   in all the size fractions. The kaolins have an acidic pH, and the
   electrical conductivity is below 55 mu S/cm. The major oxides
   geochemistry shows that the most abundant major oxides are silica and
   alumina, followed by iron oxide and titania. As physical,
   physico-chemical and geochemical characteristics of kaolins determine
   their potential industrial applications, these were inferred. Based on
   the interpretation of the results, the investigated kaolins could be
   used in the pharmaceutical, construction, pottery and cosmetics

Abstract = {{Objective: Eye injuries are one of the leading causes of disabling
   ocular morbidity. The objective of this bibliometric study was to
   evaluate the top 100 cited articles on ocular trauma published between
   1975 and 2018 via multidimensional citation analysis.
   Methods: We analyzed the top 100 cited articles among 3,768 ocular
   trauma articles published between 1975 and 2018; these articles were
   obtained from the databases in Web of Science and PubMed based on their
   citation rates per article, publication years, countries of origin,
   institutions or organizations, the most common subjects, funding status,
   article types, and levels of evidence. The data obtained were analyzed
   with the SPSS' 20.0 software package program.
   Results: In the top 100 cited articles on ocular trauma, the total
   number of authors was 420 and the average authorship was 4.20 +/- 2.23
   (range: 1-14). In our study, 70 of the top 100 cited articles were
   published in journals with an impact factor (IF) of 22.00 (range:
   2.016-8.806), and Q index or quartile score of these journals was mostly
   Q1. Although the most preferred journal was Ophthalmology according to
   the total number of citations and articles (n=2,183 and n=23,
   respectively), Eye was the most preferred journal according to the mean
   number of citations per article. Besides, the three most common topics
   among the top 100 cited articles were mechanical eyeball injury (40
   articles), epidemiology of ocular trauma (19 articles), and traumatic
   eye infection (17 articles). The average level of evidence was found to
   be 3.14 +/- 0.66 (range: 1-4), and the mean number of citations per
   article was the highest level at 2. Moreover, we also found that the
   most commonly preferred article type by authors was clinical research
   (92 articles), and most of them were in the B level of evidence group
   (70 articles).
   Conclusion: Analysis of the top 100 most cited articles on ocular trauma
   as an update study can provide us scientific contributions and vital
   current data in clinical implementations.}},

Abstract = {{Titanium dioxide is produced or imported into the EU for over one
   million tons/year. The International Agency for Research on Cancer
   (IARC) classification is 2B, a possible inhalation carcinogen for
   humans. This study evaluates urinary biomarkers of oxidative stress in
   workers of a plant producing TiO2 pigment powder, having 0.25 mu m
   average particle size and an ultrafine fraction, compared to unexposed
   subjects. Urine samples were collected from forty workers before and
   after the shift, from six employees of the same company and eighteen
   volunteers from the same geographical area. Titanium and other metals
   concentrations were measured by ICP-MS, while DNA, RNA, and protein
   oxidation products by HPLC/MS-MS. A statistically significant increase
   was found for the urinary concentration of Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb,
   Ti, and Zr, and for all biomarkers of oxidative stress in post-shift
   workers' urine samples. Urinary concentrations after the working shift
   were higher than for employees and volunteers pooled together for Cd,
   Mn, and Zr, and for the oxidative stress biomarkers 8-oxoGuo, 8-oxodGuo,
   and 3NO(2)Tyr. Biomonitoring studies on dose and effect biomarkers for
   TiO2 occupational exposure provide information useful for protecting
   workers' health even in conditions that comply with health and safety
   standards, highlighting reversible effects of chronic exposure at very
   low doses.}},

Abstract = {{Millions of Americans have learned some form of meditation, including
   mindfulness, mantra, and spiritual meditation. The majority of them
   learned on their own, comparatively few consulting a practitioner or
   attending a meditation class to receive instruction. Despite persistent
   consumer interest, there is limited research on meditation instruction.
   As interest in meditation continues to grow, the need for information on
   instructional best practices becomes increasingly important. For this
   reason, an instructional resource was developed that provided a simple
   heuristic for understanding and navigating meditation practice. A
   consumer-oriented pilot study was conducted to evaluate the resource in
   terms of perceived benefit, memorability, and satisfaction. The majority
   of participants reported it to be beneficial for understanding and
   practicing meditation and were able to recall the four elements of the
   resource correctly following a 3-week latency period and indicated
   general satisfaction with the resource. Meditation practice on days
   using versus not using the resource was also longer. Results suggest
   that a simple meditation resource can be of benefit in meditation
   instruction and practice.}},

Abstract = {{Background The sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG), in the pterygopalatine
   fossa, is a known current and historical target for therapeutic
   intervention in headache disorders because of its role in cranial
   autonomics and vasodilation. There remains an overall lack of
   well-established SPG treatment protocols, particularly with the advent
   of newer commercial devices. Methods A 22 multiple-choice question
   survey was created to evaluate clinical practice patterns with SPG block
   and sent to members of the American Headache Society (AHS). Questions
   focused on determining indications, preferred applicators, medications
   applied, perceived efficacy, tolerability, and reimbursement. Results
   One hundred seventy-two of 1,346 (12.8\%) AHS members participated.
   Ninety-three respondents (56.3\%) had performed SPG blocks on 50 or
   fewer patients. The SphenoCath (42.4\%) and the Tx360 (41.8\%) were the
   most common methods of application. Ease of use was the top reason for
   provider preference in applicator type. SPG blocks were mostly used as
   an as-needed one-time procedure. When a scheduled protocol was used,
   twice weekly for 6 weeks was most common. Chronic migraine was the most
   commonly treated headache disorder and rated the most likely to respond
   to SPG block. Experienced clinicians found SPG more helpful as a
   stand-alone treatment and tended to report that acute relief was not
   predictive of enduring response. Conclusions The variety of responses
   strongly suggests that clinicians would benefit from formalized
   protocols for SPG blocks. More experienced clinicians may have developed
   individualized protocols that they feel are more effective. The lack of
   evidence-based protocols contribute to clinicians not performing SPG
   blocks more frequently.}},

Abstract = {{Short-legged, small, robust frogs of the family Craugastoridae present a
   remarkable beta-diversity in the high Andes, their distributions being
   characterized by a very high degree of micro-endemism to specific
   valleys. We used dataloggers to study the temperature and humidity
   conditions of microhabitats of several species of the genus Microkayla
   at three elevation belts: below, within, and above the altitudinal range
   of their distribution in Bolivia. We also conducted thermal physiology
   experiments on a limited number of individuals of one of these species.
   Our aim was to infer on factors that may limit the distribution of
   anurans in a biological hotspot that is threatened by climate warming.
   We found an unexpected thermal heterogeneity within the slopes at three
   different Andean valleys that explained the specific distribution of
   species of Microkayla at each site. Species distribution was associated
   to elevation belts with the highest ambient relative humidity, and there
   was high variability in thermal preference when individuals were
   experimentally exposed to a thermal gradient. Critical thermal maxima
   compared to the temperatures that frogs confront in nature, as well as
   thermal performance trials, revealed that the studied species has a
   broad physiological tolerance to temperature. These results point to
   moisture, and not temperature, as the limiting climatic factor
   determining the occurrence of these species in high Andean slopes, but
   further experimental work on water balance is needed. The predicted
   desertification of the Andes in future climate change scenarios poses a
   potentially serious threat to this highly diverse group of amphibians.}},

Abstract = {{This article demonstrates how a combination of well-known tools-a
   standard 2D detector (CCD (charge-coupled device) camera) and a crystal
   analyzer-can improve the multimodality of X-ray imaging and tomographic
   sensing. The use of a crystal analyzer allowed two characteristic lines
   of the molybdenum anode-K alpha and K-beta- to be separated from the
   polychromatic radiation of the conventional X-ray tube. Thus, as a
   result of one measurement, three radiographic projections (images) were
   simultaneously recorded. The projection images at different wavelengths
   were separated in space and registered independently for further
   processing, which is of interest for the spectral tomography method. A
   projective transformation to compensate for the geometric distortions
   that occur during asymmetric diffraction was used. The first
   experimental results presented here appear promising.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic gaming machines (EGMs) are recognised as one of the most
   harmful gambling forms, because they promote high-speed repetitive
   gambling and automatically reinvest winnings. These features, amongst
   others, make it difficult for EGM gamblers to keep track of their play.
   Tools to assist gamblers exist, but have limited effectiveness because
   they require user registration and manual activation, leading to low
   uptake. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of a more
   informative interface (including removal of automatic reinvestment of
   winnings) and pop-up messages on gambling behaviour, and on player
   experience. A total of 213 Australian participants, recruited through
   social media, played a simulated online EGM. The experiment was a two
   (standard vs. informative interface) x two (pop-ups absent vs. present)
   between-subjects design. The informative interface: promoted keeping
   track of spins played; increased accurate estimation of amount spent (as
   did pop-up messages) and time played; and provided game usage figures
   which acted as cues to quit play. Once the initial deposit (but not
   winnings) was expended, informative interface users could opt to
   reinvest their winnings, although many opted to exit at that point. No
   difference in total spending or dissociation was observed between
   experimental groups. Informative interface users reported no reduction
   in enjoyment. Pop-up messages reduced enjoyment with the standard
   interface, but increased enjoyment when paired with an informative
   interface. These findings indicate that a more informative interface and
   pop-up messages may be useful in reducing the harmful nature of EGMs.}},

Abstract = {{In 2015 Europe's refugee protection crisis triggered the effective
   collapse of the world's most complex regional framework for asylum. A
   development both unexpected and unexplained by the hierarchical model of
   European asylum law that tends to dominate the scholarly field. The
   abandonment among member states of core obligations under international
   and EU law and the principles of solidarity and good faith is central to
   this crisis. This dynamic has been in the making since the accession
   process when EU membership was offered in exchange for transposing
   international obligations through the EU asylum acquis, collectivizing
   external border control and shifting refugee `responsibility' to new
   member states with minimal standards for refugee protection and weak
   enforcement mechanisms. Yet, the critical feature of this asylum crisis
   is its development into a European constitutional crisis, impacting
   freedom of movement, sincere co-operation, democracy, and the rule of
   law. A hierarchical model of law offers only a partial explanation of
   this interplay between refugee protection and European governance. A
   turn to the methodological debates in international law urges the
   repositioning of the lens of refugee legal scholarship, offering
   insights into the evolution towards crisis by looking at law from below
   against the backdrop of law in history, subregional law-making, and
   shifting power constellations. This process suggests that refugee law
   scholarship could benefit from widening its methodological canon by
   visiting its parent field of public international law.}},

Title = {{Editing the Pitch: Patterns of Editing Strategies of Written Pitches in
   a Chilean Accelerator Program}},

Abstract = {{Background: After a six-month training program in the Chilean public
   accelerator Start-Up Chile, entrepreneurs are asked to update a short
   pitch they wrote in the submission stage to appear in the program's
   online portfolio. Literature review: We reviewed relevant literature
   related to the pitch as well as research aiming to track changes within
   pitches. Research questions: 1. Which are the editing strategies used to
   change their pitch? 2. Do these strategies conform to specific
   discursive patterns? Research methodology: To answer the research
   questions, we designed an exploratory qualitative study to describe in
   depth the editing strategies used by two generations of startups,
   corresponding to 148 pairs of written pitches. In order to contextualize
   the results, we conducted two interviews with the program managers and
   analyzed the accelerator's official Playbook and Technical and
   Administrative Requirements. Results: We identified 10 editing
   strategies. Of those editing strategies, ``Deleting technical
   descriptions{''} is by far the most common procedure. The identified
   patterns can be classified into two groups, those simplifying, hedging,
   and focusing on certain elements of the first pitch, and those adding
   and specifying information of the first version. Conclusions: We
   conclude by discussing the strengths of this methodological approach for
   understanding such edits and for supporting successful edits in
   accelerator programs, as well as the potential for better understanding
   entrepreneur coachability.}},

   simulations using the CA-Markov model}},
Journal = {{ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Variations in the thematic resolution can impact the characterization of
   environmental heterogeneity and can consequently alter land use change
   predictions. In the current study, we quantified the impact of the
   thematic resolution of land use data on cellular automata (CA)-Markov
   model predictions by running five scenarios with increasing thematic
   resolutions (2-, 4-, 6-, 9-, and 11-class land use maps). The proposed
   model was able to replicate 83.8\% of a historical land use map from
   2010, indicating a satisfactory calibration process. Decreasing the
   thematic resolution reduced the overall prediction accuracy and
   increased the relative prediction error. This suggests the need to
   employ two indicators (overall prediction accuracy and relative
   prediction error) to assess the model performance. Furthermore, the
   choice of thematic resolution for the CA-Markov model depends on the
   required output. For example, the overall prediction accuracy and
   relative prediction error indicate a 4- and 11-class thematic resolution
   to be optimal for the forecasting of land use change in agricultural and
   construction land models, respectively. However, a finer thematic
   resolution is generally expected to minimize uncertainties in land use
   prediction using the CA-Markov model. Our conclusions provide reference
   for land use change predictions across the globe via the CA-Markov
   model.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{320}},
Pages = {{49-54}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Aims: We aimed to identify the clinical characteristics and examine
   outcomes in patients with significant tricuspid regurgitation (TR) who
   received transcatheter tricuspid valve intervention (TTVI) compared with
   guideline directed medical therapy (GDMT).
   Methods and results: Between 2015 and 2019, 124 patients with
   symptomatic severe TR were assessed at St. Michael's Hospital.
   Seventy-one patients were ineligible and received GDMT only while 53
   patients received TTVI and GDMT. During follow-up, TTVI was associated
   with significant improvements in NYHA functional class and 6-min walk
   distance (p < .001). GDMT patients had lower survival (46.9\% vs 75.1\%,
   p = .047) and lower freedom from heart failure hospitalization (HHF) and
   mortality (33.2\% vs 62.7\%, p = .027), higher incidences per 100
   person-year of gastrointestinal bleeding {[}15.58 (95\% CI 8.90-25.31)
   vs 4.24 (95\% CI 0.85-12.37), p = .04] and acute kidney injury {[}36.98
   (95\% CI 26.17-50.76) vs 14.12 (95\% CI 6.76-25.96), p = .001] compared
   with TTVI patients.
   Conclusion: TTVI in addition to GDMT was effective at improving TR
   symptoms, functional status, and was associated with lower rates of
   all-cause mortality, the combined endpoint of HHF and mortality, AKI and
   GI bleeding. Future randomized controlled trials on TTVI are needed. (C)

Abstract = {{Bronchial asthma poses a serious threat to human health. Previous
   studies have documented the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in
   asthma. However, the molecular mechanism underlying bronchial asthma
   remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role
   of the lncRNA Opa-interacting protein 5 antisense RNA1 (OIP5-AS1) in the
   house dust mite-induced inflammatory response in human bronchial
   epithelial cells. BEAS-2B cells were treated with Dermatophagoides
   pteronyssinus peptidase 1 (Der p1) to establish an in vitro model of
   asthma. OIP5-AS1 expression levels increased in BEAS-2B cells following
   Der p1 treatment, while microRNA (miR)-143-3p was downregulated.
   Additionally, the levels of the pro-inflammatory factors tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 were measured, and apoptosis
   was evaluated following OIP5 silencing. OIP5-AS1 knockdown reduced the
   inflammatory response and apoptosis in BEAS-2B cells. Furthermore, using
   dual luciferase reporter assays and co-transfection experiments, it was
   demonstrated that the function of OIP5-AS1 was mediated by miR-143-3p.
   miR-143-3p overexpression attenuated the Der p1-induced inflammatory
   response and apoptosis of BEAS-2B cells by targeting high mobility group
   box 1 (HMGB1). In summary, OIP5-AS1 exacerbated Der p1-induced
   inflammation and apoptosis in BEAS-2B cells by targeting miR-143-3p via
   HMGB1.}},

   TiO2 nanotubes for the photoelectrochemical biosensing}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{878}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{TiO2 nanotubes (TNTs) were fabricated by anodic oxidation and the
   partially reduced black-TNTs (B-TNTs) were obtained by electrochemical
   reduction. After the sensitization of B-TNTs with thioflavin T
   (B-TNTs-Th-T), the photoelectrode was used as a photoelectrochemical
   (PEC) biosensing of glucose. The uniform porous architecture of TNTs
   with a high surface to volume ratio is responsible for the
   photo-generated charge transfer and Th-T absorption and sensitization
   broadened the light absorption range and intensity. The favorable
   matching of energy levels between Th-T and B-TNTs allowed a fast
   electron transfer from excited Th-T to TNTs under chemiluminescence
   (CL). Furthermore, the bandgap of TNTs was red-shifted after the
   formation of B-TNTs and the red edge of the photonic stop-band was
   deliberately tuned to overlap with both the bandgap of the
   semiconducting material and the CL emission spectrum, by leading dual
   enhancement effects which enhanced the photocurrent unprecedentedly
   mainly owing to the ``slow light effect{''}. The photo-electrode yielded
   40 times higher photocurrent compared to TiO2 thin film coated
   counterpart indicating effectively harnessing of CL. The biosensor has a
   large linear measurement range of 0.027-5 mM with a LOD of 8 mu M for
   glucose. The phenomenon ``slow light effect{''} will pay the way for
   efficient light harnessing and management for commercially available
   more sensitive and inexpensive PEC devices in the future.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to qualitatively explore the per- and
   poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure experience and associated
   stressors, to inform public health efforts to support psychosocial
   health and resilience in affected communities. Semi-structured
   interviews (n = 9) were conducted from July-September 2019 with
   community members and state public health department representatives
   from areas with PFAS-contaminated drinking water. Thematic analysis was
   completed and themes were described and summarized. Reported stressors
   included health concerns and uncertainty, institutional delegitimization
   and associated distrust, and financial burdens. Interviewees provided
   several strategies to reduce stress and promote stress coping capacity
   and resilience, including showing empathy and validating the normalcy of
   experiencing stress; building trust through visible action and sustained
   community engagement; providing information and actionable guidance;
   discussing stress carefully; fostering stress coping capacity and
   resilience with opportunities to build social capital and restore
   agency; and building capacity among government agencies and health care
   providers to address psychosocial stress. While communities affected by
   PFAS contamination will face unavoidable stressors, positive
   interactions with government responders and health care providers may
   help reduce negative stress. More research on how best to integrate
   community psychosocial health and stress coping and resilience concepts
   into the public health response to environmental contamination could be
   helpful in addressing these stressors.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Sequence-specific and consequential interactions within or between
   proteins and/or RNAs can be predicted by identifying co-evolution of
   residues in these molecules. Different algorithms have been used to
   detect co-evolution, often using biological data to benchmark a methods
   ability to discriminate against indirect co-evolution. Such a benchmark
   is problematic, because not all the interactions and evolutionary
   constraints underlying real data can be known a priori. Instead,
   sequences generated in silico to simulate co-evolution would be
   preferable, and can be obtained using aCES, the software tool presented
   here. Conservation and co-evolution constraints can be specified for any
   residue across a number of molecules, allowing the user to capture a
   complex, realistic set of interactions. Resulting alignments were used
   to benchmark several co-evolutiondetection tools for their ability to
   separate signal from background as well as discriminating direct from
   indirect signals. This approach can aid in refinement of these
   algorithms. In addition, systematic tuning of these constraints sheds
   new light on how they drive co-evolution between residues. Better
   understanding how to detect co-evolution and the residue interactions
   they predict can lead to a wide range of insights important for
   synthetic biologists interested in o engineering new, orthogonal
   interactions between two macromolecules.}},

Abstract = {{Despite widespread interest in the construct of executive functioning
   (EF), we currently lack definitive evidence regarding the best
   measurement model for representing the construct in substantive
   analyses. The most common practice is to represent EF ability as a
   reflective latent variable, with child performance on individual EF
   tasks as observed indicators. The current article critically evaluates
   the dominant use of reflective latent variable models in the child EF
   literature and compares them to composite models, a reasonable
   alternative. We review the literature suggesting that reflective latent
   variable models may not be the most appropriate representation of the
   construct of EF. Using preschool (M-age = 48.3 months) and first grade
   (M-age = 83.5 months) data from the Family Life Project (N = 920), we
   also investigate the implications of measurement model specification for
   the interpretation of study findings. Children in this sample varied in
   terms of sex (49\% male), race (43\% black) and socioeconomic status
   (76\% low-income). Our findings show that the conclusions we draw from 2
   substantive analyses differ depending on whether EF is modeled as a
   reflective latent variable versus a composite variable. We describe the
   implications of these findings for research on child EF and offer
   practical recommendations for producers and consumers of developmental
   research.}},

Abstract = {{The MT-TL1 gene codes for the mitochondrial leucine transfer RNA
   (tRNA(Leu(UUR))) necessary for mitochondrial translation. Pathogenic
   variants in the MT-TL1 gene result in mitochondriopathy in humans. The
   m.3250T>C variant in the MT-TL1 gene has been previously associated with
   exercise intolerance and mitochondrial myopathy, yet disease
   classification for this variant has not been consistently reported.
   Molecular studies suggest the m.3250T>C variant does not alter
   tRNA(Leu(UUR)) structure but may have a modest impact on aminoacylation
   capacity. However, functional studies are limited. Our study aimed to
   further define the clinical presentation, inheritance pattern, and
   molecular pathology of the m.3250T>C variant. Families with the
   m.3250T>C variant were recruited from the Mitochondrial Disease Clinic
   at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and GeneDx laboratory
   database. Affected individuals most frequently presented with cardiac
   findings, exercise intolerance, and muscle weakness. Hypertrophic
   cardiomyopathy was the most frequent cardiac finding. Many asymptomatic
   individuals had homoplasmic or near homoplasmic levels of the m.3250T>C
   variant, suggesting the penetrance is incomplete. Patient-derived
   fibroblasts demonstrated lowered ATP production and increased levels of
   reactive oxygen species. Our results demonstrate that the m.3250T>C
   variant exhibits incomplete penetrance and may be a possible cause of
   cardiomyopathy by impacting cellular respiration in mitochondria.}},

Abstract = {{Set in the context of modeling-based learning (MBL), this research
   investigated the potential of epistemic frames as a theoretical and
   analytical framework for understanding teaching and learning practices
   used in classroom communities of practice. Epistemic frames are
   conceptualized as an orienting lens for a classroom community of
   practice that emerges out of how they organize knowledge structures and
   practices to support their ways of knowing. This research examined the
   types and organization of practices in the classroom where a MBL unit
   was implemented to understand what sense-making practices were used, and
   how these practices supported the classroom community's negotiation of
   understanding. Through this analysis, a sense of the viability of
   epistemic frames as a productive theoretical and analytical lens was
   revealed in terms of providing a better understanding of the nuances and
   context dependencies of what students and teachers do to make sense of
   real-world scientific phenomena in classrooms.}},

Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Due to rapid economic development and population growth, environmental
   pollution problems such as urban pollution and depletion of natural
   resources have become increasingly prominent. Municipal solid waste is
   part of these problems. However, waste is actually an improperly placed
   resource. As a part of green supply chain management, remanufacturing
   can turn waste products into remanufactured products for resale. Based
   on the development status of China's remanufacturing industry, this
   paper establishes three Stackelberg game models, namely the free
   recycling model (model N), the government regulation model based on the
   reward-penalty mechanism (model G), and the government dual-intervention
   model (model GF). In this study, the standard solution method for the
   Stackelberg game method, namely the backward induction method, is
   applied to solve the dynamic game equilibrium. For comparison, a further
   numerical analysis is also carried. The research results show that: (1)
   in the closed-loop supply chain based on remanufacturing, the
   strengthening of cooperation between manufacturers and remanufacturers
   is beneficial in terms of maximizing supply chain profits; (2) in order
   to maximize social benefits, the government needs to intervene in green
   supply chain management; (3) government regulation is particularly
   important when the remanufacturing industry is in the initial stage of
   development; (4) government intervention needs to be based on the
   development level of the remanufacturing industry; (5) in order to
   maximize social benefits, it is recommended that the government consider
   the ratio between the green consumption subsidies and the taxes on new
   products.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we report parts per billion (ppb) NO2 gas detection by
   utilizing zinc oxide/reduced graphene oxide (ZnO/rGO) heterostructure
   through a chemiresistive approach. The sensing material is carefully
   investigated through numerous characterization techniques. The
   experimental results indicated that the designed sensor shown good
   linearity in low ppb range of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) gas. The sensor
   exhibited very high response of 33.11 at 2.5 ppm in 182 s with obtained
   detection limit down to ppb at relatively low optimal operating
   temperature of 110 degrees C. The remarkable performance of ZnO/rGO
   heterostructure towards NO2 and negligible cross response to other
   interfering gases along with high repeatability and long-term stability
   of the sensor is investigated. Due to many reactive sites and high
   transport capability of rGO along with high gas adsorption of ZnO
   nanospheres which attributes to the favorable charge transfer at ZnO/rGO
   interface under exposure of NO2 gas which leads to modulate the energy

Abstract = {{Epigenetic aberration is implicated in aging and neurodegeneration.
   Using postmortem tissues from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and
   AD mouse models, we have found that the permissive histone mark H3K4me3
   and its catalyzing enzymes are significantly elevated in the prefrontal
   cortex (PFC). Inhibiting H3K4-specific methyltransferases with the
   compound WDR5-0103 leads to the substantial recovery of PFC synaptic
   function and memory-related behaviors in AD mice. Among the up-regulated
   genes reversed by WDR5-0103 treatment in PFC of AD mice, many have the
   increased H3K4me3 enrichment at their promoters. One of the identified
   top-ranking target genes, Sgk1, which encodes serum and
   glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1, is also significantly elevated in PFC
   of patients with AD. Administration of a specific Sgk1 inhibitor reduces
   hyperphosphorylated tau protein, restores PFC glutamatergic synaptic
   function, and ameliorates memory deficits in AD mice. These results have
   found a novel epigenetic mechanism and a potential therapeutic strategy
   for AD and related neurodegenerative disorders.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{187}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Counter-rotating electrochemical machining (CRECM) holds the unique
   advantages to machine thin-walled revolving parts, especially for
   thin-walled engine cases. The electric field intensity distribution on
   the revolving anode surface is non-uniform, which is difficult to
   calculate accurately. In this work, a novel equivalent model for
   analytic solution of the electric field in CRECM is proposed based on
   complex variable function, and anode material dissolution model is
   established for CRECM. The variations of the material removal rate (MRR)
   and interelectrode gap (IEG) at different machining parameters have been
   fully investigated. The results indicate the MRR can reach a relative
   equilibrium state after a transition stage. The relative equilibrium MRR
   is higher than the feed rate, leading to a linear increase in the IEG.
   Moreover, machining parameters are optimized numerically to shorten the
   time reaching the relative equilibrium state. Experiments are conducted
   to verify the theoretical results. The experimental results fit well
   with the theoretical values. It means that the proposed model is
   effective for the prediction of the material dissolution process in
   CRECM.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this study is to propose and design a novel
   modification process of a combined cooling, heating, and power
   production setup using parabolic trough solar collectors, contributing a
   higher performance. The base setup consists of a solar subsystem, an
   organic Rankine cycle for electricity generation, a heat exchanger and a
   single-effect absorption chiller that produce heating and cooling
   utilizing the organic Rankine cycle waste heat. The base setup is
   modified by adding two regenerative organic Rankine cycles, three
   heating process heat exchangers, and a double-effect absorption chiller.
   Both systems are studied and compared in three different modes,
   embracing solar mode (low radiation), solar and storage mode (high
   radiation), and storage mode (no radiation). Compared to the base setup,
   for the modified system, electricity production improves by 10.4\%,
   18.4\% and 3.0\% in the aforementioned operational modes, respectively.
   Also, for these modes, the electrical efficiency of the modified system
   is found to be 1.4 percent-point, 0.9 percent-point, and 0.3
   percent-point higher than those of the base one, correspondingly.
   Eventually, a multi-objective optimization is conducted to optimize the
   modified system using a genetic algorithm.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Excessive vibration of rotor-blade systems has been a main reason for
   the failure of rotating machinery. Therefore, methods capable of
   simultaneously suppressing vibrations rotor and blade are urgently
   needed. Considering this, a nonlinear energy sink (NES) with piecewise
   linear stiffness is used to satisfy the requirements. Firstly, the
   structure and working mechanism of the NES are introduced. And then, the
   dynamic model of rotor-blade-NES system is established by Lagrangian
   method The vibration suppression ability of the NES is studied under
   transient and steady state excitations. Dynamic behavior of the
   rotor-blade system with a NES is also investigated through global
   bifurcation analyses in this work. Finally, a simple test of NES's
   vibration suppression ability on rotor-blade system is completed. The
   results show that, under given parameters, the vibration suppression
   performances of the NES on both rotor and blade are superior both in
   steady state and transient state. In numerical simulation, a vibration
   suppression rate of 93\% on the rotor is achieved and in test a rate of
   88\% is achieved.}},

   Heh1 is regulated by Hub1-mediated alternative splicing}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{133}},

Abstract = {{Misassembled nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are removed by sealing off
   the surrounding nuclear envelope (NE), which is conducted by the
   endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery.
   Recruitment of ESCRT proteins to the NE is mediated by the interaction
   between the ESCRT member Chm7 and the inner nuclear membrane protein
   Heh1, which belongs to the conserved LEM family. Increased ESCRT
   recruitment results in excessive membrane scission at damage sites but
   its regulation remains poorly understood. Here, we show that
   Hub1-mediated alternative splicing of HEH1 pre-mRNA, resulting in
   production of its shorter form Heh1-S, is critical for the integrity of
   the NE in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. ESCRT-III mutants lacking Hub1 or
   Heh1-S display severe growth defects and accumulate improperly assembled
   NPCs. This depends on the interaction of Chm7 with the conserved MSC
   domain, which is only present in the longer variant Heh1-L. Heh1
   variants assemble into heterodimers, and we demonstrate that a unique
   splice segment in Heh1-S suppresses growth defects associated with the
   uncontrolled interaction between Heh1-L and Chm7. Together, our findings
   reveal that Hub1-mediated splicing generates Heh1-S to regulate ESCRT
   recruitment to the NE.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The emotional impact of a diagnosis of breast cancer in
   women and listening to their affective needs is not widely reported in
   the literature. Recent policies globally emphasize the importance of
   incorporating patients' views in treatment. The aim of the study was to
   provide insights for health care professionals and make recommendations
   based on patients' experiences. Breast cancer survivorship is
   increasing, but the long-term support needs of such women are less
   understood. Method: This exploratory study asked 20 white women from 2
   urban centers in the UK about their experience of diagnosis and
   treatment for breast cancer. It used an adaptation of the photovoice
   methodology to examine a health issue and identify issues of importance
   and relevance to patients. It recognizes their expertise in their
   situation. Results: The themes identified were: Fear/Shock; Waiting;
   Lack of Control; Communication/Practicalities; Body image changes;
   Specialist versus nonspecialist Centers/Staff; and Ongoing Support.
   Discussion: The women provided images, with a written summary of their
   meaning, and discussed them in groups. They identified good practice and
   suggestions for how to improve the experience of diagnosis and treatment
   of breast cancer. Conclusion: The photovoice methodology provides a
   low-cost, easy to implement a way for patients to provide insight into
   their experience and contribute their knowledge to improve clinical
   practice. Visual images and patients' words allow clinicians to have
   greater insight into the environment and priorities of patients which
   could have implications for their response to treatment and long-term
   care.}},

Journal = {{PARASITOLOGY INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{79}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Thrushes (Turdus spp.) are migratory passerine birds found in northern
   Europe during the summer months and in southern Europe and north of
   Africa during the winter. They constitute an important small game bird
   group very appreciated by Spanish hunters. Between October 2013 and
   February 2014, 90 adult song thrushes were collected for their exam.
   After necropsies, three species of helminths were macroscopically
   recovered from 15 birds (16.7\%): Morishitium sp. (16.7\%),
   Splendidofilaria mavis (6.7\%) and Dilepis undula (7.8\%). One of them
   showed an adult cestode in the lung. Moreover, 12 of the positive
   thrushes (80\%) harboured microfilaria in pulmonary blood vessels and
   three of them (20\%) were infected by Sarcocystis sp. on skeletal
   musculature. All parasitized birds showed lesions, ranging from mild to
   moderate airsacculitis, bronchitis and coelomitis associated to
   Morishitium sp. infection. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first
   description of Sarcocystis spp. in song thrushes from Spain. Our results
   reveal the need for further studies to evaluate the epidemiological role
   of song thrushes as spreaders of parasites during their annual
   migration.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{In Brazil's public university sector, there is a lack of information
   regarding the building inspection activity; besides, there is a
   normative gap in this area. This paper's objective was to develop and
   validate an inspection management method focused on the management of
   building maintenance in universities. Design science research was
   adopted to develop the artifact called the inspection method for
   maintenance management, which was evaluated in a university in Brazil.
   This method consists of scope, planning, inspection, verification,
   prioritization, and recommendation steps. It was found that the
   application of the inspection method in the case study provided a
   maintenance inspection guided by scope and prioritization. However, it
   is necessary to align design information, especially for new buildings,
   with the maintenance strategies to meet the required performance
   criteria. The inspection method for maintenance management could be
   experimented in other commercial buildings, as long as the design needs
   were adjusted.}},

   A propensity score analysis}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN LIFE COURSE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{46}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper explores how attitudes towards childbearing change after
   cohabitation and marriage. Entering in a union may affect attitudes
   towards childbearing, but at the same time individuals who are more
   oriented towards childbearing may be more determined to form unions. In
   order to disentangle the interplay between union formation and
   subsequent changes in attitudes towards childbearing we implement
   propensity score matching, which is applied to a panel data coming from
   a survey in Bulgaria to identify the effect of union formation on
   attitudes related to childbearing. This method controls for observable
   confounders which may affect both the probability of entering into a
   union and childbearing preferences, reducing selection bias. We find a
   positive and significant causal relationship of entering into union on
   attitudes towards parenthood among men, whereas the effect is weaker and
   often uncertain for women.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{418-426}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Unprovoked mouth gaping behavior is ubiquitous throughout 24 extant
   members of Crocodylia, yet information on gaping is limited. Proposed
   hypotheses for gaping include thermoregulation and the evaluation of
   potential environmental conditions. To determine temperature effects, we
   tracked head surface (T-sh), body surface (T-sb), and ambient (T-a)
   temperatures with insolation utilization and positions. To evaluate
   potential environmental stimuli, we tested behavioral effects (i.e.,
   open-eye frequency) and recorded conspecific presence, day and night
   events, and interaction with flies and fish. We included 24 extant
   species representatives, with detailed assessments of American
   Alligators (Alligator mississippiensis), Crocodylus siamensis,
   Crocodylus intermedius, Crocodylus rhombifer, and Crocodylus halli.
   Observations occurred during a range of T-a (3.89-32.22 degrees C) with
   mean T-sb consistently higher than both T-sb and T-a across all
   crocodilians. Differences in T(sh )and T-sb were most pronounced with
   head in the sun. However, no significant differences in T-sh and T-sb
   were detected for A. mississippiensis and Cr. siamensis. Conversely, Cr.
   halli, Cr. intermedius, and Cr. rhombifer demonstrated statistically
   higher T-ab. Gaping with open eyes was more common, yet modeling
   suggested a relationship with dosed eyes and temperature. Anecdotal
   observations indicated weather changes may elicit mouth gaping, and we
   report the second nocturnal mouth gaping observation (the first for
   three species). Overall, mixed results indicated unprovoked mouth gaping
   is a complex behavior, making it difficult to draw clear cause and
   effect relationships. `Future research may benefit from a focus on
   natural history and quantitative behavioral studies.}},

   for this ionic liquid to be of use in the biorefining industry. The use
   of ultrasonication to facilitate the reaction was also tested. Results
   showed that this ionic liquid, which combines the features of a
   hydrophobic solvent with an acidic catalyst was effective in hydrolysing
   lignocelluloses. Compared to the use of dilute sulphuric acid, the ionic
   liquid produced purer, more thermally stable cellulosic fibres. It was
   also shown to be as effective as the dilute sulphuric acid in
   pretreating lignocelluloses for enzymatic hydrolysis. Finally,
   ultrasonication was shown to be compatible with the ionic liquid and
   suggests an energy efficient method for pretreatment of lignocellulose.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Infants who excessively cry, are distressed and unsettled
   can have a marked impact on family life. One form of support is manual
   therapy and osteopathic care. There is, however, limited research and
   debate about the effectiveness of manual therapy and osteopathic care
   for these infants.
   Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of osteopathic light touch manual
   therapy care for excessively crying, unsettled and distressed infants.
   Method: We propose a two-arm pragmatic randomised controlled trial, 112
   infants will be randomised to either: (i) Specific osteopathic light
   touch manual therapy with best practice advice and support or, (ii)
   Non-specific light touch with best practice advice and support. Parents
   will be blinded to group allocation.
   Population: Healthy infants under 10 weeks old, reported by their
   parents as excessively crying, fussing, unsettled, distressed and
   difficult to console using the Rome IV criteria (>3 hours of crying per
   day, for 3 days or more, for 1 week or more). Infants with diagnosed
   health conditions for which they are receiving medical treatment or who
   are unsuitable for osteopathic care will be excluded from the study.
   Outcomes: The primary outcome is reduced infant mean crying time over 14
   days, collected via parent reported diaries. Secondary outcomes are: (i)
   Parental self-efficacy, (ii) Parent perceived global improvement, (iii)
   Satisfaction and experience with treatment, (iv) Adverse events, and (v)
   Direct cost.
   Discussion: The results from this study will provide information that
   osteopaths, other health care professionals and parents can use to
   inform their decisions about treatment choices.}},

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION: Not all patients with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer
   (HDGC) are found to carry germline pathogenic variants in the associated
   gene CDH1, which translates into a challenging clinical management and
   poor cancer prevention. Thus, several studies have searched for other
   candidate genes, among which stands PALB2. Our work explores the
   implication of this known cancer gene in HDGC.
   METHODS: We searched for germline PALB2 variants by Sanger sequencing in
   a series of 58 patients with HDGC who tested negative for CDH1
   alterations.
   RESULTS: No clearly pathogenic variants in PALB2 were found in these
   patients. Only 5 rare genetic variants were identified, 3 of which were
   classified as variants of uncertain significance.
   DISCUSSION: Despite the promising association between PALB2 and HDGC
   suggested by certain works in the literature, our findings do not
   support PALB2 as a high predisposition gene for HDGC. Larger studies are
   needed to define its role in this disease and therefore improve cancer
   prevention.}},

Abstract = {{In 2016, the Puruha Research Group of the National University of
   Chimborazo, advised by several indigenous communities in the area,
   visited Tzuztzuk Hill (also known as Churo de Lican), located in the
   parish of Lican (Riobamba, Ecuador). They observed an abundance of
   archaeological remains which prompted the team to submit a report to the
   National Institute of Cultural Heritage requesting the protection of the
   area. However, between the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020, a part
   of the site was affected by a nearby construction project. Upon
   realizing the potential for destruction of the site, the construction
   project was immediately stopped and the Municipal Decentralized
   Autonomous Government of Riobamba began work to protect Tzuztuk Hill. In
   this study, a heritage analysis of the site and its relationship with
   the rest of the archaeological sites documented in Riobamba by the
   aforementioned research group is made.}},

Volume = {{89}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The measurement of liver stiffness (LS) shows promise as a follow-up
   tool after alcohol withdrawal, but it has mainly been studied in the
   early phase or in patients with severe liver disease. A 6-month
   ancillary study of a specific psychiatric cohort of alcoholic patients
   without known liver disease followed after withdrawal was conducted
   (Clinical Trial NCT01491347). Clinical and biological data and LS values
   were collected every 2 months. A total of 129 patients were included in
   the study; 93 had an LS assessment within the first 7 days, and 37 had
   all four LS measurements. Only seven (7.5\%) patients had an initial LS
   > 12.1 kPa, the threshold used to define severe fibrosis. Abstinence was
   not associated with changes in LS at the various median-term follow-up
   periods. However, LS of abstinent subjects decreased significantly
   relative to that of non-abstinent subjects between M0 and M2. CAPT
   values were not associated with abstinence.
   The systematic median-term follow-up of withdrawn patients does not
   appear to be contributory. However, LS could help to detect relapse in
   the first 2 months after withdrawal for subjects treated in a
   psychiatric hospital for dependence. It thus could serve as a motivation
   tool. Prospective studies with various and higher baseline LS values are
   warranted for simultaneous longitudinal assessment, including for very
   short- and long-term LS after withdrawal. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Introduction: We hypothesized that the recent COVID-19 pandemic may lead
   to a delay in renal colic patients presenting to the Emergency
   Department due to the fear of getting infected. This delay may lead to a
   more severe clinical condition at presentation with possible
   complications for the patients.
   Material and methods: Retrospective review of data collected from three
   institutions from Spain and Italy. Patients who presented to Emergency
   Department with unilateral or bilateral renal colic caused by imaging
   confirmed urolithiasis during the 45 days before and after each national
   lockdown were included. Data collected included patients' demographics,
   biochemical urine and blood tests, radiological tests, signs, symptoms
   and the therapeutic management. Analysis was performed between two
   groups, Group A: patients presenting prior to the national lockdown
   date; and Group B: patients presenting after the national lockdown date.
   Results: A total of 397 patients presented to Emergency Department with
   radiology confirmed urolithiasis and were included in the study. The
   number of patients presenting to Emergency Department with
   renal/ureteric colic was 285 (71.8\%) patients in Group A and 112
   (28.2\%) patients in Group B (p < 0.001). The number of patients
   reporting a delay in presentation was 135 (47.4\%) in Group A and 63
   (56.3\%) in Group B (p=0.11). At presentation, there were no statistical
   differences between Group A and Group B regarding the serum creatinine
   level, C reactive protein, white blood cell count, fever, oliguria,
   flank pain and hydronephrosis. In addition, no significant differences
   were observed with the length of stay, Urology department admission
   requirement and type of therapy.
   Conclusion: Data from our study showed a significant reduction in
   presentations to Emergency Department for renal colic after the lockdown
   in Spain and Italy. However, we did not find any significant difference
   with the length of stay, Urology department admission requirement and
   type of therapy. (C) 2020 AEU. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All

Abstract = {{Family history (FH) of a first-degree relative with colorectal cancer
   (CRC) is associated with two to fourfold increased risk, yet screening
   uptake is suboptimal despite proven mortality reduction. We developed a
   FH-based CRC Risk Triage/Management tool for family physicians (FPs),
   and educational booklet for patients with CRC FH. This report describes
   physician referral and patient screening behavior 5 and 10 years
   post-educational intervention, and factors associated with screening.
   Longitudinal cohort study. FPs/patients in Ontario and Newfoundland,
   Canada were sent questionnaires at baseline (2005), 5 and 10 years
   (2015) following tool/booklet receipt. FPs were asked about CRC
   screening, patients about FH, screening type and timing. ``Correct{''}
   screening was concordance with tool recommendations.
   Results reported for 29/121 (24\%) FPs and 98/297 (33\%) patients who
   completed all 3 questionnaires. Over 10 years 2/3 patients received the
   correct CRC screening test at appropriate timing (baseline 75\%, 5-year
   62\%, 10-year 65\%). About half reported their FP recommended CRC
   screening (5-year 51\%, 10-year 63\%). Fewer than half the patients
   correctly assessed their CRC risk (44\%, 40\%, 41\%). Patients were less
   likely to have correct screening timing if female (RR 0.78; 95\% CI
   0.61, 0.99; p = 0.045). Patients were less likely to have both correct
   test and timing if moderate/high CRC risk (RR 0.66; 95\% CI 0.47, 0.93;
   p = 0.017) and more likely if their physician recommended screening
   (RR1.69; 95\% CI 1.15, 2.49; p = 0.007).
   Physician discussion of CRC risk and screening can positively impact
   patient screening behavior. Efforts are particularly needed for women
   and patients at moderate/high CRC risk.}},

Title = {{Decidetexto: Mobile cessation support for Latino smokers. Study protocol

Journal = {{CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{99}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Latinos, the largest minority group in the U.S.,
   experience tobacco-related disparities, including limited access to
   cessation resources. Evidence supports the efficacy of mobile
   interventions for smoking cessation, which may be greater among Latinos,
   the highest users of text messaging.
   Objectives: To describe the methodology of a randomized clinical trial
   to evaluate the impact of Decidetexto, a culturally appropriate mobile
   smoking cessation intervention versus standard care on smoking
   abstinence (cotinine-verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence) at
   Month 6 among Latino smokers.
   Methods: Latino smokers (N = 618) will be randomized to one of two
   conditions: 1) Decidetexto or 2) standard of care. Decidetexto is a
   mobile smoking cessation intervention (available in English and Spanish)
   that incorporates three integrated components: 1) a tablet-based
   software that collects smoking-related information to develop an
   individualized quit plan, 2) a 24-week text messaging counseling program
   with interactive capabilities, and 3) pharmacotherapy support.
   Decidetexto follows the Social Cognitive Theory as theoretical
   framework. Standard of care consists of printed smoking cessation
   materials along with referral to telephone quitline. Participants in
   both groups are given access to free pharmacotherapy (nicotine patches
   or gum) by calling study phone number. Promotores de Salud will rely on
   community-based approaches and clinical settings to recruit smokers into
   the study. All participants will complete follow-up assessments at Week
   12 and Month 6.
   Discussion: If successful, Decidetexto will be ready to be implemented
   in different community- and clinic-based settings to reduce
   tobacco-related disparities.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effect of a maximum admissible
   value of the sail cone angle on the transfer performance of a solar
   sail-based spacecraft in an interplanetary mission scenario. The
   proposed approach models the possible constraint on the maximum Sun
   angle of the solar panels, when thin film solar cells are attached to
   the flat solar sail exposed area. In particular, transfers towards Mars
   and Venus are investigated in a simplified circle-to-circle,
   two-dimensional mission scenario. This study is carried out by analyzing
   the transfer problem in a systematic way, by considering both the sail
   characteristic acceleration and the Sun angle of the solar panels as the
   independent parameters that define the mission performance in terms of
   flight time.}},

   case report}},
Journal = {{PHOTODIAGNOSIS AND PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{32}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aim: To test a chemical-mechanical method and antimicrobial photodynamic
   therapy (a-PDT) in combination to manage a deep dental carious lesion in
   a permanent molar pediatric patient.
   Background: Due to specific characteristics of early-erupted teeth, as
   first permanent lower molars, techniques that provide less invasive
   tissue removal aiming keep healthy tooth parts, such as pulp tissue, are
   desired. Furthermore, especially to children, provide comfort, less
   noise and vibration are important issues that should be considered on
   the management of deep caries.
   Case description: The following case report presents an association of
   Papacarie Duo (R) (PD) and a-PDT used in a 9-year-old patient with a
   deep dental caries in the mandibular right first molar. After PD
   application, the carious tissue was carefully removed with the cavity
   stained for 1 min with rose bengal solution, irradiated with a high
   intensity LED constituting the a-PDT technique, and definitively
   restored with composite resin. At 6 months of follow-up, no signs of
   caries were verified, showing success to applied techniques. A
   microbiological evaluation attested the antimicrobial effects of the
   alternative procedures.
   Conclusion: Although it reached optimal clinical and bacterial reduction
   outcomes, the approach demonstrated an excessive length of time taken
   for the management of carious lesion.
   Clinical significance: The use of new technologies should be encouraged,
   especially when treating deep caries aiming for a less invasive
   approach.}},

Title = {{Exact and heuristic approaches for the automated design of medical
   trainees rotation schedules}},
Journal = {{OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{97}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This article addresses the problem of designing rotation schedules for
   the training of medical students in a healthcare institution in
   Colombia. Rotations are carried out along the course of a six months
   time period during which students rotate through different services both
   during one or multiple fortnightly periods. The hospital receives
   trainees from different universities that present heterogeneous
   requirements, and must accomplish different rotations constraints even
   in those cases when they come from the same university. Two different
   approaches are proposed to tackle the problem. First, a mathematical
   programming model is considered. Secondly, a metaheuristic approach
   based on Variable Neighborhood Search is adapted to solve the problem in
   an efficient manner. In both cases the objective function is proposed to
   be either a linear or a quadratic function that seeks a stable
   allocation of personnel to the services all along the considered time
   horizon. The proposed techniques are implemented as a part of a basic
   spreadsheet that helps personnel in charge generate, validate and fix
   the proposed plans as needed. The effectiveness of the methodology is
   tested through ex-post analysis, comparing it against schedules
   generated by the personnel in charge at the hospital, and over simulated
   data. The results indicate that the applied metaheuristic is competitive
   against specialized optimization software and facilitates the work of
   optimization for the health professionals in charge, reducing the
   planning tasks from several days to minutes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{LITHOS}},

Abstract = {{Basaltic rocks from the Afar Depression and Main Ethiopian Rift at the
   northern end of the East African Rift System with He-3/He-4 from 6 to 17
   times the atmospheric value (He-3/(4)HeAir or RA) define two
   geographically and, to a lesser extent, geochemically distinct groups.
   These groups are inconsistent with the commonly held view that there is
   a distinct Afar mantle plume at the northern end of the rift system, and
   that the plume influence systematically decreases away from its center
   in Lake Abhe. The high (>9 R-A) He-3/He-4 Afar and Ethiopian rift
   basaltic suites possess a common, high 3He/4He component. The ca. 30 Ma
   very high titanium transitional basalts and picrites from the
   Ethiopian-Yemeni plateau with the highest He-3/He-4 (ca. 20 R-A) closely
   represent the common component. Combined with their OIB-like
   compositional features, the high He-3/He-4 basalts indicate a
   metasomatized or anomalous upper mantle sensu lato and African
   Superplume source. Similar to the mantle source of ocean island basalts,
   the superplume is heterogeneous as it consists of various enriched
   endcomponents with low He-3/He-4 (<= 8 RA) and the common, depleted
   `focus zone' component with high He-3/He-4 (>9 RA). Northern rift magmas
   are mainly pseudo-binary mixtures between the anomalous upper mantle and
   currently upwelling plumes from the superplume. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{125}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1064-1069}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: High-volume (1.5 ml kg(-1)) caudal block in infants results
   in major reductions of cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) and cerebral
   oxygenation, caused by rostral CSF movement which increases intracranial
   pressure. The primary aim of this study was to determine the
   relationship between injected volume and CBFV changes. We hypothesised
   that this volume-blood flow relationship would have a similar albeit
   inverted shape to the well-known intracranial pressure volume-pressure
   curve.
   Methods: Fifteen subjects, age 0-6 months, mean (range) weight 4.9
   (2.1-6.4) kg, were studied. A 1.5 ml kg(-1) caudal injection of 0.2\%
   ropivacaine was administered in three phases separated by two pauses.
   Subjects were randomised into five groups, in whom the pauses were
   implemented at different pre-set proportions of the total injected
   volume. Middle cerebral artery Doppler ultrasonography was used for CBFV
   measurements (V-max, peak CBF velocity; V-min, lowest CBF velocity;
   velocity time index). Mean flow velocity, pulsatility index, and
   resistivity index were calculated, and haemodynamic parameters were
   recorded.
   Results: CBFV parameters decreased in all patients. The most affected
   parameter, Vmin, was reduced by similar to 50\% (range 15-68\%) compared
   with baseline. There was a nonlinear relationship between the volume of
   the first phase injection and the CBFV measurement during the first
   pause. Across all time points, there was a linear relationship between
   volume administered and CBFV. Systemic haemodynamic parameters remained
   stable throughout the study.
   Conclusions: Injection pauses appear to attenuate adverse CBFV increases
   during administration of a high-volume caudal block.}},

Abstract = {{The Nck-associated protein 1-like (NCKAP1L) gene, alternatively called
   hematopoietic protein 1 (HEM-1), encodes a hematopoietic
   lineage-specific regulator of the actin cytoskeleton. Nckap1l-deficient
   mice have anomalies in lymphocyte development, phagocytosis, and
   neutrophil migration. Here we report, for the first time, NCKAP1L
   deficiency cases in humans. In two unrelated patients of Middle Eastern
   origin, recessive mutations in NCKAP1L abolishing protein expression led
   to immunodeficiency, lymphoproliferation, and hyperinflammation with
   features of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Immunophenotyping showed
   an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio with a major shift of both CD4(+) and CD8(+)
   cells toward memory compartments, in line with combined
   RNA-seq/proteomics analyses revealing a T cell exhaustion signature.
   Consistent with the core function of NCKAP1L in the reorganization of
   the actin cytoskeleton, patients' T cells displayed impaired early
   activation, immune synapse morphology, and leading edge formation.
   Moreover, knockdown of nckap1l in zebrafish led to defects in neutrophil
   migration. Hence, NCKAP1L mutations lead to broad immune dysregulation
   in humans, which could be classified within actinopathies.}},

Abstract = {{Background Optimal pulmonary vein (PV) occlusion, usually verified with
   selective contrast injection, is mandatory to obtain an effective PV
   isolation during cryoballoon (CB) ablation.
   Aim of the study The purpose of this study was to verify the feasibility
   and the accuracy of a new dielectric sensing system in assessing PV
   occlusion during CB ablation in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).
   Methods We enrolled 28 consecutive patients with paroxysmal or
   persistent AF. After transseptal access, a detailed image reconstruction
   of left atrium and PVs was achieved with an octapolar or decapolar
   mapping catheter (Achieve catheter, Medtronic Inc.) and KODEX-EPD system
   (EPD Solutions, a Philips company). The degree of PV occlusion with the
   inflated Arctic Front Advance Cryoballoon (Medtronic Inc.) was verified
   using the new ``occlusion tool{''} software module (EPD Solutions, a
   Philips company) and compared to an angiogram obtained with contrast
   medium injection in each PV.
   Results A total of 105 PV CB occlusion were tested. The new occlusion
   tool software module showed a 91\% sensitivity and 76\% specificity in
   assessing a complete PV occlusion verified with contrast medium
   injection. The positive predictive value was 80\%, and the negative
   predictive value was 88.6\%. Mean procedure time was 81 +/- 17 minutes.
   Mean fluoroscopy time was 6 +/- 2 minutes. No 30-day complications were
   observed.
   Conclusion The new dielectric imaging system was able to assess the
   degree of PV occlusion during a CB ablation with good sensitivity and
   specificity.}},

Abstract = {{In common with other OECD countries, there is a gender gap in
   educational achievement in England favouring girls. This carries through
   to tertiary education. On the other hand, boys are far more likely to

   underachievement of boys overall, but over-representation in STEM,
   presents significant challenges for policy. This paper documents changes
   in the gender gap over the last 20 years in England and discusses
   findings in the light of international evidence. It concludes that
   education policies, in academic and in vocational spheres, can be
   designed to reduce gender inequalities that exist in both.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPLEX NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Many algorithms have been proposed in the last 10 years for the
   discovery of dynamic communities. However, these methods are seldom
   compared between themselves. In this article, we propose a generator of
   dynamic graphs with planted evolving community structure, as a benchmark
   to compare and evaluate such algorithms. Unlike previously proposed
   benchmarks, it is able to specify any desired evolving community
   structure through a descriptive language, and then to generate the
   corresponding progressively evolving network. We empirically evaluate
   six existing algorithms for dynamic community detection in terms of
   instantaneous and longitudinal similarity with the planted ground truth,
   smoothness of dynamic partitions and scalability. We notably observe
   different types of weaknesses depending on their approach to ensure
   smoothness, namely Glitches, Oversimplification and Identity loss.
   Although no method arises as a clear winner, we observe clear
   differences between methods, and we identified the fastest, those
   yielding the most smoothed or the most accurate solutions at each step.}},

   of two South America genera (Barnadesioideae, Asteraceae)}},
Journal = {{PHYTOCHEMISTRY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{40}},

Abstract = {{Dasyphyllum Kunth is the most diverse genus of the South American
   subfamily Barnadesioideae (Asteraceae), comprising 31 species most of
   which are distributed along the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, Cerrado and
   Caatinga domains. The genus has traditionally been divided into two
   subgenera, namely Archidasyphyllum and Dasyphyllum. However, recent
   phylogenetic, morphological, and biogeographical evidence led to a new
   circumscription of Dasyphyllum by elevating the subgenus
   Archidasyphyllum to the generic rank. The present work aimed to explore
   a chemophenetic characterization of Dasyphyllum for further supporting
   its new circumscription by a metabolomic approach using liquid
   chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry and
   multivariate statistical analyses. A total of 44 mass features were
   identified based on their UV spectra, high resolution MS data and MS2
   fragmentation patterns as well as comparisons with standard compounds.
   Dasyphyllum samples exhibited a diversity of phenylpropanoids:
   3-O-caffeoylquinic acid, 4-O-caffeoylquinic acid, 5-O-caffeoylquinic
   acid, 5-O-feruloylquinic acid, 5-O-caffeoylshikimic acid,
   1,3-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 3,4-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid,
   3,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid and 4,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid. On the
   other hand, Archidasyphyllum displayed the 2-O-caffeoyltartaric acid,
   2,3-O-dicaffeoyltartaric acid and caffeoyl-feruloyltartaric acid as
   distinctive constituents. The occurrence of tartaric acid ester
   derivatives in Archidasyphyllum and its absence in Dasyphyllum may
   constitute a diagnostic chemical characteristic for further supporting
   the segregation of Archidasyphyllum from Dasyphyllum. The occurrence of
   phenylpropanoids in Archidasyphyllum and Dasyphyllum is here reported
   for the first time.}},

Abstract = {{Basic knowledge of the deformation behavior of fabricated components is
   of paramount importance in materials processing. Compared to other
   process methods, the mechanics of metal imprinting, especially at small
   scales, have received relatively less research attention. However,
   recent demands for tuning the properties of metal surfaces by forming
   undulated micropatterns have spurred interest in gaining additional
   insight into metal imprinting. The aim of this study, therefore, was to
   develop effective modeling capabilities that establish a ground base for
   exploring the mechanics of this process. Accordingly, a finite element
   analysis was performed to analyze the deformation of an elastic-plastic
   material exhibiting isotropic strain hardening imprinted by a rigid
   template with a nominally flat or patterned surface. Simulation results
   were obtained in the form of dimensionless quantities to elucidate the
   effects of pattern geometry, depth of imprinting, and friction on the
   evolution of plasticity in the deformed material and its plastic flow
   behavior into the pattern cavities. In addition to insight into the
   mechanics of the process, this study provides a computational
   methodology for adjusting key design and process parameters so as to
   enhance the efficiency of metal imprinting. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

   treatment: a case report}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY-ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Choriocarcinoma (CCA) is a malignant pregnancy-related
   tumor that originates from cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast cells
   without villi. CCA is the most metastatic form among gestational
   trophoblastic neoplasia and the diagnosis is often in advanted stage.
   Patient concerns: In this report, we present a rare case of CCA with
   lung metastasis after term pregnancy in a 41-year-old woman at 45 days
   after the birth of a healthy baby and discuss management of residual
   metastasis after completing treatment.
   Diagnosis: The diagnosis of CCA can be based on the following criteria:
   a human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) plateau for at least 4 values over
   3 weeks, an hCG increase of 10\% or greater for at least 3 values over 2
   weeks, hCG persistence for 6 months or more after molar pregnancy
   evacuation, histopathologic diagnosis of choriocarcinoma and presence of
   metastatic disease.
   Intervention and outcomes: High risk patients must be treated with
   multiagent chemotherapy (EMA-CO schedule). The complete remission rates
   ranges from 69\% to 86\%.
   Conclusion: Residual lesions after chemotherapy are often the result of
   necrosis or fibrosis. In our clinical practice will avoid the risks
   deriving from excessive anticancer treatment in these patients, while
   favoring a strict follow-up strategy to monitor disease behavior in
   time.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, electrically active defects of pristine and 5.5 MeV
   electron irradiated p-type silicon-germanium (Si1-xGex)-based diodes
   were examined by combining regular capacitance deep-level transient
   spectroscopy (C-DLTS) and Laplace DLTS (L-DLTS) techniques. The p-type
   SiGe alloys with slightly different Ge contents were examined. It was
   deduced from C-DLTS and L-DLTS spectra that the carbon/oxygen-associated
   complexes prevailed in the pristine Si0.949Ge0.051 alloys. Irradiation
   with 5.5 MeV electrons led to a considerable change in the DLT spectrum
   containing up to seven spectral peaks due to the introduction of
   radiation defects. These defects were identified using activation energy
   values reported in the literature. The double interstitial and oxygen
   complexes and the vacancy, di-vacancy and tri-vacancy ascribed traps
   were revealed in the irradiated samples. The interstitial carbon and the
   metastable as well as stable forms of carbon-oxygen (CiOi{*} and CiOi)
   complexes were also identified for the electron-irradiated SiGe alloys.
   It was found that the unstable form of the carbon-oxygen complex became
   a stable complex in the irradiated and the subsequently annealed (at 125
   degrees C) SiGe samples. The activation energy shifts in the
   radiation-induced deep traps to lower values were defined when
   increasing Ge content in the SiGe alloy.}},

Abstract = {{This study utilises an exceptionally rich English administrative
   dataset, to estimate employment impacts from training voluntarily
   initiated by unemployed individuals. A Coarsened Exact Matching approach
   is adopted, in a dynamic evaluation framework, to estimate impacts up to
   5 years from training start. We identify economically and statistically
   significant impacts, estimated separately for (i) all training starters,
   (ii) the partially, and (iii) fully treated. Investigation of possible
   endogenous selection into partial/full treatment, using distance to
   training provider as an instrumental variable, suggests inclusion of
   extensive employment and learning histories in a matching framework,
   justifies invocation of the conditional independence assumption for
   comparisons of full/partial treatment. The partially treated secure a
   return that is, on average, 2 percentage points lower than full

   conclusions on the efficacy of training; but using the partially treated
   to estimate counterfactual outcomes risks understating returns.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the direct and indirect
   linear morphometric measurements for the evaluation of alveolar bone
   loss after experimentally induced periodontitis in rats.
   Materials and Methods: Right mandibles of 30 Sprague Dawley rats were
   collected from a previous study which induced periodontitis using
   ligature model. In direct measurement group, the distance between
   cementoenamel junction and alveolar bone crest was evaluated by digital
   caliper and periodontal probe with a dental loop, whereas indirect group
   measurement was performed by an image analysis program on digital
   photographs.
   Results: The difference between groups was determined using Mann-Whitney
   U test. Average alveolar bone loss was 1.08 +/- 0.22 mm in direct
   measurement group and 1.19 +/- 0.33 mm inindirect measurement group. The
   variation between direct and in direct groups was not statistically
   significant (p>0.05).
   Conclusion: Based on the present result, it can be concluded that,
   direct morphometric analysis might be an essential alternative to
   indirect morphometric evaluations to measure alveolar bone loss after
   experimentally induced periodontitis in rats.}},

Abstract = {{A wide range of face appearance variations can be modeled by using
   set-based recognition approaches effectively, but computational
   complexity of current methods is highly dependent on the set and class
   sizes. This paper introduces new video-based classification methods
   designed for reducing the required disk space of data samples and speed
   up the testing process in large-scale face recognition systems. In the
   proposed method, image sets collected from videos are approximated with
   kernelized convex hulls and it was shown that it is sufficient to use
   only the samples that participate in shaping the image set boundaries in
   this setting. The kernelized support vector data description (SVDD) is
   used to extract those important samples that form the image set
   boundaries. Moreover, we show that these kernelized hypersphere models
   can also be used to approximate image sets for classification purposes.
   Then, we propose a binary hierarchical decision tree approach to improve
   the speed of the classification system even more. At last, we introduce
   a new video database that includes 285 people with 8 videos of each
   person, since the most popular video data sets used for set-based
   recognition methods include either a few people, or small number of
   videos per person. The experimental results on varying sized databases
   show that the proposed methods greatly improve the testing times of the
   classification system (we obtained speed-ups to a factor of 20) without
   a significant drop in accuracies.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{The role of coronary arteries is to supply sufficient blood to
   myocardium. Obstruction of coronary arteries limits blood supply and
   causes myocardial ischemia or acute myocardial infarction, a major cause
   of human death. Hence, the quantification of the regional amount of
   heart muscle subtended by obstructed coronary arteries is of critical
   value in clinical medicine. However, conventional methods are inaccurate
   and frequently disagree with clinical practice. This study proposes a
   novel medial-axis-based correspondence (Medial-ABC) algorithm to find
   the correspondence between myocardium and coronary artery in order to
   segment regional myocardium at risk subtended by any potentially
   obstructed coronary artery. Given the triangular mesh models of coronary
   artery and myocardium, the proposed algorithm (i) computes the medial
   axis of coronary artery, (ii) finds the correspondence using the medial
   axis of coronary artery, and (iii) segments the coronary artery and
   myocardium. The proposed algorithm provides a robust mathematical
   linkage between myocardium at risk and supplying coronary arteries so
   that ischemic myocardial regions can be accurately identified. Hence,
   both the extent and severity of myocardial ischemia can be quantified
   effectively, efficiently, and accurately. Furthermore, the constructed
   mesh model of segmented coronary artery and myocardium can be
   post-processed for applications such as building optimization models of
   cardiac systems. The CardiacVis program, which implements the Medial-ABC
   algorithm, is freely available at Voronoi Diagram Research Center
   (http.//voronoi.hanyang.ac.kr/software/cardiacvis) and will be an
   invaluable tool for quantitative patient-specific risk stratification in
   clinical practice.}},

Abstract = {{A bis-ethene chromium(I) species, which is the postulated key
   intermediate in the widely accepted metallacyclic mechanism for ethene
   oligomerization, is experimentally observed. This catalytic
   transformation is an important commercial route to linear alpha-olefins
   (primarily, 1-hexene and 1-octene), which act as comonomers for the
   production of polyethene. Here, electron paramagnetic resonance studies
   of a catalytic system based on {[}Cr(CO)(4)(PNP)] {[}AROC(CF3)(3))(4)]
   {[}PNP = Ph2PN(Pr-i)PPh2] activated with Et6Al2 provide the first
   unequivocal evidence for a chromium(I) bis-ethene complex. The
   concentration of this species is enhanced under ethene and isotope
   labeling studies that confirm its composition as containing
   {[}Cr(C2H4)(2)(CO)(2)(PNP)](+). These observations open a new route to
   mechanistic studies of selective ethene oligomerization.}},

Abstract = {{In the Florentine society of the Late Middle Ages, where the ideology of
   patrilineal lineage and the dotal regime largely dominated, the place of
   residence, filiation, inheritance rules, transmission of names, and
   possession of property delineated a family horizon that included mainly
   the male members among blood relatives and left little room for women
   who entered and left the house or for relatives acquired through
   marriage. However, we know the usefulness that Florentines recognised in
   the construction of matrimonial alliances - parentadi - and the extreme
   attention they paid to the choice of these parenti. But the affini -
   Florentines refer to in-laws as parenti - almost never cohabited with
   the family of the woman to whom they were related, they were not among
   her potential heirs, and the bonds that were forged during marriage
   could be undone very quickly, often leading to conflict and resentment,
   especially when the husband's death put an end to the couple and often
   left a young widow with her dowry to be recovered. In fact, the in-laws
   - the parenti - also occupy little space in Florentine family diaries
   except when the author described the different phases of the
   construction of the marriage alliance or its dissolution, rituals and
   conflicts. But they do not disappear completely and it may be
   interesting to try to discover evidence they have left behind.}},

Volume = {{67}},

Abstract = {{Inactivation of the von Hippel Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) is
   a hallmark of clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC), which is the most
   common form of kidney cancer in adults. In complex with Elongin B/C,
   pVHL functions as the substrate recognition subunit of a ubiquitin
   ligase, perhaps best known to target the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)
   transcription factor for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Beyond kidney
   cancer, the pseudo-hypoxic state caused due to chronic HIF activation in
   pVHL-deficient cells has become a biological model to study hypoxia's
   profound effects on tumor angiogenesis, metabolism, and epigenetics.
   However, a number of HIF-independent substrates of pVHL, which function
   in a broad range of biological pathways, have also been discovered.
   Independently, the development of high-throughput chemical and genetic
   screening strategies have enabled the identification of novel,
   HIF-independent, targetable dependencies in ccRCC. In this review we
   summarize the history of pVHL and HIF mediated oxygen sensing, discuss
   the current status of this field, and identify critical challenges that
   need to be overcome. The confluence of historical discovery, development
   of unbiased screening strategies, and the evolution of medicinal
   chemistry has allowed us to begin therapeutically targeting
   vulnerabilities that emerge due to pVHL loss in ccRCC. Ongoing
   mechanistic studies on the biological consequences of pVHL loss,
   therefore, are likely to become the cornerstones of modern therapeutics
   in renal cancer.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic flood control rule curves (DFCRCs) that balance the use of
   conservation space between flood control and conservation purposes are
   usually necessary for the operation of a multipurpose reservoir. This
   paper therefore proposes a procedure to apply the DFCRCs of an
   historically-based actual flood for reservoir operation versus different
   floods whose hydrograph shapes vary widely. The proposal uses
   related-size characteristics (e.g. net retention of the DFCRCs and peak
   discharge of associated outflows) in a stepwise manner from those of the
   smallest return period to those of the largest one. Illustrative
   applications of the procedure to the operation of the multipurpose Ubol
   Ratana Dam (The Nam Pong Basin, Thailand) have indicated that it enables
   the DFCRCs to ensure the reservoir's operation against various floods.
   Its operational results for the large and moderate floods in 1990 and
   1995 are comparable to those of historically based floods. In addition,
   impact assessment of climate change on the operational performance has
   shown that the system could not protect the areas upstream and
   downstream of the dam from the HadCM3A2 and HadCM3B2 floods at the 80th
   and 95th percentile levels during the future 2050s period.}},

Title = {{Culturally Significant Presence in Single-player Computer Games}},
Journal = {{ACM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING AND CULTURAL HERITAGE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Cultural presence is a term used to explain and evaluate cultural
   learning in virtual heritage projects but is less frequently used for
   video games. Given the increasing importance of video games to cultural
   heritage, this article investigates explanations of cultural presence
   that could be communicated by games, especially concerning UNESCO and
   ICOMOS definitions of cultural significance. The aim is to determine if
   cultural presence can be communicated via video games and across a range
   of game genres.
   Observations derived from game prototyping workshops for history and
   heritage aided the development of a teachable list of desirable game
   elements. To distinguish itself from the vagueness surrounding theories
   of cultural presence, a theory of culturally significant presence is
   proposed. Culturally significant presence requires three components:
   culturally significant artifacts and practices; an overarching framework
   of a singular, identifiable cultural viewpoint; and awareness by the
   participant of both the culturally significant and the overarching
   cultural framework and perspective (which gives sites, artifacts, and
   practices their cultural significance and relational value).
   As awareness of cultural presence requires time for reflection,
   single-player games were chosen that were not completely dependent on
   time-based challenges. Another criterion was cultural heritage content:
   They must simulate aspects of heritage and history, communicate a
   specific cultural framework, or explore and reconstruct a past culture.
   Four games were chosen that simulate a culture, explain archaeological
   methods, portray indigenous intangible heritage, or explain
   historical-based ecosystems of the past based on educational guidelines.
   The games are Assassin's Creed: Origins; Heaven's Vault; Never Alone;
   and a Ph.D. project: Saxon. Their genres could be described as
   first-person shooter/open world/virtual tour; dialogue-based puzzle
   game; 2D platform game; and turn-based strategy game.
   The aim is not to evaluate the entire range of interactive virtual
   environments and games, but to examine the applicability and relevance
   of this new theory and to ascertain whether the four games provided
   useful feedback on the concept and usefulness of culturally significant
   presence. A more clearly demarcated theory may not only help focus
   evaluation studies but also encourage game developers to modify or allow
   modification of commercial games for classroom teaching of digital
   heritage.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Physical inactivity in older adults is linked to increased risk of
   chronic diseases, disability and various poor health outcomes. As the
   aging population rises, the prevalence of diseases associated with aging
   also increases. Regular physical activity in older adults is important
   to improve overall health and promote healthy aging. This study aimed to
   determine the prevalence and factors associated with physical inactivity
   among older adults in Malaysia.
   Methods This study was based on 3969 Malaysian older adults aged >= 60
   years who completed the physical activity module in the National Health
   and Morbidity Survey 2018, a population-based cross-sectional survey.
   Physical activity was measured using the Global Physical Activity
   Questionnaire through a face-to-face interview. Participants were
   classified as physically active or inactive. Associations between
   physical inactivity, sociodemographic characteristics and a range of
   selected independent variables were examined using multivariable
   logistic regression.
   Results Overall, three out of 10 (29.8\%) Malaysian older adults were
   physically inactive. Results of multivariable analysis showed that older
   age group (>= 80 years), of Bumiputera Sarawak ethnicity,
   unemployed/retirees/homemakers, functional limitation, diabetes mellitus
   and dementia were significantly associated with a higher risk of
   physical inactivity. Women, with secondary education level and good

   Conclusions The present study reported the status of physical inactivity
   among older adults in Malaysia. There is the need to design effective
   public health programs and interventions to promote active living and
   healthy aging among Malaysian older adults, particularly in those

Abstract = {{Two widely investigated methane hydrate promoters, tetra-n-butyl
   ammonium bromide (TBAB) and cyclopentane (CP), for methane hydrate
   formation and dissociation were comparatively investigated in the
   quiescent reactor at 2.5 degrees C and 8 MPa. The results indicated that
   the increase in the mass fraction TBAB decreased the induction time.
   However, it did not significantly affect the methane uptake. In the
   presence of CP, the increase in the CP concentration resulted in an
   increase in the induction time due to the increasing thicknesses of the
   CP layer in the unstirred reactor. Moreover, the methane uptake was
   varied proportionally with the CP concentration. The addition of TBAB
   resulted in a higher methane uptake than that of CP, since the presence
   of TBAB provided the cavities in the hydrate structure to accommodate
   the methane gas during the hydrate formation better than that of CP. On
   the contrary, the presence of CP significantly increased the induction
   time. Although the methane recovery remained relatively the same
   regardless of TBAB and CP concentrations, the recovery was higher in the
   presence of TBAB.}},

Abstract = {{The chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is one of the most important pulses
   worldwide. The objective was to identify, compare and evaluate peptides
   from chickpea hydrolysates produced by two enzymatic treatments. The
   antidiabetic potential and bitterness of the peptides and induction of
   bitter receptors were identified in silico. Proteins were isolated from
   the Kabuli variety. Peptides were produced from the proteins using a
   simulated digestive system (pepsin/pancreatin, 1:50 Enzyme/Protein,
   E/P), and these peptides were compared with those produced via bromelain
   hydrolysis (1:50 E/P). The protein profiles, sequences and
   characteristics of the peptides were evaluated. The biochemical
   inhibition and molecular docking of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV),
   alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase were also studied. The molecular
   docking identified peptides from enzymatic hydrolysis as inhibitors of
   DPP-IV. The high hydrophobicity of the peptides indicated the potential
   for bitterness. There was no correlation between peptide length and
   DPP-IV binding. Peptides sequenced from the pepsin/pancreatin
   hydrolysates, PHPATSGGGL and YVDGSGTPLT, had greater affinity for the
   DPP-IV catalytic site than the peptides from the bromelain hydrolysates.
   These results are in agreement with their biochemical inhibition, when
   considering the inhibition of sitagliptin (54.3 mu g/mL) as a standard.
   The bitter receptors hTAS2R38, hTAS2R5, hTAS2R7 and hTAS2R14 were
   stimulated by most sequences, which could be beneficial in the treatment
   of type 2 diabetes. Chickpea hydrolysates could be utilized as
   functional ingredients to be included in the diet for the prevention of
   diabetes.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Data theft from the desktop system using devices capable of storing data
   is a serious problem that causes great harm to an individual or a
   company. It is essential to excogitate a way to reduce the problem. The
   triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), recently introduced as a
   light-weight, easy-to-design energy harvester, works on the coupling of
   electromagnetic induction and contact electrification. In this work, a
   TENG is used to incorporate a smart feature in the table which triggers
   an alarm if an intruder is using the desk. The TENG works in the
   single-electrode contact-separation mode and in the sliding mode. The
   Kapton backed by aluminum is used as active triboelectric layers while
   the material on apparels or hand skin acts as opposite triboelectric
   material. The device is systematically studied for its electrical
   performance using materials such as jeans, cotton, paper, etc. The
   device gives the highest output voltage and current of similar to 200 V
   and 2.2 mu A in case of paper. Finally, a smart table is demonstrated
   using the as fabricated TENG coupled with the Arduino board which
   triggers an alarm if a person is accessing the desk. This work can
   extend the application of the TENG for the development of smart
   furnitures. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To evaluate the medication adherence behaviour and knowledge
   of epilepsy patients before patient counselling and to monitor and
   evaluate the outcome of clnical pharmacist mediated patient counselling.
   Methodology: A prospective interventional study with one-year duration
   was conducted among 100 epileptic inpatients of the neurology department
   in a south Indian tertiary care hospital. Clinical pharmacy students
   mediated education was provided to the patients and bystanders, and its
   effect on medication adherence and patient beliefs was assessed through
   medication adherence scale (MMAS-4) and an internally validated beliefs
   about medication survey form.
   Results: Before the intervention, 40\% of patients showed high adherence
   to antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy followed by 27\% patients with a
   medium level of adherence and 33\% of patients exhibited a low level of
   adherence. After the intervention, 62\% of patients showed high
   adherence followed by 20\% of patients with medium adherence and the
   remaining 18\% exhibited a low level of adherence to AED therapy.
   Medication belief assessment after intervention also showed improving
   trends (P < 0.05). The study defined that the overall improvement in
   medication adherence and knowledge of patients was found to be
   statistically significant after the intervention.
   Conclusion: The study concluded that low adherence to the medications
   and lack of knowledge about the disease was the major reasons for the
   unsuccessful drug treatment which can be cleared up to a satisfying
   extent by the use of clinical pharmacist intervention.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Small vessel diameter is associated with higher risk of
   target lesion revascularization (TLR) after percutaneous coronary
   intervention (PCI). The COMBO sirolimus-eluting biodegradable-polymer
   stent has a proprietary anti-CD34 antibody layer to enhance homogeneous
   endothelialization, which may be advantageous in treating small vessels.
   Objective: We examined for differences in 1-year clinical outcomes after
   PCI by maximum implanted stent diameter from the COMBO collaboration.
   Methods: The COMBO collaboration (n = 3614) is a patient-level pooled
   dataset of patients undergoing PCI with COMBO stents in the MASCOT and
   REMEDEE multicenter registries. Stent diameter was available in 3590
   (99.3\%) patients. We compared patients receiving COMBO stents <3 mm
   versus >= 3mm. The primary endpoint was 1-year target lesion failure
   (TLF), composite of cardiac death, target vessel-myocardial infarction
   (TV-MI) or clinically driven TLR. Secondary outcomes included stent
   thrombosis (ST). Adjusted outcomes were assessed using Cox regression
   methods.
   Results: The study included 792 (22\%) patients with small stents <3 mm
   and 2798 (78\%) patients with large stents >= 3 mm. Small stent patients
   included more women with lower body mass index and higher prevalence of
   diabetes but similar prevalence of acute coronary syndrome. Risk of
   1-year TLF was similar in small and large stent groups (4.4\% vs. 3.8\%,
   HR 1.12, 95\% CI 0.74-1.72, p = 0.58). There were no differences in the
   rates of cardiac death (1.7\% vs. 1.5\%, p= 0.74), TV-MI (1.4\% vs.
   1.2\%, p= 0.58) or TLR (2.7\% vs. 2.1\%, p= 0.31). Definite or probable
   ST occurred in 1.3\% of the small stent and 0.7\% of the large stent PCI
   patients, p= 0.14, HR 2.13, 95\% CI 0.93-5.00, p= 0.07.
   Conclusions: One-year ischemic outcomes after COMBO PCI were similar
   irrespective of stent diameter in this allcomers international cohort.

Title = {{1-Year COMBO stent outcomes stratified by the PARIS bleeding prediction
   score: From the MASCOT registry}},
Journal = {{IJC HEART \& VASCULATURE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{31}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: The COMBO stent is a biodegradable-polymer sirolimus-eluting
   stent with endothelial progenitor cell capture technology for faster
   endothelialization.
   Objective: We analyzed COMBO stent outcomes in relation to bleeding risk
   using the PARIS bleeding score.
   Methods: MASCOT was an international registry of all-comers undergoing
   attempted COMBO stent implantation. We stratified patients as low
   bleeding-risk (LBR) for PARIS score <= 3 and intermediate-to-high (IHBR)
   for score > 3 based on baseline age, body mass index, anemia, current
   smoking, chronic kidney disease and need for triple therapy. Primary
   endpoint was 1-year target lesion failure (TLF), composite of cardiac
   death, myocardial infarction (MI) not clearly attributed to a non-target
   vessel or clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (TLR).
   Bleeding was adjudicated using the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium
   (BARC) definition. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) cessation was
   independently adjudicated.
   Results: The study included 56\% (n = 1270) LBR and 44\% (n = 1009) IHBR
   patients. Incidence of 1-year TLF was higher in IHBR patients (4.1\% vs.
   2.6\%, p = 0.047) driven by cardiac death (1.7\% vs. 0.7\%, p = 0.029)
   with similar rates of MI (1.8\% vs. 1.1\%, p = 0.17), TLR (1.5\% vs.
   1.6\%, p = 0.89) and definite/ probable stent thrombosis (1.2\% vs.
   0.6\%, p = 0.16). Incidence of 1-year major BARC 3 or 5 bleeding was
   significantly higher in IHBR patients (2.3\% vs. 0.9\%, p = 0.0094), as
   was the incidence of DAPT cessation (29.3\% vs. 22.8\%, p < 0.01),
   driven by physician-guided discontinuation.
   Conclusions: Patients with intermediate-to-high PARIS bleeding risk in
   the MASCOT registry experienced greater incidence of 1-year TLF, major
   bleeding and DAPT cessation than LBR patients, without significant
   differences in stent thrombosis. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this study is to compare small lymphatic
   vessel sealing using Ligasure (TM) (LS) and Hem-o-lok (R) (HML) clips in
   an ex vivo canine spermatic cord model.
   Materials and Methods: Canine testes with spermatic cord attached were
   harvested. By random distribution, the spermatic cord of each testis was
   either (i) sealed with LS, (ii) clipped with one HML clip, or (iii) had
   no intervention. The testis was then injected with a Patent Blue V dye
   solution. At 5 minutes and 12 hours after injection, the distal
   spermatic cord was inspected for macroscopically visible dye. One random
   spermatic cord from each of the LS and HML cohorts free of macroscopic
   evidence of dye was examined using the frozen section histology of the
   cross sections proximal and distal to the intervention site to detect
   the microscopic presence of dye.
   Results: During the study period, 18 canine testes were harvested. After
   randomization, five, six, and seven testes were included in the control,
   HML, and LS groups, respectively. In the control group, all 5 testes had
   leaked blue dye from the cut end of the spermatic cord at 5 minutes.
   Further, in the HML group, dye was macroscopically visible distal to the
   intervention site (intervention failure) in 2 out of 6 cases at 5
   minutes. In the LS group, 2 out of 7 testes had leaked blue dye at 5
   minutes. All testes that did not fail at 5 minutes also did not fail at
   12 hours in both LS and HML groups.
   Conclusion: LS is an effective alternative option to HML clips to seal
   small lymphatic vessels.}},

Abstract = {{R-doping effects on the magneto-mechanical properties, including Young's
   modulus (E) at magnetic field (H), that is Delta E effect, and
   magnetostriction (lambda), of Fe86.8Ga13R0.2 alloys (R = Tb and Dy) are
   studied. Delta E-s/E-0 of Fe87Ga13 alloy is 6\%, and it is significantly
   enhanced to 12\% by doping Dy, but reduced to 4.5\% for Tb-doped alloy.
   The trend of magnetostriction sensitivity (d lambda/dH) of
   Fe86.8Ga13R0.2 alloys with R is similar to that of Delta E-s/E-0 with R.
   Most importantly, strong Delta E effect due to high d lambda/dH for
   Fe-86.8Ga13Dy0.2 alloy favors magnetic applications. Large Delta E
   effect is considered to correlate to magnetic softening and lattice
   softening by doping Dy. For Tb-doped alloy, the increase of lambda(s)
   might be related to the decrease of Fe content in the matrix due to the
   appearance of minor Tb2Fe17 phase. However, the decrease of d lambda/dH
   might result from increased coercivity and decreased permeability
   related to the introduction of Tb2Fe17 phase and result in reduced Delta
   E effect. The findings of this work provide an effective pathway of
   enhancing the magneto-mechanical properties for Fe-rich Galfenol alloys.}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   The objective of this study is to determine the predictors for urinary
   retention after vesicovaginal fistula surgery. Methods
   This was a retrospective case-control study of women who underwent
   vesicovaginal fistula repair between January 2014 and December 2017 at
   the Fistula Care Centre in Lilongwe, Malawi. Cases were defined as
   patients with documented urinary retention, defined as a postvoid
   residual that is 50\% greater than the total void of at least 100 mL.
   The cases and controls were matched by the 3 components of the Goh
   classification system in a ratio of 1:5. Univariate analysis was used to
   detect differences between demographic, clinical characteristics, and
   operative techniques between cases and control. Logistic regression
   analysis was performed for estimation of odds ratios (ORs). Results
   There were no statistically significant differences between the 40 cases
   and 187 controls, when comparing age, gravidity, parity, body mass
   index, and length of postoperative catheterization. The median amount of
   postvoid residual noted at the time of diagnosis was 240 mL (range,
   55-927 mL). Odds for urinary retention was 3 times higher among those
   with vertical closure than patients with horizontal closure of the
   bladder (OR, 2.91; 95\% confidence interval, 1.35-6.20). Patients with
   prior fistula repairs were significantly less likely to develop urinary
   retention compared to those receiving surgery for the first time (OR,
   0.27; 95\% confidence interval, 0.10-0.67). Conclusions
   Vertical closure of the bladder and patients without a history of prior
   fistula repairs are predictors for developing urinary retention after
   fistula repair surgery.}},

Abstract = {{Global tomography models show a large low-velocity anomaly extending
   from the core-mantle boundary (CMB) beneath South Africa to the upper
   mantle in East Africa. Although it is believed that this anomaly is
   linked to mantle upwellings that control key surface features of the
   African continent, its origin and evolution are still debated. Here we
   assemble geochemical and seismological constraints along with
   information from new seismic analyses and geodynamic laboratory
   experiments to propose that presently there are at least two different
   plume heads beneath Afar and Kenya that originated at the CMB. A third
   plume between Kenya and Afar may have caused the Ethiopia-Yemen traps 30
   Ma, now merging with the Afar plume. We infer that the Afar plume is
   presently detached from the CMB probably because of an interaction with
   the subducted Tethyan slab and that it is likely a dying plume. This may
   imply that rifts along the Main Ethiopian Rift would fail by the loss of
   thermal sources, which consequently hampers continental breakup.}},

Abstract = {{Reading acquisition involves learning to associate visual symbols with
   spoken language. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that instruction on
   the relationship between spellings and sounds may be particularly
   important. However, it is unclear whether the effectiveness of this form
   of instruction depends on pre-existing oral language knowledge. To
   investigate this issue, we developed a series of computational models of
   reading incorporating orthographic, phonological and semantic processing
   to simulate both artificial and natural orthographic learning conditions
   in adults and children. We exposed the models to instruction focused on
   spelling-sound or spelling-meaning relationships, and tested the
   influence of the models' oral language proficiency on the effectiveness
   of these training regimes. Overall, the simulations indicated that oral
   language proficiency is a vital foundation for reading acquisition, and
   may modulate the effectiveness of reading instruction. These results
   provide a computational basis for the Simple View of Reading, and
   emphasise the importance of both oral language knowledge and
   spelling-sound instruction in the initial stages of learning to read.}},

Abstract = {{Background and aims: Patients with schizophrenia are known to use
   potentially addictive psychoactive substances as self-medication and to
   ease psychological distress. Other potentially addictive behaviors such
   as online gaming are also used to self-medicate and ease psychological
   distress. However, the role of online gaming and problematic gaming (in
   the form of internet gaming disorder {[}IGD]) has not previously been
   investigated for patients with schizophrenia facing distress. Methods:
   One hundred and four participants diagnosed with schizophrenia were
   recruited and completed a number of psychometric scales including the
   Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSPS), Internet Gaming Disorder
   Scale-Short Form (IGDS-SF9), Self-Stigma Scale-Short (SSS-S), and
   Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results: The results showed
   significant negative associations between PSPS, IGDS-SF9, and DASS-21,
   and significant positive correlations between the IGDS-SF-9, SSS-S and
   DASS-21. Moreover, IGD did not mediate the association between
   self-stigma and depression. However, IGD significantly mediated the
   association between self-stigma and anxiety, and the association between
   self-stigma and stress. In addition, (i) age and self-stigma were
   significant predictors for IGD; (ii) social function and self-stigma
   were significant predictors for depression; (iii) social function,
   self-stigma, and IGD were significant predictors for anxiety; and (iv)
   self-stigma and IGD were significant predictors for stress. Conclusion:
   The findings suggest that online gaming may be a coping strategy for
   individuals with schizophrenia with psychological stress and self-stigma
   and that for some of these individuals, their gaming may be problematic.}},

Title = {{Quality of life assessment in patients treated with nasal corticotherapy
   for allergic rhinitis: A cohort study}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a chronic nasal pathology
   induced by an inflammation of the mucous membranes due to a dependent
   IgE reaction following allergenic exposure. The main symptoms are
   rhinorrhea, nasal itching, nasal obstruction and sneezing bursts. It
   highly affects the patient quality of life (QoL) in many levels making
   it a public health issue.
   The aim of this study is to assess the QoL of patients with AR as well
   as the level of its improvement after nasal corticotherapy.
   Materials and methods: From June 2019 to February 2020, a prospective
   study was carried out based on the use of the validated Arabic version
   of the RQLQ (Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire) on a
   cohort of AR patients to measure their QoL before and after three months
   of treatment by ``Budesonide{''}.
   Results: A total of 70 patients participated in the study with an
   average age of 39.54 years with a sex ratio of 0.60. Their total RQLQ
   score was up to 4.28, improved to 2.35 after treatment. Also, a
   statistically significant improvement in sub-scores was also observed (p
   < 0.001): activities (from 4.43 to 2.29), nasal symptoms (from 5.00 to
   2.80), eye symptoms (from 3.38 to 1.80), practical problems (from 4.29
   to 2.18), general problems (from 4.63 to 2.78) and emotional state (from
   4.28 to 2.43).
   Conclusion: The RQLQ is a reliable tool to evaluate the QoL in AR
   patients, stating the negative influence of AR on patients daily life
   and the effectiveness of nasal corticosteroid treatment.}},

Title = {{Optimal Control as a Tool for Innovation in Aerial Twisting on a
   Trampoline}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aerial twisting techniques are preferred by trampoline coaches for their
   balanced landings. As these techniques are not intuitive, computer
   simulation has been a relevant tool to explore a variety of techniques.
   Up to now, twisting somersaults were mainly simulated using arm
   abduction/adduction only (2D). Our objective was to explore more complex
   (3D) but still anatomically feasible arm techniques to find innovative
   and robust twisting techniques. The twist rotation was maximized in a
   straight backward somersault performed by a model including arm
   abduction/adduction with and without changes in the plane of elevation.
   A multi-start approach was used to find a series of locally optimal
   performances. Six of them were retained and their robustness was
   assessed by adding noise to the first half of the arm kinematics and
   then reoptimizing the second half of the skill. We found that aerial
   twist performance linearly correlates with the complexity of arm
   trajectory. Optimal techniques share a common strategy consisting of
   moving the arm in a plane formed by the twisting and angular momentum
   axes, termed as the best tilting plane. Overall, 3D techniques are
   simpler and require less effort than 2D techniques for similar twist
   performances. Three techniques which generate similar to 3 aerial twists
   could be used by athletes because kinematic perturbations do not
   compromise the performance and the landing.}},

Abstract = {{A 1-GHz full cryogenic oscillator is presented. The oscillator is based
   on a planar superconductor resonator featuring a loaded \$\{Q\}\$ factor
   of 200 000 at low microwave input power (unloaded \$\{Q\}\$ of 400 000)
   and on amplifying parts realized with SiGe bipolar transistors. The
   circuit is designed with a harmonic balance software and realized on an
   alumina substrate. A nonlinear model is extracted at low temperature
   both for the transistor and the resonator. This double nonlinearity
   increases the difficulty of the oscillator design and implies a strategy

   cryogenerator are also a serious issue to get high performance. Finally,
   the oscillator features a phase noise of 112 dBc/Hz at 100-Hz offset
   frequency and a phase noise floor of 170 dBc/Hz (100-kHz offset) at a
   temperature of 65 K.}},

Title = {{Non-pharmacologic management of orthostatic hypotension}},
Journal = {{AUTONOMIC NEUROSCIENCE-BASIC \& CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{229}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Orthostatic hypotension (OH), a debilitating disorder characterized by a
   drop in blood pressure when in the upright position, may be treated
   through several pharmacologic and lifestyle modifications. The treatment
   is aimed at decreasing the symptoms, mainly the falls, increase the
   standing time, and improve the activities of daily life. A recent expert
   consensus outlined the management of orthostatic hypotension and
   included 4 sequential steps: 1) review medications and modify or remove
   those that may aggravate or cause OH; 2) non-pharmacologic measures; 3)
   pharmacologic measures and 4) treatment combinations. The aim of this
   manuscript is to review the non-pharmacological approach. In milder
   cases, this approach may suffice, but with more severe symptoms, such as
   falls, syncope or near syncope, a pharmacological strategy is
   simultaneously employed. Furthermore, most non-pharmacological measures
   are combined. The non-pharmacological approach is aimed at optimizing
   blood volume, decreasing postural venous pooling, reducing heat and
   post-prandial induced vasodilation, emphasizing physical conditioning,
   and minimizing nocturnal diuresis.}},

Abstract = {{Mega infrastructure projects provide a basic guarantee for social
   development, economic construction, and livelihood improvement. Their
   operation and maintenance (O\&M) management are of great significance
   for the smooth operation and the realization of the value created by the
   projects. In order to provide an approach for effectively evaluating
   O\&M management, this study develops a holistic indicator system using a
   mixed-review method from the national macro perspective in China. In
   this study, literature analysis, policy texts, expert interviews, and
   grounded theory were used to collect relevant data at home and abroad,
   and establish an initial evaluation indicator system with 23 indicators
   covering two dimensions and five aspects. Then the questionnaire survey
   and factor analysis were used to score and categorize the indicators,
   and finally an evaluation indicator system for O\&M management of mega
   infrastructure projects was formed. The results show that social
   relations, environmental benefits, macro policy, and operational
   capacities play an important role in the evaluation of the O\&M of mega
   infrastructure projects. This study helps the management team to avoid
   negative impacts in the O\&M management of mega infrastructure projects
   and lays a theoretical foundation for future research. The indicator
   system in this study is based on the Chinese context, and it remains to
   be verified whether the indicator system is applicable to other
   countries due to the differences in political and cultural backgrounds
   in different regions.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{267}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In order to examine whether 8:2 FTOH exposure would lead to a
   contamination risk of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances
   (PFASs) in broiler derived food, the biotransformation, and tissue
   distribution and accumulation of 8:2 FTOH following oral exposure in
   male broilers were investigated. The main metabolites of 8:2 FTOH in
   plasma and six tissues (muscle, liver, kidney, fat, heart, and lungs)
   identified by LC-Q-TOF were 2-perfluorooctyl ethanoic acid (8:2 FTCA),
   8:2 fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic acid (8:2 FTUCA),
   3-perfluoroheptyl propanoic acid (7:3 FTCA), perfluoropentanoic acid
   (PFPeA), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA),
   perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), 8:2 FTOH
   glucuronide conjugate, and 8:2 FTOH sulfate conjugate. The tissue
   distribution and bioaccumulation of 8:2 FTOH and its unconjugated
   metabolites were determinated by LC-MS/MS. 8:2 FTOH was quickly depleted
   in plasma and all six tested tissues, while PFOA, PFNA, and 7:3 FTCA
   showed strong accumulation in blood and all six examined tissues and
   were eliminated more slowly than the other metabolites. The tissues with
   the highest accumulation levels for 8:2 FTOH and its metabolites were
   heart, kidneys and liver, and the tissue with the lowest accumulation
   levels was muscle. The elimination half-lifes of PFNA in kidney and 7:3
   FTCA in lung were longer compared to those of other metabolites in all
   six determined tissues. Thus, PFNA and 7:3 FTCA can be selected as
   potential biomonitoring markers after 8:2 FTOH exposure. This study has
   improved our understanding of 8:2 FTOH biotransformation and tissue
   bioaccumulation in broilers, which will help us monitor human exposure
   risk via food derived from broilers polluted by 8:2 FTOH. (c) 2020

Abstract = {{A unique nanostructured electrocatalyst based on Palladium (Pd)
   nanosponge architecture is synthesized by one-step dealloying of the
   amorphous alloy precursor with low Pd concentration. The sponge-like
   nanostructure with hollow interiors enables sufficient contact between
   reactants and-both the interior and exterior surfaces. The results of
   cyclic voltammetry reveal that the as-prepared Pd nanosponge exhibits
   high sensitivity of 32 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) in a wide linear range (1-18
   mM), and long-term stability toward glucose electro-oxidation. The Pd
   nanosponge also manifests detection limit as low as 2.0 mu M (S/N = 3)
   and high selectivity for glucose sensing. The enhanced catalytic
   activity of the Pd nanosponge is attributed to the bimetallic
   synergistic effect and the large active surface area of the
   high-uniformity porous structure. The facile synthesis of the
   cost-effective Pd nanosponge with superior electrocatalytic performance
   makes it hold great potentials for biosensor and other catalysis
   applications.}},

   Salt-and-Pepper Noise}},

Abstract = {{Salt-and-pepper noise, which is often introduced by sharp and sudden
   disturbances in the image signal, greatly reduces the quality of images.
   Great progress has been made for the salt-and-pepper noise removal;
   however, the problem of image blur and distortion still exists, and the
   efficiency of denoising requires improvement. This paper proposes an
   iterative weighted-mean filter (IWMF) algorithm in detecting and
   removing high-density salt-and-pepper noise. Three steps are required to
   implement this algorithm: First, the noise value and distribution
   characteristics were used to identify the noise pixels, effectively
   improving the accuracy of noise detection. Second, a weighted-mean
   filter was applied to the noisy pixels. We adopted an un-fixed shape
   symmetrical window with better detail preservation ability. Third, this
   method was performed iteratively, avoiding the streak effect and
   artifacts in high noise density. The experimental results showed that
   IWMF outperformed other state-of-the-art filters at various noise
   densities, both in subjective visualization and objective digital
   measures. The extremely fast execution speed of this method is quite
   suitable for real-time processing.}},

Title = {{NPY stimulates cholesterol synthesis acutely by activating the
   SREBP2-HMGCR pathway through the Y1 and Y5 receptors in murine
   hepatocytes}},
Journal = {{LIFE SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{262}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Aims: The development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is
   partially attributed to disturbance in cholesterol metabolism and
   sympathetic overactivity. Excessive levels of the sympathetic
   neurotransmitter neuropeptide Y (NPY) positively correlated with both
   NAFLD and cholesterol accumulation. We wanted to determine, for the
   first time, whether NPY promotes cholesterol accumulation directly in
   hepatocytes and elucidate the underlying mechanism.
   Main methods: In vivo, NPY was injected through the hepatic portal vein
   into SD rats. One hour later, serum and liver tissues were collected. In
   vitro, BRL-3A hepatocytes were treated with NPY, and with Y1, Y2, Y5,
   receptor antagonists as well as with extracellular signal-regulated
   protein kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) antagonist, respectively. Cholesterol
   content was measured by coupled enzyme method. Precursor
   sterol-regulatory element binding protein 2 (pSREBP2), mature SREBP2
   (mSREBP2), HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), ERK1/2, pERK1/2, cAMP-dependent
   protein kinase (PKA), and pPKA protein expression levels were examined
   by western blotting.
   Key findings: In rats, intraportal vein injection of NPY activates
   pSREBP2, mSREBP2, and HMGCR protein expression, and induces hepatic
   cholesterol accumulation. In BRL-3A cells, we observed that NPY
   increases cholesterogenic protein expression and cholesterol synthesis
   through Y1 and Y5 receptors. This effect is mediated by the activation
   of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway.
   Significance: We demonstrated, for the first time, that NPY can activate
   the cholesterogenic pathway and elucidated the underlying mechanism.
   Thus, NPY and NPY receptors might be new targets for the treatment of
   NAFLD and dyslipidemia.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this study, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) film samples were prepared at
   different temperatures and annealed through magnetron sputtering
   technology. The surface morphology, crystal structure, bonding
   structure, and optical properties of the samples were characterized and
   analyzed. The surface of the MoS2 films prepared by radio frequency
   magnetron sputtering is tightly coupled and well crystallized, the
   density of the films decreases, and their voids and grain size increase
   with the increase in deposition temperature. The higher the deposition
   temperature is, the more stable the MoS2 films deposited will be, and
   the 200 degrees C deposition temperature is an inflection point of the
   film stability. Annealing temperature affects the structure of the
   films, which is mainly related to sulfur and the growth mechanism of the
   films. Further research shows that the optical band gaps of the films
   deposited at different temperatures range from 0.92 eV to 1.15 eV,
   showing semiconductor bandgap characteristics. The optical band gap of
   the films deposited at 200 degrees C is slightly reduced after annealing
   in the range of 0.71-0.91 eV. After annealing, the optical band gap of
   the films decreases because of the two exciton peaks generated by the K
   point in the Brillouin zone of MoS2. The blue shift of the K point in
   the Brillouin zone causes a certain change in the optical band gap of
   the films.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the coating of
   antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to the
   surface of a silicone catheter to reduce bacterial growth and to
   increase hydrophilicity, respectively.
   Methods: Surface characterisation was performed on bare silicone,
   AMP-coated, PVP-coated and AMP + PVP-coated silicone catheters using
   attenuated total reflectance-infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and water contact angle. Antibacterial
   activity, antibacterial biofilm growth and XTT assay were performed on
   bare silicone, AMP-coated, PVP-coated and AMP + PVP-coated silicone
   catheters. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA.
   Results: The water contact angle of the AMP + PVP-coated silicone
   catheter was 21.37 +/- 2.17 degrees compared with 107.23 +/- 0.96
   degrees, 74.40 +/- 1.76 degrees and 20.77 +/- 0.32 degrees for bare
   silicone, AMP-coated and PVP-coated silicone catheters. Based on in
   vitro antimicrobial tests, the AMP + PVP-coated silicone catheter had
   6.2, 2.2 and 2.5 greater antibacterial activity than that of the bare
   silicone catheter against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. Moreover, bacterial biofilm growth
   on the surface of the AMP + PVP-coated silicone catheter was minimal as
   characterised by scanning electron microscopy. MTT assay showed that
   bare silicone, AMP-coated, AMP + PVP-coated and PVP-coated silicone
   catheters were non-cytotoxic to 3T3 and human colon cancer (Cato-2)
   cells.
   Conclusions: This work demonstrates that AMP + PVP-coated silicone
   catheters have potential clinical application prospects with improved
   hydrophilicity, excellent biocompatibility, antibacterial activity and a
   certain antibacterial biofilm effect. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published

Abstract = {{Bovine alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-LA) is a critical component of whey
   protein (WP). It has regulatory effects on obesity, but the regulatory
   mechanism remains unclear. The present study investigated the beneficial
   effect of alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-LA) on obesity-related hepatic lipid
   metabolism in high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced obese C57BL/6J mice. The
   results showed that supplementation with alpha-LA for 8 weeks improved
   body weight gain, serum lipids, and hepatic steatosis and alleviated
   glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in obese mice. Additionally,
   alpha-LA upregulated the expression of fatty acid beta-oxidation-related
   genes and downregulated the expression of lipogenesis-related genes in
   the livers of obese mice. Our study suggested that the benefit of
   alpha-LA on improving hepatic lipid metabolism may be mainly associated
   with the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha
   (PPAR alpha) pathways in liver tissues. Therefore, alpha-LA may be used
   as a dietary therapy for obesity and related metabolic disorders.}},

Title = {{Development of a waterlogging analysis system for paddy fields in
   irrigation districts}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{591}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Waterlogging is one of the most important agricultural disasters
   affecting rice. In this study, we developed a waterlogging analysis
   system for paddy fields in irrigation districts with 7 modules,
   including pretreatment, hydrological computations and waterlogging
   computations. The newly developed system can consider the effects of
   both landform features and human interventions in irrigation districts.
   Observational data from the Gaoyou Irrigation District during 2014 and
   2015 were applied to calibrate and validate a waterlogging analysis
   system, respectively. The results indicated that the waterlogging
   analysis system could accurately predict the water levels in both the
   calibration (R-2 > 0.97) and validation (R-2 > 0.92) periods.
   Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses of the yield reduction rate
   indicated that saturated soil moisture and shape parameters (a and n)
   were the dominant soil hydrodynamic parameters affecting the simulated
   yield reduction rates. The weighted mean yield reduction rate of field
   areas decreased with increasing shape parameters and increased with
   increasing soil moisture saturation. However, further analysis showed
   that the maximum yield reduction rate exhibited a trend similar to that
   of saturated soil moisture, which indicated that the backwater effects
   of the river and ditch water level changes had a greater influence than
   the soil hydrodynamic parameters on the yield reduction rate, especially
   in low-elevation fields. In addition, the relationship between the yield
   reduction rate and field elevation could be fitted by an exponential
   function (R-2 = 0.83), and the field pond depth decreased linearly with
   a reduction in field elevation in both 2014 (R-2 = 0.36, p < 0.01) and
   2015 (R-2 = 0.64, p < 0.01). The proposed waterlogging analysis system
   could be a useful tool for evaluating the effects of waterlogging on
   rice production in the studied irrigation district or in other regions
   with similar climatic conditions.}},

Title = {{Bubble dynamics and heat transfer performance on micro-pillars
   structured surfaces with various pillars heights}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{163}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Micro-pillars structured surfaces have been found to enhance nucleate
   boiling significantly, as compared with smooth surfaces. In this study,
   a VOF-based (volume of fluid) numerical model is developed to
   investigate the single-bubble dynamics on micro-pillars structured
   surfaces in nucleate boiling, aiming to understand the effect of pillar
   height (h) on boiling enhancement. The model is solving by the
   commercial CFD (computational fluid dynamics) solver Fluent. The results
   show that increasing h modifies remarkably the bubble morphology. An
   interesting phenomenon is observed for larger h that the bubble bottom
   undergoes expansion, shrinkage, and re-expansion in gaps between
   micro-pillars in the growth stage, so that a mushroom-like bubble is
   generated, with a small root and a large head. The modified bubble
   morphology promotes the bubble departure, leading to a shorter departure
   time. Moreover, increasing h also enhances both evaporation rate in the
   microlayer and evaporation rate on the liquid-vapor interface, and
   thereby increasing bubble departure diameter. Thus, the shorter

Title = {{On the crushing response of the functionally graded metallic foams based
   on 3D Voronoi model}},
Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{157}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the study on crushing response of functionally
   stepwise graded foam under quasi-static and dynamic compression using
   three-dimensional (3D) Voronoi model. A series of simulations is
   conducted to acquire proper computing parameters and to validate the
   predictability of numerical model by comparing with experiment results.
   Two different strategies are proposed to achieve the gradient change in
   relative density by changing equivalent radius and cell-wall thickness.
   The main focus of present paper is placed on the effect of gradation
   configuration on the stress-strain response, deformation propagation and
   energy absorption. The results show that the gradation configuration has
   little effect on the crushing behavior of graded foams under
   quasi-static compression. However, the performance of graded foam under
   dynamic compression could be promoted by tailoring its gradation
   configuration. Adopting a negative gradation is beneficial for reducing
   the stress at the stationary side and maximizing the energy absorption
   under low strain level. A positive gradation would be preferred as an
   energy absorber under high strain level.}},

Title = {{Garcinone C suppresses colon tumorigenesis through the Gli1-dependent
   hedgehog signaling pathway}},
Journal = {{PHYTOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{79}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although garcinone C, a natural xanthone derivative
   identified in the pericarp of Garcinia mangostana, has been demonstrated
   to exert different health beneficial activities in oxidative stress and
   beta-amyloid aggregation, the role of garcinone C in colon tumorigenesis
   has not been investigated. In addition, aberrant Hedgehog (Hh) signaling
   activation is associated with tumorigenesis including colon cancer.
   Here, we hypothesized that garcinone C can prevent colon tumorigenesis
   through regulating the Hh signaling pathway.
   Method: Colony formation assay and flow cytometry were used to evaluate
   the effect of garcinone C on the proliferation and cell cycle
   progression of colon cancer cells. Protein expression of cell cycle
   related markers and Hh/Gli1 signaling mediators were determined. The
   regulatory effect of orally administered garcinone C on the Hh/Gli1
   signaling pathway and colon tumorigenesis was evaluated in an
   azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colon cancer
   animal model.
   Results: Garcinone C suppressed the proliferation of colon cancer cells,
   induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, as well as regulated the expression of
   cell cycle-related markers such as cyclin D1, cyclin E, CDK6, and p21.
   Garcinone C inhibited the expression of Gli1, a key mediator of Hedgehog
   signaling, and protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation in Smo-independent
   colon cancer cells. In the AOM/DSS-induced colon tumorigenesis model,
   garcinone C significantly inhibited tumor development, regulated the
   expression of cell cycle markers and Gli1, and reduced AKT
   phosphorylation in colon tumor tissues, which is consistent with our in
   vitro results.
   Conclusion: Garcinone C can suppress colon tumorigenesis in vitro and in
   vivo through Gli1-dependent non-canonical Hedgehog signaling, suggesting
   that it may serve as a potent chemopreventive agent against colon
   tumorigenesis.}},

Title = {{A high efficient heat exchanger with twisted geometries for biogas
   process with manure slurry}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{279}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Heat-transfer enhancement in manure slurry is crucial for increasing the
   efficiency and production of biogas during anaerobic digestion in biogas
   plants. In this study, a novel heat exchanger with an optimal twisted
   geometry was developed based on the numerical screening of the twisted
   tubes with equilateral polygons, and experiments were conducted to
   validate the numerical results. It was observed that the SST k-omega
   model is more efficient than other turbulence models in representing the
   heat transfer performance of the twisted tubes, and the numerical model
   with a thermostatic wall can be used to reliably screen the twisted
   geometries. The twisted hexagonal tube has the optimal geometry, with
   enhancement capability of up to 1.4 times compared to that of the
   circular tube. The formation of high continuity regions with relatively
   strong heat-transfer rates along the heat-exchange wall is the main
   reason for the high performance during heat transfer. The external
   heating process was integrated in a full-scale biogas plant, and the
   model and algorithm were developed and validated with additional
   experiments to describe the overall performance of both conventional and
   screened optimal geometries under different conditions. It was observed
   that a profit equivalent to 39\% of total production for a large-scale
   biogas plant can be achieved owing to energy conservation in external
   heating with the twisted hexagonal tubes.}},

   arrays on carbon cloth for cycling-stable lithium metal anodes}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Lithium metal has been regarded as the promising and attractive anode
   material for future energy storage. However, the development of lithium
   metal batteries has been severely hindered from largescale commercial
   applications because of uncontrollable lithium dendrite growth and low
   coulombic efficiency, which may lead to short cycle life and safety
   hazard. Herein, we report a composite Li anode by prestoring lithium
   into highly ordered CoO nanorod array-decorated commercial carbon cloth
   (CC) through a thermal infusion strategy. Not only can the
   lithiophilicity of CC be improved by the CoO nanorod, but also the local
   current inhomogeneity can be decreased. As a stable 3-dimension (3D)
   framework, it can suppress the dendrite formation effectively. In
   comparison with bare Li, the CoO@CC-Li anode shows more stable cycling
   performance in symmetric cells with small overpotential at different
   current densities. The good cycling performance and rate capability in
   the full cell against the LiFePO4 cathode also prove its advancement for
   practical applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal antenatal depression strongly influences child mental health
   but with considerable inter-individual variation that is, in part,
   linked to genotype. The challenge is to effectively capture the
   genotypic influence. We outline a novel approach to describe genomic
   susceptibility to maternal antenatal depression focusing on child
   emotional/behavioral difficulties. Two cohorts provided measures of
   maternal depression, child genetic variation, and child mental health
   symptoms. We constructed a conventional polygenic risk score (PRS) for
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (PRSADHD) that
   significantly moderated the association between maternal antenatal
   depression and internalizing problems at 60 months (p = 2.94 x 10(-4),
   R-2 = .18). We then constructed an interaction PRS (xPRS) based on a
   subset of those single nucleotide polymorphisms from the PRSADHD that
   most accounted for the moderation of the association between maternal
   antenatal depression and child outcome. The interaction between maternal
   antenatal depression and this xPRS accounted for a larger proportion of
   the variance in child emotional/behavioral problems than models based on
   any PRSADHD (p = 5.50 x 10(-9), R-2 = .27), with similar findings in the
   replication cohort. The xPRS was significantly enriched for genes
   involved in neuronal development and synaptic function. Our study
   illustrates a novel approach to the study of genotypic moderation on the
   impact of maternal antenatal depression on child mental health and
   highlights the utility of the xPRS approach. These findings advance our
   understanding of individual differences in the developmental origins of
   mental health.}},

   the dynamic fluctuation characteristics of the pipeline near high-speed

   of AC current density and typical dynamic interference cycle on the
   corrosion rate of X65 steel were investigated. The results show that the
   corrosion rates under steady and dynamic AC interference are higher than
   that under natural corrosion. With the increase of peak AC current
   density and interference time of each cycle, the dynamic AC corrosion
   rate increases. When the interference time increases to 350s in each
   interference cycle, the dynamic AC corrosion rate is equivalent to the
   steady AC corrosion rate.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Aim: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common
   primary malignancy of the liver. Resistance to chemotherapy and
   side-effects remain a challenge for treating advanced and recurrent HCC.
   Therefore, there is an emerging need to develop new drugs to treat HCC.
   Materials and Methods: We evaluated the anti-growth activity of
   flavopereirine in HepG2 and Huh7 HCC cell lines. Cell viability,
   cell-cycle profile, apoptosis, and autophagy-related protein expressions
   were analysed after flavopereirine treatment. Results: Flavopereirine
   treatment induced G(0)/G(1) cell-cycle arrest, with an increase of
   sub-G1 cells detected at the higher concentration and longer exposure to
   flavopereirine in HCC cells. Intrinsic and extrinsic pathways were
   involved in flavopereirine-induced apoptosis, as demonstrated by an
   increase of cleaved caspase 8 and 9 by western blotting. An alteration
   of autophagy-related protein expression was also found after
   flavopereirine treatment. Conclusion: Taken together, the current
   results indicate that flavopereirine exhibits good anticancer activity
   in HCC cells.}},

Abstract = {{To improve the removal efficiency of such submicron inclusions, we
   designed an argon blowing method for an RH facility based on
   mathematical simulations. The effect of the argon blowing on the liquid
   steel flow and the movement of submicron inclusions was studied using
   the k-epsilon flow model coupled with the DPM model for inclusion
   movement based on fluid computational dynamics in FLUENT. It was found
   that a more uniform argon flow can be achieved in the up-leg snorkel
   with a new nozzle position and inner diameter, which resulted in a
   favorable up-lifting and mixing movement. The new design also increased
   the circulation rate of molten steel in the RH chamber. The increased
   turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent dispersing rate enhanced the
   collision probability of submicron inclusions, which results in an
   improved removal for 0.5-1 mu m inclusions. The proposed RH facility
   could increase the removal rate of submicron inclusions from the
   original 57.1\% to 66.4\%, which improves the magnetic properties of
   non-oriented silicon steel.}},

Title = {{Experimental assessment of alternative low global warming potential
   refrigerants for automotive air conditioners application}},
Journal = {{CASE STUDIES IN THERMAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{22}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{R134a, one of the most commonly used refrigerants especially for air
   conditioning (AC) systems, will be banned in automotive air conditioners
   after 2022 due to a high global warming potential (GWP). R152a and
   R1234yf are considered as two potential low GWP drop-in alternatives to
   R134a due to similar thermodynamic properties. In this paper, the
   performance of R152a, R1234yf, and R134a in an oil-free vapour
   compression refrigeration (VCR) system is investigated. The absence of
   oil lubricant enables a wide range of refrigerant selection and highly
   efficient refrigeration cycle. Experiments for R152a, R1234yf, and R134a
   were conducted over wide range of operating conditions. The results show
   that R1234yf is similar to R134a in terms of operating pressure and
   temperature, but R1234yf has an 11\% and 16\% deterioration in cooling
   capacity and coefficient of performance (COP) respectively. The higher
   volumetric efficiency, adiabatic efficiency and cooling capacity of
   R152a contributes to a 13\% and a 6\% higher cooling capacity and COP
   respectively than that of R134a. At an evaporator temperature of 0
   degrees C, the COP of R152a, R1234yf, and R134a are 2.8, 1.8, and 2.3,
   respectively. Though flammability restricts the use of R152a in
   conventional automotive air conditioners, R152a can be considered as a
   more promising alternative to R134a for oil-free automotive air
   conditioning than R1234yf due to its high efficiency, low cost, and
   reasonable safety level benefiting from the absence of oil lubricants.}},

Abstract = {{Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) are process-oriented
   information-technology (IT) solutions for collecting and managing

   programming effort and the complex integration with other manufacturing
   systems, though the food and beverage manufacturers can benefit from the
   MES, its implementation is not widespread in this industry. To simplify
   the implementation and engineering process, the concept of model-driven
   engineering (MDE) is considered as a solution. However, a feasible
   model-driven approach for MES engineering has not been established, not
   to mention for the food and beverage industry. This paper presents an
   approach for the automatic MES generation according to the MDE concept
   providing MES functions that are relevant to the food and beverage
   manufacturing processes primarily. It consists of necessary phases to
   cover the whole engineering process of the MES. Based on the application
   of the presented approach to the brewing process in a brewhouse, the
   feasibility and practicality of this approach were proven.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports a facile preparation of EuxTi1-xO2-yNy/CoFe2O4
   (Eu/N-doped titania coupled with cobalt ferrite), an efficient
   photocatalyst for ibuprofen (IBP) oxidation from its solution under
   visible light. The heterojunction structure (EuxTi1-xO2-yNy/CoFe2O4)
   enhanced the IBP photo-oxidation performance by promoting charge carrier
   mobility, and the immobilization of this heterojunction composite onto
   diatomaceous earth (DE) improved the adsorption ability towards IBP
   molecule from its solution, thus further improved the photooxidation
   efficiency. The effects of various factors on oxidation efficiency were
   studied, such as pH, IBP concentration, catalyst dosage, co-existing
   ions, microplastics and peroxymonosulfate (PMS). Quenching experiment
   results demonstrated the roles of reactive species. The intermediates
   and their acute toxicity were studied. Furthermore, the photocatalytic
   reaction pathway and mechanism were proposed. The reported photocatalyst
   revealed excellent reusability and stability, suggesting itself a
   promising approach for wastewater treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Methyl iodide (CH3I) is an important trace greenhouse gas in the
   atmosphere and an ozone-depleting substance. The influence of different
   environmental factors, such as the duration of illumination; the
   strength of illumination; the concentrations of humic acid, ferric ion
   (Fe3+), and iodide ion (I-); and pH, on the photochemical production of
   CH3I in artificial seawater (ASW) were tested by simulated solar
   irradiation. In addition, Yangtze River Estuary waters from inshore to
   offshore were used to explore the relationship between the photochemical
   production of CH3I and different sources of dissolved organic matter
   (DOM) in natural sea-water (NSW). The results revealed that higher
   concentrations of humic acid and I-, as well as higher strengths of
   illumination and longer illumination durations, promoted the
   photochemical formation of CH3I in ASW. The addition of Fe3+ accelerated
   the photochemical production of CH3I, but high concentrations of Fe3+
   inhibited the formation of CH3I. Experiments on NSW obtained from the
   Yangtze River estuary spiked when concentrations of DOM were high,
   confirming that DOM plays an important role in facilitating the
   photochemical production of CH3I within the Yangtze River Estuary. The
   photochemical production of CH3I in the seawater was significantly
   higher under light conditions relative to dark conditions, indicating
   that illumination accelerated the production of CH3I.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigates the dominant energy dissipations of the
   multi-frequency whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators to provide an
   insight into the loss mechanisms of the devices. An extensive theory for
   each loss source was established and experimentally testified. The
   squeezed film damping (SFD) is a major loss for all the WGMs at
   atmosphere, which is distinguished from traditional bulk acoustic wave
   (BAW) resonators where the high-order modes suffer less from the air
   damping. In vacuum, the SFD is negligible, and the frequency-dependent
   Akhiezer damping (AKE) has significant effects on different order modes.
   For low-order WGMs, the AKE is limited, and the anchor loss behaves as
   the dominant loss. For high-order modes with an extended nodal region,
   the anchor loss is reduced, and the AKE determines the Q values.
   Substantial Q enhancements over four times and an excellent f x Q
   product up to 6.36 x 10(13) at 7 K were achieved.}},

Abstract = {{The extraction and complexation behaviors of four tetraalkyl
   diglycolamide (TRDGA, where R represents n-butyl, n-hexyl, n-octyl and
   2-ethylhexyl) ligands with linear chain or branched chain structure were
   described with respect to La3+, Pr3+, Nd3+; Eu3+, Gd3+; Y3+, Er3+ and
   Yb3+ as the representatives of light, middle and heavy rare-earth group
   ions in HNO3 solution. Effects of acidity, ligand concentration and
   temperature on the distribution ratio of these ions were examined. High
   acidity was good for the extraction. For same metal ion, the
   extractability of DGA ligands followed the order of T2EHDGA < THDGA <
   TODGA < TBDGA at the same acidity, which was also supported by nuclear
   magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses. Meanwhile, for different metal ions,
   their extracted efficiencies by the same DGA ligand increased in the
   sequence of lanthanide contraction. The average separation factors of
   adjacent lanthanides within light, middle and heavy rare-earth groups
   could attain about 2.4, 1.7 and 2.1, respectively. Slope analysis
   indicated that the formation of predominant 1:3 and 1:2 metal/ligand
   extracted species for linear chain and branched DGA, respectively. In
   methanol solution, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 Eu3+/DGA species were also observed
   using fluorescence spectroscopy titration. Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FT-IR) analyses suggested that the carbonyl oxygens
   compared with ether oxygen play a dominant role in coordination.
   Moreover, the stability constants (log beta) and the thermodynamic
   parameters (Delta H, Delta S and Delta G) for the complexation of Eu3+
   with DGAs were also presented.}},

Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We focus on exploring the LIDAR-RGB fusion-based 3D object detection in
   this paper. This task is still challenging in two aspects: (1) the
   difference of data formats and sensor positions contributes to the
   misalignment of reasoning between the semantic features of images and
   the geometric features of point clouds. (2) The optimization of
   traditional IoU is not equal to the regression loss of bounding boxes,
   resulting in biased back-propagation for non-overlapping cases. In this
   work, we propose a cascaded cross-modality fusion network (CCFNet),
   which includes a cascaded multi-scale fusion module (CMF) and a novel
   center 3D IoU loss to resolve these two issues. Our CMF module is
   developed to reinforce the discriminative representation of objects by
   reasoning the relation of corresponding LIDAR geometric capability and
   RGB semantic capability of the object from two modalities. Specifically,
   CMF is added in a cascaded way between the RGB and LIDAR streams, which
   selects salient points and transmits multi-scale point cloud features to
   each stage of RGB streams. Moreover, our center 3D IoU loss incorporates
   the distance between anchor centers to avoid the oversimple optimization
   for non-overlapping bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on the KITTI
   benchmark have demonstrated that our proposed approach performs better
   than the compared methods.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   China's ``13(th) 5-Year Plan{''} (2016-2020) for the prevention and
   control of sudden acute infectious diseases emphasizes that epidemic
   monitoring and epidemic focus surveys in key areas are crucial for
   strengthening national epidemic prevention and building control
   capacity. Establishing an epidemic hot spot areas and prediction model
   is an effective means of accurate epidemic monitoring and surveying.
   Objective: This study predicted hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome
   (HFRS) epidemic hot spot areas, based on multi-source environmental
   variable factors. We calculated the contribution weight of each
   environmental factor to the morbidity risk, obtained the spatial
   probability distribution of HFRS risk areas within the study region, and
   detected and extracted epidemic hot spots, to guide accurate epidemic
   monitoring as well as prevention and control. Methods: We collected
   spatial HFRS data, as well as data on various types of natural and human
   social activity environments in Hunan Province from 2010 to 2014. Using
   the information quantity method and logistic regression modeling, we
   constructed a risk-area-prediction model reflecting the epidemic
   intensity and spatial distribution of HFRS. Results: The areas under the
   receiver operating characteristic curve of training samples and test
   samples were 0.840 and 0.816. From 2015 to 2019, HRFS case site
   verification showed that more than 82\% of the cases occurred in
   high-risk areas.
   Discussion
   This research method could accurately predict HFRS hot spot areas and
   provided an evaluation model for Hunan Province. Therefore, this method
   could accurately detect HFRS epidemic high-risk areas, and effectively
   guide epidemic monitoring and surveyance.
   Author summary
   Hunan, the main epidemic area of HRFS in China. Hunan has had a
   cumulative incidence of 117,000 cases since 1963. During this time Hunan
   experienced two high incidence periods in the 1980s and 1990s. We used
   an Information quantity + Logistic regression model (I+LR model) to
   predict high-incidence and potential epidemic HFRS areas. Normalized
   difference vegetation index(NDVI)contributed most to HFRS risk. Per
   capita GDP, population size, land-use type, rainfall, elevation, and
   soil type were all factors found to influence HFRS risk. Our study is
   useful for risk prediction, prevention, and control of HFRS.}},

Title = {{Breakage mechanism of hard-rock penetration by TBM disc cutter after
   high pressure water jet precutting}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING FRACTURE MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{240}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{To achieve greater efficiency of TBM driving and lower cutter
   maintenance costs in hard rock formations, the TBM integrated high
   pressure water jet system was developed. By examining the working modes
   of water jets and disc cutters, this paper investigates the mechanical
   response and failure mechanisms for the simple case in which a water jet
   is first used to cut, followed by disc cutter rock breaking. As disc
   cutters use penetration-type rock breaking, laboratory quasi-static
   penetration tests and numerical simulations were carried out for kerf
   specimen precutting with a high pressure water jet. The influence of
   kerf parameters on the mechanical behavior of rock breaking was studied,
   and the mechanisms of surface and internal cracks and fractures were
   revealed and discussed. The results show that peak penetration force
   decreases with the increase of kerf depth, and slightly increases with
   the increase of kerf spacing. The specific energy decreases
   significantly with the increase of kerf depth and gradually becomes
   stable once the kerf depth becomes greater than 18.14 mm. The internal
   cracks formed in shallower kerf specimens mainly include shallow tensile
   cracks and deep vertical split cracks. However, the internal cracks of
   deeper kerf specimens incline and bend, extending towards the bottom of
   the kerf. The theoretically obtained minimum shear load, optimal failure
   depth, and fragment area all increase with kerf spacing, but the angle
   of the shear plane remains approximately 45 degrees. These findings may
   provide some reference for the design and construction of TBMs
   integrated with high-pressure water jets.}},

Abstract = {{Sanghuang is a well-known edible and medicinal fungus consumed in Asia
   for centuries. In the present study, a novel exopolysaccharide named as
   mannan (SSEPS2) was isolated from the liquid culture broth of
   Sanghuangporus sanghuang by using ethanol precipitation, anion-exchange
   chromatography, and size-exclusion chromatography, which was exclusively
   composed of D-mannose with the molecular weight 9.43 x 10(4) g/mol. The
   structural analysis suggested that SSEPS2 consisted of 1,3-linked and
   1,2-linked alpha-D-mannopyranose (Manp), with substitution at O-6 of
   1,2-linked alpha-D-Manp by 1,6-linked alpha-D-Manp residues and terminal
   alpha-D-Manp residues. The exponent of a (0.58) indicated that SSEPS2
   existed in a flexible chain conformation, with a coil-like structure in
   0.1 M NaNO3 at 25 degrees C, which was further confirmed by the atomic
   force microscopy images and a three-dimensional molecular model. It
   exhibited potential antitumor activity against the growth of HepG2
   (human hepatoma) and MCF-7 cell lines in vitro. The IC50 values for
   inhibiting HepG-2 cells and MCF-7 cells proliferation were 365 and 340
   mu g/mL, which showed its potential application in the development of
   anticancer therapeutics. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the mode selective coupler (MSC) in a cavity, a Q-switched
   pulsed erbium-doped fiber laser with switchable output modes is reported

   arc realized. Because the MSC has mode separation characteristics and
   the laser cavity has a dual-branch output configuration, the laser
   output can be switched between different modes by adjusting the cavity
   loss. The dual wavelength Q-switched pulse output with linear
   polarization modes (LP01 mode and LP11 mode) is successfully observed.
   The laser with switchable output modes can be used in communication,

Abstract = {{The emergence and global distribution of the mcr-1 gene for colistin
   resistance have become a public concern because of threats to the role
   of colistin as the last line of defense against some bacteria. Because
   of the prevalence of mcr-1-positive Escherichia coli isolates in food
   animals, production of these animals has been regarded as one of the
   major sources of amplification and spread of mcr-1. In this study, 249
   E. coli isolates were recovered from 300 fecal samples collected from
   swine farms in Heilongjiang Province, People's Republic of China.
   Susceptibility testing revealed that 186 (74.70\%) of these isolates
   were colistin resistant, and 86 were positive for mcr-1. The
   mcr-1-positive isolates had extensive antimicrobial resistance profiles
   and additional resistance genes, including blaTEM, blaCTX-M, aac3-IV,
   tet(A), floR, sul1, sul2, sul3, and oqxAB. No mutations in genes pmrAB
   and mgrB were associated with colistin resistance. Phylogenetic group
   analysis revealed that the mcr1-positive E. coli isolates belonged to
   groups A (52.33\% of isolates), B1 (33.72\%), B2 (5.81\%), and D
   (8.14\%). The prevalence of the virulence-associated genes iutA, iroN,
   fimH, vat, ompA, and traT was moderate. Seven mcr-1-positive isolates
   were identified as extraintestinal pathogenic. Among 20 mcr-1-positive
   E. coli isolates, multilocus sequence typing revealed that sequence type
   10 was the most common (five isolates). The conjugation assays revealed
   that the majority of mcr-1 genes were transferable at frequencies of
   7.05 x 10(-7) to 7.57 x 10(-4). The results of this study indicate the
   need for monitoring and minimizing the further dissemination of mcr-1
   among E. coli isolates in food animals, particularly swine.
   HIGHLIGHTS
   A high prevalence of resistance to colistin was found among porcine E.
   coli isolates.
   The mcr-1 gene was the predominant gene among colistin-resistant E.
   coli.
   E. coli isolates positive for mcr-1 had extensive resistance profiles
   and other resistance genes.
   The majority of mcr-1 genes were transferable.
   Some virulence-associated genes were highly prevalent among
   mcr-1-positive E. coli isolates.}},

Abstract = {{A simple single bounding surface constitutive model is developed to
   predict the undrained behaviours of saturated clays under cyclic loads.
   The new model does not involve complex kinematic hardening rules, and it
   is only required to memorize important stress reverse events; therefore,
   the simplicity should be the largest advantage of the model. A new
   interpolation function of an elastoplastic shear modulus is proposed
   based on bounding surface theories. The evolution of a hardening modulus
   is described in the deviatoric stress space by the movement and updating
   of a mapping centre based on the new interpolation function, which
   enables the model to describe the stress-strain hysteretic responses of
   clays under cyclic loading. The new model can be regarded as an
   improvement of some classical one-dimensional soil dynamic models and a
   generalization in three-dimensional stress space. The model parameters
   can usually be determined by performing triaxial tests. The model
   performance has been verified by a comparative analysis on clays
   subjected to one-way and two-way cyclic loading at different stress
   levels. The developed model can capture the essential features of
   behaviours in saturated clay, including reverse plastic flow, evolution
   of hysteretic loops, accumulation of plastic deformations and soil
   stiffness degradation. The newly developed constitutive model has been
   successfully encoded into the ABAQUS software package by the secondary
   development interface of UMAT. The ability of the model to calculate
   boundary value problems, such as clay foundations subjected to seismic
   loads, has been verified to some extent by simulating the seismic
   responses of homogeneous horizontal sites.}},

Abstract = {{Delphinium yunnanense is an endemic species in the Yunnan Province of
   China, while Delphinium elatum `Guardian Blue' is widespread as cut
   flowers in the world. They all bloom attractive blue flowers, which are
   a crucial ornamental trait for floriculture. In this experiment, the
   cross-compatibility between D. yunnanense and D. elatum was
   characterised and evaluated. The results showed that a strong
   cross-incompatibility was observed in D. yunnanense x D. datum,
   resulting in hybrid sterility. The F 1 hybrid generation produced
   neither fruits nor seeds. The cross-incompatibility of the hybrids
   resulted from the disturbed structure of the pollen tubes penetrating
   pistil style and callose deposits on stigma and in style. Moreover, the
   germination rate of D. elatum x D. yunnanense F, seed was lower than
   their own allogamic crosses, although there was no difference in fruit
   set rate. The results confirmed the cross-incompatibility between D.
   yunnanense and D. elatum, suggesting that D. elatum is more suitable as
   a maternal parent for hybridisation breeding. Our study characterised
   and evaluated the interspecific cross-compatibility through the
   pollen-stigma interaction and the reproductive system in Delphinium,
   which could provide the basis for the development and utilisation of
   potential ornamental traits in Delphinium.}},

Title = {{Global quantitative monitoring of the ion exchange balance in a chloride
   migration test on cementitious materials with mineral additions}},
Journal = {{CEMENT AND CONCRETE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{138}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The concrete pore solution changes during chloride transfer due to the
   species leaching and the dissolution/precipitation of compounds. The
   latter could affect the material porosity and the chloride diffusion
   coefficient. In order to quantify these changes, the global movement of
   species was monitored on blended cement materials during a chloride
   migration test. Compartment solutions and sample pore solutions were
   analyzed in order to quantify the ion exchange balance. Two migration
   test protocols were carried out using (i) NaOH, KOH and NaCl, and (ii)
   synthetic seawater and synthetic pore solution. The use of slag reduces
   the free chloride in the porosity by about 9 times. For the Portland
   cement material, a precipitation of 0.3\%wt of Na, 0.6\%wt of K and
   1\%wt of Cl participated in a porosity clogging of 60\%. Finally, the
   materials with mineral additions reduce the portlandite dissolution
   during chloride transfer and the calcium leaching phenomena up to 26\%.}},
