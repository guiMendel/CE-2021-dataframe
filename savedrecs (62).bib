Abstract = {{We have verified the consequences of alterations of the lipidic phase of
   HEp 2 cell membranes on susceptibility to infection from Herpes simplex
   virus, and have related these results to modification in membrane
   fluidity. This was carried out by treating HEp 2 cells with saturated
   and unsaturated fatty acids with chain lengths from eight to 18 carbons
   atoms. The results show that HEp 2 cells treated with saturated fatty
   acids with eight and ten carbon atoms have both increased membrane
   fluidity and increased susceptibility to Herpes simplex virus infection
   while both parameters were reduced when HEp 2 cells were treated with
   saturated fatty acids having 14 an d 18 carbon atoms. Fatty acids with
   16 carbon atoms, however, show an increase in membrane fluidity which
   has no significant correlation to infection susceptibility. As to
   unsaturated acids, those with eight carbon atoms, 2-octenoic acid
   (trans-8: 1]2{[}) and 2-octynoic acid (8::: 1]2{[}), increase the
   susceptibility to infection and fluidity while low concentrations of
   monounsaturated acids with 14 and 18 carbon atoms, myristoleic acid
   (cis-14: 1{[}9]) and oleic acid (cis-18 : 1{[}9]), reduce both the
   susceptibility to infection and th fluidity of the membrane.}},

Abstract = {{Residual soils (saprolites) developed on crystalline rocks appear to
   form by an essentially isovolumetric process (i.e. without dilation or
   compaction).  Isovolumetric geochemical analysis of a suite of saprolite
   samples developed on a common parent rock can be used to estimate the
   relative rates of long-term losses of P and Si during weathering.  Using
   the export of dissolved Si in rivers as a weathering index, one can then
   estimate the rate of P release due to chemical weathering by means of
   the P-Si loss ratio in saprolite.  For three basins where data are
   available (Liberty Hill, SC; Amazon River, Brazil:  Rio Negro, Brazil)
   estimated P weathering release rates are 163, 457, and 242 moles P km-2
   yr-1, respectively.  These compare to precipitation inputs of 684, 700
   and 630 moles P km-2 yr-1 and total river exports of 256, 4490 and 820
   moles P km-2 yr-1, respectively.  The Rio Negro shows a near perfect
   balance between the input of P via precipitation and chemical weathering
   and the riverine output of dissolved and suspended P.  This system,
   however, raised the unsolved problem of the source that supports the
   atmospheric P input.}},

Abstract = {{We determined ionic composition, anatomical characteristics, and
   ultrastructure of the assimilating organs, photosynthetic and
   respiratory gas exchange, photo-synthetic metabolism, and osmotic
   pressure of the cell sap in plants of solonchaks of the Ararat valley. 
   Succulent C-4 species, the majority of which belong to the family
   Chenopodiaceae, are widely represented in the investigated region.  With
   respect to ultrastructure, a significant number of C-4 halophtes belong
   to the NAD-ME{*} group.  Osmotic pressure is elevated and the
   photosynthetic and respiratory rates depressed in plants dwelling on the
   most saline plots (regardless of the type of photosynthetic metabolism).
   Photosynthetic metabolism for the most part reflects ultrastructural
   characteristics, but is more mobile, a circumstance that promotes plant
   adaptation to conditions of salinity.  It is concluded that high values
   of cell sap osmotic pressure in halophytes enable them to survive on
   arid saline territory.  Advantages of the C-1 syndrome are manifested in
   combination with the annual life form.  Plants of the C-3 type can
   survive under conditions of salinity only in the form of perennials.}},

   combinational scattering bands of glassy carbon and pyrolytic graphite
   is observed which is similar to that observed previously in single
   crystal graphite at P > 23 GPa.  A step-like singularity in the
   dependence of the combinational scattering frequency of single crystal
   graphite on the pressure is observed at P = 23-45 GPa.  At P > 44 GPa
   the combinational scattering spectra of all three substances become
   virtually indistinguishable from the spectra of amorphous carbon (a-C)
   at the same pressures.  This result is ascribed to the formation at
   these pressures of a dense amorphous modification of carbon.}},

Abstract = {{We compared tyrosinase activity (TH, DO, and native PAGE-defined

   hairbulb melanocytes of lethal yellow (A(y)/a C/C), nonagouti black (a/a
   C/C), and albino (a/a c2J/c2J) of 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-day regenerating
   hairbulbs.  With respect to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopa oxidase
   (DO) activities, A(y)/a melanocytes possessed only 25-35\% of the
   activity of a/a; there were no genotype differences in either the
   subcellular distribution of activity in soluble and particulate
   fractions or in the relative increases of activity over the 12-day
   developmental period.  TH data on wild-type agouti (A(wJ)/A(wJ)) mice
   over the 3-11 day regeneration interval showed an activity intermediate
   between that of a/a and A(y)/a; the rate of TH increase reflected black
   and yellow phases of the agouti hair cycle.  Analyses of the number and
   densities of dopa-sensitive bands following native PAGE of 3-, 6-, 9-,
   and 12-day hairbulb fractions of a/a and A(y)/a mice suggested
   stage-dependent patterns.  A comparison of rates and amounts of melanin
   production in 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-day fractions showed consistent melanin
   production in A(y)/a to be 10-20\% that of a/a; however, fold increases
   in melanin production over the four stages were similar between
   genotypes.  Overall, tyrosinase activity data support the notion that
   agouti locus modification of tyrosinase activity is a graded or
   quantitative rather than a qualitative phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{Course and prognosis of open lower leg fractures are significantly
   influenced by the concomitant soft tissue injury.  Selection and timing
   of therapeutic procedures determine the final outcome.  Fracture
   stabilisation takes priority.  Early soft tissue coverage should be
   achieved by local cutaneous or fasciocutaneous flaps.  Exposed bone can
   be covered by trasposed local musculature.  Especially in the distal
   third as well as in extensive soft tissue loss the microsurgical
   transplantation of free flaps is advantageous.  Tissue expansion can
   provide skin for secondary replacement of instable scars.}},

Abstract = {{From September 1980 to March 1985, 123 cementless, polyethylene Endler
   acetabular sockets of the threaded, tapered type were implanted in 115
   patients at the department of orthopaedic surgery, Balgrist, University
   of Zurich.  The first 102 Endler sockets, in combination with a
   Zweymuller femoral prosthesis, have been followed up till April 1988,
   this corresponding to an average observation period of 57.4 months. 
   12.8\% of the total number of qualitative criteria and the Sutherland
   method, and further 20.6\% of the cases were suspected of having
   loosened, so that a figure of 33.3\% (34 loosened sockets) resulted.  A
   definite correlation between loosening and the following factors were
   determined:  females, limping, Trendelenburg sign, period of
   implantation and severe, continuous pain.  No correlation was found
   between either tolerable pain, age, weight, or paraarticular
   ossification, and loosening.  The cementless artificial hip joint of
   Endler/Zweymuller combination led to a definite improvement of
   independency and living quality through increase in mobility and
   reduction of pain.}},

Abstract = {{The oral and maxillofacial surgical therapy of the elderly patient must
   include considerations of age-related physiological changes, both of
   inner organs and oral structures.  Decreased hepatic and renal function
   may lead to delayed elimination of anaesthetic drugs and thereby make
   dose reductions necessary.  Sclerosis or osteoporosis of jaw bones may
   render the surgical treatment of odontogenous diseases more difficult
   due to the increased fracture hazard.
   Painful anchylosis and rheumatic arthritis of the temporo-mandibular
   joint, tumors and fractures are common diseases of the elderly patient
   that a maxillofacial surgeon has to deal with.  Furthermore,
   preprosthetic and reconstructive surgery is often required after jaw
   resections or severe atrophy.  Due to the polypathia frequently present
   in elderly patients maxillofacial surgery requires particular
   indications, special surgical performance, and extensive postoperative
   care.  By using all possible means, a satisfaction treatment can be
   achieved even in this age patients, whose quality of life can thus be
   improved.}},

Abstract = {{For centuries the extraction of precious metals from ores by forming an
   amalgam has been a well-known metallurgical method.  However, its use

   a great importance for the production of chlorine and sodium hydroxide
   solution, as well as, for refining ultrapure metals such as 5 to 6 N
   indium and gallium.
   The toxicity, especially that of mercury compounds, is a reason for the
   search for alternative techniques replacing the use of that element.}},

Abstract = {{The heat capacities of dumortierite have been measured from 7 to 1000 K

   The corrected calorimetric entropy at 298.15 K calculated from the
   experimental data is 330.2 +/- 5.0 J/(mol.K) based upon the chemistry of
   the sample, average compositions proposed by Alexander et al. (1986),
   and correction to the structural formula given by Moore and Araki
   (1978).  Moore and Araki (1978) have shown the Al(1) site to be
   disordered, and chemical analyses suggest that there is some Al
   substitution for Si.  A minimum configurational entropy of 4.74 J/(mol .
   K) should be added to the corrected calorimetric entropy for third law
   calculations.
   The enthalpy and Gibbs free energy of formation of dumortierite from the
   elements have been estimated from synthesis and decomposition data and
   are -9109 +/- 20 and -8568 +/- 20 kJ/mol, respectively, at 298.15 K and

   report on the characteristic creep behaviour of the same type 316

   It is demonstrated that simply devised and inexpensive direct
   double-shear creep rupture tests can be used to identify the correct
   creep rupture multi-axial stress criterion appropriate to pure
   shear-dominated conditions for the steel being studied.  It is also
   shown that the introduction of this criterion into the reference stress
   method of creep analysis enables acceptable predictions of the creep
   lifetimes of thick-walled tubes under torsional stress to be made.
   In addition, a number of preliminary supporting test results on
   thick-walled tubes under internal pressure and under pure bending are
   briefly reported and the results discussed with respect to the central
   theme of the study.}},

   glass, vial-shaped on-line concentrator provides a zone for solvent
   evaporation and sample concentration.  Large volumes of HPLC eluate can
   be concentrated with the on-line concentrator and then transferred
   directly into the capillary column.  Trace levels ( < 10 ppb) of PAH
   compounds can be efficiently concentrated with the on-line concentrator

   product of this reaction.  The rate constant for the OH forming channel
   can be expressed by k1 = 1.0.10(12) exp(-91 kJ/RT) cm3 mol-1 s-1 (1470 <
   T/K < 2040).  At temperatures around 2000 K the contribution of the ``OH
   channel{''} to the total rate constant of the reaction CH3 + NO is about
   40\%.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of seismic event-order series advanced in this paper, on the
   basis of observation data analysis, achieves an effective means of
   realizing the dynamic behavior and the predictability of a seismic
   system. From analysing the observation data of RI(S) at Hunanzhen
   reservoir as an example, we found that the correlation dimension d2 and
   the order-2 Renyi entropy K2 of these seismic systems are vary from 3.2
   to 7.5 and from 0.019 to 0.052 respectively. It indicate that there are
   deterministic laws in these seismicity processes. So the seismicity
   could be predicted, but limited in a time interval which defined by K2.
   The longest predictable time in the example is up to one month. This is
   of great significance for researching seismicity laws and
   predictability.}},

   the substrate naphthyl phosphate, and the liver isoenzyme activity of AP
   was also investigated after treatment of the plasma with
   L-phenylalanine, which inhibits the AP fraction of intestinal origin
   (LPSAP). The activity measured in the presence of L-phenylalanine thus
   represents that attributable to plasma AP of liver origin. Respective
   mean activities of 47 and 41 and 78 and 72 units/liter were obtained for
   total and AP isoenzyme of liver origin in the plasma of normal and
   bilharzial patients with hepatosplenomegaly and ascitis (group III),

Abstract = {{A 52-year-old male presented himself with tachycardia crises which
   appeared first during childhood, increased in frequency without goiter
   or exophthalmos.  Cardiac and adrenergic diseases were excluded.  The
   thyroid function was normal regarding T4, free T4 and T3, TBG,
   radioiodine uptake, TSH and T3 suppressibility; however the TSH response
   to TRH was decreased.  The lymphocyte nuclear T3 receptor was found with
   an affinity close to that of normal volunteers (Ka:  1.42 x 10(10) M-1
   vs 1.95 +/- 0.35 x 10(10) M-1) and a binding capacity markedly increased
   (9.9 vs 3.7 +/- 0.4 fmol T3/100 mu-g DNA).  Pindolol was inefficient on
   the dysrhythmia which disappeared with carbimazole and relapsed after
   withdrawal of the antithyroid drug.  Under carbimazole, the plasma T4
   markedly decreased (27.7 +/- 3.6 nmol/l) but the patient remained
   euthyroid.  The clinical course and the laboratory data suggest that the
   tachycardia crises are the consequence of a hypersensitivity of the
   heart to thyroid hormones, associated with an increased number of T3
   nuclear receptor sites in lymphocytes.}},

   aged 58-95 years, were dissected.  A high correlation between severe
   degeneration of the ac-joint and rupture of the rotator cuff was found. 
   The correlation was even higher between distally pointing osteophytes
   and cuff ruptures.  The results demand to clearly define the
   degeneration of the ac-joint and the rotator cuff in patients suffering
   from shoulder pain.  A simultaneous occurance has to be considered.  If
   conservative treatment fails in patients with cuff tear and ac-joint
   degeneration, surgical revision is recommended.  This should comprise: 
   1.  suture of the cuff-ruptur 2.  excision of the coracoacromial
   ligament 3.  anterior acromioplasty according to Neer 4.  excision of
   the outer end of the clavicle}},

Abstract = {{The structure of RuCl2(Cyttp) (Cyttp = C6H5P(CH2CH2CH2P(C6H11)2)2) in
   solution is very dependent on the polarity and coordination ability of
   the solvents.  In non-polar solvents such as benzene, mer-RuCl2(Cyttp)
   and fac-RuCl2(Cyttp) are present in about equal quantity.  In
   halogenated solvents (such as dichloromethane, chloroform, CDCl2CDCl2),
   three isomers are present:  fac-RuCl2(Cyttp) (predominant),
   {[}Ru2Cl3(Cyttp)2]Cl (minor) and mer-RuCl2(Cyttp) (trace).  In other
   polar solvents such as CD3COOD and CD3NO2 the ionic dinuclear complex
   {[}Ru2Cl3(Cyttp)2]Cl is the major species along with fac-RuCl2(Cyttp). 
   In methanol, only {[}Ru2Cl3(Cyttp)2]Cl is present.  Acetonitrile
   complexes are formed when RuCl2(Cyttp) is treated with acetonitrile.

   NORTH-AMERICA}},
Journal = {{WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{1990}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{3-20}},

Abstract = {{The effects of acid deposition, excess N deposition, and elevated CO2 on
   forest soils and nutrition in North America are reviewed. While there
   remains the possibility that acid deposition and excess N deposition are
   contributing to declines in red spruce, sugar maple, and southern pines,
   clear-cut cause and effects are still not evident. Climate is clearly a
   major factor in red spruce decline in the northeastern U.S., but air
   pollution may contribute. There is some evidence that soil solution Al
   may be approaching deleterious levels in southeastern red spruce
   forests. Lack of proper management may be a major factor in the sugar
   maple and southern pine declines, but once again, air pollution as a
   potential contributor cannot be ignored. Nutrient budget analyses and
   discoveries of soils base cation depletion in certain sites suggest that
   base cation status is declining in forests of the southeastern U.S., but
   thus far, base cation deficiences are uncommon. Recent research has
   revealed that there are more cases of N-saturated forests in North
   America than was previously suspected. These systems are characterized
   by high rates of soil N mineralization, high atmospheric N inputs, low
   uptakes, or some combination of these factors. Soil leaching and Al
   mobilization in such systems is often dominated by nitrate. However, the
   geographical extent of these types of systems is limited, and the
   traditional view that most forest ecosystems are N limited remains
   valid, especially where forest management is intensive. The limited
   information available on tree response to CO2 suggests N-deficient
   plants often grow faster with elevated CO2, whereas P-deficient plants
   often do not. Research is needed to 1) determine if the differences in
   response between N- and P-deficient plants is common, 2) the responses
   of plants deficient in other nutrients to elevated CO2, and 3) the
   interactions of CO2 increase, nutrient deficiencies, climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Cefotaxime, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, and cefuroxime were tested in a
   multicenter study to establish susceptibility testing criteria and
   quality control guidelines for Neisseria gonorrhoeae.  Interpretive
   criteria were established by using triplicate testing of at least 100
   gonococcal strains having various susceptibility patterns to currently
   utilized drug regimens.  Only a susceptible category was proposed for
   cefotaxime and ceftazidime (greater-than-or-equal-to-31 mm and
   less-than-or-equal-to-0.5-mu-g/ml) because of rare resistant isolates. 
   The other interpretive criteria were cefoxitin-susceptible,
   greater-than-or-equal-to-28 mm (less-than-or-equal-to-2-mu-g/ml);
   intermediate, 24-27 mm (4-mu-g/ml), and resistant,
   less-than-or-equal-to-23 mm (greater-than-or-equal-to-8-mu-g/ml);
   cefuroxime-susceptible, greater-than-or-equal-to-31 mm
   (less-than-or-equal-to-1-mu-g/ml); moderately susceptible, 26-30 mm
   (2-mu-g/ml); and resistant, less-than-or-equal-to-25 mm
   (greater-than-or-equal-to-4-mu-g/ml).  Quality control criteria were
   established by using multiple agar lots, three disk lots, and a number
   of replicates consistent with National Committee for Clinical Laboratory

Abstract = {{Researchers have historically assumed that short food retention time is
   a typical trait of frugivorous birds, and our data support this. 
   Because absorptive efficiency is directly related to retention time and
   absorption rate, we predicted that either rates of nutrient absorption
   would be higher in frugivores than other birds to compensate for short
   retention or that absorptive efficiencies would be lower.  In the four
   passerine species that we studied, the more frugivorous species had
   higher intestinal glucose (but not proline) transport activity than the
   more insectivorous and carnivorous species and higher intestinal sucrase
   activity.  But compared with those of chickens and hummingbirds, small
   intestines of frugivorous passerines (four species) did not have high
   rates of glucose and proline uptake in vitro.  In accordance with our
   prediction, in vivo digestive efficiency of radiolabeled glucose was
   92\% in frugivorous cedar waxwings (88\% for fructose) and 73\% in
   fruit-eating American robins, less than the expected value near 100\%. 
   Digestive efficiency for sucrose was even less (62\% in cedar waxwings,
   0\% in American robins).  Thus, it appears that the anatomy and
   physiology of fruit eaters result in less than complete digestion and
   absorption of sugars.  Presumably there is some compensating advantage
   to short digesta retention that perhaps increases net rate of energy
   intake.  It may lie in the ability of frugivores to process large
   amounts of fruit per unit time in spite of the constraint gut volume
   might place on fruit intake.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluates the reproducibility of individual differences in
   behaviorally evoked cardiovascular reactivity among 39 young adult
   males.  Presented also are initial data describing idiosyncratic
   patterns of hemodynamic adjustment that may underlie pressor responses
   to laboratory stressors.  Subjects were administered three experimental
   stressors (mental arithmetic, mirror tracing, and bicycle exercise) on
   two occasions, four weeks apart.  Heart rate, blood pressure, and
   impedance-derived measurements of cardiac pre-ejection period, stroke
   index, cardiac index, and total peripheral resistance were obtained
   during baseline and task periods at each session.  To index task-induced
   ``reactivity,{''} residualized (baseline-adjusted) change scores were
   calculated for all variables; percentage change from baseline was also
   calculated for impedance-derived hemodynamic measurements.  Test-retest
   (inter-session) correlations were significant for nearly all baseline,
   task, and change-score measurements.  The few exceptions included
   diastolic blood pressure changes during mirror tracing and bicycle
   exercise and changes in stroke index and peripheral resistance during
   mental arithmetic.  Although virtually all baseline and task
   correlations exceeded .60, reactivity indices yielded consistently lower
   retest correlations (significant r's = .35-.78; median r = .49).  In
   subsequent analyses, subsets of individuals were identified whose
   reactions to mental arithmetic at the first laboratory session reflected
   changes in either cardiac output (CI reactors, n = 9) or total
   peripheral resistance (TPR reactors, n = 6), or a combination of cardiac
   and vascular influences (Mixed reactors, n = 8).  This typology of
   hemodynamic response:  (a) was corroborated by corresponding group
   differences in heart rate, pre-ejection period, and stroke index; (b)
   was reproducible on retesting; and (c) showed some generalization to the
   mirror tracing task, though not to bicycle exercise.}},

   The digestibility was influenced more by sucrose content than by
   steaming. In a poor sugar beet sample (sucrose content 534 g per kg DM)
   an increase of viscosity inducing resistance of fructose was noted with
   decreased praecaecal digestibility of disaccarides caused by steaming
   process. Between sucrose concentration and the praecaecal digestibility
   of organic matter a close biostatistical relationship was found. A

Abstract = {{Human occupational diseases orginated from Trichophyton verrucosum
   infection of cattle belonged to the most frequent zooanthroponoses since
   1960.  Morbidity peaks of this human dermatophytosis could be observed
   in 1970 and 1971 with about 740 cases of occupational diseases per year.
   The ecological properties of Tr. verrucosum (compulsory monoxenic
   parasite), the pathogenetic development of bovine dermatophytosis
   (rising immunity with subsequent elimination of the agent), systematic
   medical therapy and prophylaxis with griseofulvin and other drugs as
   well as the application of Tr. verrucosum live vaccines were the
   preconditions for a successful control of this zooanthroponosis.  Since
   then the number of human and animal diseases could be essentially
   reduced.}},

Abstract = {{Personal interviews were conducted with 116 free-living, yet frail older
   adults in an urban setting to determine their nutrition interests and
   their preferred methods of acquiring nutrition information.  Two
   nutritionists specializing in aging, one health educator, and one
   trained senior volunteer conducted interviews at respondents' homes;
   respondents were either current or potential customers of a nonprofit
   home-delivery grocery service.  The focused interviews used a pilot
   tested questionnaire designed to elicit basic program planning
   information:  1) topics of interest, 2) preferred presentation methods,
   including structure of class settings, and 3) current sources of
   nutrition information.  Analysis of the results showed that frail
   elderly people are interested in a variety of topics relating to
   nutrition and health, especially getting their money's worth in buying
   foods and nutrient retention in food preparation.  Respondents found
   written materials to be both the most interesting information
   presentation method and the most helpful information souce.  They
   identified other helpful sources of food/nutrition information as
   follows:  food package labels, television programs, cookbooks,
   physicians and home economists, dietitians and nutritionists.  Survey
   results can serve to guide effective educational strategies for older
   adults.}},

   activity.  Composition of casts vary with species.  pH increases and
   nutrients accumulate in worm-activated soils.  Based on the data on

Abstract = {{The antagonism of acetylcholine-induced contractions of guinea-pig
   gallbladder and ileum smooth muscle strips via various antagonists has
   been investigated in order to find out the muscarinic receptor
   subtype(s) of gallbladder smooth muscle.  Atropine, pirenzepine, 4-DAMP
   and AF-DX 116 were used as nonselective, M1-selective, M1- and smooth
   muscle M3-selective and cardiac M2-selective muscarinic antagonists,
   respectively.
   All the muscarinic antagonists examined displaced the
   concentration-response curves to the right parallelly in a
   concentration-dependent manner without affecting the maximum response in
   both tissues.  Schild analysis of data was consistent with competitive
   antagonism.  pA2 values of the antagonists were as follows:  a)
   gallbladder:  atropine:  8.43; pirenzepine:  7.81; 4-DAMP:  8.10; AF-DX
   116:  6.71; b) ileum:  atropine:  9.62; pirenzepine:  6.94; 4-DAMP: 
   9.41; AF-DX 116:  6.55.  It may be concluded that the muscarinic

Abstract = {{In a series of thermal loading tests at the HDR reactor pressure vessel
   - thermal stratification, cyclic thermal shock and pressurized thermal
   shock - the methods applied in safety analysis had to become qualified
   by a continuous intercomparison of calculated results and experimental
   data.  Above all the complex boundary conditions of the HDR-tests offer
   a close approximation to the original components, so that they provide a
   real assessment of the transferability.
   The results of the thermal mixing tests indicated that during cold water
   inflow into the RPV longitudinal strains build up in the cylindrical
   wall which dominate over that in circumferential direction.
   During the cyclic thermal fatigue tests incipient crack formation in the
   cladding as well as the behaviour of crack propagations in the cladding
   and in the base material was analyzed.
   In the pressurized thermal shock tests, the nozzle region and the
   cyclinder wall in the incipient crack condition were loaded by long
   cooling streaks.  Even in the aggravated loading condition as the result
   of a routed cold water streak no remarkable indications of crack growth
   were noticed.
   In both cases, cyclic and pressurized thermal shock loading, the
   expected crack propagation was overpredicted by the fracture mechanical
   methods used.
   The non-destructive examination methods used were able to locate all of
   the cracks but they mostly overpredicted the actual crack depth.}},

Abstract = {{Progress in the inhibition of corrosion by organic ligands and complex
   compounds is considered.  It was shown to be possible to retard both
   general and localized corrosion of different metals by inhibitors of
   this type.  In considering the action of ligands themselves, emphasis is
   placed on the importance of their chemical structure as expressed
   through electronic and hydrophobic characteristics.  Examples are given
   for inhibition of corrosion which are difficult to explain solely by
   competitive adsorption of solution components, but can be understood in
   terms of nucleophilic substitution of ligands in a surface complex. 
   Attention is drawn to other reactions leading to change in pH of the
   near-electrode layer, formation of sparingly soluble deposits, and so
   on.  The role of the nature of the complexing agents and its
   quantitative aspects are discussed with regard to the use of complex
   compounds of metals as inhibitors.}},

Abstract = {{For the prevention of corrosion and scale formation in recirculating
   water supplies, oxyethylidenediphosphoric acid (OEDP) {[}1, 2] and its
   zinc complex (ZnOEDP) {[}3-6] have been widely used.  OEDP has good
   anti-scale properties; however, it offers only weak protection of
   low-carbon steels from corrosion {[}7].  Moreover, its solutions are
   unstable in media where the calcium hardness H(Ca)2+ is greater than or
   equal to 2 mg-equiv/liter, due to the possibility of precipitating it as
   sparingly soluble complexes with Ca2+ {[}8].  The use of its zinc
   complex, which provides better protection than OEDP {[}4], substantially
   increases the solution stability, up to at least H(Ca)2+ = 6
   mg-equiv/liter {[}8].  Nowadays, however, when ecological requirements
   and water shortages are more widespread, the conversion of cooling
   systems to operation without blowdowns must be anticipated.  This
   naturally causes still greater cooling water hardness levels, and the
   use of zinc complexes can prove to be economically undesirable,
   particularly in weakly alkaline solutions.  In connection with this, we
   have developed a new, more effective corrosion inhibitor based on OEDP
   with stabilizing additives, IFKhAN-36.}},

   vitro, by means of total cell protein determination, on mouse B16
   melanoma and, for comparison, on human KB carcinoma cell lines.  Four
   compounds out of 22 revealed promising cytostatic activity for both cell
   lines, being nearly equipotent with dopa.  Those compounds which most
   effectively suppressed the growth of both tumour cell lines were the
   same as those which had a significant influence on tyrosinase activity
   regardless of whether they acted as inhibitors or substrates.}},

Abstract = {{In order to understand the modifications of the chromatographic profile
   of Aroclor 1260 upon gamma irradiation, a total of 14 pure
   polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners were separately irradiated in
   solution.  Dechlorination was observed, and the generated products were
   investigated by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry.  Degradation
   proceeds more rapidly in methanol/water mixture than in petroleum ether,
   but the relative amount of ortho-dechlorinated congeners formed upon
   irradiation was smaller in the former solvent.  Ortho chlorines are
   preferentially lost in petroleum ether except when they are involved in
   a 2,5 (or 3,6) substitution pattern, in which case para dechlorination
   becomes predominant.  The precursors of some toxicologically important
   congeners such as congeners 77, 118, 167, and 189 have been identified. 
   These data are useful to rationalize the modifications of the
   chromatographic profile of PCB complex mixture upon gamma irradiation.}},

Journal = {{INTERCIENCIA}},

Abstract = {{Although ecosystem terminology has been used very broadly, the analysis
   of ecosystems has focussed consistently on units of the environment that
   are functionally integrated, as shown by (1) internal reciprocity of
   mass flux for critical nutrients (mainly N and P), and (2) processing of
   organic carbon by organisms that are physically intermingled to such an
   extent that they regulate each others' abundances. The Orinoco basin
   shows continuity in mass balance but does not show the intimate
   functional integration of a single ecosystem. The Orinoco basin is an
   ecosystem complex consisting of two components (1) ecosystem cluster,
   and (2) transpor pathways; these two components can be distinguished by
   the ratio of internal flux to boundary flux: transport pathways show a
   ratio of less than 1.0, and ecosystems show a ratio greater than 1.0.
   The Orinoco complex consists of five major parts, including three
   transport pathways (the atmosphere, the geosphere, and the river itself,
   and two ecosystem clusters (terrestrial cluster and floodplain cluster).
   Each ecosystem cluster is made up of several distinct groups of
   ecosystems. The moist forest of the Guayana Shield shows a very high
   ratio of internal flux to boundary flux for organic carbon, phosphorus,
   and nitrogen. However, the absolute yields of phosphorus and nitrogen
   and the concentrations of inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen demonstrate
   failure of these ecosystems to retain potentially limiting nutrients any
   more efficiently than ecosystems of much lower productivity at higher
   latitudes. Watershed studies show that plains watersheds without montane
   headwaters have the lowest boundary fluxes of phosphorus and fixed
   nitrogen. Watersheds with montane headwaters have the highest boundary
   fluxes for phosphorus, and the watersheds of the Guayana Shield are
   intermediate. Flooplains ecosystems fall into three groups: (1) fringing
   floodplain, (2) internal deltaic floodplain, and (3) coastal deltaic
   floodplain. Only the fringing floodplain has yet been studied in detail
   with respect to mass balance. For the fringing floodplain as a whole,
   the net boundary fluxes for nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon, are near
   zero, indicating very high internal processing capability. During
   inundation, the ratio of internal to boundary fluxes briefly goes below
   1.0. Ecosystems that temporarily cross this boundary can be classified
   as disturbed. For the fringing floodplain, the disturbance is annual and
   is accompanied by homogenization of many of the chemical and biological
   features of floodplain ecosystems in a given reach of the river. From
   the initial conditions, which may be termed a disturbance setpoint,
   adjacent ecosystems diverge along different trajectories determined by
   local physical conditions. The setpoint itself shows a spatial gradient
   because of trends in water chemistry and suspended solids from one end
   of the Orinoco main stem to another. Thus the characteristics of
   specific ecosystems along the floodplain can be explained in terms of
   the setpoint and the successional divergence of ecosystems from a given
   setpoint. Further study of the Orinoco River should include
   quantification of mass flux of organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus
   for representatives of each one of the ecosystem groups in the Orinoco
   ecosystem complex.}},

Abstract = {{The X-pinch is an attractive concept because it can concentrate X-ray
   emission to a small region near the intersection of two or more wires.
   In this experiment we tested several titanium alloy wire configurations
   on BLACKJACK 5, including the two-wire X-pinch, the six-wire X-pinch,
   single wires, and an array of six parallel wires.  K-shell X-ray
   emission mostly originated from a 2 to 3 mm region with the two-wire
   X-pinch, and a 4 to 6 mm region with the six-wire X-pinch.  K-shell
   yields obtained with the six-wire X-pinch of optimal wire diameter (340
   J) were competitive with those produced by the single wire (400 J) and
   the wire array (300 J), and double the best achieved with the two-wire
   X-pinch.  Linear yield densities (brightnesses) with the six-wire
   X-pinch, approximately 700 J/cm, exceeded those of single wire and wire
   array loads of the same 3 cm discharge length by factors of five or
   more.}},

Abstract = {{The airways of the guinea pig are richly innervated by
   peptide-containing nerve fibers.  Among the most abundant neuropeptides
   are calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP), which
   are stored in nerve fibers located predominantly within and beneath the
   epithelium, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), which is located in
   fibers running mainly among smooth muscle bundles and seromucous glands.
   Sensory denervation (capsaicin treatment)  of adult guinea pigs caused
   an almost total disappearance of CGRP- and SP-containing nerve fibers,
   while the density of VIP-containing nerve fibers located in smooth
   muscle seemed to increase.  In the isolated trachea, perfused luminally,
   CGRP was found to appear in the intraluminal fluid after exposure to
   capsaicin but not after electrical vagal stimulation.  CGRP
   concentrations in the tracheal wall did not change significantly.
   Luminally applied CGRP did not affect smooth muscle tension, measured as
   intraluminal volume changes.}},

   days.  Even after marked dilatations, a parenchymal reduction could not

Abstract = {{Because blood specimens from newborns reflect the antibody status of the
   mother, seroprevalence rates among childbearing women are obtainable
   from analysis of the specimens.  A blinded survey of human
   immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody seroprevalence among childbearing
   women was conducted in Maryland.  The survey used 31,273 dried filter
   paper blood spot specimens obtained from newborns screened for
   hereditary disorders.
   Overall, 99 specimens were positive on two enzyme-linked immunoassays
   and on Western blot, providing a seroprevalence rate of 0.32 percent. 
   The rate for childbearing women residing within the City of Baltimore,
   0.7 percent, was significantly higher than the rate for those residing
   elsewhere in Maryland, 0.1 percent.  The statewide rate for nonwhite
   women, 0.8 percent, was higher than for white women, 0.007 percent.  No
   statistically significant associations were found with residence in an
   inner city area, as opposed to residence in other areas of the city;
   birth weight group; reported health of the infant; or the infant having
   received a transfusion.}},

Journal = {{EVOLUTION}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the process of colonization of North and South America by
   the species Drosophila subobscura has been studied by analyzing the
   variability of lethal genes. The genetic structures of a Palearctic
   natural central population (Bordils, Spain) and a colonizer population
   from America (Gilroy, California) have been compared. The frequencies of
   lethal chromosomes and their allelism are 29.007\% and 0.0069 in the
   first population and 14.414\% and 0.0526 in the American population. A
   founder effect is detected after the computation of some population
   parameters (N(e), h, he and the lethal load). Furthermore, the allelism
   of lethal chromosomes has revealed a strong association between a lethal
   gene and the O5 inversion both in Gilroy and in the population of Puerto
   Montt (Chile). The interpopulation allelism shows that the O5
   arrangement from the USA and Chile is the same, confirming that the
   colonizing processes of North and South America are correlated. The O5
   arrangement can also be useful as a genetic marker to trace the origin
   of the colonization. The frequency of the O5 arrangement in the original
   population of the colonization could be used to estimate the number of
   colonizers. This population is still unknown, but taking the extreme
   values of the frequency of the O5 inversion in natural Palearctic
   populations (1-15\%), the number of colonizers could vary between 9 and
   149 individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Adsorption of catalase from contact buffer solutions (0.1 M phosphate
   buffer with pH 6.6) on MIFIL polyamide film membranes with a 0.3-mu-m
   pore diameter and on polystyrene test tubes (for comparison) was
   investigated at different temperatures from 20 to 36-degrees-C.  Three
   methods were used for the quantitative characterization of adsorption of
   catalase:  spectral monitoring of the decrease in the catalase in the
   contact solution, kinetic monitoring of the decreasing amounts of
   catalase in the buffer based on the peroxidase activity of the enzyme in
   oxidation of o-dianisidine by cumyl hydroperoxide, and determination of
   the catalase activity of the adsorbed enzyme in disproportionation of
   hydrogen peroxide.  The maximum concentrations of adsorbed protein and
   the dissociation constants of catalase complexes with the polyamide
   sorbent were determined from the Langmuir isotherms at 20-36-degrees-C. 
   Catalase retains 11.2 and 4.5\% of the catalase activity characteristic
   of the enzyme with a preserved quaternary structure in adsorption on
   polyamide membranes and polystyrene test tubes, respectively.  The
   possible role of two opposite factors in the loss of the activity of the
   enzyme during its adsorption was discussed:  association of protein and
   its partial dissociation into subunits.}},

Abstract = {{Human galactosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.38), a potential tumor marker, was
   isolated from ascites fluid of ovarian cancer patients by three methods,
   using various affinity sorbents.  The highest degree of purification was
   achieved in chromatography on monoclonal antibodies against
   galactosyltransferase, immobilized on agarose.  The physicochemical
   properties of the preparations purified by various methods were
   compared.  It was shown that the enzyme purified on an immunosorbent
   practically does not differ in molecular weight and isospectrum from the
   rest of the preparations, which is evidence that the antigenic epitope
   recognized by this monoclonal antibody on the galactosyltransferase
   molecule is common to all isoforms of this enzyme.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the present study was to determine whether or not
   abnormalities in glycogen utilization occur in the working skeletal
   muscles of rats with a myocardial infarction (MI) and chronic heart
   failure (CHF). Accordingly, glycogen concentrations were measured at
   rest and following 45 min of submaximal swimming in noninfarcted (SHAM)
   and MI rats. The tissues examined included the liver and the vastus
   intermedius, plantaris, soleus and the white portions of the
   gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles of the rat's hindlimb.
   Results were analyzed by a two-way analysis of variance and demonstrated
   that the exercise protocol produced a significant amount of glycogen
   depletion in the liver and the vastus intermedius and plantaris muscles
   of the SHAM and MI groups of rats. Although the amount of glycogen
   utilized in the liver was similar between the SHAM and MI groups of
   rats, the amount of glycogen utilized in the vastus intermedius and
   plantaris muscle was significantly greater for the MI group of rats when
   compared to their SHAM counterparts. The results suggest that the
   glycogen depletion abnormalities found in the working muscles of the MI
   rat with CHF are related to accelerated rates of glycogen breakdown and
   utilization. Furthermore, the results also support the contention that
   these glycogen depletion abnormalities are primarily located in muscles
   that are primarily oxidative in nature. The mechanisms responsible for
   these abnormalities in skeletal muscle glycogen utilization during
   exercise in the MI rat with CHF have yet to be determined.}},

   primarily as tools to achieve learning objectives.  The introduction of
   alternatives in education requires an appreciation of both the learning
   objectives of these animal experiments and the possibilities and
   limitations of alternatives.  In the Netherlands, a government-funded
   project is in progress, with the aim of developing the use of
   alternatives to animal experiments in education.  The numbers of animals
   used for educational purposes was reduced by 40\% in the period
   1978-1988.

Abstract = {{The effects of dilevalol on vascular adrenoceptors were investigated
   using helical strips of cat arteries.  In coronary arteries partially
   pre-contracted with prostaglandin F2-alpha (PGF2-alpha), the
   concentration-relaxant response curves for isoproterenol were shifted to
   the right by dilevalol with a potency similar to that of propranolol,
   although dilevalol itself did not relax the arteries.  Contractions
   induced by norepinephrine of mesenteric arteries were attenuated by low
   concentrations of prazosin but were not influenced by yohimbine of up to
   10(-8) M.  In contrast, the norepinephrine-induced contractions of
   middle cerebral arteries were attenuated by yohimbine but only slightly
   attenuated by prazosin.  With mesenteric arteries, treatment with
   dilevalol (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) attenuated the contractions induced by
   norepinephrine and phenylephrine in a concentration-dependent manner. On
   the other hand, contractions induced by norepinephrine and clonidine in
   middle cerebral arteries were not attenuated by treatment with dilevalol
   of up to 10(-6) M.  Treatment with low concentrations of dilevalol
   (10(-8) to 10(-7) M) potentiated the contractile response to the
   electrical stimulation of adrenergic nerves in mesenteric arteries while
   high concentrations (3 x 10(-7) to 10(-5) M) attenuated it.  The
   potentiation was reversed to attenuation by pretreatment with
   propranolol.  Treatment with isoproterenol (10(-10) to 10(-9) M) also
   potentiated the contractile response to the electrical stimulation in
   the arteries.  Isoproterenol did not cause any relaxation of mesenteric
   arteries precontracted with PGF2-alpha.  Attenuations by clonidine of
   the response to the electrical stimulation in the arteries did not
   significantly differ in control arteries and those treated with a high
   concentration (10(-6) M) of dilevalol.  These results suggest that o
   dilevalol has a potent beta-receptor blocking activity, weak
   alpha-1-blocking activity and BETA-agonistic activity but has no effect
   on the alpha-2-adrenoceptor. The potentiating effect of dilevalol on the
   contractile response to the adrenergic nerve stimulation seems to occur
   only in arteries which do not relax with BETA-agonist.}},

Abstract = {{A simple model of an unreliable communications network is a
   probabilistic graph in which each edge has some independent probability
   of being operational.  The Network Broadcast Facility location problem
   is to identify a node for which the expected number of nodes connected
   to it in the presence of random edge failures is as large as possible.
   This problem is, in fact, a special case of stochastic 1-median problem.
   In this paper both problems are shown to be NP-hard.  In light of this
   apparent intractability, a location strategy based on efficiently
   computable two-terminal reliability bounds is suggested.  This location
   strategy does not guarantee to find the best location but instead limits
   the choice to a subset of the nodes which contain the most resilient
   nodes of the network.  The success of this approach depends on obtaining
   sufficiently tight reliability bounds.  Edge-packing methods for
   computing upper and lower two-terminal bounds, as well as global methods
   for tightening these bounds are discussed.  We illustrate the location
   strategy using an example network with 59 nodes and 71 edges.  We
   conclude from this example that the location strategy shows promise as a
   filtering scheme for screening potential locations.}},

   while that of the other increased.  The locking curve was asymmetric and
   a stable and an unstable locking regions existed.  From the theoretical
   analysis, it was found that the phase delay with which the electric
   field emitted from each laser to the other laser significantly
   influences the locking characteristics.  The increase and decrease of
   the locked output power are caused by the phase delay.  It is also shown
   that the laser which receives the larger optical injection behaves like
   a slave laser and the laser which has less optical injection behaves
   like a master laser, and the shape of the locking curve is determined by
   the balance between the alpha parameter and the thermal resistance.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that there is present in hemolyzed serum a factor that
   interferes with the radioimmunoassay for detection of skeletal muscle
   carbonic anhydrase III (CA-III) in serum. This inhibitory factor
   cross-reacts with muscle anti-CA-III antibody and its level increases in
   parallel with the degree of hemolysis. In order to identify this factor,
   we purified the factor from a hemolysate of human erythrocytes,
   characterized it, compared it with known carbonic anhydrase isozymes
   from erythrocytes and with CA-III from skeletal muscle. We concluded
   that the factor was biochemically and immunochemically identical to
   CA-III from skeletal muscle. Calculation indicated the factor to
   represent about 1\% of the total enzymes in human erythrocytes.}},

Abstract = {{The major part of the proliferative response in primary mixed lymphocyte
   cultures (MLC) is caused by HLA-DRBl incompatibilities.  In DRBl-matched
   pairs the proliferation induced by HLA-DRB3, -DQ and -DP mismatches may
   be unmasked.  In most previous studies the influence of HLA-DP
   incompatibilities in primary MLC has been investigated in homozygous
   typing cells representing only a few Dw specifities.  We were interested
   in determining the stimulatory capacity of isolated HLA-DP mismatches,
   ascertained by RFLP analysis, in primary MLC in HLA-A, -B, -DR and -DQ
   compatible, unrelated heterozygous individuals of many different Dw
   specificities.  Thirty-eight MLCs performed with cells from related
   pairs and 67 with cells from unrelated pairs were evaluated.  All but
   nine of the MLCs were analyzed in both directions, giving a total of 201
   investigated reactions.  The relative responses (RR) in the three MLCs
   performed between DP incompatible, related pairs were all positive (RR
   greater-than-or-equal-to 8\%).  Eighty of 82 MLCs performed with cells
   from DP incompatible, unrelated individuals were positive, whereas 37 of
   46 MLCs between DP compatible, unrelated pairs were negative (RR < 8\%)
   (p < 10(-10).  The magnitude of the RR was influenced by the number of
   DP mismatches.  Thus, the mean RR was approximately twice as high in
   MLCs in which responder and stimulator cells differed by two DP antigens
   (mean RR 60.5\%) compared with reactions with only one DP mismatch (mean
   RR 35.4\%) (p < 10(-3)).  RFLP-defined HLA-DP incompatibilities predict
   a positive primary MLC in HLA-A, -B, -DR and -DQ matched individuals
   with a high degree of accuracy (98\%).  We suggest that in the search
   for matched unrelated bone marrow donors HLA-DP typing might preferably
   precede and in many instances even replace MLC.  This may well
   facilitate the search for compatible unrelated donors by reducing the
   number of MLCs.}},

Year = {{1990}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{In membranes of rat striatum, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a
   potent activator of Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase, enhanced
   adenylate cyclase activity by counteracting the inhibition elicited by
   GTP.  Exposure to pertussis toxin caused a similar alteration of the
   GTP-regulation of the enzyme activity and largely prevented the PMA
   effects.  PMA treatment increased by threefold the GTP-dependence of the
   enzyme stimulation by dopamine.  The hydrolysis of but did not affect
   the GTP-dependence of the enzyme stimulation by dopamine.  The
   hydrolysis of GTP by membrane-bound high affinity GTPase was
   significantly inhibited by PMA (IC 50 10 nM) in a Ca2+-dependent manner.
   Like PMA, phorbol 12, 13-dibutyrate inhibited the GTPase activity,
   whereas the biologically inactive 4-beta phorbol 13-acetate and 4-beta
   phorbol were without effect.  These results suggest that activation of
   Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase by PMA stimulates adenylate
   cyclase activity by impairing the activity of the GTP-dependent
   inhibitory protein, possibly through a reduction of the GTP-GDP
   exchange.}},

Abstract = {{The molecular cluster model approach for the description of processes at
   surfaces is presented.  It involves using finite clusters that contain
   surface atoms interacting with atomic or molecular adsorbates.  Accurate
   ab initio wave functions can be obtained for the clusters, and, thus,
   this makes it possible to describe the bonding in terms that are
   familiar for molecular systems.  The adsorbate-substrate interaction can
   be analyzed by new techniques developed to characterize the bonding as
   covalent or ionic.  This is shown for F on Ag(111) and O and CO on
   Cu(100) systems.  The measures of adsorbate ionicity are (a) the
   expectation value of a projection operator giving an indication of the
   number of electrons associated with the adsorbate, (b) the analysis of
   the dipole moment curve as function of the distance, and (c) the effect
   of an external electric field on the adsorbate geometry.  The
   consequences of ionic adsorbates on metal surfaces is discussed for two
   selected topics:  adsorption of thiocyanate on Ag electrodes and
   coadsorption of CO with ionic species.}},

Abstract = {{Personal exposure levels to respirable suspended particulates during
   cooking periods were monitored in twenty households in a rural community
   of the hill region of Nepal.  Filters for gravimetric analysis were
   exposed in households with traditional stoves (without flue) and then
   again after the introduction of smokeless (with flue) cook stoves. 
   Drager Tube analyses of carbon monoxide and formaldehyde levels were
   also conducted.  Data from this longitudinal study provide convincing
   evidence of the cause-effect relationship between the introduction and
   use of smokeless stoves and the resulting decrease in domestic smoke
   pollution.
   A household survey revealed that all cooks, but one, found that the
   smokeless stove emitted less smoke than the traditional stove and
   seventy-five percent of the cooks preferred the smokeless stove to the
   traditional stove.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of three macrolides (azithromycin, roxithromycin and
   erythromycin) on the interaction in vitro of human polymorphonuclear
   leukocytes (PMNs) with Staphylococcus aureus was examined.  The exposure
   of S. aureus to 0.25 MIC of roxithromycin and erythromycin but not of
   azithromycin significantly increased the uptake of opsonized bacteria by
   human PMNs.  The preincubation of PMNs with 1, 10 and 25 mg/l of three
   antimicrobial agents did not affect either the uptake of S. aureus or
   the superoxide radical production by human PMNs.  At these same
   concentrations the three agents showed slight but not significant
   intracellular activity in PMNs against S. aureus.  It is concluded that
   treatment of S. aureus with subinhibitory concentrations of
   roxithromycin and erythromycin enhanced phagocytosis by PMNs, but the
   three macrolides tested did not directly affect the functions of human
   PMNs against S. aureus.}},

Abstract = {{Most Canadian soils contain dissolved salts and are subject to freezing.
   However, the structural consequences of freezing in the presence of
   solutes are unknown.  The effects of ice segregation and solutes on soil
   structural stability were investigated in a laboratory experiment.  Nine
   27-cm-diameter by 19-cm-high columns were used.  These were packed with
   air-dry Conestogo silt loam soil (Gleyed Melanic Brunisol or Aquic
   Eutrochrept) and wetted with CaCl2 solutions at 1, 2, and 4 g L-1.  Slow
   freezing took place from the top down in an environmental chamber
   maintained at -3.4 +/- 0.4-degrees-C.  Depth of frost penetration,
   temperature, frost heave, and unfrozen water content were monitored
   within each column.  After 20 d, the mean frost penetration was 107 +/-
   18 mm and the soil surface had heaved 9 +/- 4 mm, indicating ice
   segregation.  At the end of the experiment, the frozen and unfrozen
   zones of each column were sampled destructively.  Samples were
   equilibrated at 4-degrees-C and analyzed for wet-aggregate stability
   (WAS), dispersible clay (DC), gravimetric water content, and CaCl2
   concentration.  Samples which had been frozen had significantly more
   water and CaCl2 in the thawed state than those which had remained
   unfrozen.  These increases were attributed to a freezing-induced
   redistribution of the saturating solutions.  DC decreased with
   increasing CaCl2 concentration, indicating an electrical double-layer
   effect.  Soil that had been frozen and thawed had a more stable
   structure (in terms of both DC and WAS) than the unfrozen soil.  No
   interaction was found between solutes and freezing.  In contrast, there
   was a significant interaction between water content and freezing. WAS
   increased with decreasing water content for those aggregates which had
   been frozen and thawed, but not for those which had remained unfrozen.}},

Abstract = {{Typical x-ray flux measurement methods (diodes, thermopiles, sensitized
   photographic film, photoresist, etc.) yield questionable accuracy and
   poor precision.  A commercially available nylon-based radiochromic film,
   developed for monitoring dose during radiation processing of food
   products, was used to calibrate and characterize a high brightness
   (10(6)-10(7) W/srad), pulsed, laser plasma, soft x-ray source.  The
   response of this film can be calibrated using NIST radiation standards,
   has negligible x-ray wavelength and environmental dependence, and is
   doserate insensitive over a large range.  The change in optical density
   (DELTA-OD) of exposed film is directly proportional to the incident
   dose.  Excellent agreement was observed for film response to both
   broadband soft x rays
   (0.6-lesser-than-or-equal-to-lambda-lesser-than-or-equal-to-2.2 nm) and
   20 keV electrons.  An incident dose of 100 mJ/cm2 resulted in a DELTA-OD
   of 1.00 with a measurement precision of +/- 2\%, with no evidence of
   saturation found up to 120 mJ/cm2.  The laser plasma source demonstrated
   flux stability of better than 5\% over a five-month period.  Dosimetry
   film was also used to measure illumination uniformity, measure soft
   x-ray transmission through various materials, and calibrate an on-board
   miniature x-ray diode for dose integration.}},

Abstract = {{Sixteen children with severe juvenile chronic arthritis received high

   improved to some degree in 6 of ten patients.  A decrease in the number
   of active joints occurred in 7 patients of the 11 who received more than
   ten months of IVGG.  Hemoglobin levels increased, the ESR and platelet
   counts decreased and the IgG levels diminished in most of the patients
   who received long term treatment.  The treatment was totally ineffective
   in three children who had very severe disease.  Two children had

Abstract = {{The delta-C-13 and delta-N-15of the soft tissues of two calyptogena
   phaseoliformis specimens sampled from the floor of Ascension Fan-Valley,
   off the Monterey Peninsula, California, ranged from -35.0 to -33.6 parts
   per thousands, respectively.  The carbon isotope abundances are similar
   to those of other Calyptogena known or believed to be nutritionally
   dependent on sulfide-based chemoautotrophic symbionts.  Calyptogena
   delta-15N values and their geographic variation indicate an unusual
   source of dietary nitrogen for these animals.  The delta-C-13 and
   delta-O-18 values for Calyptogena shells from the Ascension and Monterey
   Fan-Valleys approximate those reported for Calyptogena from three other
   locations in the Pacific and appear to reflect shell formation from
   constituents within ambient deep-ocean water.}},

   risk factor for women who have low birth weight infants and infants who
   die during the neonatal period.  Postpartum interviews with 1,484
   primarily low-income women were conducted during 1987-88 in three areas
   of Missouri with the highest rates of inadequate prenatal care.  The
   purpose of the study was to identify barriers to prenatal care and to
   determine which barriers differentiated between women receiving adequate
   and those receiving inadequate prenatal care.
   Women who received inadequate prenatal care were more likely to be
   black, unmarried, higher parity, and have less education than those who
   received adequate care.  These women were also more likely to be poor,
   Medicaid-eligible, to have had an unwanted pregnancy, more stress and
   problems during pregnancy, and less social support.  In the multivariate
   analysis, race and marital status lost their importance.  The strongest
   predictor of inadequate prenatal care was women not knowing that they
   were pregnant in the first 4 months of pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio
   9.28).  To improve the rate of adequate prenatal care, society must
   address the issues of poverty and wantedness of pregnancy.}},

Abstract = {{Tannic acid stimulated the iodination (incorporation of radioactive
   iodine into an acid-insoluble fraction) of human peripheral blood
   polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) and human promyelocytic leukemic HL-60
   cells, without affecting the iodination of 9 other cultured cell lines.
   The stimulation of both PMN and HL-60 cells depended on incubation time
   and temperature, and was significantly suppressed by myeloperoxidase
   inhibitors. Among chemically defined natural polyphenols, condensed
   tannins (epicatechin gallate oligomers) and monomeric and oligomeric
   hydrolyzable tannins potently stimulated PMN iodination, whereas
   polyphenols of lower molecular weight (gallic acid, alkyl gallates,
   epicatechin, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, caffeic acid
   derivatives and licorice flavonoids) had much less activity. Various
   synthetic polyphenolic compounds structurally unrelated to tannins also
   stimulated PMN iodination depending upon their molecular weight, but to
   a slightly lesser extent. The results suggest that the stimulation
   activity of tannins and related polyphenols might depend more on their
   molecular weights than the number of hydroxyl groups on each benzene
   ring in the molecule, or the presence of sugars or hexahydroxydiphenoyl
   groups.}},

Abstract = {{We have experienced two cases of Graves' disease with antithyroid
   hormone autoantibodies (Case 1:  anti-T4; Case 2:  anti-T3) who finally
   underwent subtotal thyroidectomy after antithyroid drug treatment. 
   Using serial sera obtained before and after operation, the correlation
   between titers of antithyroglobulin (anti-Tg) and anti-T4 or anti-T3
   autoantibodies was examined in each case.  There was a significant
   positive correlation between titers of anti-T4 (Case 1, r = 0.90, p <
   0.05), or anti-T3 (Case 2, r = 0.64, p < 0.01) and anti-Tg antibodies. 
   Using the homogenate of the thyroid tissue, it was found that the sole
   iodoprotein in the thyroid gland in each patient was 660 KDa Tg.  In
   addition, Tg purified from the thyroid gland from Case 2 showed
   different immunological activity with normal Tg in two out of four
   murine monoclonal anti-Tg antibodies tested.  On the other hand, Tg from
   Case 1 had identical immunological activity with normal Tg in every four
   monoclonal antibodies.  These results are consistent with the view that
   the antigen responsible for the development of antithyroid hormone
   autoantibodies is Tg, at least in our two cases.  The reason for the
   persistence of anti-T3 autoantibodies in Case 2, despite the subtotal
   thyroidectomy, could be due to some unidentified structural
   abnormalities of Tg which was detected only by the monoclonal anti-Tg
   antibodies.}},

Abstract = {{The method currently used to record topographical voltage distributions
   of visual evoked potentials is that of monopolar recording with respect
   to some arbitrary reference electrode.  As an alternative we
   investigated the method of bipolar topographical recording of the
   checkerboard reversal evoked potential in four amblyopic patients and
   ten normal persons.  The recordings were performed with a system of 14
   bipolar channels, arranged in a rectangular grid with an interelectrode
   distance of 15\% of the inion-nasion distance and centered 3 cm above
   the inion.
   The gradient distributions of the visual evoked potential obtained from
   normal persons showed at the time of component P2 a maximum about 3 cm
   above the inion.  The healthy eyes of the amblyopic patients showed
   similar distributions and latencies.  The amblyopic eyes showed normal
   or reduced amplitudes and normal or increased latencies with large
   checks and low amplitudes with smaller checks.  The topographical
   distributions recorded with the bipolar recording system showed shifts
   of the maxima with the larger patterns in three of four amblyopic eyes. 
   A technical comparison showed that these shifts can be recorded by the
   bipolar recording method with higher accuracy than with the monopolar
   method, promising a better understanding and more accurate diagnosis of
   amblyopia.}},

Abstract = {{During the synthesis of fatty acids and their utilization in plastids,
   fatty acyl moieties are linked to acyl carrier protein (ACP).  In
   contrast to previously cloned organ-specific ACP isoforms, we have now
   isolated a cDNA clone for a potentially constitutive ACP isoform from a
   spinach root library.  Identity between the amino acid sequence encoded
   by this cDNA and N-terminal sequence data from ACP-II protein from
   spinach leaf indicates that the root cDNA encodes ACP-II.  The deduced
   amino acid sequence for ACP-II shows 62\% identity with spinach leaf
   ACP-I.  Southern analysis suggests that multiple ACP genes or
   pseudogenes occur in the spinach genome.  High-stringency northern blot
   analysis and RNase protection studied confirm that, within the region
   encoding the mature ACP-II, the cloned ACP sequence is expressed in
   leaves and seeds as well as in roots.  Quantitative RNase protection
   data indicate that the ratio of ACP-I and ACP-II mRNA sequences in leaf
   is similar to the ration of the two proteins.}},

Abstract = {{The level of mRNAs for the c-myc protooncogene and the serum proteins
   alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and albumin in liver, visceral yolk sac and gut
   between day 9 and day 19 of mouse gestation was studied by in situ
   hybridization employing single-stranded RNA probes.  In the
   prehepatocyte population, c-myc was coexpressed with albumin and AFP. 
   No heterogeneity was noted within this cell population with respect to
   the expression of these mRNAs up to day 15.  AFP expression was high in
   the liver primordium and rose further until day 15.  Albumin mRNA was
   expressed weakly but distinctly in the hepatic bud and increased
   throughout fetal life.  C-myc expression in prehepatocytes exhibited a
   maximum around day 13 and a dramatic decline after day 15, but was much
   lower in other cell types of the fetal liver.  In the visceral yolk sac,
   AFP was strongly expressed, with albumin expression first becoming
   detectable at day 13, while c-myc mRNA was detected up to day 9.  In the
   endodermal gut epithelium, c-myc expression was high, albumin mRNA was
   not detected and AFP message was restricted to individual loops of the
   gut.  These results suggest that a period of high c-myc expression in
   the developing liver may allow rapid expansion of the prehepatocyte
   population at a specific stage of differentiation.}},

   The experiments showed that the function of the sinoartrial (SA) node
   and the passage of the cardiac impulse are not impaired by shockwave
   generation.  During the exposure of the pacemaker, however, an
   inhibition of impulse could be shown consistently.  Mechanical damage to
   the pacemaker did not occur.  As a consequence, pacemaker modulation by

   optimal controls are found by either maximizing or minimizing a modified
   Hamiltonian.  The starting extremum operation and the switching
   conditions from one extremum operation to the other are determined.  The
   solution is computed by interation on the two constant adjoint
   variables.  The solution convergence, however, is sensitive to these
   parameters.  A method based on the characteristics of the heading
   adjoint variable is used to reduce this sensitivity.  A roll angle
   chattering solution, which occurs during the minimum power energy loss
   segment of the trajectory and causes computational problems, is removed
   by including penalty on the roll angle magnitude in the performance
   criterion.  A number of specific problems are then solved.}},

Abstract = {{Formal analysis of self-reproducing systems allows to consider joint
   properties of chemical autocatalythic systems, biological populations,
   ecosystems, technical, social, and cultural systems.  Potential
   self-reproducing system can be defined using Petri net language as a
   non-empty subset Q of positions with a sequence of internal transitions,
   in which at least one initial and one final position belongs to Q, and
   it increases the number of objects in all positions of subset Q. 
   Minimal potential self-reproducing systems consist of one or several
   interconnected transition cycles.  Real self-reproducing system can be
   defined on the basis of its stable existence at constant efflux of its
   components.  It is simultaneously a potential self-reproducing system. 
   At certain conditions, any potential self-reproducing system may become
   real.  One can introduce a trophic structure similar to that in
   ecosystems in any Petri net.  Abstract population is a minimal unit of
   trophic structure.  It is a potentially self-reproducing system. 
   Abstract populations can be divided into autotrophic and heterotrophic,
   and the latter, into phagotrophic and saprotrophic ones.}},

Abstract = {{The aluminum concentration and Ryzanar Index increased and the pH
   decreased in a small Appalachian water supply reservoir following acid
   precipitation runoff episodes. Concomitant increases in tapwater
   aluminum and decreases in tapwater pH were also observed at two homes in
   the water distribution system. Lead concentrations in the tapwater of
   one home frequently exceeded recommended levels, although spatial and
   temporal variation in tapwater copper and lead concentrations was
   considerable. Since source water and reservoir water copper and lead
   concentrations were much lower, the increased copper and lead
   concentrations in tapwater were attributed to corrosion of household
   plumbing. Tapwater copper concentration correlated well with tapwater pH
   and tapwater temperature. Asbestos fibers were not detected in tapwater.
   The asbestos-cement pipe in the water distribution system was protected
   by a spontaneous metallic coating that inhibited fiber release from the
   pipe. Several simulataneous reactions were hypothesized to be taking
   place in the distribution system that involved corrosion of metallic
   components and coating of asbestos-cement pipe components in part with
   corrosion products and in part by cations of watershed origin. Greater
   water quality changes might be expected in areas of higher atmospheric
   deposition.}},

Abstract = {{Presence of 2,4-diaminobutyric acid (A2bu), a neurotoxin, in tissues of
   flatpea (Lathryus sylvestris L.) necessitates a thorough understanding
   of the regulation of this nonprotein amino acid before the species can
   be recommended to livestock producers for forage applications. To
   determine how different concentrations and ratios of NO3- and NH4+ in
   growth media influence the levels of A2bu and other free amino acids in
   the `Lathco' flatpea cultivar, plants were grown hydroponically in
   controlled environments. The concentration of A2bu was highest in
   tissues when the NO3- to NH4+ ratio in the nutrient solution was low.
   Responses of amides and other nonprotein amino acids, especially in the
   roots, followed a similar trend. Free protein amino acids in leaves and
   stems were generally unaffected by changes in NO3- to NH4+ ratios. In
   roots, protein amino acids increased as the NO3- to NH4+ ratio in the
   growth medium increased. Ammonium inhibited shoot and root growth; NO3-
   alleviated the toxic effects of NH4+. Soluble protein concentrations
   were higher in the shoots of NO3- -fed plants in the roots of plants
   supplied with NH4+. These results suggest that accumulation of A2bu and
   other nonprotein amino acids, as well as asparagine and glutamine, plays
   a role in detoxification of NH4+ and storage of N.}},

   contribution of free energy of dehydration toward their stability was
   significant even when compared with that of the free energy of

Title = {{ENALAPRIL REDUCES ALBUMIN EXCRETION IN DIABETIC-PATIENTS WITH LOW-LEVELS
   OF MICROALBUMINURIA}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEPHROLOGY}},
Year = {{1990}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Although angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may lower
   urinary protein excretion, it is not known whether these agents can
   completely eliminate microalbuminuria.  This study examined whether the
   ACE inhibitor, enalapril, can abolish low levels of microalbuminuria in
   diabetic patients.  Six men with adult-onset, insulin-dependent diabetes
   mellitus, most of whom had low levels of microalbuminuria, were studied
   in a clinical research center, where they ate a controlled diet and
   performed regulated exercises daily.  After 2 weeks of baseline
   measurements, the patients received 5-15 mg/day of enalapril for 4
   weeks.  They were then monitored for 2 more weeks without enalapril. 
   Urinary albumin excretion (UAE) fell in each patient with enalapril
   treatment and was within the normal range at some time during enalapril
   treatment in 5 of 6 patients.  After stopping enalapril, UAE rose.  UAE
   was 53.6 +/- 20.7 (SEM), 31.5 +/- 8.9 and 39.4 +/- 8.0 mg/24 h during
   the baseline, enalapril and postenalapril periods, respectively
   (baseline vs. enalapril, p < 0.02; postenalapril vs. enalapril, p <
   0.01).  The magnitude of fall in UAE correlated with the baseline UAE (r
   = 0.90).  During enalapril treatment, renal plasma flow and GFR did not
   change, although blood pressure fell slightly.  These data suggest that
   enalapril can reduce or abolish UAE in diabetic patients with
   microalbuminuria.  Whether long-term treatment with enalapril will
   continue to suppress microalbuminuria and prevent progressive diabetic
   nephropathy remains to be determined.}},

Abstract = {{Breathing dry gas at high minute ventilation leads to heat and water
   losses from the pulmonary airways.  Although these thermal exchanges
   tend to promote airway cooling and drying, net changes in airway wall
   temperature and hydration reflect the balance of these losses and
   restoration of heat and water from circulatory replenishing sources. 
   Because its blood flow rate is small, the tracheobronchial circulation
   replaces little of the heat loss from the bronchi to the atmosphere;
   instead, the pulmonary arteries represent the major circulatory heat
   source for intrapulmonary bronchi.  Nonetheless, the tracheobronchial
   circulation probably acts as an important water replenishing source that
   helps the bronchi, resist drying, though the precise role of the airway
   circulation in this regard has not yet been established.  Conversely,
   airway heat and water fluxes caused by dry gas breathing affect the
   tracheobronchial circulation in two ways.  They increase airway systemic
   blood flow rate, and induce bronchovascular hyperpermeability.  Each
   effect appears primarily as a local response to local airway heat/water
   losses, but the mechanisms leading to these changes remain uncertain. 
   Furthermore, these vascular responses probably enhance the ability of
   the tracheobronchial circulation to modulate airway cooling or drying. 
   Thus, airway heat and water exchanges share bidirectional interactions
   with the airway circulation.}},

Abstract = {{Studies in humans have indicated that trained athletes compared with
   sedentary subjects have an increased capacity to secrete epinephrine. 
   To investigate whether this is due to an adaptation induced by physical
   training or a selection phenomenon, rats were swim trained (T) 10 wk for
   6 h/day or served as controls being either sedentary freely eating (C),
   food restricted (FR), sham swim trained (ST), or cold stressed (CS). 
   Adrenal glands were weighed and cross sectioned for light microscopic
   determination of size of the adrenal medulla.  Endurance-trained
   compared with control rats had heavier adrenal glands (P < 0.05, higher
   catecholamine content in the glands (P < 0.05), and higher adrenal
   medulla volumes (P < 0.05) {[}males:  2.74 +/- 0.16 (T) vs. 2.05 +/-
   0.16 (C), 1.90 +/- 0.10 (ST), and 2.21 +/- 0.08 mm3 (CS)] {[}females: 
   2.55 +/- 0.11 (T) vs. 1.92 +/- 0.06 mm3 (C)].  Cold stress or sham swim
   training did not increase adrenal weight or volume of adrenal medulla (P
   > 0.05).  To stimulate adrenal medulla secretion, rats had an
   insulin-induced hypoglycemia.  Insulin dose needed to suppress plasma
   glucose below 4.0 mM was four times greater in sedentary compared with
   trained rats.  During hypoglycemia the epinephrine response was much
   smaller in trained than in untrained rats (P < 0.05).  In conclusion, in
   rats strenuous endurance training causes an enlargement of the adrenal
   medulla.  However, possibly reflecting an adaptation within the central
   nervous system to reduced blood glucose levels induced by repeated
   exercise bouts, the epinephrine response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia
   is markedly diminished after training.}},

Title = {{THE USE OF MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES FOR TREATMENT OF AUTOIMMUNE-DISEASE}},

Number = {{6, S}},
Pages = {{S30-S39}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decade monoclonal antibodies have been successfully
   employed in a number of animal models of autoimmune disease.  We have
   used antibodies to the class II gene products of the major
   histocompatibility complex, the CD4 molecule on helper T cells, and the
   T-cell receptor.  Monoclonal anti-class II antibodies have been
   administered to treat paralytic disease in the animal model of multiple
   sclerosis-experimental allergic encephalomyelitis.  These antibodies not
   only reverse acute paralytic disease but also decrease the number of
   relapses in a model of relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis when given
   after the first attack.  The advantage of this form of therapy is that
   it is haplotype specific.  In other words, in a heterozygous individual
   it is possible to block the major histocompatibility gene associated
   with disease susceptibility while leaving other major histocompatibility
   gene products free for antigen presentation.  Thus, animals given this
   form of immunotherapy are not significantly immunosuppressed. 
   Antibodies to the CD4 molecule have been equally effective in treating
   animal models of autoimmunity.  We and others have reversed ongoing
   paralysis in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.  Relapses have
   been diminished after the administration of anti-CD4.  Antibodies to CD4
   have been used successfully to treat animal models of systemic lupus
   erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and myasthenia gravis.  Recent
   trials with anti-CD4 have been successful in the treatment of rheumatoid
   arthritis and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.  The latter trial employed a
   chimeric human/mouse antibody.  Antibodies to the variable region of the
   T-cell receptor have been employed to treat experimental autoimmune
   encephalomyelitis.  These antibodies were effective in both preventing
   and reversing ongoing disease.  These antibodies targeted the variable
   region gene products of T-cell receptors that were involved in
   autoimmune disease.  It is remarkable that a limited heterogeneity of
   T-cell receptors is responsible for autoimmune conditions.  However, in
   certain instances the T-cell receptor repertoire is more diverse and may
   require a cocktail of monoclonal antibody reagents.  Other approaches to
   treatment of autoimmune disease based on targeting the variable region
   of the T-cell receptor involve active molecular vaccination.}},

Abstract = {{99mTc-SESTAMIBI is a new myocardial perfusion agent used in the
   detection of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.  In the present
   study, myocardial scintiscanning (on treadmill) with 99mTc-SESTAMIBI and
   201-Thallium were compared, and both were compared with coronary
   angiography.  Some 130 consecutive patients were evaluated within an
   interval of a few weeks with scintiscans of both 99mTc-SESTAMIBI and
   201-Thallium:  82 of them were also examined by coronary angiography.
   Segmental analysis of the two series of scans revealed some correlation
   in 89.2\% of the segments, while correlation of the final diagnosis
   showed agreement in 92\% of cases.  Compared to coronary angiography,
   sensitivity in the detection of CAD was found to be 75.8\% for
   201-Thallium and 72.5\% for 99mTc-SESTAMIBI.
   The authors conclude that 99mTc-SESTAMIBI is a promising myocardial
   perfusion agent which displays an excellent correlation with
   201-Thallium.}},

Abstract = {{Investigations were made of the action of ACTH and LH-RH on a number of
   behavioural paradigms and the possible involvement of neurotransmitters
   or opiates by pretreatment of receptor blockers in rats and mice.
   ACTH delayed the extinction of active avoidance behaviour.  Atropine and
   haloperidol blocked this action, whereas phenoxybenzamine and
   propranolol were ineffective.
   LH-RH or a highly potent analogue of LH-RH (D-Trp6-LH-RH) decreased the
   rate of disappearance of dopamine in the hypothalamus following
   alpha-methyl-paratyrosine inhibition of catecholamine synthesis, and
   blocked the accumulation of serotonin following MAO inhibition.  LH-RH
   or the analogue attenuated the consolidation of passive avoidance
   learning.
   Apomorphine-induced cage-climbing was also inhibited by the LH-RH
   analogue, but this action was not influenced by naloxone.
   Open-field activity (ambulation, rearing and grooming) was decreased by
   the analogue peptide.  Naloxone blocked the action on ambulation and
   rearing, but was ineffective on grooming.
   The LH-RH analogue caused a dose-dependent increase in cataleptogenic
   activity.  This action could not be blocked with naloxone.
   The LH-RH analogue suppressed picrotoxin-induced seizures.  Naloxone
   restored the situation to the control level.
   The data suggested that the effects of some neurohormones are mediated
   by transmitters or endogenous opiates, and that both peptide-transmitter
   and peptide-peptide interactions have to be considered in the action of
   neurohormones.}},

Abstract = {{Venom and oropharyngeal swabs from freshly captured Malayan pit vipers
   (Calloselasma rhodostoma) in southern Thailand and captive specimens in
   England were cultured aerobically and anaerobically to identify the
   bacterial flora which might contaminate wounds inflictd by bites of this
   species.  The snakes' mouths contained a wider range of organisms than
   their venoms, especially gut-related Gramnegative rods such as
   Enterobacter and Pseudomonas species and some staphylococci and
   clostridia.  There were fewer positive cultures from captive snakes.  C.
   rhodostoma venom inhibited the growth of group A streptococci and, to a
   lesser extent, that of Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens
   but not that of 2 Gram-negative organisms.  Secondary bacterial
   infection is an important complication of snake bite, especially of
   necrotic wounds.  A combination of gentamicin with benzyl penicillin
   would have prevented infection with, or treated, most of the bacteria
   isolated from snake venoms and mouths in Thailand.}},

Abstract = {{We developed the Falls Efficacy Scale (FES), an instrument to measure
   fear of falling, based on the operational definition of this fear as
   ``low perceived self-efficacy at avoiding falls during essential,
   nonhazardous activities of daily living.{''}  The reliability and
   validity of the FES were assessed in two samples of community-living
   elderly persons.  The FES showed good test-retest reliability (Pearson's
   correlation 0.71).  Subjects who reported avoiding activities because of
   fear of falling had higher FES scores, representing lower self-efficacy
   or confidence, than subjects not reporting fear of falling.  The
   independent predictors of FES score were usual walking pace (a measure
   of physical ability), anxiety, and depression.  The FES appears to be a
   reliable and valid method for measuring fear of falling.  This
   instrument may be useful in assessing the independent contribution of
   fear of falling to functional decline among elderly people.}},

Abstract = {{In order to study the elimination rat of perfluorochemical (PFC)
   emulsion from the blood and the PFC contents in the main organs of the
   tumor-bearing animals, Wistar strain rats were intramuscularly implanted
   with Walker 256 carcinosarcoma and 9L glioma cells were innoculated into
   the femoral muscle of Fischer rats.  After 7 d the Wistar rats received
   an injection of 4 g PEC/kg of a PFC emulsion.  The Fischer rats received
   a similar injection after 11 d.  The rats injected with the PFC emulsion
   were periodically sacrificed for a week.  There was no significant
   difference in PFC contents in the blood and main organs between normal
   rats and the tumor-bearing rats with either Walker 256 carcinosarcoma or
   9L glioma.  The PFC contents in Walker tumor were about 10 times as much
   as those of 9L tumor.  The innoculated tumors did not substantially
   affect the PFC retention in the blood and the accumulation of PFC in
   main organs after intravenously injected with the PFC emulsion.}},

Abstract = {{Uranium dioxide fuels irradiated in a commercial BWR during 1 to 4
   cycles (burn-up: 6-approximately-28 GWd/t) have been annealed in an
   out-of-pile condition and the release rate of Kr-85 was measured
   continuously. The annealing temperature ranged
   1,500-approximately-1,800-degrees-C. The effects of temperature and
   burn-up have been studied on burst release during temperature ramp and
   on diffusional release during isothermal annealing.
   The burst release evolved on temperature ramp was mainly due to the
   rapid release of fission gas from grain boundaries, which had previously
   accumulated there during base irradiation. With increasing burn-up, the
   critical temperature for the onset of the burst release became lower and
   the fractional burst release increased. The number of fission gas atoms
   per unit area of grain boundary, which was calculated from the
   quantities of the burst released Kr-85, was about 2-approximately-4
   times larger than saturation values estimated from theoretical
   considerations based on the assumption of mechanically equilibrated
   bubbles for 3 and 4 cycle irradiated fuels. Effective diffusion
   coefficient of Kr-85 obtained by the isothermal annealing tests appeared
   to be independent of burn-up (< 30 GWd/t).}},

   (EIA) of serum samples taken from (CBA X C57BL/6) F1 mice immunized with
   O-specific polysaccharides, O-antigens (O-Ag) obtained by Boivin's
   method and antigenic preparations isolated with hydroxylamine (HA) from
   S. choleraesuis and S. typhimurium.  O-Ag and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
   of the corresponding bacterial species were used as antigens for the
   sensitization of polystyrene plates.  The primary and secondary humoral
   immune response was studied by means of EIA.  As revealed in this
   investigation, the immunization of mice with HA-isolated antigenic
   preparations and O-Ag, obtained from S. typhimurium, in a single
   injection (in doses of 1-100 mu-g) led to the development of weak
   srecific immune response to O-Ag.  Response to LPS was absent.  After
   the second immunization of the animals pronounced immune response to
   O-Ag and LPS was observed.  It developed asaresponse of both IgM and IgG
   type.  The immunization of mice, made in a single injection, with
   HA-isolated antigenic preparations and O-Ag, obtained from S.
   choleraesuis, did not lead to the development of O-specific immune
   response.  After the immunization of mice with these antigens in two
   injections sharply pronounced nonspecific activity of IgM and IgG serum
   antibodies with respect to O-Ag and LPS of homologous and heterologous
   bacterial species was noted in EIA.  Neither S. typhimurium
   O-polysaccharide, nor S. choleraesuis O-polysaccharide did not induce
   O-specific immune response even after the second immunization.}},

Abstract = {{An updated version of the computer program EXCAD {[}1] allows the user
   to optimize experimental design to estimate parameters of particular
   semi-parametric models.  The semi-parametric models take the general
   form of a function of time (t):  Y(t) = NL(c(t,alpha),beta).  The
   function NL(C(t,alpha),beta), is, in general, a non-linear
   transformation of a function, C(t,alpha), that in turn is the
   convolution of two others.  One of these two functions is expressed in a
   non-parametric form, and is not of direct interest to the experimenter. 
   The other is of direct interest:  it is a parametric function depending
   on a set of parameters-alpha.  This semi-parametric model applies to
   numerous kinds of biological experiments, such as
   pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic, physiological, circulatory flow
   experiments.  This paper presents a new method for determining an
   optimal experimental design to estimate the parameters alpha and beta. 
   The new approach adopts the D-optimal criterion, and is illustrated
   using real thiopental data.}},

Abstract = {{In Western Europe medicine packages contain an insert prepared by the
   manufacturer which enumerates the drug side-effects.  We investigated
   the influence of this insert on alleged theophylline side-effects. 
   Forty literate adult asthmatics were randomly allocated into two groups
   (n=20 each): theophylline packages contained the manufacturer's insert
   in group A but not in group B.  Theophylline was prescribed (10 mg.kg-1
   body weight qd) for one week.  During this period the patients filled a
   diary grading 13 different symptoms from 0 to 3; 5 of these symptoms
   were listed on the insert as theophylline side-effects.  On the eighth
   day the patients were interviewed and theophylline blood levels
   measured.  Theophylline side-effects were significantly more marked in
   group A than in group B, whereas the other symptoms were of similar
   magnitude.  Eight patients prematurely stopped their treatment in group
   A vs 3 in group B, because of alleged intolerance.  Theophylline blood
   levels did not differ significantly in the two groups; neither did they
   in the subgroup which stopped treatment and in the one which complied to
   prescription.  We conclude that side-effects were suggested to the
   patients by the insert and/or that the insert increased their awareness
   of side-effects, with a subsequent detrimental influence upon compliance
   to therapy.}},

Abstract = {{A human venous homograft ``Varivas R{''}, in clinical use for 10 years
   for vascular access loops and femoropopliteal bypasses, has been used
   since December 1985 as a material for aortopulmonary shunts and other
   reconstructive procedures in congenital heart surgery.  For this purpose
   vein segments 5 cm length, varying in diameter from 4 up to 10 mm by
   steps of 1 mm, were obtained.  Our experience with Varivas is limited to
   59 patients.  Of 47 infants, 18 received a left, and 25 a right sided
   aortopulmonary shunt, 9 had bilateral aortopulmonary shunts, 2 righ
   ventricle pulmonary conduits, 1 a pulmonary-pulmonary conduit, 3
   interrupted aortic arch reconstructions and 4 a central aortopulmonary
   shunt, 1 with confluence reconstruction, 3 recidives of coarctation a
   patch repair.  Among 11 adults 6 received coronary bypass and 6 others
   vascular reconstructions.  In contrast to other artificial graft
   materials, the vein material offers easy manipulation similar to the
   daily routine of handling fresh vein grafts in coronary surgery.  The
   appropriate diameter sizes match better the infants anatomy, without the
   risk of kinking and/or anastomosis displacement.  Peroperatively it was
   possible to confirm patency by electromagnetic flow measurement and the
   postoperative examinations were done by colour Doppler echocardiography.
   We had to reoperate upon 4 infants because of early thrombosis; on 1
   infant for stenosis of the graft and on another 5 for late thrombosis. 
   In an attempt to extend the indications for ``inoperable{''} pulmonary
   hypoplasia/atresia we were not able to keep the shunt open in 4 infants.}},

   divided into different groups according to their serological properties

Abstract = {{Minimal excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) were investigated in
   13 neurons under single or double-pulse near-threshold microstimulation
   of the radial layer (Schaffer's collaterals) and stratum oriens in
   surviving hippocampal slices (area CA1) in guinea pigs.  The amplitude
   of 23 EPSP (9 units; 12 pathways) rose after tetanization of Schaffer's
   collaterals over a 5-55 min period, taken as long-term potentiation
   (LTP).  Statistical analysis conducted using four methods of quantal
   hypothesis based on a binomial approximation revealed an increase in
   mean quantal content (m) during LTP.  The rise in quantal size was only
   statistically significant when using data obtained from a section of
   these methods (mainly for stretches of over 15 min following
   tetanization) and shows no correlation with intensity of LTP.  The
   pronounced rise in m demonstrated using different methods matches data
   from experiments on intact animals and indicates a presynaptic location
   of the mechanisms underlying protracted persistence of residual
   tetanization lasting some tens of minutes.}},

Abstract = {{The oxygen-17 spin-lattice relaxation time in tungsten hexacarbonyl has
   been measured in the solvent, chloroform-d, and used to determine the
   reorientational diffusion coefficient, D, as a function of temperature. 
   The experimental activation energy for D was significantly below that
   predicted by the Gierer-Wirtz `microviscosity' model, but in almost
   perfect agreement with the value calculated from the more recent
   Hynes-Kapral-Weinberg (HKW) theory of reorientation in liquids.
   The HKW model was used to predict the diffusion coefficient and, hence,
   the reorientational contribution (DELTA-Reor) to the bandwidths of the
   E(g) (Raman) and T(1u)(IR) vibrational modes of W(CO)6 in various
   solvents.  These, together with the reported widths (DELTA-Obs),
   permitted determination of the contribution of vibrational relaxation
   (DELTA-Vib).  Both DELTA-Reor and DELTA-Vib are sensitively dependent
   both upon mode and solvent.  In general, the latter contribution
   dominates the observed bandwidth, particularly in the solvents,
   chloroform and benzene.}},

Abstract = {{The pattern of uridylate phosphatase and uridine phosphorylase has been
   studied in the liver, brain, heart and thigh muscles of the chick during
   development.  The study of enzymes involved in pyrimidine metabolism
   confirms that differences in utilisation of the metabolic pathways exist
   during ontogenesis.  In the liver, starting from the 12th day, an active
   metabolic pathway, leading to UMP via cytosine should be added to the
   catabolic ones.  In the brain, the second period of embryogenesis should
   be characterized by a lower utilisation of the catabolic pathways and by
   an increase of the anabolic ones.  In the heart, pyrimidine metabolism
   during development regards especially UMP.  In skeletal muscle,
   pyrimidine metabolism shows low activity.}},

Abstract = {{Undifferentiated and differentiated HL-60 leukemic cells posses
   nucleotide receptors which functionally couple to phospholipase C via
   pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding proteins
   (G-proteins).  We investigated the role of extracellular nucleotides in
   the regulation of B-glucuronidase release in HL-60 cells.  In dibutyryl
   cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP)-differentiated HL-60 cells, the chemotactic
   peptide, N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucy-L-phenylalanine (fMet-Leu-Phe),
   the phosphorothioate analogue of ATP, adenosine
   5'-O-{[}3-thio]triphosphate (ATP{[}gamma-S]), and UTP increased
   cytosolic Ca2+ from 100 nM up to 1.2 mu-M with EC50 values of 4 nM, 1
   mu-M and 100 nM, respectively.  In these cells, ATP{[}gamma-S] induced
   exocytosis with an EC50 of 4 mu-M and an effectiveness amounting to
   50-70\% of that of fMet-Leu-Phe.  ATP, ITP, UTP, CTP, and uridine
   5'-O-{[}2-thio]diphosphate activated exocytosis as well.  Phorbol
   myristate acetate (PMA) induced exocytosis with an EC50 of 115 ng/ml and
   an effectiveness similar to that of ATP{[}gamma-S].  Cytochalasin B (CB)
   differently potentiated exocytosis induced by ATP{[}gamma-S],
   fMet-Leu-Phe and PMA.  Treatment of Bt2cAMP-differentiated HL-60 cells
   with pertussis toxin (500 ng/ml) for 24 h resulted in ADP-ribosylation
   of more than 97.5\% of the G-proteins.  Under these conditions,
   pertussis toxin almost completely inhibited the increase in cytosolic
   Ca2+ and B-glucuronidase release induced by fMet-Leu-Phe but only
   partially inhibited the effects of ATP{[}gamma-S] and UTP.  fMet-Leu-Phe
   at a non-stimulatory concentration (1 nM) potentiated
   ATP{[}gamma-S]-induced B-glucuronidase release in the presence but not
   in the absence of CB.  In contrast, ATP{[}gamma-S] and fMet-Leu-Phe
   synergistically activated superoxide formation in the absence of CB. 
   PMA potentiated superoxide formation induced by ATP{[}gamma-S] or
   fMet-Leu-Phe and did not affect exocytosis induced by ATP{[}gamma-S] or
   fMet-Leu-Phe.  In undifferentiated HL-60 cells, fMet-Leu-Phe,
   ATP{[}gamma-S], UTP and PMA did not induce B-glucuronidase release. 
   fMet-Leu-Phe did not increase cytosolic Ca2+ in undifferentiated HL-60
   cells, whereas ATP{[}gamma-S] and UTP were similarly potent and
   effective as in Bt2cAMP-differentiated cells.  In differentiated HL-60
   cells, fMet-Leu-Phe induced aggregation, and ATP{[}gamma-S] induced a
   transient shape change.  Our results show (I) that exocytosis in HL-60
   cells does not obligatorily depend on CB.  (II) Purine and pyrimidine
   nucleotides activate exocytosis via pertussis toxin-sensitive and
   -insensitive signal transduction pathways.  (III) Specific signal
   transduction components for exocytosis are expressed during myeloid
   differentiation which are apparently different from G-proteins,
   phospholipase C, protein kinase C, and the Ca2+-mobilizing system.  (IV)
   Exocytosis and superoxide formation are independently regulated.}},

Abstract = {{Six pigs with coronary artery occlusion were investigated with MR
   imaging before and subsequently for about 2.5 hours at repeated
   intervals after the intravenous administration of Gd-DTPA (0.4 mmol/kg).
   The animals were sacrificed after a total occlusion time of 6 hours and
   the hearts were excised.  The excised hearts were then reexamined in the
   MR equipment and stained with TTC (triphenyl tetrazolium) in order to
   define areas of infarction.  Four control hearts with 6-hour-old
   infarctions were only imaged ex vivo without any previous administration
   of contrast media.  In vivo, there was no clear demarcation of
   infarction with or without Gd-DTPA.  Ex vivo, without any contrast
   media, the infarctions were poorly discriminated with a discretely
   increased signal intensity relative to normal myocardium in the T2
   weighted images.  Gd-DTPA was found to accumulate in the infarctions,
   which caused an elevated signal intensity most pronounced in the T1
   weighted images.  This considerably improved the delineation of the
   infarcted area.}},

   be chosen by the user, enabling stereographic pairs to be produced. 
   Plots can be copied to the clipboard for editing in other Macintosh
   graphics applications.  SPINEL is a self-contained variant, allowing
   data entry, editing, and printing within the program, whereas SPINELTAB
   accepts standard Macintosh tab-delimited input files, generated by other
   spreadsheet or word-processing applications.  Both versions are

Abstract = {{Peritoneal fluid probably has an important and complex role in fertility
   and infertility.  In this study, in-vitro fertilization was attempted in
   peritoneal fluid and the classical B2-Menezo medium.  Clinical criteria
   concerning male and female fertility and biological factors such as
   fresh semen quality, sperm survival, sperm-zona pellucida binding,
   cleavage and pregnancy rates were analysed for each infertile couple. 
   The following results have been obtained.  The quality of peritoneal
   fluid appears to fluctuate greatly from one woman to another.  Routine
   use of peritoneal fluid as a culture medium during in-vitro
   fertilization should not be encouraged.  Peritoneal fluid toxicity may
   explain some cases of `unexplained' infertility.}},

   than working at home full time.  They would telecommute only in times of
   need (e.g. when they have young children) and were concerned with work
   and interaction-related problems which might arise from telecommuting. 
   The findings suggest that telecommuting will be of particular interest
   to employees who are married, those with a high proportion of work that
   can be done at home, those who find their journey to work frustrating,
   and those with supervisors and coworkers who are supportive of
   telecommuting.  Respondents who are single and have a study room at home
   are also likely to favour telecommuting.  Implications are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Viral infections of the gastrointestinal tract consitute a major health
   problem during the first years of life. In addition to causing acute
   diarrhea, rotaviruses and other enteric viruses may be involved in the
   pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis and other neonatal enteric
   diseases. There are several potential methods for the prevention and
   treatment of gastrointestinal viral infections. Antiviral immune
   globulins, administered by the parenteral or oral route, might prove
   useful for the inhibition of intestinal viral replication.
   Alternatively, specific glycoprotein inhibitors of viral-cell binding
   might be used to prevent the productive infection of intestinal
   epithelial cells. In addition, since many enteric viruses require
   proteolytic enzymes for protein cleavage, protease inhibitors may prove
   to be effective agents for the inhibition of intestinal viral
   replication. At this point in time, these methods have proven useful for
   the inhibition of rotavirus infection in experimental animals. The
   successful application of these and other methods for the prevention of
   enteric infections in humans might substantially reduce the morbidity
   and mortality associated with enteric diseases.}},

Abstract = {{In the parallel detection EELS, the fluctuation effect of the
   accelerating voltage is compensated both by the open loop and negative
   feedback controls.  The fundamental frequency components of the AC power
   line and the excitation of Cockcroft-Walton circuit are canceled by
   applying the inverse-phase signal to the deflection coil, while the
   effect from the drift and the higher-order ripples is controlled by the
   negative feedback.  The energy resolution is increased from 9.3 eV to
   5.7 eV by the open loop control and can be improved up to 3.8 eV by the
   negative feedback.  As the loop gain increases, the resolution increases
   at first, but then decreases.  This decrease results from the shot noise
   of electron beam and the phase shift of the feedback loop.  It is
   theoretically shown that the optimum condition to the loop gain and the
   bandwidth exists for the feedback control.}},

Abstract = {{Ciliated cell cultures can be produced in outgrowths from explants of
   human respiratory epithelium.  An image analysis technique was developed
   to quantify the percentage of active ciliated cells present in these
   cultures.  The subtraction 2 by 2 of five successive video images of the
   cultures, followed by the addition of the resulting images, allowed the
   determination of the culture surface covered by ciliated cells.  The
   percentage of this surface varied according to the region of the explant
   (27.7\% in the outgrowth near the explant and 4.1\% at the periphery of
   the outgrowth).  High variations were observed within the same region of
   an outgrowth, as well as from one outgrowth to another.  However,
   maximal differentiation was observed after 4 d of culture.  The
   quantitation technique described in the present work might be useful for
   studying in vitro the respiratory epithelial injury and the subsequent
   repair processes.}},

Abstract = {{Soil C and N dynamics were studied in a sequence of old fields of
   increasing age to determine how these biogeochemical cycles change
   during secondary succession.  In addition, three different
   late-successional forests were studied to represent possible ``steady
   state{''} conditions.  Surface soil samples collected from the fields
   and forests were analyzed for total C, H2O-soluble C, total N, potential
   net N mineralization, potential net nitrification, and microbial
   biomass.  Above-and belowground plant biomass was estimated within each
   of the old field sites.
   Temporal changes in soil organic C, total N and total plant biomass were
   best described by a gamma function {[}y = at(b) e(ctd) + f] whereas a
   simple exponential model {[}y = a(1 - e(-bt)) + c] provided the best fit
   to changes in H2O-soluble C, C:N ratio, microbial C, and microbial N. 
   Potential N mineralization and nitrification linearly increased with
   field age; however, rates were variable among the fields.  Microbial
   biomass was highly correlated to soil C and N pools and well correlated
   to the standing crop of plant biomass.  In turn, plant biomass was
   highly correlated to pools and rates of N cycling.
   Patterns of C and N cycling within the old field sites were different
   from those in a northern hardwood forest and a xeric oak forest;
   however, nutrient dynamics within an oak savanna were similar to those
   found in a 60-yr old field.  Results suggest that patterns in C and N
   cycling within the old-field chronosequence were predictable and highly
   correlated to the accrual of plant and microbial biomass.}},

Abstract = {{Characteristic manifestations may grow manifest in the foot region of
   long-time diabetics on insulin with fully developed diabetes-specific
   complications.  They are generally summarised under the cover term of
   ``diabetic foot{''}.  Primarily included are neurotrophic ulcerations,
   diabetic osteoarthropathy (Charcot's joint), and neuropathic
   oedematisation.  These pathological problems are primarily associated
   with diabetic somatovisceral polyneuropathy.  These alterations should
   be distinguished and delimitated from purely ischaemic foot lesions of
   diabetics.  The latter were found to develop on the basis of arterial
   (macro-angiopathic) impairment of blood circulation.  There is also a
   relatively high incidence of mixed forms on the basis of neuropathic and
   macro-angiopathic alterations.  Hints are given in this paper on
   prevention and differential therapy.  Therapeutic procedures usually are
   long-drawn.  Therefore, utmost attention should be given to preventive
   measures, in the context of briefing of diabetics.}},

Abstract = {{In cultured striatal neurons, maximal {[}H-3]GABA release stimulated by
   quisqualate (QA) or alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole
   propionate (AMPA) was 10-20 times smaller than that stimulated by
   kainate (KA), and we have previously reported that QA or AMPA
   competitively inhibited KA-evoked GABA release. Since the lectin
   concanavalin A (Con A) has been shown to inhibit QA receptor
   desensitization, the interaction between QA and KA was further studied
   in Con A-treated neurons. Con A dose-dependently and specifically
   potentiated QA- or AMPA-evoked {[}H-3]GABA release, so that maximal
   responses of QA or AMPA were half of that of KA. The responses of these
   agonists were inhibited by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX)
   with similar apparent K(i) values, indicating that they resulted from
   non-NMDA receptor activation. In Con A-treated neurons, QA and AMPA
   competitively inhibited the KA-induced GABA release. The apparent
   affinities of QA and AMPA in inhibiting the KA response were identical
   to their affinities in stimulating GABA release. Moreover,the maximal KA
   response measured in the presence of QA or AMPA was identical to that
   measured with KA alone. These results clearly indicate that to stimulate
   GABA release from Con A-treated striatal neurons, QA and AMPA behave as
   partial agonists of a receptor fully activated by KA. These results
   further support the hypothesis that QA, AMPA and KA act on a common
   receptor type in striatal neurons.}},
