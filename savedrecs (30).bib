Abstract = {{We consider the system of quasilinear equations describing 1D radiative
   and reactive viscous flows with arbitrarily large data. The large-time
   behavior of solutions in the case of first-order kinetics has been
   recently studied. In this paper, we present new results concerning the
   case of higher-order kinetics for fairly general kinetics law (unbounded
   with respect to density and temperature, and dealing with the ignition
   phenomenon), including L-2 and H-1-stabilization rate bounds of power
   type. The power exponents of bounds improve essentially those known for
   related problems and are partially proved to be sharp. An effect of
   ``faster equaling{''} of values in space for the concentration of
   unburned gas is also found. Finally we show how our results are modified
   in the case of reaction without diffusion. (c) 2005 Published by

Abstract = {{Cases of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) that occur during pregnancy
   or postpartum are rarely reported. Ergot derivatives are known to induce
   the spasmodic contraction of coronary arteries. Administration of ergot
   derivatives can cause AMI, even in normal healthy people. In several
   reported cases, ergot derivatives triggered severe AMI during the
   postpartum period. Here, we report the case of a forty-year-old woman
   who was successfully impregnated by artificial fertilization and died
   after treatment with ergot derivatives. The autopsy revealed AMI with
   severe coronary atherosclerosis. This is the first case that reports
   aggravation of pre-existent severe coronary atherosclerosis after
   postpartum infusion of ergot derivtives.}},

Abstract = {{Classical transient receptor potential channels (TRPCs) are thought to
   be candidates for the nonselective cation channels (NSCCs) involved in
   pacemaker activity and its neuromodulation in murine stomach smooth
   muscle. We aimed to determine the role of TRPC4 in the formation of
   NSCCs and in the generation of slow waves. At a holding potential of -60
   mV, 50 mu M carbachol (CCh) induced I-NSCC of amplitude {[}500.8 +/-
   161.8 pA (n=8)] at -60 mV in mouse gastric smooth muscle cells. We
   investigated the effects of commercially available antibodies to TRPC4
   on recombinant TRPC4 expressed in HEK cells and CCh-induced NSCCs in
   gastric smooth muscle cells. TRPC4 currents in HEK cells were reduced
   from 1525.6 +/- 414.4 pA (n=8) to 146.4 +/- 83.3 pA (n=10) by anti-TRPC4
   antibody and I-NSCC amplitudes were reduced from 230.9 +/- 36.3 pA
   (n=15) to 49.8 +/- 11.8 pA (n=9). Furthermore, I-NSCC in the gastric
   smooth muscle cells of TRPC4 knockout mice was only 34.4 +/- 10.4 pA

   mice. Our data suggest that TRPC4 is an essential component of the NSCC

Abstract = {{Three-component seismic waveforms recorded at the single broadband
   station SJG have been examined for four M(W) >= 6 Caribbean earthquakes
   using a regional moment-tensor (RMT) inversion procedure that uses a
   general crustal velocity model to generate synthetic Green's functions
   at a fixed depth. Comparisons of the computed source parameters with
   solutions reported by international agencies indicate that the RMT
   procedure provides a rapid estimate of the earthquake magnitude using a
   single station. Focal mechanisms are not as well resolved and may
   require a more complete azimuthal coverage. The inversion procedure thus
   provides a timely estimate of the earthquake magnitude that would be
   useful for tsunami alerting. Warning intervals for the Caribbean region
   would vary from about 12 minutes for a tsunami generated at a distance
   of 200 km to more than 60 minutes for a tsunami originating at a

Abstract = {{CO adsorption on NO2-predosed Au\{111\} reveals an unexpected attractive

   characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy and low energy electron
   diffraction. Density functional calculations allow us to rationalize
   these observations, and point towards a general pattern of behavior for
   electronegative coadsorbates on coinage metals, with important
   implications for catalytic promotion.}},

Abstract = {{During injury or trauma, blood coagulation is initiated by the
   interaction of factor VIIa (FVIIa) in the blood with freshly exposed
   tissue factor (TF) to form the TF center dot FVIIa complex. However,
   unwanted clot formation can lead to death and debilitation due to
   vascular occlusion, and hence, anticoagulants are important for the
   treatment of thromboembolic disorders. Here, we report the isolation and
   characterization of two synergistically acting anticoagulant proteins,
   hemextins A and B, from the venom of Hemachatus haemachatus (African
   Ringhals cobra). N-terminal sequences and CD spectra of the native
   proteins indicate that these proteins belong to the three-finger toxin
   family. Hemextin A (but not hemextin B) exhibits mild anticoagulant
   activity. However, hemextin B forms a complex (hemextin AB complex) with
   hemextin A and synergistically enhances its anticoagulant potency.
   Prothrombin time assay showed that these two proteins form a 1: 1
   complex. Complex formation was supported by size-exclusion
   chromatography. Using a ``dissection approach,{''} we determined that
   hemextin A and the hemextin AB complex prolong clotting by inhibiting TF
   center dot FVIIa activity. The site of anticoagulant effects was
   supported by their inhibitory effect on the reconstituted TF center dot
   FVIIa complex. Furthermore, we demonstrated their specificity of
   inhibition by studying their effects on 12 serine proteases; the
   hemextin AB complex potently inhibited the amidolytic activity of FVIIa
   in the presence and absence of soluble TF. Kinetic studies showed that
   the hemextin AB complex is a noncompetitive inhibitor of soluble TF
   center dot FVIIa amidolytic activity, with a K-i of 50 nM. Isothermal
   titration calorimetric studies showed that the hemextin AB complex binds
   directly to FVIIa with a binding constant of 1.62 X 105 M-1. The
   hemextin AB complex is the first reported natural inhibitor of FVIIa
   that does not require a scaffold to mediate its inhibitory activity.
   Molecular interactions of the hemextin AB complex with FVIIa/TF center
   dot FVIIa will provide a new paradigm in the search for anticoagulants
   that inhibit the initiation of blood coagulation.}},

   hydroxylation with N2O are studied as a function of the nature of the T
   atom (Al, B) and compared with the characterization of the nature of
   iron species determined by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The
   results indicate that the mechanism for generation of iron species
   highly active in this reaction is the creation of hydroxyl nests in the
   zeolite framework due to framework to extra-framework migration of the
   Tatom. The process is favoured when B is present as Tatom, but occurs
   also in the case of Fe and Al as T atoms. Iron atoms migrate to these
   zeolite defect sites forming highly active Fe3+ isolated species in
   square pyramidal or highly distorted octahedral coordination. The
   process occurs during the catalyst pre-treatment as well as during the
   initial half an hour of time on stream, leading to an increase in the
   phenol productivity during this step. A model of these active sites is
   presented. The effect of the silica source in the preparation of these
   catalysts is also reported. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A personal account is given of the history of monitoring soil erosion by
   water in England and Wales from the late 1960s to the present. Prior to
   the mid-1970s it was not easy to carry out research on water erosion and
   information was obtained on an ad hoc basis. Since 1982 there have been
   four major monitoring schemes, three of them national schemes funded by
   the Ministry of Agriculture, and one scheme on the South Downs of
   Sussex, southern England, carried out by John Boardman. The three
   national schemes were carried out by staff of the (then) Soil Survey of
   England and Wales (1982-1986), of the (then) Agricultural Development
   and Advisory Service (1989-1994) and by the (then) Soil Survey and Land
   Research Centre (1996-1998). Some results of these four schemes are
   compared. It is likely severity of erosion has not changed over time.
   The evidence that erosion may have increased in extent over the last 20
   years is arguable. Although most erosion occurs in winter cereals-all
   four schemes show this-three of the schemes, because of the ways in
   which they were set up, overemphasise the fact. The results from the
   more extensive 1982-1986 scheme show that fields drilled to other crops
   can be more vulnerable. A new monitoring scheme is urgently needed and
   should cover large blocks of land representative of the soil landscapes
   of England and Wales. In this way a sufficient number of eroded fields
   will be located to allow statistical analysis of the data and to enable
   future trends in severity and extent of water erosion to be identified.

   regarding the effects of treatments or interventions into models for
   repeated cancer relapses. In contrast to many existing models, our
   approach permits the impact of interventions to differ after each
   relapse. We adopt the general model for recurrent events proposed by
   Pena and Hollander, in which the effect of interventions is represented
   by an effective age process acting on the baseline hazard rate function.
   To accommodate the situation of cancer relapse, we propose an effective
   age function that encodes three possible therapeutic responses: complete
   remission, partial., remission, and null response. The proposed model
   also incorporates the effect of covariates, the impact of previous
   relapses, and heterogeneity among individuals. We use our model to
   analyse the times to relapse for 63 patients with a particular subtype
   of indolent lymphoma and compare the results to those obtained using
   existing methods. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Protein-DNA recognition plays an essential role in the regulation of
   gene expression. Regulatory proteins are known to recognize specific DNA
   sequences directly through atomic contacts between protein and DNA,
   and/or indirectly through the conformational properties of the DNA. In
   this work, we have analyzed the specificity of intermolecular
   interactions by statistical analysis of base-amino acid interactions
   within protein-DNA complexes as well as the computer simulations of
   base-amino acid interactions. The specificity of the intramolecular
   interactions was studied by statistical analysis of the
   sequence-dependent DNA conformational parameters and the elastic
   properties of DNA. Systematic comparison of these specificities in a
   large number of protein-DNA complexes revealed that both intermolecular
   and intramolecular interactions contribute to the specificity of
   protein-DNA recognition, and their relative contributions vary depending
   upon the protein-DNA complex. We demonstrated that combination of the
   intermolecular and intramolecular energies leads to enhanced specificity
   and the combined energy could explain experimental data on binding
   affinity changes caused by base mutations. These results provided new
   insight into the relationship between specificity and structure in the
   process of protein-DNA recognition, which would lead to prediction of
   specific protein-DNA binding sites. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{An experiment was conducted for 8 weeks at the Cantho University,
   Vietnam, to determine the acceptable level of mangrove leaf litter load
   and its effect on water quality, growth and survival rate of tiger
   shrimp (Penaeus monodon). Shrimps were cultured in plastic tanks
   containing 50 L of brackish water (salinity of 15 parts per thousand).
   Leaf litter of Rhizophora apiculata, Avicennia officinalis, Excoecaria
   agallocha and Acacia auriculiformis were loaded to tanks at rates of 0.0
   (control), 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 g L-1 with and without
   aeration. Tiger shrimp post-larvae (PL; 0.05 +/- 0.01 g) obtained from
   the shrimp hatchery of Cantho University were stocked at a density of 20
   PL per tank and fed with pelleted feed containing 38\% protein at a rate
   of 10\% body weight (BW) day(-1). The high leaf-loading rates
   significantly reduced dissolved oxygen (DO) and survival rates of shrimp
   in the non-aerated treatments, and all shrimps died after 2 days in the
   treatments with loading rates above 0.5 g L-1. Leaf litter loads
   significantly increased tannin content, chemical oxygen demand (COD),
   H2S and pH in the aerated treatments. Stepwise regression analysis
   showed COD, tannin and H2S concentrations had negative effects on shrimp
   growth in the aerated treatments. Tannin concentration was found to be
   highest in the treatments with Excoecaria (32 mg L-1) and Avicennia (24
   mg L-1) leaves. However, there were no significant differences in growth
   and survival rates of shrimp among the aerobic treatments loaded with
   different leaf types. The results of this study showed that moderate
   load of mangrove leaves could play an important role in promoting shrimp
   growth and survival in aerobic condition. Mangrove leaves at a loading
   rate of 1 g L-1 positively influenced both the survival and growth rate
   of shrimps. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Air pollution control residues (APCR) resulting from municipal solid
   wastes (MSW) are most often classified as hazardous waste. A treatment
   process employing aqueous and alkaline leaching was developed to extract
   Pb, the principal contaminant found in these residues. This treatment
   process generates highly alkaline (pH between 11.3 and 12.5) and
   Pb-loaded effluent. The objective of this study was to evaluate the
   potential of a counter-current sorption process (CCSP) for Pb using peat
   moss (PM) in order to treat leachates emanating from diverse types of
   APCR (used lime, electrofilter ash and boiler ash). Results have shown
   that the CCSP process diminishes the quantity of PM required to treat
   these effluents by a factor of 4. Thus, a concentration of 4 g PM/L is
   sufficient to lower the initial Pb concentration in used lime leachate
   from approximately 150 mg/L to less than 0.5 mg/L. By reusing treated
   effluent for additional leaching and sorption cycles, our research has
   also shown that the quantity of water consumed during the treatment
   process can be reduced by 50\%. Lastly, considering both the low cost of
   acquiring PM and managing saturated adsorbents, in addition to the
   efficient recuperation of Pb, the CCSP process has great potential for
   full-scale use. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Both haplotype-based and locus-based methods have been proposed as the
   most powerful methods to employ when fine mapping by association.
   Although haplotype-based methods utilize more information, they may lose
   power as a result of overparameterization, given the large number of
   haplotypes possible over even a few loci. Recently methods have been
   developed that cluster haplotypes with similar structure in the hope
   that this reflects shared genealogical ancestry. The aim is to reduce
   the number of parameters while retaining the genotype information
   relating to disease susceptibility. We have compared several
   haplotype-based methods with locus-based methods. We utilized 2 regions
   (D2 and D4) simulated to be in linkage disequilibrium and to be
   associated with disease susceptibility, combining 5 replicates at a time
   to produce 4 datasets that were analyzed. We found little difference in
   the performance of the haplotype-based methods and the locus-based
   methods in this dataset.}},

Abstract = {{The mu-opioid receptor (MOR) plays a mandatory role in the action of
   most opioid drugs, such as morphine, fentanyl, and heroin. it has been
   revealed that a deficiency in the MOR gene (Oprm 1) or a difference in
   the 3' noncoding region of the gene markedly affects the sensitivity of
   mice to opioids. As the 3' noncoding region of the human OPRM1 gene had
   not yet been characterized, in the present study we conducted 3'-rapid
   amplification of cDNA ends (3'RACE)-PCR and identified the 3' end of the
   human MOR-1 mRNA, the most abundant transcript among OPRM1 gene
   transcripts. The poly(A) signal was located at 13612-13617 nucleotides
   downstream from the stop codon in the OPRM1 gene. Reverse transcription
   PCR analyses showed that the region from the stop codon to the poly(A)
   signal was transcribed. In the 3' UTR, we identified 33 AU-rich regions
   and more than 300 putative transcription factor-binding sites.
   Furthermore, we compared the 3' noncoding regions of the human and mouse
   OPRM1/Oprm1] genes and found apparent homology. In Northern blotting
   with mouse brain mRNAs, a same-size band was detected by a probe for the
   MOR-1 coding region and by a probe for a mouse genome region
   corresponding to the human MOR-1 3'UTR. Since 3'UTRs affect gene
   expression, the present characterization of the 3' noncoding region in
   the human OPRM1 gene should lead to a better understanding of the
   mechanisms underlying OPRM1 gene regulation and individual differences
   in sensitivity to opioids. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   this study, we found that levels of MKP-1 expression were transiently

   oxidative stress in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. There was a
   strong negative correlation between MKP-1 expression and ERK1/2
   phosphorylation levels. Treatment of cells with a proteasomal inhibitor
   MG132 decreased the oxidative stress-induced degradation of MKP-1,
   resulting in dephosphorylation of ERKI/2. MG132 potentiated hydrogen
   peroxide-induced cell death, which was attenuated by a phosphatase
   inhibitor sodium orthovanadate. Suppression of MKP-1 expression by
   transfection with siRNA duplexes specific to MKP-1 transcript resulted
   in a decrease in oxidative stress-induced cell death. These data
   therefore suggest that MKP-1, a negative regulator of ERK1/2, plays a

Abstract = {{The kinetics of N(2)O decomposition to gaseous nitrogen and oxygen over
   HZSM-5 catalysts with low content of iron (< 400 ppm) under transient
   and steady-state conditions was investigated in the temperature range of
   250-380 degrees C. The catalysts were prepared from the HZSM-5 with Fe
   in the framework upon steaming at 550 degrees C followed by thermal
   activation in He at 1050 degrees C. The N(2)O decomposition began at 280
   degrees C. The reaction kinetics was first order towards N(2)O during
   the transient period, and of zero order under steady-state conditions.
   The increase of the reaction rate with time (autocatalytic behaviour)
   was observed up to the steady state. This increase was assigned to the
   catalysis by adsorbed NO formed slowly on the zeolite surface from
   N(2)O. The formation of NO was confirmed by temperature-programmed
   desorption at temperatures > 360 degrees C. The amount of surface NO
   during the transient increases with the reaction temperature, the
   reaction time, and the N(2)O concentration in the gas phase up to a
   maximum value. The maximum amount of surface NO was found to be
   independent on the temperature and N(2)O concentration in the gas phase.
   This leads to a first-order N(2)O decomposition during the transient
   period, and to a zero-order under steady state. A kinetic model is
   proposed for the autocatalytic reaction. The simulated
   concentration-time profiles were consistent with the experimental data
   under transient as well as under steady-state conditions giving a proof
   for the kinetic model suggested in this study. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{To examine whether the fission yeast Maml ABC transporter can be used
   for secretion of heterologous proteins, thereby bypassing the classical
   secretion pathway, we have analyzed chimeric forms of the M-factor
   precursor. It was demonstrated that GFP can be exported when fused to
   both the amino-terminal prosequence from mfin1 and a CaaX motif. This
   secretion was dependent on the Maml transporter and not the classical
   secretion pathway. The secretion efficiency of GFP, however, was
   relatively low and most of the reporter protein was trapped in the
   vacuolar membranes. Our findings suggest that the Main1 ABC protein is a
   promiscuous peptide transporter that can accommodate globular proteins
   of a relatively large size. Furthermore, our results help in defining
   the sequences required for processing and secretion of natural M-factor.

Abstract = {{Eukaryotic genomes are divided into chromatin domains, which are thought
   to represent independent regulatory units. Typically, these domains are
   flanked by bordering elements that insulate the transcription unit front
   outside influences. Borders also demarcate the range of action for
   enhancer-like elements within the domain as they are formed around
   dominant genomic structures such as DNAse I hypersensitive sites (HS).
   Here we describe an efficient strategy to localize these elements. Our
   procedure is based on a computational method and predictions are
   verified by classical in vivo and in vitro procedures. Exemplified by
   the interferon-beta (IFN-beta) domain it proves its potential to provide
   novel insights into remote control principles of transcription. Sites
   with secondary-structure forming potential are localized by the analysis
   of stress-induced duplex destabilization (SIDD) properties and the
   associating factors are characterized by electrophoretic mobility shift
   assays (EMSA). These studies reveal far upstream factor binding sites
   within the IFN-beta domains of both humans and mice. A prominent example
   is YY1, a transcription factor that not only recognizes a core consensus
   motif, ATGG, but, in addition, the structural context, which is evident
   from characteristic imprints in the respective SIDD-profiles. (C) 2005

Abstract = {{Previous neuroimaging studies showed that use of marijuana can alter
   patterns of cortical activation during rest or a task challenge. We used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine whether recent cannabis
   abuse contributed to stress-induced blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD)
   contrast in a group of cocaine-dependent individuals. Emotional stress
   was induced using the script-guided imagery paradigm, in which subjects
   imagined being in a real-life stressful situation and, as a control, in
   a neutral situation, while BOLD signals of their brain were acquired
   with a 1.5 T scanner. Abstinent cocaine-dependent subjects with recent
   marijuana abuse (n = 8) were compared with abstinent cocaine-dependent
   subjects who had not abused marijuana recently (n = 18). The two groups
   were otherwise matched in their demographic characteristics and drug use
   history. All subjects were abstinent for at least 15 days and drug free
   as confirmed by urine drug screening before the imaging session. Recent
   cannabis abusers demonstrated hypo-activation in frontal cortical areas
   including the perigenual. anterior cingulate during increased emotional
   stress. In contrast, at the same statistical threshold, no brain regions
   showed increased activation in recent cannabis abusers compared with
   non-abusers. The group difference in the perigenual anterior cingulate
   remained even when lifetime cocaine and alcohol consumption was
   accounted for in covariance analysis. These results provide evidence
   that recent cannabis abuse is associated with decreased activation in
   the frontal cortex during an emotional stress task. The results suggest
   an abnormal cognitive control mechanism during affective processing in
   association with heavy cannabis use. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Simulated Genetic Analysis Workshop 14 data were analyzed by jointly
   testing linkage and association and by accounting for epistasis using a
   candidate gene approach. Our group was unblinded to the ``answers.{''}
   The 48 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the six disease
   loci were analyzed in addition to five SNPs from each of two
   non-disease-related loci. Affected sib-parent data was extracted from
   the first 10 replicates for populations Aipotu, Kaarangar, and Danacaa,
   and analyzed separately for each replicate. We developed a likelihood
   for testing association and/or linkage using data from affected sib
   pairs and their parents. Identical-by-descent (IBD) allele sharing
   between sibs was explicitly modeled using a conditional logistic
   regression approach and incorporating a covariate that represents
   expected IBD allele sharing given the genotypes of the sibs and their
   parents. Interactions were accounted for by performing likelihood ratio
   tests in stages determined by the highest order interaction term in the
   model. In the first stage, main effects were tested independently, and
   in subsequent stages, multilocus effects were tested conditional on
   significant marginal effects. A reduction in the number of tests
   performed was achieved by prescreening gene combinations with a
   goodness-of-fit chi square statistic that depended on mating-type
   frequencies. SNP-specific joint effects of linkage and association were
   identified for loci D1, D2, D3, and D4 in multiple replicates. The
   strongest effect was for SNP B03T3056, which had a median p-value of
   1.98 x 10(-34). No two- or three-locus effects were found in more than

Abstract = {{Pleural malignant mesothelioma (NW) is a rare but extremely aggressive
   cancer. The limited impact of standard therapeutic treatments on
   survival rates makes the identification of factors that increase the
   individual risk a leading priority. The high proportion of cases
   explained by exposure to asbestos has guided intervention policies to an
   effective ban of this compound from our environment. However, MM cannot
   be solely attributed to this agent, and the role of predisposing factors
   and their interaction with asbestos exposure is increasingly studied.
   The role of mEH, GSTM1, GSTT1, NAT2, and CYP1A1 genotypes in modulating
   susceptibility to MM was examined in a case-control study of 80 subjects
   with a confirmed diagnosis of MM and 255 controls. Subjects with low mEH
   activity showed a significantly increased risk of MM (OR, 2.51; 95\% CI,
   1.11-5.68). The association was stronger in the group with low asbestos
   exposure (OR, 7.83; 95\% Cl, 0.98-62.60). A significant increased risk
   of MM was also found in NAT2 fast acetylators (OR, 1.74; 95\% Cl,
   1.02-2.96). The presence of synergisms between genotypes, i.e., mEH and
   NAT2 (LRT for heterogeneity p < 0.023), mEH and GSTM1 (LRT p < 0.061),
   and NAT2 and GSTM1 (LRT p < 0.049), combined with the interaction
   observed with exposure to asbestos, suggests the presence of
   gene-environment and gene-gene interactions in the development of MM,
   although the size of the study group does not allow to draw clearcut
   conclusions.
   Since genetic polymorphisms can also modify the extent of genetic damage
   occurring in subjects exposed to carcinogens, we measured the frequency
   of micronuclei in peripheral blood lymphocytes of a subgroup of MM
   cases. The limited number of cases (28) did not allow to observe
   significant effects. In conclusion, these results strengthen the
   hypothesis that individual susceptibility to MM can be modulated by the
   interaction between polymorphic genes involved in the metabolism and the
   intensity of asbestos exposure. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the leaching of enargite (Cu3AsS4) in sulfuric

   degrees + 3H(2)O
   The dissolution rate of arsenic was found to be very slow. About 6\% of
   arsenic was dissolved in 7 h of leaching at 100 degrees C in a solution
   containing 0.25 M H2SO4 and 1.5 M NaCl under a flow of oxygen of 0.3
   l/min. The kinetics of arsenic dissolution is well represented by a
   shrinking core model for spherical particles controlled by surface

Abstract = {{We studied the relationship between sleep quality and quantity and
   subsequently recorded automatically evoked event-related potential (ERP)
   responses. In previous studies decrement of attentional processing has
   been associated with changes in sleep. Sleep is shown to associate also
   with ERPs elicited by unattended sound stream, however, there is no
   consensus on these effects. A recent study suggested that the early
   anterior P3a to novel stimuli in attended stream is attenuated and the
   late parietal P3a is strengthened by total sleep deprivation. We carried
   out 72-h consecutive actigraphy measurements in a naturalistic setting
   to collect information about variation in sleep duration, sleep onset
   latency, sleep efficiency, and percentage of sleep. MMN and P3a
   deflections to infrequent changes in sound duration and pitch in
   unattended sound stream were obtained in a separate recording session
   from the same subjects when they were awake. No significant correlations
   were found between sleep and MMN parameters, indicating that MMN is
   resistant to normal variation in sleep. However, P3a to both pitch and
   duration changes correlated positively with sleep onset latency, and P3a
   to duration changes correlated negatively with sleep efficiency and
   percentage of sleep. The correlation was higher in the posterior scalp
   areas. Our results suggest that the involuntary attention switching
   system, reflected by the P3a is sensitized as a function of decreased
   sleep quality. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The discharge regimes of the large rivers of northern Australia are
   characterized by the occurrence of extreme flood events with
   far-reaching environmental and societal impacts. In January 1998 the
   largest flood ever recorded on the Katherine River, northern Australia,
   resulted in widespread inundation and resultant damage to the town of
   Katherine. The occurrence of the flood emphasized the unreliability of
   the then available flood probability estimates and prompted a
   palaeoflood approach to estimate the recurrence interval of the event.
   The location of Katherine is ideal for such a study, as the town is
   located immediately downstream from Katherine Gorge, which provides the
   necessary bedrock-confined channel required for such an approach. In
   addition, previous work in Katherine Gorge had demonstrated that the
   gorge sections hold suitable deposits for palaeoflood stage
   reconstruction. The results of the present study show that at least two
   flow events with discharges similar to the 1998 flood have occurred
   within the last 600 years, and that high-magnitude floods are a general
   feature of the discharge record of the Katherine River over the last c.
   2000 years. Furthermore, because the study was undertaken within a few
   months of the occurrence of the 1998 flood, it provided the opportunity
   to evaluate the previously obtained flood discharge estimates and draw
   attention to the general uncertainties associated with palaeoflood
   studies. Our results emphasize that palaeoflood stage estimates based on
   slackwater deposits need to be treated as conservative estimates only.
   More specifically, with respect to the 1998 event, our study
   demonstrates that the controls of flood peak were more complex than
   simply flood routing through the gorge sections. It is clear that the
   areas downstream from Katherine Gorge made an important contribution to
   the flood peak of the 1998 event. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Rainfall simulations were conducted on a loess derived silt loam soil
   (Henan province, P.R. China) under conventional tillage. This tillage
   practice is widespread and involves the turning of the plough layer and
   the wheat stubble in July (primary tillage), followed by a secondary
   tillage operation in October. Soil samples were collected and in situ
   measurements were done before each rainfall simulation in order to
   analyse soil physical properties after successive simulated rainfall
   events. The purpose of this study was to determine rainfall induced
   changes in saturated hydraulic conductivity, bulk density, penetration
   resistance, water retention and soil erodibility. The results only
   showed significant differences in soil bulk density and erodibility when
   applying successive rainfall events. Penetration resistance and water
   retention (at matric potentials <= - 3 kPa) were not significantly
   affected and soil surface sealing was not observed. This was also
   confirmed by the infiltration measurements, where no significant
   differences in saturated hydraulic conductivity were found. From a soil
   conservation point of view, this study indicated that the primary
   tillage operation (i.e. ploughing at the beginning of July) is rather
   disadvantageous: the saturated hydraulic conductivity is not
   significantly affected, but the soil erodibility is considerably higher
   in comparison to a consolidated soil. Furthermore, the beneficial
   effects of the wheat stubble on soil and water conservation are lost by
   the tillage operation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A hazardous leachate from an industrial landfill site is stored in lined
   dams. The TDS (approximately 100 g/l) and the organic concentration
   (approximately 70 g/l COD) of the leachate are high. The high TDS
   concentration of the leachate would make treatment with reverse osmosis
   (RO) very difficult. The leachate also contains high concentrations of
   iron, manganese, barium, strontium and phenolics. This leachate has the
   potential to pollute the water environment, if the dams overflow.
   Therefore, electrodialysis (ED) was evaluated as an alternative
   technology to desalinate/concentrate the leachate for effluent volume
   reduction and pollution control. Physical/chemical pretreatment of the
   leachate with fly ash and chemicals have shown that the fouling
   potential of the leachate for membrane systems could be significantly
   reduced. The AFN anionic membrane from Tokuyama Soda was found to be the
   most resistant anionic membrane towards membrane fouling during tests in
   a membrane fouling test cell. This membrane was then used in a
   laboratory-scale ED stack to evaluate the process for treatment of the
   leachate. It was found that the leachate could be effectively
   desalinated/concentrated with ED. The desalinated effluent was
   significantly less toxic and more biodegradable than the ED feed or
   brine which comprised approximately 38\% of the treated leachate. It
   also appears that it should be possible to Control membrane fouling with
   regular membrane cleanings. Electrodialysis pilot tests were finally
   conducted in the batch and feed-and-bleed modes to develop process
   design criteria for a full-scale application. It was found that an
   excellent quality water could be produced with batch ED treatment
   followed by RO desalination. The treated water is almost of potable
   quality (645 mg/l TDS) except for high COD (935 mg/l). Feed-and-bleed ED
   pilot tests have shown that the TDS of the leachate could be reduced
   from 116,255 mg/l to 2,435 mg/l (5 stage ED). Brine volume comprised
   approximately 41\% of the treated leachate. The capital cost of an 80
   kl/d (feed) ED plant is estimated at 2.38 million US\$. Operational
   costs are estimated at 28.96 US\$/kl.}},

Abstract = {{lsothiocyanates (ITCs) are widely distributed in cruciferous vegetables
   and are biologically active against chemical carcinogenesis due to their
   ability to induce phase 11 conjugating enzymes. Among these is the
   glutathione-S-transferase (GST) family of enzymes, which in turn
   catalyzes the metabolism of ITCs, for which it has high substrate
   specificity. A recent body of epidentiologic data on the inverse
   association between cruciferous vegetable/ITC intake and cancers of the
   colo-rectum, lung and breast, also support that this protective effect
   is greater among individuals who possess the GSTM1 or T1 null genotype,
   and who would be expected to accumulate higher levels of ITC at the
   target tissue level, a pre-requisite for their enzyme-inducing effects.
   The association between ITC and cancer, and its modification by GST
   status, is most consistent for lung cancer and appears to be strongest
   among current smokers. Within limits, a comparison between groups which
   have been stratified by GST genotype may be less susceptible to
   confounding by other variables, given the random assortment of genes in
   gametogenesis. While a more complete understanding of the overall
   effects on health will need to take into account other components such
   as indoles and anti-oxidants, the interaction between ITC intake and GST

Abstract = {{The heterotrimeric eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) plays a
   critical role in the mechanics and regulation of protein synthesis.
   Unlike yeast and archaeal eIF2, the purified baculovirus-expressed
   recombinant human eIF2 subunits used in these studies reveal that the
   alpha- and beta-subunits interact with each other. Consistent with this
   observation, the beta-subunit specifically interacts with the purified
   eIF2B in ELISA studies and this interaction is enhanced when wt eIF2
   alpha in the recombinant trimeric complex is phosphorylated or replaced
   by a mutant phosphomimetic eIF2 alpha (S51D). These findings together
   with other observations raise the possibility that the beta-subunit
   plays a key role in the regulation and function of mammalian eIF2
   complex. PERK, an eIF2 alpha kinase, is found to interact with wt and
   mutants of eIF2a in which the serine 51 or 48 residue is replaced by
   alanine or aspartic acid thereby suggesting that the phosphorylation
   site in the substrate is not important for interaction. Fluorescence
   spectroscopic and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analyses reveal
   that the energy transfer occurs from PERK to eIF2 alpha. The
   dissociation constant of alpha-subunit-PERK complex (K-d alpha-subunit)
   is 0.74 mu M and the interaction is stoichiometric. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the prototypic receptor protein
   tyrosine kinase, is a major regulator of growth and survival for many
   epithelial cell types. We report here that receptor-type
   protein-tyrosine phosphatase-kappa (RPTP-kappa) dephosphorylates EGFR
   and thereby regulates its function in human keratinocytes.
   Protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitors induced EGFR tyrosine
   phosphorylation in intact primary human keratinocytes and cell-free
   membrane preparations. Five highly expressed RPTPs (RPTP-beta, delta,
   kappa, mu, and xi) were functionally analyzed in a Chinese hamster ovary
   (CHO) cell-based expression system. Full-length human EGFR expressed in
   CHO cells, which lack endogenous EGFR, displayed high basal (i.e. in the
   absence of ligand) tyrosine phosphorylation. Co-expression of
   RPTP-kappa, but not other RPTPs, specifically reduced basal EGFR
   tyrosine phosphorylation. RPTP-kappa also reduced epidermal growth
   factor-dependent EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in CHO cells. Purified
   RPTP-kappa preferentially dephosphorylated EGFR tyrosines 1068 and 1173
   in vitro. Overexpression of wild-type or catalytically inactive
   RPTP-kappa reduced or enhanced, respectively, basal and EGF-induced EGFR
   tyrosine phosphorylation in human keratinocytes. Furthermore,
   siRNA-mediated knockdown of RPTP-kappa increased basal and
   EGF-stimulated EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and augmented downstream
   Erk activation in human keratinocytes. RPTP-kappa levels increased in
   keratinocytes as cells reached confluency, and overexpression of
   RPTP-kappa in subconfluent keratinocytes reduced keratinocyte
   proliferation. Taken together, the above data indicate that RPTP-kappa
   is a key regulator of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and function in
   human keratinocytes.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Prophylactic transfusion prevents strokes in children with sickle cell
   anemia who have abnormalities on transcranial Doppler ultrasonographic
   examination. However, it is not known how long transfusion should be
   continued in these children.
   Methods
   We studied children with sickle cell disease who had a high risk of
   stroke on the basis of a transcranial Doppler screening examination and
   who had received transfusions for 30 months or longer, during which time
   the Doppler readings became normal. The children were randomly assigned
   to continued transfusion or no continued transfusion. Children with
   severe stenotic lesions on cerebral magnetic resonance angiography were
   excluded. The composite primary end point was stroke or reversion to a
   result on Doppler examination indicative of a high risk of stroke.
   Results
   The study was stopped after 79 children of a planned enrollment of 100
   underwent randomization. Among the 41 children in the transfusion-halted
   group, high-risk Doppler results developed in 14 and stroke in 2 others
   within a mean (+/-SD) of 4.5+/-2.6 months (range, 2.1 to 10.1) of the
   last transfusion. Neither of these events of the composite end point
   occurred in the 38 children who continued to receive transfusions. The
   average of the last two transcranial Doppler results before transfusion
   was started was the only predictor of the composite end point (P=0.05).
   Conclusions
   Discontinuation of transfusion for the prevention of stroke in children
   with sickle cell disease results in a high rate of reversion to abnormal
   blood-flow velocities on Doppler studies and stroke.}},

Abstract = {{TDDFT/B3LYP and RI-CC2 calculations with different basis sets have been
   performed for vertical and adiabatic excitations and emission properties
   of the lowest singlet states for the neutral (enol and keto), protonated
   and deprotonated forms of 7-hydroxy-4-tnethylcoumarin (7H4MC) in the gas
   phase and in solution. The effect of 7H4MC-solvent (water) interactions
   on the lowest excited and fluorescence states were computed using the
   Polarizable Continuum Method (PCM), 7H4MC-water clusters and a
   combination of both approaches. The calculations revealed that in
   aqueous solution the pi pi{*} energy is the lowest one for excitation
   and fluorescence transitions of all forms of 7H4MC studied. The
   calculated excitation and fluorescence energies in aqueous solution are
   in good agreement with experiment. It was found that, depending on the
   polarity of the medium, the solvent shifts vary, leading to a change in
   the character of the lowest excitation and fluorescence transition. The
   dipole-moment and electron-density changes of the excited states
   relative to the ground state correlate with the solvation effect on the
   singlet excited states and on transition energies, respectively. The
   calculations show that, in contrast to the ground state, the keto form
   has a lower energy in the pi pi{*} state as compared to enol,
   demonstrating from this point of view the energetic possibility of
   proton transfer from the enol to the keto form in the excited state.}},

Abstract = {{Well-defined hexadecylamine (HDA) intercalated structures, either
   interdigitated layers, bilayers, or hybrid layers of both, in a confined
   space of highly functionalized layered (x-zirconium phosphates
   (alpha-ZrPs) have been prepared based on the two-step intercalation
   mechanism and these distinct intercalated structures can serve as a
   model system to investigate the interactions of two monolayers whose
   amphiphilic tails are adjacent to each other. At the first intercalation
   step, the electrostatic interaction between HDAs and alpha-ZrP is
   dominant and results in an interdigitated layer structure (d(001) = 3.0
   nm) and the interdigitated layer is saturated at around Phi = 50\%,
   where Phi is the weight fraction of intercalated HDAs in the
   intergallery of alpha-ZrP. For (D higher than 50\%, the bilayer
   structure (d(001) = 4.3 nm) emerges due to further hydrophobic
   interaction between HDAs initially grafted to alpha-ZrP and unanchored
   HDAs and the relative fraction of the bilayer structure over the
   interdigitated layer increases with the increase in the intercalated
   amount of HDAs. The intriguing morphology of alpha-ZrP tactoids
   intercalated with HDAs in coexisting bilayers and interdigitated layers
   is observed by using microtomed TEM and the two-step intercalation has
   also been verified with TGA and FT-IR. Also, a structural transition
   from the bilayers to the interdigitated layers is monitored by using in
   situ synchrotron WAXS showing that the hydrophobically intercalated HDAs
   are selectively deintercalated at a relatively low decomposition
   temperature around 220 degrees C.}},

   However, distinctive chemical and physical features of the pzs
   differentiate them from either the porphyrins or phthalocyanines, in

Title = {{Mechanics and erosion of basement-cored uplift provinces}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH}},

Abstract = {{Basement-cored uplift provinces are often characterized by high-angle
   reverse faulting along preexisting crustal heterogeneities, which may
   greatly affect the mechanics of deformation and the coupling between
   erosion and orogenic structure. Herein we construct a coupled
   deformation-erosion model to understand the mechanics and erosion of
   mountain belts in which the spatial distribution of deformation is
   largely influenced by the presence of preexisting high-angle faults. In
   this case, deformation is accommodated along, and topography is built
   above, these structures. This topographic loading leads to increasing
   lithostatic stresses beneath these regions. As a result, active
   deformation may migrate to frictionally stronger structures in adjacent
   regions where lithostatic loading is lower. The migration of deformation
   to such nearby structures depends on the Hubbert-Rubey pore fluid
   pressure ratio of the crust (lambda), the orientations of the
   frictionally weaker and stronger preexisting faults (beta(1) and
   beta(2), respectively), the friction coefficients (mu(b1) and mu(b2))
   and Hubbert-Rubey fluid-pressure ratios (lambda(b1) and lambda(b2)) of
   these faults, and the surface slope of the topography above the
   frictionally weaker structure (alpha), assuming zero surface slope above
   the frictionally stronger structure. In general, we found that for a
   given alpha and beta(1), as mu(b1) increases
   lambda=lambda(b1)=lambda(b2) increases, and beta(2) decreases, the value
   of mu(b2) required to force deformation to migrate increases. However,
   as erosional processes lead to decreasing surface slopes, deformation
   will be inhibited from migrating to frictionally stronger structures in
   adjacent regions. Our model results may help to explain some aspects of
   the deformation observed and the possible correlation between
   precipitation and the migration of deformation within these tectonic
   provinces.}},

Abstract = {{The phosphosulfomannan 1 (PI-88) is a mixture of highly sulfated
   oligosaccharides that is currently undergoing clinical evaluation in
   cancer patients. As well as it's anticancer properties, 1 displays a
   number of other interesting biological activities. A series of analogues
   of 1 were synthesized with a single carbon (pentasaccharide) backbone to
   facilitate structural characterization and interpretation of biological
   results. In a fashion similar to 1, all compounds were able to inhibit
   heparanase and to bind tightly to the proangiogenic growth factors
   FGF-1, FGF-2, and VEGF. The compounds also inhibited the infection of
   cells and cell-to-cell spread of herpes simplex virus (HSV-1).
   Preliminary pharmacokinetic data indicated that the compounds displayed
   different pharmacokinetic behavior compared with 1. Of particular note
   was the n-octyl derivative, which was cleared 3 times less rapidly than
   1 and may provide increased systemic exposure.}},

Abstract = {{The Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) was searched through two 3D

   optimizations of 2-(benzimidazol-2-yl)quinoxalines (BIQs, 3) gave the
   best results in terms of potency and selectivity at the A(1) and A(3)

Abstract = {{The difference between quantum and classical survival probabilities for
   molecular dissociation dynamics in the tithe domain, which arises mainly
   from quantum mechanical tunneling, has interesting characteristics that
   are not noticed through the counterpart in energy domain. It is shown
   that the early stage undergoes a fast tunneling, while the later stage
   is characterized with a long-lasting slow tunneling. The mechanism of
   this behavior is analyzed in terms of a quasi-semiclassical theory
   featuring the geometrical distribution of the so-called tunneling
   points. In particular, the role of dynamical tunneling is discussed as a
   phenomenon that typifies the time dependence of tunneling dynamics. It
   is predicted that these tunneling characteristics will be reflected in
   the isotope effect and should be experimentally observable.}},

   transferase 1A}},

Abstract = {{AIM: To elucidate the role of the peroxisome proliferator-activated
   receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) and its target gene carnitine palmitoyl
   acyl-CoA transferase 1A (CPT1A) in the pathogenesis of hepatitis C virus
   (HCV) infection.
   METHODS: Liver samples were collected from the patients with chronic HCV
   infection and controls. HepG2 cells were transfected with vector
   pEF352neo carrying. Two independent clones (clone N3 and N4) stably
   expressing HCV core protein were analyzed. Total RNA was extracted from
   cells and liver tissues. PPAR alpha and CPT1A mRNAs were quantified by
   real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using SYBR Green Master. Total
   extracted proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,
   and electroblotted. Membranes were incubated with the anti-PPAR alpha
   antibody, then with a swine anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish
   peroxidase for PPAR alpha. Protein bands were revealed by an enhanced
   chemiluminescence reaction for PPAR alpha. For immunohistochemical
   staining of PPAR alpha, sections were incubated with the primary goat
   polyclonal antibody directed against PPAR alpha at room temperature.
   RESULTS: Real-time PCR indicated that the PPAR alpha level and
   expression level of CPT1A gene in hepatitis C patients lowered
   significantly as compared with the controls (1.8 +/- 2.8 vs 13 +/- 3.4,
   P = 0.0002; 1.1 +/- 1.5 vs 7.4 +/- 1, P = 0.004). Western blot results
   showed that the level of PPAR alpha protein in the livers of hepatitis C
   patients was lower than that in controls (2.3 +/- 0.3 vs 3.6 +/- 0.2, P
   = 0.009). The immunohistochemical staining results in chronic hepatitis
   C patients indicated a decrease in PPAR alpha staining in hepatocytes
   compared with those in the control livers. The in vitro studies found
   that in the N3 and N4 colon stably expressing HCV core protein, the PPAR
   alpha mRNA levels were significantly lower than that in the controls.
   CONCLUSION: The impaired intrahepatic PPAR alpha expression is
   associated with the pathogenic mechanism in hepatic injury during
   chronic HCV infection. HCV infection reduced the expression of PPAR
   alpha and CPT1A at the level of not only mRNAs but also proteins. PPAR
   alpha plays an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic HCV
   infection, but the impaired function of this nuclear receptor in HCV
   infection needs further studies. (C) 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier

Abstract = {{Milling fractions from conventional and transgenic corn were prepared at
   laboratory scale and used to study the influence of sample composition
   and heat-induced DNA degradation on the relative quantification of
   genetically modified organisms (GMO) in food products. Particle size
   distributions of the obtained fractions (coarse grits, regular grits,
   meal, and flour) were characterized using a laser diffraction system.
   The application of two DNA isolation protocols revealed a strong
   correlation between the degree of comminution of the milling fractions
   and the DNA yield in the extracts. Mixtures of milling fractions from
   conventional and transgenic material (1\%) were prepared and analyzed
   via real-time polymerase chain reaction. Accurate quantification of the
   adjusted GMO content was only possible in mixtures containing
   conventional and transgenic material in the form of analogous milling
   fractions, whereas mixtures of fractions exhibiting different particle
   size distributions delivered significantly over- and underestimated GMO
   contents depending on their compositions. The process of heat-induced
   nucleic acid degradation was followed by applying two established
   quantitative assays showing differences between the lengths of the
   recombinant and reference target sequences (A, Delta/(A) = -25 bp; B,
   Delta/(B) = +16 bp; values related to the amplicon length of the
   reference gene). Data obtained by the application of method A resulted
   in underestimated recoveries of GMO contents in the samples of
   heat-treated products, reflecting the favored degradation of the longer
   target sequence used for the detection of the transgene. In contrast,
   data yielded by the application of method B resulted in increasingly
   overestimated recoveries of GMO contents. The results show how commonly
   used food technological processes may lead to distortions in the results
   of quantitative GMO analyses.}},

   Delta S-1(not equal) = -41.4 +/- 10.8 J K-1 mol(-1) and Delta H--1(not
   equal) = 72.5 +/- 2.4 kJ mol(-1), Delta S--1(not equal) = 46.7 +/- 11.1
   J K-1 mol(-1) for the forward and reverse reaction, respectively, and
   the binding parameters of O-2 Delta H degrees = -32.2 +/- 2.2 U mol(-1)
   and Delta S degrees = -88.1 +/- 10.7 J K-1 mol(-1). The hydroxylation of
   a series of p-substituted phenolate salts by (Cu-2(MeL66)O-2](2+)
   studied in acetone at -55 degrees C indicates that the reaction occurs
   with an electrophilic aromatic substitution mechanism, with a Hammett
   constant rho = -1.84. The temperature dependence of the phenol
   hydroxylation was studied between -84 and -70 degrees C for a range of
   sodium p-cyanophenolate concentrations. The rate plots were hyperbolic
   and enabled to derive the activation parameters for the monophenolase
   reaction Delta H-ox(not equal) = 29.1 +/- 3.0 kJ mol(-1), Delta S-ox(not
   equal) = -115 +/- 15 J K-1 mol-1, and the binding parameters of the
   phenolate to the mu-peroxo species Delta H-b degrees = -8.1 +/- 1.2 kJ
   mol(-1) and Delta S-b degrees = -8.9 +/- 6.2 J K-1 mol(-1). Thus, the
   complete set of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for the two
   separate steps of O-2 binding and phenol hydroxylation have been
   obtained for {[}Cu-2(MeL66)](2+).}},

Abstract = {{The secondary structure of Kluyveromyces lactis beta-galactosidase was
   determined by circular dichroism. It is mainly a beta-type protein,
   having 22\% beta-turns, 14\% parallel beta-sheet, 25\% antiparallel
   beta-sheet, 34\% unordered structure, and only 5\% alpha-helix. The
   structure-activity relationship as a function of the pH was also
   studied. The pH conditions leading to the highest secondary structure
   content (100\% ellipticity) of the enzyme was found at pH 7.0; at pH
   6.5-7.0, the percent ellipticity decreased slightly, suggesting little
   structural change, but the activity decreased significantly, probably
   because of variations in critical residues. On the other hand, at pH's
   above 7.0, a more noticeable change in ellipticity was observed due to
   structural changes; the CD analysis showed a small increase in the
   helical content toward higher pH, whereas the maximum activity was found
   at pH 7.5, meaning that the changes produced in the secondary structure
   at this pH favored the interaction between the enzyme and the substrate.}},

Abstract = {{AIM: To investigate the expression of leptin and leptin receptor (ob-R)
   in intestinal-type gastric cancer and precancerous lesions, and to
   explore the possible mechanism and role of the leptin system in
   developing intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinoma.
   METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed to examine the expression of
   leptin and leptin receptor in archival samples of gastric adenocarcinoma
   and preneoplastic lesions, including intestinal metaplasia and mild to
   severe gastric epithelial dysplasia. Positive staining was identified
   and percentage of positive staining was graded.
   RESULTS: Dual expression of leptin and leptin receptor were detected in
   80\% (16/20) intestinal metaplasia, 86.3\% (25/30) mild gastric
   epithelial dysplasia, 86.7\% (26/30) moderate gastric epithelial
   dysplasia, 93.3\% (28/30) severe gastric epithelial dysplasia, 91.3\%
   (55/60) intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinoma and 30.0\% (9/30)
   diffuse-type gastric carcinoma. The percentage of dual expression of
   leptin and leptin receptor in intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinoma was
   significantly higher than that in diffuse-type gastric adenocarcinoma
   (chi(2) = 37.022, P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSION: Our results indicate the presence of an autocrine loop of
   leptin system in the development of intestinal-type gastric
   adenocarcinoma. (C) 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Global expression profiles of a consecutive series of 121 childhood
   acute leukemias (87 B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias, 11 T cell
   acute lymphoblastic leukemias, and 23 acute myeloid leukemias), six
   normal bone marrows, and 10 normal hematopoietic subpopulations of
   different lineages and maturations were ascertained by using 27K cDNA
   microarrays. Unsupervised analyses revealed segregation according to
   lineages and primary genetic changes, i.e., TCF3(E2A)/PBX1, IGH@/MYC,
   ETV6(TEL)/RUNX1(AML1), 11q231MLL, and hyperdiploidy (> 50 chromosomes).
   Supervised discriminatory analyses were used to identify differentially
   expressed genes correlating with lineage and primary genetic change. The
   gene-expression profiles of normal hematopoietic cells were also
   studied. By using principal component analyses (PCA), a differentiation
   axis was exposed, reflecting lineages and maturation stages of normal
   hematopoietic cells. By applying the three principal components obtained
   from PCA of the normal cells on the leukemic samples, similarities
   between malignant and normal cell lineages and maturations were
   investigated. Apart from showing that leukemias segregate according to
   lineage and genetic subtype, we provide an extensive study of the genes
   correlating with primary genetic changes. We also investigated the
   expression pattern of these genes in normal hematopoietic cells of
   different lineages and maturations, identifying genes preferentially
   expressed by the leukemic cells, suggesting an ectopic activation of a
   large number of genes, likely to reflect regulatory networks of
   pathogenetic importance that also may provide attractive targets for
   future directed therapies.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a method that uses on-line microdialysis sampling
   coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine
   arbutin in whitening cosmetics. The optimum analytical conditions for
   microdialysis sampling were a probe length of 10 mm and a dialysis
   flow-rate of 5 mu l min(-1). The accuracy (\% bias) for intra-day (n =
   6) and inter-day (it = 30, five consecutive days) analyses ranged from
   -8.9 to 11.5\%, with a precision below 7.64\% R.S.D. The calibration
   curve was linear within the range from 0.1 to 20 mM (R-2 = 0.9989). The
   detection limit was 15 mu M. By comparing the arbutin levels determined
   this way in the whitening cosmetics with the results obtained from the
   no-net-flux method, we conclude that our proposed on-line
   microdialysis-HPLC system displays good accuracy. We evaluated the
   robustness of our optimum conditions by means of a Plackett-Burman
   design. Apart from the effect of a low flow-rate of perfusate-an
   increase of 12.52 +/- 2.31\%-we observed no significant changes in the
   analyses upon changing the levels of any other parameter. Because this
   on-line method offers the advantages of simplicity, reliability, the
   lack of any tedious sample pretreatment process, and a reduced use of
   organic solvents, we believe that it is suitable for the routine
   analysis of commercial cosmetics. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Much evidence indicates that women have a higher risk of developing
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) than do men. The reason for this gender
   difference is unclear. We hypothesize that estrogen deficiency in the
   brains of women with AD may be a key risk factor. In rapidly acquired
   postmortem brains from women with AD, we found greatly reduced estrogen
   levels compared with those from age- and gender-matched normal control
   subjects; AD and control subjects had comparably low levels of serum
   estrogen. We examined the onset and severity of AD pathology associated
   with estrogen depletion by using a gene-based approach, by crossing the
   estrogen-synthesizing enzyme aromatase gene knockout mice with APP23
   transgenic mice, a mouse model of AD, to produce estrogen-deficient
   APP23 mice. Compared with APP23 transgenic control mice,
   estrogen-deficient APP23 mice exhibited greatly reduced brain estrogen
   and early-onset and increased beta amyloid peptide (A beta) deposition.
   These mice also exhibited increased A beta production, and microglia
   cultures prepared from the brains of these mice were impaired in A beta
   clearance/degradation. In contrast, ovariectomized APP23 mice exhibited
   plaque pathology similar to that observed in the APP23 transgenic
   control mice. Our results indicate that estrogen depletion in the brain
   may be a significant risk factor for developing AD neuropathology.}},

Title = {{Ionization of zwitterionic amine substrates bound to monomeric sarcosine

Volume = {{44}},

Month = {{DEC 27}},
Abstract = {{Monomeric sarcosine oxidase (MSOX) binds the L-proline zwitterion (pK(a)
   = 10.6). The reactive substrate anion is generated by ionization of the
   ES complex (pK(a) = 8.0). Tyr317 was mutated to Phe to determine whether
   this step might involve proton transfer to an active site base. The
   mutation does not eliminate the ionizable group in the ES complex (pK(a)
   = 8.9) but does cause a 20-fold decrease in the maximum rate of the
   reductive half-reaction. Kinetically determined K-d values for the ES
   complex formed with L-proline agree with results obtained in spectral
   titrations with the wild-type or mutant enzyme. Unlike the wild-type
   enzyme, K-d values with the mutant enzyme are pH-dependent, suggesting
   that the mutation has perturbed the pK(a) of a group that affects the
   K-d. As compared with the wild-type enzyme, an increase in charge
   transfer band energy is observed for mutant enzyme complexes with
   substrate analogues while a 10-fold decrease in the charge transfer band
   extinction coefficient is found for the complex with the L-proline
   anion. The results eliminate Tyr317 as a possible acceptor of the proton
   released upon substrate ionization. Since previous studies rule out the
   only other nearby base, we conclude that L-proline is the ionizable
   group in the ES complex and that amino acids are activated for oxidation
   upon binding to MSOX by stabilization of the reactive substrate anion.
   Tyr317 may play a role in substrate activation and optimizing binding,
   as judged by the effects of its mutation on the observed pK(a), reaction
   rates, and charge transfer bands.}},

Abstract = {{The first crystallographic data for a-bonded alkylcobalt(III)
   phthalocyanine complexes are reported. A single-crystal X-ray structure
   of (CH3CH2COPC)-P-III (PC = dianion of phthalocyanine) reveals that the
   solid consists of centrosymmetric face-to-face dimers in which the
   (CH3CH2COPc)-Pc-III units retain their square pyramidal geometry. The
   structure appears to be the first one reported for a five-coordinate
   RCo(III)(chelate) complex with an electron-deficient equatorial system.
   The Co-C bond in (CH3CH2COPC)-P-III (2.031(5) angstrom) is the longest
   found in five-coordinate RCoIII(chel) complexes (R = simple primary
   alkyl group). Another X-ray study demonstrates that (CH3COPc)-Pc-III(py)
   has a distorted octahedral geometry with axial bonds of very similar
   length to those in methylcobalamin. The axial bonds are shorter than
   those in its octaethylporphyrin analogue, in accordance with a weaker
   trans axial influence in six-coordinate complexes containing an
   electron-deficient phthalocyanine equatorial ligand. A different trend
   has been observed for fivecoordinate RCoIII(chel) complexes:
   electron-rich equatorial systems seem to make the Co-C axial bond
   shorter. Kinetic data for the homolysis of (RCoPc)-Pc-III complexes (R =
   Me, Et) in dimethylacetamide are also reported. Homolysis of ethyl
   derivatives is faster. The Co-C bond dissociation energies (BDEs) for
   the pyridine adducts of the methyl and the ethyl derivative are 30 +/- 1
   and 29 +/- 1 kcal/mol, respectively. The BDE for CH3COPc(py) is
   considerably lower than that for MeCbl despite the very similar lengths
   of the axial bonds in the two complexes. The results of this work do not
   support any correlation between the Co-C bond length and the bond
   strength as defined by BDE.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{545}},
Pages = {{67-111}},
Month = {{DEC 25}},
Abstract = {{The interaction between a fixed particle and decaying homogeneous
   isotropic turbulence is studied numerically using an overset grid that
   provides resolution of all scales of fluid motion. A description of the
   numerical technique and validation of the solution procedure are
   presented. An ensemble of 64 simulations with the particle in different
   regions of the flow is computed. The particle diameter in the
   simulations is approximately twice the size of the unladen Kolmogorov
   length scale, and the maximum value of the particle Reynolds numbers due
   to the turbulent fluctuations is close to 20. Ensemble averages of
   quantities from the numerical solutions are used to investigate the
   turbulence modification and the fluid forces on the particle.
   Volume-averaged profiles of the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation
   rate from the overset grid simulations reveal that the displacement of
   fluid by the particle and the formation of the boundary layer at the
   particle surface lead to turbulence modification in a local region. Time
   histories of the force applied to the particle from each overset grid
   simulation are compared to those predicted by a particle equation of
   motion. The particle equation of motion is shown to underpredict the
   root mean square (RMS) force applied to the particle by the turbulence.
   RMS errors between the forces from the overset grid simulation and those
   predicted by the particle equation of motion are shown to be between 15
   \% and 30 \% of the RMS force on the particle. The steady viscous drag
   force is shown to be the dominant term in the particle equation of
   motion while the history integral term is negligible.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},

Volume = {{545}},
Pages = {{1-27}},
Month = {{DEC 25}},
Abstract = {{Numerical simulations of the collapse and spreading of granular columns
   onto a horizontal plane using the Contact Dynamics method are presented.
   The results are in agreement with previous experimental work. The final
   shape of the deposit appears to depend only on the initial aspect ratio
   a of the column. The normalized runout distance has a power-law
   dependence on the aspect ratio a, a dependence incompatible with a
   simple friction model. The dynamics of the collapse is shown to be
   mostly controlled by a free fall of the column. Energy dissipation at
   the base of the column can be described simply by a coefficient of
   restitution. Hence the energy available for the sideways flow is
   proportional to the initial potential energy Eo. The dissipation process
   within the sideways flow is approximated well by basal friction, unlike
   the behaviour of the runout distance. The proportion of mass ejected
   sideways is shown to play a determining role in the spreading process:
   as a increases, the same fraction of initial potential energy Eo drives
   an increasing proportion of the initial mass against friction. This
   gives a possible explanation for the power-law dependence of the runout
   distance on a. We propose a new scaling for the runout distance that
   matches the data well, is compatible with a friction model, and provides
   a qualitative explanation of the column collapse.}},

Abstract = {{Formation of new vessels from pre-existing capillaries demands extensive
   reprogramming of endothelial cells through transcriptional and
   post-transcriptional events. We show that 120 protein spots in a
   two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/electrophoretic analysis were
   affected during vascular endothelial growth factor-A-induced endothelial
   cell tubular morphogenesis in vitro, as a result of changes in charge or
   expression level of the corresponding proteins. For about 22\% of the
   spots, the protein products could be identified, of which several
   previously have been implicated in cytoskeletal reorganization and
   angiogenesis. One such protein was heat shock protein 27, a chaperone
   involved in beta-actin rearrangement that was identified as regulated in
   degree of serine phosphorylation. We also identified regulation of
   chloride intracellular channel 4 (CLIC4), the expression of which
   decreased during tubular morphogenesis. CLIC4 was expressed at high
   levels in resting vessels, whereas expression was modulated during
   pathological angiogenesis such as in tumor vessels. The subcellular
   localization of CLIC4 in endothelial cells was dependent on whether
   cells were engaged in proliferation or tube formation. Antisense- and
   small interfering RNA-mediated suppression of CLIC4 expression led to
   arrest in tubular morphogenesis. Our data implicate CLIC4 in formation
   of a vessel lumen.}},

Abstract = {{In a genetic screen for Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants hypersensitive
   to the inositol-depleting drugs lithium and valproate, a loss of
   function allele of TPI1 was identified. The TPI1 gene encodes triose
   phosphate isomerase, which catalyzes the interconversion of
   dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. A
   single mutation (N65K) in tpi1 completely abolished Tpi1p enzyme
   activity and led to a 30-fold increase in the intracellular DHAP
   concentration. The tpi1 mutant was unable to grow in the absence of
   inositol and exhibited the ``inositol-less death{''} phenotype.
   Similarly, the pgk1 mutant, which accumulates DHAP as a result of

Abstract = {{Current research in drug discovery from medicinal plants involves a
   multifaceted approach combining botanical, phytochemical, biological,
   and molecular techniques. Medicinal plant drug discovery continues to
   provide new and important leads against various pharmacological targets
   including cancer, HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer's, malaria, and pain. Several
   natural product drugs of plant origin have either recently been
   introduced to the United States market, including arteether,
   galantamine, nitisinone, and tiotropium, or are currently involved in
   late-phase clinical trials. As part of our National Cooperative Drug
   Discovery Group (NCDDG) research project, numerous compounds from
   tropical rainforest plant species with potential anticancer activity
   have been identified. Our group has also isolated several compounds,
   mainly from edible plant species or plants used as dietary supplements,
   that may act as chemopreventive agents. Although drug discovery from
   medicinal plants continues to provide an important source of new drug
   leads, numerous challenges are encountered including the procurement of
   plant materials, the selection and implementation of appropriate
   high-throughput screening bioassays, and the scale-up of active
   compounds. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric aerosols cause scattering and absorption of incoming solar
   radiation. Additional anthropogenic aerosols released into the
   atmosphere thus exert a direct radiative forcing on the climate
   system(1). The degree of present-day aerosol forcing is estimated from
   global models that incorporate a representation of the aerosol
   cycles(1-3). Although the models are compared and validated against
   observations, these estimates remain uncertain. Previous satellite
   measurements of the direct effect of aerosols contained limited
   information about aerosol type, and were confined to oceans only(4,5).
   Here we use state-of-the-art satellite-based measurements of
   aerosols(6-8) and surface wind speed(9) to estimate the clear-sky direct
   radiative forcing for 2002, incorporating measurements over land and
   ocean. We use a Monte Carlo approach to account for uncertainties in
   aerosol measurements and in the algorithm used. Probability density
   functions obtained for the direct radiative forcing at the top of the
   atmosphere give a clear-sky, global, annual average of -1.9 W m(-2) with
   standard deviation, +/-0.3 W m(-2). These results suggest that
   present-day direct radiative forcing is stronger than present model
   estimates, implying future atmospheric warming greater than is presently
   predicted, as aerosol emissions continue to decline(10).}},

Abstract = {{A new type of waveguide lattice that relies on the effect of bandgap
   guidance, rather than total internal reflection, in the regions between
   the waveguide defects is proposed. Two different setting, for low index
   and high index defects are suggested. We analyze the linear bandgap and
   diffraction properties of such lattices. In the nonlinear regime the
   Kerr effect can counteract diffraction leading to the formation of gap
   lattice solitons. Interestingly enough, in the case of low index
   defects, stable soliton solutions are localized in the low index areas.
   This finding challenges the widely accepted idea that stable solitons
   can be sustained in high refractive index regions. In addition, in the
   case of high index defects, the coupling coefficient can become
   negative. Physical settings where the linear and nonlinear properties
   for bandgap lattices can be experimentally realized are presented. (c)

Abstract = {{Ron, the tyrosine kinase receptor for the Macrophage-stimulating
   protein, is involved in cell dissociation, motility, and matrix
   invasion. Delta Ron, a constitutively active isoform that confers
   increased motility to expressing cells, is generated through the
   skipping of exon 11. We show that abnormal accumulation of Delta Ron
   mRNA occurs in breast and colon tumors. Skipping of exon 11 is
   controlled by a silencer and an enhancer of splicing located in the
   constitutive exon 12. The strength of the enhancer parallels the
   relative abundance of A Ron mRNA and depends on a sequence directly
   bound by splicing factor SF2/ASF. Overexpression and RNAi experiments
   demonstrate that SF2/ASF, by controlling the production of Delta Ron,
   activates epithelial to mesenchymal transition leading to cell
   locomotion. The effect of SF2/ASF overexpression is reverted by specific
   knockdown of Delta Ron mRNA. This demonstrates a direct link between
   SF2/ASF-regulated splicing and cell motility, an activity important for
   embryogenesis, tissue formation, and tumor metastasis.}},

Abstract = {{The atomistic origin of fatigue failure in micron-sized silicon devices
   is not fully understood. Two series of density-functional theory
   calculations on cubic diamond Si explore the effect of surface bond
   formation on crack healing in systems which exhibit strong surface
   reconstruction. Both series introduce a separation between Si(100)
   layers (i.e., the crack) and allow the ions to relax to their
   minimum-energy configuration. The initial surface ionic positions are
   either bulk terminated or 2x1 reconstructed. A plot of the energy versus
   the introduced separation reveals that once the surfaces reconstruct,
   the crack is no longer able to return to the equilibrium configuration.
   Rather, the healed crack interface contains defects which places the
   flawed energy minimum at a finite strain of 3\% and an increased energy
   of 1.13 J/m(2) relative to the equilibrium configuration. The
   irreversible plastic deformation supports the mechanism proposed by Kahn

Abstract = {{An investigation into the dynamics and layer structure of the postsunset
   ionosphere prior to the onset of equatorial spread F (ESF) took place
   during the NASA EQUIS II campaign on Kwajalein Atoll on August 7 and 15,
   2004. On both nights, an instrumented rocket measured plasma number
   density and vector electric fields to an apogee of about 450 km. Two
   chemical release rockets were launched both nights to measure lower
   thermospheric wind profiles. The Altair UHF/VHF radar was used to
   monitor coherent and incoherent scatter. In both experiments, strong
   plasma shear flow was detected. Periodic, patchy bottom-type scattering
   layers were observed in the westward-drifting plasma below the shear
   nodes. The large-scale plasma depletions that formed later during ESF
   reproduced the periodic structure of the original, precursor layers. The
   layers were therefore predictive of the ESF that followed. We surmise
   that collisional shear instabilities may have given rise to large-scale
   plasma waves that were highlighted by the bottom-type layer structure
   and that preconditioned the postsunset ionosphere for ESF.}},

Abstract = {{Growth of fast myotomal muscle in teleosts involves the continuous

   maximum diameter (D-max) of fast muscle fibres in 4-year-old Bleke
   salmon (25-28 cm fork length) was 119 mu m and not significantly
   different from that found in immature migratory salmon of a similar
   size. In contrast no evidence for active fibre recruitment was found in
   the Bleke salmon, such that the maximum fibre number, FNmax, was only
   21-30\% of that reported in typical farmed and wild migratory
   populations, respectively. We hypothesise that, once established, the

Abstract = {{Why do females of many species mate with more than one male? One of the
   main hypotheses suggests that female promiscuity is an insurance
   mechanism against the potential detrimental effects of inbreeding.
   Accordingly, females should preferably mate with less related males in
   multiple or extrapair mating. Here we analyse paternity, relatedness
   among mating partners, and relatedness between parents and offspring, in
   the socially monogamous North American barn swallow (Hirundo rustica
   erythrogaster). In contrast to the inbreeding avoidance hypothesis, we
   found that extrapair mating partners were more related than expected by
   random choice, and tended to be more related than social partners.
   Furthermore, extrapair mating resulted in genetic parents being more
   related to their extrapair young than to their withinpair young. We
   propose a new hypothesis for extrapair mating based on kin selection
   theory as a possible explanation to these findings.}},

Abstract = {{Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity discovered sediments with layered
   structures thought to be unique to aqueous deposition and with minerals
   attributed to evaporation of an acidic salty sea. Remarkable iron-rich
   spherules were ascribed to later groundwater alteration, and the
   inferred abundance of water reinforced optimism that Mars was once
   habitable. The layered structures, however, are not unique to water
   deposition, and the scenario encounters difficulties in accounting for
   highly soluble salts admixed with less soluble salts, the lack of clay
   minerals from acid - rock reactions, high sphericity and near- uniform
   sizes of the spherules and the absence of a basin boundary. Here we
   present a simple alternative explanation involving deposition from a
   ground-hugging turbulent flow of rock fragments, salts, sulphides,
   brines and ice produced by meteorite impact. Subsequent weathering by
   intergranular water films can account for all of the features observed
   without invoking shallow seas, lakes or near- surface aquifers. Layered
   sequences observed elsewhere on heavily cratered Mars and attributed to
   wind, water or volcanism may well have formed similarly. If so, the
   search for past life on Mars should be reassessed accordingly.}},

Abstract = {{Input to the central nervous system from olfactory sensory neurons
   (OSNs) is modulated presynaptically. We investigated the functional
   organization of this inhibition and its role in odor coding by imaging
   neurotransmitter release from OSNs in slices and in vivo in mice
   expressing synaptopHluorin, an optical indicator of vesicle exocytosis.
   Release from OSNs was strongly suppressed by heterosynaptic,
   intraglomerular inhibition. In contrast, inhibitory connections between
   glomeruli mediated only weak lateral inhibition of OSN inputs in slices
   and did not do so in response to odorant stimulation in vivo. Blocking
   presynaptic inhibition in vivo increased the amplitude of odorant-evoked
   input to glomeruli but had little effect on spatial patterns of
   glomerular input. Thus, intraglomerular inhibition limits the strength
   of olfactory input to the CNS, whereas interglomerular inhibition plays
   little or no role. This organization allows for control of input
   sensitivity while maintaining the spatial maps of glomerular activity
   thought to encode odorant identity.}},

Title = {{Long-term air pollution exposure and living close to busy roads are
   associated with COPD in women}},
Journal = {{RESPIRATORY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Lung function and exacerbations of chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease (COPD) have been associated with short-term exposure
   to air pollution. However, the effect of long-term exposure to
   particulate matter from industry and traffic on COPD as defined by lung
   function has not been evaluated so far. Our study was designed to
   investigate the influence of long-term exposure to air pollution on
   respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function in 55-year-old women. We
   especially focused on COPD as defined by GOLD criteria and additionally
   compared the effects of air pollution on respiratory symptoms by
   questionnaire data and by lung function measurements.
   Methods: In consecutive cross sectional studies conducted between
   1985-1994, we investigated 4757 women living in the Rhine-Ruhr Basin of
   Germany. NO2 and PM10 exposure was assessed by measurements done in an 8
   km grid, and traffic exposure by distance from the residential address
   to the nearest major road using Geographic Information System data. Lung
   function was determined and COPD was defined by using the GOLD criteria.
   Chronic respiratory symptoms and possible confounders were defined by
   questionnaire data. Linear and logistic regressions, including random
   effects were used to account for confounding and clustering on city
   level.
   Results: The prevalence of COPD (GOLD stages 1-4) was 4.5\%. COPD and
   pulmonary function were strongest affected by PM10 and traffic related
   exposure. A 7 mu g/m(3) increase in five year means of PM10
   (interquartile range) was associated with a 5.1\% (95\% CI 2.5\%-7.7\%)
   decrease in FEV1, a 3.7\% (95\% CI 1.8\%-5.5\%) decrease in FVC and an
   odds ratio (OR) of 1.33 (95\% CI 1.03-1.72) for COPD. Women living less
   than 100 m from a busy road also had a significantly decreased lung
   function and COPD was 1.79 times more likely (95\% CI 1.06-3.02) than
   for those living farther away. Chronic symptoms as based on
   questionnaire information showed effects in the same direction, but less
   pronounced.
   Conclusion: Chronic exposure to PM10, NO2 and living near a major road
   might increase the risk of developing COPD and can have a detrimental
   effect on lung function.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a monodispersed Rayleigh droplet beam of water droplets
   doped with proteins. An intense infrared laser is used to align these

   the angular spread of alignment in thermal equilibrium, and relaxation
   phenomena, particularly the damping of oscillations excited as the
   molecules enter the field. The possibility of adiabatic alignment is
   also considered. We find that damping times in a high-pressure gas cell
   as used in x-ray-diffraction experiments are short compared with the
   time taken for molecules to traverse the beam and that a suitably shaped
   field might be used for electron-diffraction experiments in vacuum to
   provide adiabatic alignment, thus obviating the need for a damping gas

Abstract = {{Polarized light passing through a supercooled binary liquid mixture
   sample is analyzed during the moment of the nucleation of the crystal
   phase to determine whether the stable equilibrium crystal is nucleated,
   or whether a transient phase of different composition or broken-symmetry

   heterogeneous nucleation of a supercooled clathrate-forming liquid
   mixture, tetrahydrofuran (THF)/water, compared with ice nucleating from
   pure supercooled water. The new experimental results are consistent with
   the hypothesis that the equilibrium clathrate hydrate crystal is
   nucleated directly, with no transient phase detected on the time scale
   of these experiments.}},

Abstract = {{We report a neutron-scattering study to characterize the ordering and
   local dynamics of spherical micelles formed by the triblock copolymer
   polyethylene oxide (PEO)-polypropylene oxide (PPO)-polyethylene oxide
   (Pluronic) in aqueous solution. The study focuses on two Pluronic
   species, F68 and F108, that have the same weight fraction of PEO but
   that differ in chain length by approximately a factor of 2. At
   sufficiently high concentration, both species undergo a sequence of
   phase changes with increasing temperature from dissolved chains to
   micelles with liquidlike order to a cubic crystal phase and finally back
   to a micelle liquid phase. A comparison of the phase diagrams
   constructed from small-angle neutron scattering indicates that
   crystallization is suppressed for shorter chain micelles due to
   fluctuation effects. The intermediate scattering function I(Q,t)/I(Q,0)
   determined by neutron spin echo displays a line shape with two distinct
   relaxations. Comparisons between I(Q,t)/I(Q,0) for fully hydrogenated
   F68 chains in D2O and for F68 with deuterated PEO blocks reveal that the
   slower relaxation corresponds to Rouse modes of the PPO segments in the
   concentrated micelle cores. The faster relaxation is identified with
   longitudinal diffusive modes in the PEO corona characteristic of a
   polymer brush. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{A new generation of thin-film shape memory alloys (SMA) has been
   developed with less than 2 gin thickness for MEMS microactuator
   applications. In this study, thin-film TiPdNi SMA was processed using
   ion beam assisted deposition (IBAD) with and without in situ heat
   treatment. As-deposited films were found to be amorphous. Postdeposition
   annealing lead to bulk diffusion of palladium to the substrate interface
   and silicon into the bulk film, creating a porous cross section. Various
   forms of tensile failures were observed including decohesion and
   delamination as a result of postdeposition annealing. Effect of heating
   and cooling rates was studied as well as in situ heat treatment during
   deposition. Deposition using the MAD technique with in situ heat
   treatment was successful in producing fully martensitic films 1.5 gm
   thick and with reduced grain size and film defects, compared to the
   other sputter deposited films and EBAD deposited followed by
   postdeposition heat treatment. The effects of various processing

Abstract = {{The OneDose (TM) Patient Dosimetry System (Sicel Technologies) is a new
   dosimeter based on metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor
   technology and designed for the in vivo measurement of patient dose
   during radiotherapy. In vivo dosimetry for total body irradiation (TBI)
   is challenging due to the extended treatment distance, low dose rates
   and beam spoilers. Phantom results confirm the suitability of the
   dosimeter for TBI in terms of inherent build-up, post-irradiation
   fading, accuracy, reproducibility, linearity and temperature dependence.
   Directional dependence is significant and should be taken into account.
   The OneDose (TM) dosimeters were also trialed in vivo for two TBI
   patients and the dose measured compared to conventional dosimeter
   measurements using an ionization chamber and thermoluminescent
   dosimeters (TLD), with agreement to within 2.2\% and 3.9\%,
   respectively. Phantom and patient results confirm that the OneDose (TM)
   patient dosimetry system is a practical and convenient alternative to
   TLDs for TBI in vivo dosimetry. For increased confidence in results with
   this dosimeter, we recommend that two dosimeters be used for each site

Abstract = {{Recent developments in micro-CT have revolutionized the ability to
   examine in vivo living experimental animal models such as mouse with a
   spatial resolution less than 50 mu m. The main requirements of in vivo
   imaging for biological researchers are a good spatial resolution, a low
   dose induced to the animal during the full examination and a reduced
   acquisition and reconstruction time for screening purposes. We introduce
   inline acquisition and reconstruction architecture to obtain in real
   time the 3D attenuation map of the animal fulfilling the three previous
   requirements. The micro-CT system is based on commercially available
   x-ray detector and micro-focus x-ray source. The reconstruction
   architecture is based on a cluster of PCs where a dedicated
   communication scheme combining serial and parallel treatments is
   implemented. In order to obtain high performance transmission rate
   between the detector and the reconstruction architecture, a dedicated
   data acquisition system is also developed. With the proposed solution,
   the time required to filter and backproject a projection of 2048 x 2048
   pixels inside a volume of 140 mega voxels using the Feldkamp algorithm
   is similar to 500 ms, the time needed to acquire the same projection.}},

Abstract = {{Context Recent reports suggest an increasing occurrence and severity of
   Clostridium difficile-associated disease. We assessed whether the use of
   gastric acid-suppressive agents is associated with an increased risk in
   the community.
   Objective To determine whether the use of gastric acid-suppressive
   agents increases the risk of C difficile-associated disease in a
   community population.
   Design, Setting, and Patients We conducted 2 population-based
   case-control studies using the United Kingdom General Practice Research
   Database (GPRD). In the first study we identified all 1672 cases of C
   difficile recorded between 1994 and 2004 among all patients registered
   for at least 2 years in each practice. Each case was matched to 10
   controls on calendar time and the general practice. In the second study,
   a subset of these cases defined as community-acquired, that is, not
   hospitalized in the prior year, were matched on practice and age with
   controls also not hospitalized in the prior year.
   Main Outcome Measures The incidence of C difficile and risk associated
   with gastric acid-suppressive agent use.
   Results The incidence of C difficile in patients diagnosed by their
   general practitioners in the General Practice Research Database
   increased from less than 1 case per 100 000 in 1994 to 22 per 100 000 in
   2004. The adjusted rate ratio of C difficile-associated disease with
   current use of proton pump inhibitors was 2.9 (95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI], 2.4-3.4) and with H-2-receptor antagonists the rate ratio was
   2.0 (95\% Cl, 1.6-2.7). An elevated rate was also found with the use of
   nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (rate ratio, 1.3; 95\% Cl,
   1.2-1.5).
   Conclusions The use of acid-suppressive therapy, particularly proton
   pump inhibitors, is associated with an increased risk of
   community-acquired C difficile. The unexpected increase in risk with
   nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use should be investigated further.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present and validate a framework, based on deformable
   image registration, for automatic processing of serial three-dimensional
   CT images used in image-guided radiation therapy. A major assumption in
   deformable image registration has been that, if two images are being
   registered, every point of one image corresponds appropriately to some
   point in the other. For intra-treatment images of the prostate, however,
   this assumption is violated by the variable presence of bowel gas. The
   framework presented here explicitly extends previous deformable image
   registration algorithms to accommodate such regions in the image for
   which no correspondence exists. We show how to use our registration
   technique as a tool for organ segmentation, and present a statistical
   analysis of this segmentation method, validating it by comparison with
   multiple human raters. We also show how the deformable registration
   technique can be used to determine the dosimetric effect of a given plan
   in the presence of non-rigid tissue motion. In addition to dose
   accumulation, we describe a method for estimating the biological effects
   of tissue motion using a linear-quadratic model. This work is described
   in the context of a prostate treatment protocol, but it is of general
   applicability.}},

Abstract = {{AIM: To analyze the relationship between perisinusoidal stellate cell
   (PSC) activation and the dietary fat quantity and composition in the
   treatment of hepatic steatosis.
   METHODS: Using an experimental rat model of steatosis based on the
   intake of a hyperlipidic diet (14\% fat as olive oil or sunflower oil,
   HL-O and HL-S, respectively), we analyzed the liver's capability of
   recovery after the treatment with a normal-lipidic diet (5\% fat as
   olive oil or sunflower oil, NL-O and NL-S, respectively) by
   immunocytochemical and Western blot analysis of glial fibrillary acidic
   protein (GFAP) expression in PSCs, collagen quantification and serum
   aminotransferase determination.
   RESULTS: The fatty infiltration in the steatotic livers decreased after
   the treatment with both NL diets, indicating liver recovery. This
   decrease was accompanied with a lower collagen deposition and
   aminotransferase level as well as changes in the PSC population that
   increased the GFAP expression. The above-mentioned effects were more
   pronounced in animals fed on NL-O based diet.
   CONCLUSION: Treatment with a balanced diet enriched in olive oil
   contributes to the liver recovery from a steatotic process. The PSC
   phenotype is a marker of this hepatic-recovery model. (C) 2005 The WJG

Abstract = {{The secretory function of cells relies on the capacity of the
   endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to fold and modify nascent polypeptides and
   to synthesize phospholipids for the subsequent trafficking of secretory
   proteins through the ER-Golgi network. We have previously demonstrated
   that the transcription factor XBP-1 activates the expression of certain
   ER chaperone genes and initiates ER biogenesis. Here, we have rescued
   the embryonic lethality of XBP-1 deficient fetuses by targeting an XBP-1
   transgene selectively to hepatocytes (XBP-1(-/-);Liv(XBP1)).
   XBP-1(-/-);Liv(XBP1) mice displayed abnormalities exclusively in
   secretory organs such as exocrine pancreas and salivary gland that led
   to early postnatal lethality from impaired production of pancreatic
   digestive enzymes. The ER was poorly developed in pancreatic and
   salivary gland acinar cells, accompanied by decreased expression of ER
   chaperone genes. Marked apoptosis of pancreatic acinar cells was
   observed during embryogenesis. Thus, the absence of XBP-1 results in an
   imbalance between the cargo load on the ER and its capacity to handle
   it, leading to the activation of ER stress-mediated proapoptotic
   pathways. These data lead us to propose that XBP-1 is both necessary and
   sufficient for the full biogenesis of the secretory machinery in
   exocrine cells.}},

Abstract = {{A method that uses induced eddy current for characterization of niobium,
   tantalum and chromium sputtered coating on steel is presented in this
   paper. The objective of this work is to find the correlation between the
   sputtering conditions and resistivity of coatings and to develop a
   system for fast inspection of coatings as a coating quality control tool
   during production as well as in the field for determining coating
   degradation levels. A two-probe differential system having higher
   sensitivity and less noise than a one-probe system with 2D scanning
   ability was developed. A computer program that controls an XY table and
   performs fast data acquisition was written. Resistivity maps of the
   niobium, tantalum and chromium coated samples were constructed and are
   shown in the paper. For niobium coatings, the relationship between
   sputtering pressure and resistivity of coatings is examined, as well as
   the relationship between impurity level of process gas and resistivity
   of coatings. For tantalum coatings, the relationship between beta-Ta
   fraction and resistivity is analyzed. For chromium coatings, the
   relationship between micro-crack density and resistivity of coatings is
   analyzed. The topographic picture and destructive analysis of the
   samples show very good correlation with eddy currents measurements. (c)

Abstract = {{We study the impact of lens galaxy environments on the image separation
   distribution of lensed quasars. We account for both environmental
   convergence and shear, using a joint distribution derived from galaxy
   formation models calibrated by galaxy-galaxy lensing data and number
   counts of massive elliptical galaxies. We find that the external field
   enhances lensing probabilities, particularly, at large image
   separations; the increase is similar to 30 per cent at theta = 3 arcsec
   and similar to 200 per cent at theta = 5 arcsec, when we adopt a
   power-law source luminosity function Phi(L) alpha L-2.1. The enhancement
   is mainly driven by convergence, which boosts both the image separation
   and magnification bias (for a fixed lens galaxy mass). These effects
   have been neglected in previous studies of lens statistics. Turning the
   problem around, we derive the posterior convergence and shear
   distributions and point out that they are strong functions of image
   separation; lens systems with larger image separations are more likely
   to lie in dense environments.}},

   the thin superlattices in the plastic regime. The superlattices are

Abstract = {{The incorporation of nitrogen into thin (10 nm) Ta layers using plasma
   immersion ion implantation (PIII) has been studied. PIII was carried out
   using a low-pressure (0.3 Pa) plasma and ion energies between 6 and 25
   keV. The depth distributions of nitrogen were measured by Auger electron
   spectroscopy (AES) and compared with those obtained by numerical
   simulations (Profile Code). The experimental profiles do not show a
   maximum at the projected range of the implanted ions, but a high
   nitrogen concentration at the surface decreasing with depth. The
   influence of implantation parameters such as high-voltage pulse rise and
   fall times, voltage amplitude, and plasma pulsing on the shape of the
   nitrogen profile is investigated and discussed. Especially reduced fall
   time of the high-voltage pulse reduces the implantation with energies
   below the nominal value and therefore the high nitrogen concentration
   near the surface significantly. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Electron impact (70 eV) mass spectra of a series of C-1-C-6 alcohols
   encased in large superfluid liquid helium nanodroplets (similar to 60000
   helium atoms) have been recorded. The presence of helium alters the
   fragmentation patterns when compared with the gas phase, with some ion
   product channels being more strongly affected than others, most notably
   cleavage of the C-alpha-H bond in the parent ion to form the
   corresponding oxonium ion. Parent ion intensities are also enhanced by
   the helium, but only for the two cyclic alcohols studied, cyclopentanol
   and cyclohexanol, is this effect large enough to transform the parent
   ion from a minor product (in the gas phase) into the most abundant ion
   in the helium droplet experiments. To demonstrate that these findings
   are not unique to alcohols, we have also investigated several ethers.
   The results obtained for both alcohols and ethers are difficult to
   explain solely by rapid cooling of the excited parent ions by the
   surrounding superfluid helium, although this undoubtedly takes place. A
   second factor also seems to be involved, a cage effect which favors
   hydrogen atom loss over other fragmentation channels. The set of
   molecules explored in this work suggest that electron impact ionization
   of doped helium nanodroplets does not provide a sufficiently large
   softening effect to be useful in analytical mass spectrometry.}},

   binary systems, by fitting one temperature-dependent binary interaction
   parameter. For comparison, the same data were also modeled by using the
   traditional Peng-Robinson (PR) cubic EoS. The three pure-component
   parameters of PC-SAFT and SL EoS and two pure-component of PR EoS were
   regressed by fitting pure-component data (liquid
   pressure-volume-temperature data for polymers and copolymer and vapor
   pressure and saturated liquid molar volume for fluids). The estimation
   of pure-component and binary interaction parameters was performed by
   using the modified maximum likelihood method with an objective function
   that includes the cloud point pressure. An excellent agreement was
   obtained with the PC-SAFT EoS, while the performance of the SL and PR
   EoS was less satisfactory. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Gadolinium has been recently proposed, as neutron capture agent in NCT
   (Neutron Capture Therapy), due to both the nuclide high neutron capture
   cross section, and the remarkable selective uptake inside tumour tissue
   that Gd-loaded compounds, can provide. When a neutron external source is
   supplied, different Gd nuclear reactions, and the generated Auger
   electrons in particular, cause a high local energy deposition, which
   results in a tumour cell inactivation. Preliminary micro- as well as
   macrodosimetric Monte Carlo computational investigations show that the
   tumour-to-healthy tissue biological damage ratio is in close relation to
   the neutron beam energy spectrum. The results points out that the
   optimum neutron spectrum, to be used for Gd-NCT, seems to lie in the 1
   to 10 keV energy range. In order to `tailor' such spectra, an original,
   accelerator-driven, neutron source and spectrum shaping assembly for
   hospital-based Gd-NCT are presented and preliminary results are
   reported.}},

Abstract = {{For a global field K and an elliptic curve E-n over K(T), Silverman's
   specialization theorem implies rank(E-n(K(T))) <= rank(E-t (K)) for all
   but finitely many t is an element of P-1 (K). If this inequality is
   strict for all but finitely many t, the elliptic curve E-n is said to
   have elevated rank. All known examples of elevated rank for K = Q rest
   on the parity conjecture for elliptic curves over Q, and the examples
   are all isotrivial.
   Some additional standard conjectures over Q imply that there does not
   exist a non-isotrivial elliptic curve over Q(T) with elevated rank. In
   positive characteristic, an analogue of one of these additional
   conjectures is false. Inspired by this, for the rational function field
   K = K(U) over any finite field K with characteristic A 2, we construct
   an explicit 2-parameter family E-c,E-d of non-isotrivial elliptic curves
   over K(T) (depending on arbitrary c, d E 0) such that, under the parity
   conjecture, each E-c,E-d has elevated rank. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

   dissociation for the above molecules, features not consistently found in

   valence correlation and the third level inner shells correlation,
   adapting standard multi-configuration techniques to the HF-HL function.
   The procedure for both levels has been preliminarily applied to LiH and

Abstract = {{Multi-proxy data from an Italian stalagmite constrain the commencement
   of full Last Interglacial conditions in southern Europe at 129 +/- 1 ka,
   consistent with absolutely dated records currently available from both
   hemispheres. The post-glacial transition towards warmer and wetter
   conditions commenced at 134 +/- 2 ka. Oxygen isotope evidence suggests
   this was interrupted briefly at 130 +/- 2 ka, an event probably related
   to the `Termination II pause' associated with Heinrich Event 11. For
   most of the stalagmite, the pattern of delta(18)O variation mimics the
   air temperature record from the Vostok ice core, especially through
   marine isotope stage 5. There is no obvious evidence for substantial
   `early interglacial' warming.}},

Abstract = {{The actin homolog MreB contributes to bacterial cell shape. Here, we
   explore the role of the coexpressed MreC protein in Caulobacter and show
   that it forms a periplasmic spiral that is out of phase with the
   cytoplasmic MreB spiral. Both mreB and mreC are essential, and depletion
   of either protein results in a similar cell shape defect. MreB forms
   dynamic spirals in MreC-depleted cells, and MreC localizes helically in
   the presence of the MreB-inhibitor A22, indicating that each protein can
   form a spiral independently of the other. We show that the peptidoglycan
   transpeptidase Pbp2 also forms a helical pattern that partially
   colocalizes with MreC but not MreB. Perturbing either MreB (with A22) or
   MreC (with depletion) causes GFP-Pbp2 to mislocalize to the division
   plane, indicating that each is necessary but not sufficient to generate
   a helical Pbp2 pattern. We show that it is the division process that
   draws Pbp2 to midcell in the absence of MreB's regulation, because cells
   depleted of the tubulin homolog FtsZ maintain a helical Pbp2
   localization in the presence of A22. By developing and employing a
   previously uncharacterized computational method for quantitating shape
   variance, we find that a FtsZ depletion can also partially rescue the
   A22-induced shape deformation. We conclude that MreB and MreC form
   spatially distinct and independently localized spirals and propose that
   MreB inhibits division plane localization of Pbp2, whereas MreC promotes
   lengthwise localization of Pbp2; together these two mechanism ensure a
   helical localization of Pbp2 and, thereby, the maintenance of proper
   cell morphology in Caulobacter.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
   (N93-004) evaluated the effects of epoetin alfa on tumor response to
   chemotherapy and survival in patients with small-cell lung cancer
   (SCLC).
   Patients and Methods Adult patients with hemoglobin <= 14.5 g/dL
   starting chemotherapy received epoetin alfa 150 U/kg or placebo
   subcutaneously 3 times weekly until 3 weeks after completion of
   chemotherapy. Survival was assessed for 3 years. The primary end point
   was the proportion of patients with complete or partial response after
   three chemotherapy cycles.
   Results The trial was terminated prematurely after 224 of a projected
   400 patients were accrued. Baseline characteristics were similar between
   groups. Epoetin alfa and placebo patients (n = 109 and In = 115,
   respectively) had mean baseline hemoglobin of 12.8 g/dL and 13.0 g/dL,
   respectively. Overall tumor response was similar between the epoetin
   alfa and placebo groups after three chemotherapy cycles (72\% and 67\%,
   respectively; 95\% Cl of difference, -6\% to 18\%) and after completion
   of chemotherapy (60\% and 56\%, respectively; 95\% Cl of difference,
   -9\% to 17\%). Epoetin alfa and placebo groups had similar median
   overall survival (10.5 and 10.4 months, respectively) and overall
   mortality (91.7\% and 87.8\%, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.172; 95\%
   Cl, 0.887 to 1.549; P = .264). Hemoglobin was maintained in the
   prechemotherapy range in epoetin alfa patients, but decreased
   substantially in placebo patients. Fewer epoetin alfa patients than
   placebo patients required transfusion.
   Conclusion These results suggest that in newly diagnosed patients with
   SCLC epoetin alfa does not affect tumor response to chemotherapy or
   survival. However, the early trial closure makes these conclusions
   preliminary.}},

   Special cases (with some vanishing parameters) correspond to the use of

   correlated wave function, we present new recurrence relations that
   complement the formula of Sack, Roothaan, and Kolos. One of these is a
   sum rule that could also be used for downward recursion; the other is
   suitable for recursion in the usual (upward) recursive process. Formulas
   connecting matrix elements in the four-body (three-electron) problem are
   also derived; their use confirms the recurrence relations recently
   published by Pachucki, Puchalski, and Remiddi for the Hylleraas basis
   and provides a new sum rule for matrix elements in the general

Abstract = {{The novel form of composite walling system consists of two skins of
   profiled steel sheeting with an in-fill of concrete. The behaviour of
   such walling under in-plane shear is important in order to utilise this
   system as shear elements in a steel framed building. Steel
   sheet-concrete interface governs composite action, overall behaviour and
   failure modes of such walls. This paper describes the finite element
   (FE) modelling of the shear behaviour of walls with particular emphasis
   on the simulation of steel-concrete interface. The modelling of complex
   non-linear steel-concrete interaction in composite walls is conducted by
   using different FE models. Four FE models are developed and
   characterized by their approaches to simulate steel-concrete interface
   behaviour allowing either full or partial composite action. Non-linear
   interface or joint elements are introduced between steel and concrete to
   simulate partial composite action that allows steel-concrete in-plane
   slip or out of plane separation. The properties of such interface/joint
   elements are optimised through extensive parametric FE analysis using
   experimental results to achieve reliable and accurate simulation of
   actual steel-concrete interaction in a wall. The performance of
   developed FE models is validated through small-scale model tests. FE
   models are found to simulate strength, stiffness and strain
   characteristics reasonably well. The performance of a model with joint
   elements connecting steel and concrete layers is found better than full
   composite (without interface or joint elements) and other models with
   interface elements. The proposed FE model can be used to simulate the
   shear behaviour of composite walls in practical situation.}},

   To elucidate electronic and magnetic properties of these species,
   effective exchange integrals (J(ab)) for magnetic clusters are
   calculated by ab initio hybrid density functional (HDFT) methods. The ab
   initio Jab values are numerically reproduced by using model Hamiltonians

   possibilities of organic magnetic conductors are elucidated on the basis
   of these models for self-assembled DNA wires, sheets, and related

   devices is also elucidated theoretically in relation to an important
   role of electron-electron repulsion effect for quantum electron
   transport, together with the electron-exchange interaction in the Kondo
   effect. The implications of the calculated results are finally discussed

Abstract = {{The surface composition of four industrial spray-dried dairy powders
   (skim milk powder, whole milk powder, cream powder and whey protein
   concentrate) was estimated by electron spectroscopy for chemical
   analysis (ESCA), and its influence on powder flowability was studied. It
   was found that skim milk powder flows well compared to the other powders
   because the surface is made of lactose and protein with a small amount
   of fat, whereas the high surface fat composition inhibits the flow of
   whole milk, cream and whey protein powders. However, the poor
   flowability of the powders with high surface fat coverage was
   drastically improved by removal of fat present on the surface through a
   brief wash with petroleum ether. The results obtained indicate that,
   although there are several parameters including particle size, which
   influence the flowability of powders, the flowability of powders is
   strongly influenced by the surface composition of powders, particularly
   for fat-containing powders. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD) is a lysosomal storage disease caused
   by genetic deficiency of galactocerebrosidase (GALC) activity. Failure
   in catalyzing the degradation of its major substrate,
   galactocerebroside, in oligodendrocytes (OLs) and Schwann cells leads to
   death of these myelinating cells, progressive demyelination, and early
   demise of GLD patients. Transplantation of bone marrow cells and
   umbilical cord blood have been attempted as a means of enzyme
   replacement and have shown limited success. It remains unknown whether
   or how these therapies support survival of GALC-deficient OLs and myelin
   maintenance. We report that, upon transplantation, GALC-deficient OLs
   from the twitcher mouse, a model of GLD, achieved widespread myelination
   in the brain and spinal cord of the myelin-deficient shiverer
   mouse,which was preserved for the life of the host. GALC

Abstract = {{The yeast histone variant H2AZ (Htz1) is implicated in transcription
   activation, prevention of the ectopic spread of heterochromatin, and
   genome integrity. Our genome-wide localization analysis revealed that
   Htz1 is widely, but nonrandomly, distributed throughout the genome in an
   SWR1-dependent manner. We found that Htz1 is enriched in, intergenic
   regions compared with coding regions. Its occupancy is inversely
   proportional to transcription rates and the enrichment of the RNA
   polymerase 11 under different growth conditions. However, Htz1 does not
   seem to directly regulate transcription repression genome-wide; instead,
   the presence of Htz1 under the inactivated condition is essential for
   optimal activation of a subset of genes. In addition, Htz1 is not
   generally responsible for nucleosome positioning, even at those
   promoters where Htz1 is highly enriched. Finally, using a biochemical
   approach, we demonstrate that incorporation of Htz1 into nucleosomes
   inhibits activities of histone modifiers associated with transcription,
   Dot1, Set2, and NuA4 and reduces the nucleosome mobilization driven by
   chromatin remodeling complexes. These lines of evidence collectively
   suggest that Htz1 may serve to mark quiescent promoters for proper
   activation.}},

Abstract = {{The culture of human natural killer (NK) cell clones has traditionally
   been a long, laborious process with an efficiency of only 1-2\%.
   Recently, a stem cell growth medium (SCGM) has been described to expand
   preferentially polyclonal NK cells from peripheral blood. We have tested
   SCGM in a single cell sorting system and shown a 4-5 fold increase in
   the number of proliferating NK clones compared to standard RPMI media.
   The cloning efficiency was further enhanced by the provision of
   irradiated feeder cells derived from multiple donors combined with the
   addition of the anti-CD3 antibody, OKT3. The combination of SCGM, single
   cell sorting and these multiple optimisations enhanced NK cloning
   efficiency by more than tenfold to greater than 20\% for short-term
   cultures when deriving 105 cells and as high as 10\% for longer term
   cultures when deriving more than 2 X 106 cells. This novel system thus
   facilitates the generation of NK clones and allows larger scale studies
   of NK function that were beyond the scope of previous methodology. (c)

Abstract = {{Previously, the generalized luminosity L was defined and calculated for
   all incident channels based on an NLC e(+)e(-) design. Alternatives were
   then considered to improve the differing beam-beam effects in the
   e(-)e(-), e gamma and gamma gamma channels. Regardless of the channel,
   there was a large flux of outgoing, high energy photons that were
   produced from the beam-beam interaction e.g. beamsstrahlung that needs
   to be disposed of and whose flux depended on L. One approach to this
   problem is to consider it a resource and attempt to take advantage of it
   by disposing of these straight-ahead photons in more useful ways than
   simply dumping them. While there are many options for monitoring the
   luminosity, any method that allows feedback and optimization in real
   time and in a non-intercepting and non-interfering way during normal
   data taking is extremely important-especially if it provides other
   capabilities such as high resolution tuning of spot sizes and can be
   used for all incident channels without essential modifications to their
   setup. Our ``pin-hole{''} camera appears to be such a device if it can
   be made to work with high energy photons in ways that are compatible
   with the many other constraints and demands on space around the
   interaction region. The basis for using this method is that it has, in
   principle, the inherent resolution and bandwidth to monitor the very
   small spot sizes and their stabilities that are required for very high,
   integrated luminosity. While there are many possible, simultaneous uses
   of these outgoing photon beams, we limit our discussion to a single,
   blind, proof-of-principle experiment that was done on the FFTB line at
   SLAC to certify the concept of a camera obscura for high energy photons.}},

Abstract = {{Entrapping probiotic bacteria in gels with ionic cross-linking is
   typically achieved with polysaccharides ( alginate, pectin,
   carraghenan). In this study, whey proteins were used for this purpose by
   carrying out the Ca2+-induced gelation of pre-heated whey protein
   isolate (WPI). A Lactobacillus rhamnosus cell suspension was added in a
   denatured WPI solution in a 30 : 70 volume ratio. Gelation was carried
   out by extrusion of the cell suspension in a CaCl2 solution. Beads of
   similar to 3mm diameter were formed. The population in the beads was 8.0
   x 10(8) cells g(-1). Entrapment efficiency in gel beads was 96\%, with a
   survival level of 23\%. Scanning electron microscopy of beads before
   freeze-drying showed a tight protein network containing encapsulated Lb.
   rhamnosus cells homogeneously distributed throughout the matrix. The
   survival to freeze-drying of the bead-entrapped cells was 41\%.
   Viability of micro-entrapped cells in a dynamic gastro-intestinal (GI)
   model was studied and the results were compared to free cells
   freeze-dried in a milk-based cryoprotective solution, as well as in a
   pre-denatured WPI solution. Results showed that protein gelation
   provided protection against acidic conditions in the stomach after 90
   min, as well as against bile after 30, 60 and 90 min in the duodenum.
   Moreover, the milk-based cryoprotective solution was equally effective
   after 90 min in the duodenum. It is concluded that the gelation of whey
   proteins induced by Ca2+ ions can protect the cells against adverse
   conditions of the GI system. However, certain stages in the entrapment
   process, particularly extrusion in the solution of CaCl2, still need to
   be optimized in order to reduce the mortality of the cells during
   gelation.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES To compare the incidence of diastolic and systolic
   asynchrony, assessed by tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), in patients with
   congestive heart failure (CHF) and severe left ventricular (LV)
   dysfunction, and to assess TDI changes induced by cardiac
   resynchronization therapy (CRT).
   BACKGROUND Thirty percent of CRT candidates are nonresponders. Besides
   QRS width, the presence of echographic systolic asynchrony has been used
   to identify future responders. Little is known about diastolic
   asynchrony and its change after CRT.
   METHODS Tissue Doppler imaging was performed in 116 CHF patients (LV
   ejection fraction 26 +/- 8\%). Systolic and diastolic asynchrony was
   calculated using TDI recordings of right ventricular and LV walls.
   RESULTS The CHF group consisted of 116 patients. Diastolic asynchrony
   was more frequent than systolic, concerning both intraventricular (58\%
   vs. 47\%; p = 0.0004) and interventricular (72 vs. 45\%; p < 0.0001)
   asynchrony. Systolic and diastolic asynchrony were both present in 41\%
   patients, but one-third had isolated diastolic asynchrony. Although
   diastolic delays increased with QRS duration, 42\% patients with narrow
   QRS presented with diastolic asynchrony. Conversely, 27\% patients with
   large QRS had no diastolic asynchrony. Forty-two patients underwent CRT.
   Incidence of systolic intraventricular asynchrony decreased from 71\% to
   33\% after CRT (p < 0.0001), but diastolic asynchrony decreased only
   from 81\% to 55\% (p < 0.0002). Cardiac resynchronization therapy
   induced new diastolic asynchrony in eight patients.
   CONCLUSIONS Diastolic asynchrony is weakly correlated with QRS duration,
   is more frequent than systolic asynchrony, and may be observed alone.
   Diastolic asynchrony is less improved by CRT than systolic. Persistent
   diastolic asynchrony may explain some cases of lack of improvement after
   CRT despite good systolic resynchronization.}},

   transition, namely a magnetically induced Wigner solid of charge

   alkali-doped fullerides and the high T-c cuprates based on an
   interpretation of Uemura-type plots. A phase diagram for alkali-doped
   fullerides is proposed that contains possible universal quantum phase
   transitions. Evidence is presented that suggests the superconducting
   phase is located between Wigner solids of A charge carriers in

Abstract = {{Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a neurodegenerative disease
   primarily affecting the cerebellum, brainstem and retina. The disease is
   caused by a polyglutamine expansion in ataxin-7, a protein with largely
   unknown function. To improve our knowledge of the expression and
   function of wild-type and expanded ataxin-7, we looked for alternative
   SCA7 transcripts in mice. We identified a murine SCA7 isoform (SCA7b)
   containing an uncharacterized exon homologous to the newly identified
   human exon 12b. Northern blot analysis revealed three exon 12b
   containing transcripts with molecular sizes of 7.5, 4.4 and 3.0 kb in
   mice. This contrasted with the situation in humans, where only one exon
   12b-containing transcript was observed. Furthermore, Northern blot of
   the human 4.4 kb SCA7b isoform predominantly showed expression in the
   brain, while expression of both the murine 7.5-kb and the 4.4-kb
   transcripts were observed in several tissues including brain, heart,
   liver, kidney and testis. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis
   revealed that in muscle and heart SCA7b is the predominant SCA7 isoform,
   while in brain equal levels of SCA7a and SCA7b was observed. Insertion
   of exon 12b into the murine SCA7 ORF resulted in a frame-shift that gave
   rise to an alternative ataxin-7 protein (ataxin-7b). The novel 58-amino
   acid C-terminus in ataxin-7b directed the protein to a more cytoplasmic
   location. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring of the radiation environment is one of the key tasks in
   operating a high-energy accelerator such as the Large Hadron Collider
   (LHC). The radiation fields consist of neutrons, charged hadrons as well
   as photons and electrons with energy spectra extending from those of
   thermal neutrons up to several hundreds of GeV. The requirements for
   measuring the dose equivalent in such a field are different from
   standard uses and it is thus necessary to investigate the response of
   monitoring devices thoroughly before the implementation of a monitoring
   system can be conducted. For the LHC, it is currently foreseen to
   install argon- and hydrogen-filled high-pressure ionisation chambers as
   radiation monitors of mixed fields. So far their response to these
   fields was poorly understood and, therefore, further investigation was
   necessary to prove that they can serve their function well enough. In
   this study, ionisation chambers of type IG5 (Centronic Ltd) were
   characterised by simulating their response functions by means of
   detailed FLUKA calculations as well as by calibration measurements for
   photons and neutrons at fixed energies. The latter results were used to
   obtain a better understanding and validation of the FLUKA simulations.
   Tests were also conducted at the CERF facility at CERN in order to
   compare the results with simulations of the response in a mixed
   radiation field. It is demonstrated that these detectors can be
   characterised sufficiently enough to serve their function as radiation
   monitors for the LHC.}},

Abstract = {{We report on X-ray and optical observations of the X-ray burster EXO
   1747-214. This source is an X-ray transient, and its only known outburst
   was observed in 1984-1985 by the EXOSAT satellite. We reanalyzed the
   EXOSAT data to derive the source position, column density, and a
   distance upper limit using its peak X-ray burst flux. We observed the
   EXO 1747-214 field in 2003 July with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory to
   search for the quiescent counterpart. We found one possible candidate
   just outside the EXOSAT error circle, but we cannot rule out the
   possibility that the source is unrelated to EXO 1747-214. Our conclusion
   is that the upper limit on the unabsorbed 0.3-8 keV luminosity is L < 7
   x 10(31) ergs s(-1), making EXO 1747-214 one of the faintest neutron
   star transients in quiescence. We compare this luminosity upper limit to
   the quiescent luminosities of 19 neutron star and 14 black hole systems
   and discuss the results in the context of the differences between
   neutron stars and black holes. Based on the theory of deep crustal
   heating suggested by Brown and coworkers, the luminosity implies an
   outburst recurrence time of > 1300 yr unless some form of enhanced
   cooling occurs within the neutron star. The position of the possible
   X-ray counterpart is consistent with three blended optical/IR sources
   with R magnitudes between 19.4 and 19.8 and J magnitudes between 17.2
   and 17.6. One of these sources could be the quiescent optical/IR
   counterpart of EXO 1747-214.}},

Abstract = {{We present an expanded data set of 50 unlinked autosomal noncoding
   regions, resequenced in samples of Hausa from Cameroon, Italians, and
   Chinese. We use these data to make inferences about human demographic
   history by using a technique that combines multiple aspects of genetic
   data, including levels of polymorphism, the allele frequency spectrum,
   and linkage disequilibrium. We explore an extensive range of demographic
   parameters and demonstrate that our method of combining multiple aspects
   of the data results in a significant reduction of the compatible
   parameter space. In agreement with previous reports, we find that the
   Hausa data are compatible with demographic equilibrium as well as a set
   of recent population expansion models. In contrast to the Hausa, when
   multiple aspects of the data are considered jointly, the non-Africans
   depart from an equilibrium model of constant population size and are

   indicated that the interaction effect of spherical shock wave with a
   parabolic surface may be used for propulsion technique. But detailed

Abstract = {{The biochemistry of early stages of hematopoietic differentiation is
   difficult to study because only relatively small numbers of precursor
   cells are available. The murine EML cell line is a multi-potential cell
   line that can be used to model some of these steps. We found that the
   lineage(-) EML precursor cells can be separated into two populations
   based on cell surface markers including CD34. Both populations contain
   similar levels of stem cell factor (SCF) receptor (c-Kit) but only the
   CD34(+) population shows a growth response when treated with SCF.
   Conversely, the CD34(-) population will grow in the presence of the
   cytokine IL-3. The human beta-globin locus control region hypersensitive
   site 2 plays different roles on P-globin transcription in the CD34+ and
   CD34- populations. The two populations are present in about equal
   amounts in culture, and the CD34+ population rapidly regenerates the
   mixed population when grown in the presence of SCF. We suggest that this
   system may mimic a normal developmental transition in hematopoiesis.}},

Abstract = {{Freshwater planarians have prodigious regenerative abilities that enable
   them to form complete organisms from tiny body fragments. This
   plasticity is also exhibited by the planarian germ cell lineage. Unlike
   many model organisms in which germ cells are specified by localized
   determinants, planarian germ cells appear to be specified
   epigenetically, arising postembryonically from stem cells. The planarian
   Schmidtea mediterranea is well suited for investigating the mechanisms
   underlying epigenetic germ cell specification. Two strains of S.
   mediterranea exist: a hermaphroditic strain that reproduces sexually and
   an asexual strain that reproduces by means of transverse fission. To
   date, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) have been generated only from the
   asexual strain. To develop molecular reagents for studying epigenetic
   germ cell specification, we have sequenced 27,161 ESTs from two
   developmental stages of the hermaphroditic strain of S. mediterranea;
   this collection of ESTs represents approximate to 10,000 unique
   transcripts. BLAST analysis of the assembled ESTs showed that 66\% share
   similarity to sequences in public databases. We annotated the assembled
   ESTs using Gene Ontology terms as well as conserved protein domains and
   organized them in a relational database. To validate experimentally the
   Gene Ontology annotations, we used whole-mount in situ hybridization to
   examine the expression patterns of transcripts assigned to the
   biological process ``reproduction.{''} Of the 53 genes in this category,
   87\% were expressed in the reproductive organs. In addition to its
   utility for studying germ cell development, this EST collection will be
   an important resource for annotating the planarian genome and studying
   this animal's amazing regenerative abilities.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments using chimeric stimuli have shown that the right hemisphere
   is more influential in processing facial information. Here, again, we
   found clear evidence that study participants used the information from
   the left side of the face to inform their gender decisions when chimeric
   male/female, female/male stimuli were presented. Most interestingly
   though, this effect was not only present for upright faces but also for
   inverted (flipped) faces (although the effect was significantly
   reduced). We propose that the chimeric bias effects found here argue
   against the idea that inversion destroys the right hemisphere
   superiority for faces. If this was indeed the case, flipping the
   chimeric faces should have resulted in a loss of the left face bias.

Abstract = {{Applying functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques, hemodynamic
   responses elicited by slowly flashing checkerboards (0.25 Hz) were
   measured both before and after a block of rapidly presented
   checkerboards (9 Hz - a `photic tetanus') was delivered. It has been
   shown previously, using electroencephelography, that this photic tetanus
   potentiates components of the visual-evoked potential. In the present
   study, hemodynamic responses in the extrastriate visual cortex were
   significantly increased to checkerboards presented at a low frequency
   after the administration of the photic tetanus. These results support
   the idea that long-term potentiation can be demonstrated non-invasively
   within the human visual cortex and provide evidence that the plastic
   changes are localized within the secondary visual cortex. NeuroReport

Abstract = {{The hygroscopicity of mineral aerosol samples has been examined by three
   independent methods: diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform
   spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and differential mobility
   analysis. All three methods allow an evaluation of the water coverage of
   two samples, CaCO3 and Arizona Test dust, as a function of relative
   humidity. For the first time, a correlation between absolute gravimetric
   measurements and the other two ( indirect) methods has been established.
   Water uptake isotherms were reliably determined for both solids which at
   298 K and 80\% relative humidity exhibited similar coverages of similar
   to 4 monolayers. However, the behaviour at low relative humidity was
   markedly different in the two cases, with Arizona Test Dust showing a
   substantially higher affinity for water in the contact layer. This is
   understandable in terms of the chemical composition of these two
   materials. The mobility analysis results are in good accord with field
   observations and with our own spectroscopic and gravimetric
   measurements. These findings are of value for an understanding of
   atmospheric chemical processes.}},

Abstract = {{The alpha 3-subunit of strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors is an
   important modulator of the pain-sensitizing effects of spinal
   prostaglandin prostaglandin E-2. Mice deficient for alpha 3-subunit of
   strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors lack the prostaglandin
   E-2-induced inhibition of glycinergic neurotransmission and recover
   faster from inflammation-induced hyperalgesia. It, however, remains
   unclear whether alpha 3-subunit of strychnine-sensitive glycine
   receptors plays a role in other pain models involving prostaglandin
   synthesis, such as chemically induced pain or neuropathic pain. In this
   paper, we show a reduction of acetic acid-induced writhing responses in
   the absence of of alpha 3-subunit of strychnine-sensitive glycine
   receptors, but no changes in formalin-induced pain. Furthermore, alpha
   3-subunit of strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors-deficient mice
   develop normal thermal hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia. Thus, alpha
   3-subunit of strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors is involved in the
   modulation of moderate inflammatory acetic acid-induced pain responses,
   but neither in formal in-induced pain nor in neuropathic pain.

Abstract = {{Internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements allow simultaneous
   synthesis of multiple proteins in eukaryotic cells. Here, two unrelated
   IRESs that perform efficiently in bicistronic constructs, the
   picornavirus foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and the cellular
   immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP) IRES, were used to
   generate a tricistronic vector. Functional analysis of the tricistronic
   RNA evidenced that the efficiency of protein synthesis tinder the
   control of BiP IRES was lower than that of the FMDV IRES, relative to
   the efficiency measured in bicistronic vectors. A specific competition
   between these elements was verified using two separate mono-or
   bicistronic constructs in vivo and in vitro. In contrast, no
   interference was detected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) IRES. The
   interference effect of FMDV IRES was observed in cis and trans, in
   support of competition for common transacting factors different than
   those used in cap- and HCV-dependent initiation. (c) 2005 Federation of

Abstract = {{Thin films of mesoporous silica (MPS) are attractive for
   low-permittivity interlayer isolation in integrated circuit wiring.
   Here, we report the mechanisms of moisture-induced capacitance-voltage
   (C-V) instabilities in MPS films. Upon annealing Al/MPS/Si(001)/Al
   capacitors between 80 to 200 degrees C, the flat-band voltage first
   increases, reaches a maximum, and then decreases. Concurrently, the
   initially observed deep depletion behavior is replaced by strong
   inversion. Subsequent air exposure restores the preanneal C-V
   characteristics. Kinetics analyses reveal two thermally activated
   processes: Proton generation through fissure of silanol bonds
   (activation energy E-a1=0.42 +/- 0.04 eV) and proton-induced
   depassivation of dangling bond traps (E-a2=0.54 +/- 0.05 eV) at the
   MPS/Si interface. We present an empirical model correlating these
   processes with the C-V characteristics. Our findings will be important
   considerations in designing processes for integrating MPS films into
   microdevices.}},

   The upper similar to 50 km of the Martian crust have likely formed by

   very rapidly at the surface but is then gradually heated up through
   burial heating as it is overlain by other successive flows. The thermal
   evolution models of a lava flow show that its temperature remains below
   the magnetic blocking temperatures of magnetite, 480-580 degrees C,
   until it reaches similar to 30-45 km depth. The highly magnetic SD/PSD

Abstract = {{Introduction To study how competence is described and perceived by
   organizations of healthcare professionals in France and propose
   approaches toward implementing a policy to monitor and assess competence
   throughout medical professionals' careers.
   Methods After a literature search, we sent 160 letters to organizations
   representing 16 healthcare professions (listed in the French healthcare
   code) describing our objectives and proposing interviews.
   Semi-structured interviews (45-90 minutes) were conducted. The principle
   questions asked were: What is your organization's definition of
   competence? What are the principal elements that define competence in
   healthcare activities? How can a system for assessing competence be
   implemented? Which methods for such a system are most appropriate, based
   on experience in other countries? Who are the players in the field of
   competence? How can organizations participate in monitoring competence?
   Results 265 people representing 148 French organizations were
   interviewed. Analysis of the interviews showed that the principal points
   mentioned included: need for recognition; lack of training on new
   developments; need to anticipate changes; need for better health
   security in the healthcare system. There was a general consensus on the
   basic elements of competence, the responsibility of public institutions
   and professional organizations, and the need to work together.
   Discussion We suggest that competence in health care should be defined
   as follows: ``professional competence is based on an initial diploma,
   participation in effective continuing medical education, a minimum
   amount of professional activity, and a regular peer review process{''}.
   Healthcare professionals in France would like to have a better system
   that allows them to exchange more information on the principal issues in
   health care.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{110}},

Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{{[}1] This paper aims to investigate the distribution and stability of
   large-scale bed forms in response to storm and fair-weather conditions
   in a shallow marine environment. Multibeam and side-scan sonar data off
   the Dutch coast ( median grain size 0.25 - 0.35 mm) were collected to
   monitor sand waves (lambda = 100 - 800 m) and superimposed megaripples
   (lambda = 1 - 40 m) through multiple storm and fair-weather events. Box
   cores were used to observe the vertical bed structure and grain size. In
   the Dutch coastal area, two-dimensional (2-D) megaripples (lambda = 1 -
   15 m) are the dominant bed forms in current-dominated (> 0.4 m/s) tidal
   flow regimes with oscillatory flows < 0.15 m/s. Effects of trapping of
   fine material under these conditions by tube building Lanice conchilega
   colonies on bed form development are suspected but need further study.
   At slightly higher energy conditions, 3-D megaripples (lambda = 5 - 15
   m) begin to form on the shoreface. After seasonal storms, at oscillatory
   flows > 0.4 m/s, undulating bed topography of mound-like 3-D bed forms
   (lambda = 20 - 40 m) is observed. Immediately after storms, these bed
   forms are covered by smaller 3-D megaripples, which are related to sets
   of low-angle converging laminae in box cores, interpreted as hummocky
   cross stratification (HCS). The sand waves form compound bed forms of
   sets of 2-D and 3-D megaripples. The morphology of the sand waves is a
   function of the general wind-wave climate of the marine environmental
   setting, with flat-topped 3-D sand waves occurring in shallow
   wave-dominated settings and 2-D sand waves occurring in the
   tide-dominated environment farther offshore.}},

   from German-speaking countries on the medical practice of withholding or

   German-speaking part of Switzerland provides the first in-depth analysis
   in this field. This study is based on data from this region and is a
   contribution to a large empirical research project on medical
   end-of-life decisions in 6 European countries (EURELD).
   Methods: Continuous random samples (n = 4991) were taken from all deaths
   in the German-speaking part of Switzerland that had been reported to the
   Swiss Federal Office of Statistics between June and October 2001.
   Doctors who had been attending the deceased person were asked to
   complete mailed questionnaires, their replies being kept strictly
   anonymous.
   Results: The response rate was 67\%. Medications were withheld or
   withdrawn in 48\% of all treatments forgone: among these, antibiotics
   accounted for 17\%. Other potentially life-sustaining medical measures
   forgone included artificial hydration (12\%), surgery (7\%), artificial
   feeding (6\%), chemotherapy (6\%), diagnostic tests (4\%), hospital
   admissions (3\%), renal dialysis (2\%), blood product infusions (2\%),
   intubation (2\%), ventilation (2\%), resuscitation (2\%), and
   radiotherapy (1\%). 43\% of all treatments were forgone in patients who
   died in hospital, 42\% in nursing homes, and 15\% at home. In almost
   three-quarters (73\%) of the treatments forgone, a primary care doctor
   had ordered the treatment to be withheld or withdrawn. On average,
   forgoing treatment led to a life-shortening effect of more than one
   month in 8\% of all cases. The proportion was higher for renal dialysis
   (25\%), blood products infusion (18\%), and diagnostic tests (16\%).
   Conclusions: Forgoing life-sustaining medical treatment comprises a wide
   range of decisions taken in many different clinical settings. In most
   cases the likely lifespan is only slightly shortened.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{25}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{Results of extensive density-functional studies provide direct evidence
   that Cr atoms in CrGaN have a strong tendency to form embedded clusters,
   occupying Ga sites. Significantly, for larger than 2-Cr-atom clusters,
   states containing antiferromagnetic coupling with net spin in the range
   0.06-1.47 mu(B)/Cr are favored. We propose a picture where various
   configurations coexist and the statistical distribution and associated
   magnetism will depend sensitively on the growth details. Such a view may
   elucidate many puzzling observations related to the structural and
   magnetic properties of III-N and other dilute semiconductors.}},

Abstract = {{The receptor activator of NF-kappa B ligand (RANKL), a critical
   regulator of osteoclastogenesis, is synthesized as a membrane-anchored
   protein and cleaved into a soluble form by ectodomain shedding. We
   developed an assay system to identify molecules regulating the RANKL
   shedding. Using this system, we found that a splice variant of
   Ca2+-promoted Ras inactivator ( CAPRI), Delta CAPRI, which is expressed
   in primary osteoblasts, promoted the RANKL shedding. The wild type CAPRI
   is a member of the Ras GTPase-activating protein ( GAP) family and
   suppresses Ca2+- dependent Ras activation, whereas Delta CAPRI, which
   lacks one exon in the GAP-related domain, activated the Ras pathway.
   Overexpression of Delta CAPRI or a constitutive active form of Ras
   up-regulated the expression level of matrix-metalloproteinase 14
   (MMP14), which directly cleaves the ectodomain of RANKL, whereas Erk
   activation by expressing the constitutive active Mek1 did not affect the
   MMP14 expression or RANKL shedding. These results suggest that Delta
   CAPRI is a possible regulator of RANKL shedding by modulating MMP14
   expression through Ras signaling cascades other than the Erk pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Cell migration is a prerequisite for cancer invasion and metastasis,
   suggesting cell motility as a potential therapeutic target for cancer
   treatment. A synthetic library was screened to identify inhibitors of
   tumor cell migration. From this, we discovered that CAC-1098
   (aurintricarboxylic acid) and CBI-0997 (5-(2,4-dimethoxy-5ethylphenyl)-
   4-(4-bromophenyl) isoxazole) inhibited migration of MDA-MB-231 cells
   with IC50 = 5 and 50 nM, respectively. We synthesized KRIBB3
   (5-(5-ethyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-4-(4-methoxyphenyl) isoxazole) by
   replacing the bromide group of CBI-0997 with a methoxyl group. Like
   CBI-0997, KRIBB3 has anti-migratory and anti-invasive activities in
   MDA-MB-231 cells. Because KRIBB3 has a better drug-like structure, we
   focused our effort on further understanding its anti-migratory
   mechanism. Biotinyl-KRIBB3 was synthesized as an affinity probe for
   identification of KRIBB3-binding proteins. Using affinity
   chromatography, we identified Hsp27 as a target protein of KRIBB3 in
   vitro. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with phorbol 12-myristate
   13-acetate induced protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of Hsp27
   and tumor cell migration. In contrast, treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells
   with KRIBB3 blocked phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced
   phosphorylation of Hsp27 and tumor cell migration. Furthermore,
   overexpression of Hsp27 antagonized the inhibitory effect of KRIBB3 on
   tumor cell invasion, and knockdown of Hsp27 using small interfering RNA
   inhibited tumor cell migration. Overall, our results demonstrate that
   KRIBB3 inhibits tumor cell migration and invasion by blocking protein
   kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of Hsp27 through its direct binding
   to Hsp27.}},

Title = {{Predicting surface geomagnetic variations using ionospheric

Number = {{A12}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{A technique is described for predicting ground surface geomagnetic
   variations from measurements of the approaching interplanetary magnetic
   field (IMF) and solar wind. The method uses twin, empirical
   representations of the ionospheric electric and magnetic Euler
   potentials' response to the IMF drivers. The magnetic potential model,
   originally derived for mapping the large-scale field-aligned current
   structure, describes the curl-free component of the horizontal
   ionospheric current, also called the ``potential current.'' Using
   approximations that the Hall and Pedersen conductances have a fixed
   ratio and that there are no conductivity gradients, then the Hall
   current is derived from the magnetic potentials. In this case the Hall
   current is the same as the divergence-free ``equivalent current,'' which
   is used to derive the geomagnetic variations at the ground surface. The
   assumption that the ionospheric conductances have no gradients is
   avoided if the empirical model for the ionospheric electric potentials
   is used in addition to the magnetic potentials. In this second method
   the electric field provides additional information about the direction
   of the estimated equivalent current. Despite the approximation of a
   fixed conductance ratio, both calculation methods perform remarkably
   well for predicting the large-scale and long-period geomagnetic
   variations. The method that includes the electric fields has a slightly
   better performance, particularly in the polar cap. Corrections for the
   effects of currents induced underground were not applied for this
   demonstration. Such corrections could in principle improve the
   predictions, particularly for the short-period variations for which the
   effect is the greatest.}},

Abstract = {{Usher syndrome type IIa (USH2A) combines moderate to severe congenital
   hearing impairment and retinitis pigmentosa. It is the most common
   genetic form of USH. USH2A encodes usherin, which was previously defined
   as a basement membrane protein. A much larger USH2A transcript predicted
   to encode a transmembrane (TM) isoform was recently reported. Here, we
   address the role of TM usherin in the inner ear. Analysis of the usherin
   alternative transcripts in the murine inner ear revealed the existence
   of several predicted TM usherin isoforms with modular ectodomains of
   different lengths. In addition, we identified in the usherin cytoplasmic
   region a predicted 24 amino acid peptide, derived from a newly defined
   exon that is predominantly expressed in the inner ear but not in the
   retina. In mouse and rat inner ears, we show that TM usherin is present
   at the base of the differentiating stereocilia, which make up the
   mechanosensitive hair bundles receptive to sound. The usherin
   immunolabeling is transient in the hair bundles of cochlear hair cells
   (HCs), but persists in mature hair bundles of vestibular HCs. Several
   lines of evidence support the involvement of TM usherin in the
   composition of the ankle links, a subset of filamentous lateral links
   connecting stereocilia at the base. By co-immunoprecipitation and in
   vitro binding assays, we establish that the usherin cytodomain can bind
   to whirlin and harmonin, two PDZ domain-containing proteins that are
   defective in genetic forms of isolated deafness and USH type I,
   respectively. These PDZ proteins are suitable to provide the anchoring
   of interstereocilia lateral links to the F-actin core of stereocilia.
   Our results strongly suggest that congenital deafness in USH type I and
   type II shares similar pathogenic mechanisms, i.e. the disruption of
   hair bundle links-mediated adhesion forces that are essential for the
   proper organization of growing hair bundles.}},

Abstract = {{Low-band-gap pi-conjugated polymers composed of pi-excessive thiophene
   and pi-deficient benzothiadiazole and quinoxaline units were prepared in
   high yields by a polycondensation method using palladium cross-coupling
   reactions of alkylthiophene diacetylenes,
   4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, and
   5,8-dibromo-2,3-dipyridine-2-ylquinoxaline. The copolymers were
   characterized by NMR, IR, LTV, gel permeation chromatography, and
   elemental analysis. High-molecular-weight (weight-average molecular
   weight up to 82,600 g/mol), thermostable, soluble, and film-forming
   materials were obtained. The polymers were photoluminescent in
   chloroform and showed metallic luster in the solid state. The absorption
   and emission in solution and in the solid state of the polymers revealed
   that the polymers generated a pi-stacked structure in the solid state,
   and the polymer molecules in the film were ordered. Thin films of
   poly{[}3-do-decylthiophen-2,5-diylethynylene-(benzo{[}1,2,5]thiadiazole-

   similar to 1.85-2.08 eV. The highest occupied molecular orbital and
   lowest unoccupied molecular orbital levels of the polymers were
   determined from electrochemical measurements. In the absorption and
   emission spectra of these polymers in chloroform/methanol mixtures, all
   the polymers revealed solvato-chromic effects, which were related to the
   formation of aggregates, as confirmed by temperature-dependence
   absorption investigations. The absorption spectra of P-2 and P-4 at
   different temperatures also revealed significant effects of the
   structure on the molecular interactions. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{Neural tube defects (NTDs) constitute a major group of congenital
   malformations with an overall incidence of approximately 1-2 in 1,000
   live births in the United States. Hispanic Americans have a 2.5 times
   higher risk than the Caucasian population. Spina bifida meningomyelocele
   (SBMM) is a major clinical presentation of NTDs resulting from lack of
   closure of the spinal cord caudal to the head. In a previous study of
   spina bifida (SB) patients of European Caucasian descent, it was
   suggested that specific haplotypes of the platelet-derived growth factor
   receptor-a (PDGFRA) gene P1 promoter strongly affected the rate of NTD
   genesis. In our study, we evaluated the association of PDGFPLA PI in a
   group of 407 parent-child triads (167 Caucasian, 240 Hispanics) and 164
   unrelated controls (89 Caucasian, 75 Hispanic). To fully evaluate the
   association of PDGFRA P1, we performed both transmission-disequilibrium.
   test (TDT) and association analyses to test the hypotheses that PDGFRA
   PI was (1) transmitted preferentially in SBMM affected children and (2)
   associated with the condition of SBMM comparing affected children to
   unaffected controls. We did find that there was a different allelic and
   genotypic distribution of PDGFRA P1 when comparing Hispanics and
   Caucasians. However, neither ethnic group showed strong association
   between SBMM and the PDGFPLA P1 region. These findings suggest that
   PDGFRA P1 does not have a major role in the development of SBMM. (c)

Abstract = {{Functional hydrophilic microspheres (latex particles) have found various
   applications in life sciences and in medicine - particularly in latex
   diagnostic tests. This paper presents a comprehensive review of studies
   on latex particles with a hydrophilic interfacial layer composed of
   various hydrophilic polymers with reactive groups at the ends of
   macromolecules or at each monomeric unit along the chain. Typical
   examples of these hydrophilic polymers are poly(2-hydroxyethyl methyl
   methacrylate), poly(acrylic acid), poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide),
   polysaccharides, poly(ethylene oxide) and polyglycidol. Hydrophilic
   microspheres with different morphologies (uniform or core-shell, see
   Figure) have been synthesized by emulsion and dispersion
   polymerizations. The chemical structure of polymers which constitute the
   interfacial layer of microspheres has been investigated using a variety
   of instrumental techniques (such as XPS, SSIMS and NMR) and analytical
   methods based on specific chemical reactions suitable for the
   determination of particular functional groups. Microspheres are exposed
   to contact with proteins in the majority of medical applications. This
   paper presents examples of studies on the attachment of these
   biomacromolecules to microspheres. The relation between the structure of
   the interfacial layer of microspheres and the ability of these particles
   for the covalent binding of proteins is discussed. Several examples of
   diagnostic tests, in which hydrophilic microspheres with adsorbed or
   covalently immobilized proteins were used as reagents, are presented.
   The paper also contains a short review of the application of magnetic
   hydrophilic particles for protein separation. Examples of hydrophilic
   latex particles used for hemoperfusion or heavy metal ion separation are
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{Concern over terrorist releases of harmful material has generated
   interest in short-range air-borne dispersion in urban areas. Here, we
   review the important fluid dynamical processes that control dispersion
   in the first kilometre, the neighbourhood scale, when much of the
   material remains within the urban canopy. Dispersion is then controlled
   by turbulent mixing and mean flow transport through the network of
   streets. We consider mixing and transport in a long straight street,
   street intersections and then a network of streets connected by
   intersections. The mixing and transport in these systems are illustrated
   with results from recent fine-resolution numerical simulations and
   laboratory models, which then inform simpler scaling estimates and
   modelling schemes. Finally, we make some tentative steps to pull the
   process studies together to begin to understand results from full-scale
   observations. In particular, it is shown that the positions of `shear
   layers' and `dividing streamlines' largely control the patterns of
   mixing and transport. It is also shown that neighbourhood-scale
   dispersion follows one scaling in the near field and another in the far
   field after passage through many intersections. The challenge for the
   future is to bring these threads together into a coherent mathematical
   model.}},

   Ru/Al2O3 catalyst was studied under kinetic control in an agitated batch
   reactor (glass) at 135-165 degrees C under atmospheric pressure of
   nitrogen in n-decane solution. Catalyst characterization was done by
   nitrogen adsorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron
   microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray analysis, and hydrogen temperature
   programmed desorption techniques. Over such catalyst, the network
   involves six reaction: (1) double bond migration of linoleic acid to
   conjugated linoleic acid, (2) positional and geometric isomerization of
   conjugated linoleic acid, (3) double bond hydrogenation of linoleic acid
   to monoenoic acids, (4) double bond hydrogenation of conjugated linoleic

   monoenoic acids, and (6) double bond hydrogenation of monoenoic acids to
   stearic acid. The concentrations of chemisorbed hydrogen and an adsorbed
   key intermediates on the ruthenium surface influenced the catalytic
   activity and the selectivities toward isomerization and hydrogenation
   products through a complex relation. Although presence of hydrogen
   promoted the side reaction double bond hydrogenation, the isomerization
   rate was enhanced by chemisorbed hydrogen. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All

Abstract = {{Many mathematical models of solidification use the following equation
   for the estimation of solid volume f(s) = 1 - exp(-n(1)tau(n2)), where
   tau is time, n(1) and n(2) are constants. The fundamentals of the
   statistical theory of metal solidification were developed in classic
   papers written by Kolmogorov {[}A.N. Kolmogorov, Bull. Acad. Sci. USSR.
   Ser. Math., 3 (1937) 355-359 (in Russian)], Johnson and Mehl {[}W.A.
   Johnson, R.F. Mehl, Trans. Metall. Soc. AIME 135 (1939) 416-442], Avrami
   {[}M. Avrami, J. Chem. Phys. 7 (1939) 1103-1112; M. Avrami, J. Chem.
   Phys. 8 (1940) 212-224; M. Avrami, J. Chem. Phys. 9 (1941) 177-184]. The
   above equation in contemporary literature is named after these authors
   (K-J-M-A), but this equation is only a particular solution of
   Kolmogorov's general solution f(s) = 1 - exp(Omega), where the function
   Omega is the so-called total extended volume (per unit volume) of the
   growing grains, if their overlapping is neglected. Kolmogorov's general
   solution for the Omega-function is an accurate development only in the
   case of geometric similarity of the growing grains, their uniform
   distribution and equal orientation in space. Moreover. for an arbitrary
   moment and direction all grains must have the same absolute value of the
   growth velocity vector. If the conditions stated above are neglected,
   the above equations can give overestimated results. The source of this
   overestimation is the, so-called, screening effect. The presented
   solution takes into account the screening effect for the calculation of

Abstract = {{We report star polyhedral gold nanocrystals synthesized by colloidal
   reduction with ascorbic acid in water at ambient conditions. We identify
   two distinct classes of star nanocrystals: multiple-twinned crystals
   with fivefold symmetry, and monocrystals. These respective classes
   correspond to icosahedra and cuboctahedra, two Archimedian solids, with
   preferential growth of their \{111\} surfaces. Due to this preferential
   growth, the \{111\} faces of the original Archimedean solids grow to
   become tetrahedral pyramids, the base of each pyramid being the original
   polyhedral face. By assuming a star morphology, gold nanocrystals
   increase their proportion of exposed \{111\} surfaces, which possess the
   lowest surface energy among low-index crystallographic planes for FCC
   crystals. Thus, we propose that the driving force for star nanocrystal
   formation Could be the reduction in surface energy that the crystals
   experience. Interestingly, icosahedrally derived star nanocrystals
   possess a geometric morphology closely resembling the great stellated
   dodecahedron, a Kepler-Poinsot solid. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The fate of arsenic in aquatic systems is influenced by dissolved
   natural organic matter (DOM). Using UV-A and visible light from a
   medium-pressure mercury lamp, the photosensitized oxidation of As(III)
   to As(V) in the presence of Suwannee River humic acid was investigated.
   Pseudo-first-order kinetics was observed. For 5 mg L-1 of dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) and 1.85 mEinstein m(-2) s(-1) UV-A fluence rate,
   the rate coefficient k degrees exp was 21.2 +/- 3.2 10(-5) s(-1),
   corresponding to a half-life <1 h. Rates increased linearly with DOC and
   they increased by a factor of 10 from pH 4 to 8. Based on experiments
   with radical scavengers, heavy water, and surrogates for DOM, excited
   triplet states and/or phenoxyl radicals seem to be important
   photooxidants in this system (rather than singlet oxygen, hydrogen
   peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, and superoxide). Photoirradiation of
   natural samples from freshwater lakes, rivers, and rice field water
   (Bangladesh) showed similar photoinduced oxidation rates based on DOC.

Abstract = {{Nitric oxide (NO) acts as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator involving
   in the modulation of thermal and/or inflammatory hyperalgesia. The
   neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is a key enzyme for NO production
   in normal neuronal tissues, but its functional role in chronic pain
   remains unclear. The present study combined a genetic strategy with a
   pharmacologic approach to address the role of nNOS in the central
   mechanism of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced chronic
   inflammatory pain. Targeted disruption of the nNOS gene significantly
   reduced CFA-induced mechanical pain hypersensitivity during the
   maintenance (but not the development) of inflammatory pain, while it
   failed to attenuate either development or maintenance of CFA-induced
   thermal pain hypersensitivity. Intraperitoneal administration of
   L-N-G-nitro-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a non-specific NOS
   inhibitor, blocked CFA-evoked thermal and mechanical pain
   hypersensitivity at both development (2 h) and maintenance (24 h) phase
   in wild type mice, but had no effect in the knockout mice. Furthermore,
   intrathecal injection of either L-NAME or 7-nitroindazole, a selective
   nNOS inhibitor, markedly attenuated mechanical pain hypersensitivity at
   both 2 and 24 It after CFA injection. Finally, spinal cord nNOS (but not
   endothelial NOS or inducible NOS) expression was up-regulated at 24 h
   after CFA injection, occurring mainly in the ipsilateral superficial
   dorsal horn. Together, these data indicate that spinal cord nNOS may be
   essential for the maintenance of mechanical pain hypersensitivity and
   that it may also be sufficient for the development of mechanical pain
   hypersensitivity and for the development and maintenance of thermal pain
   hypersensitivity after chronic inflammation. Our findings suggest that
   spinal cord nNOS might play a critical role in central mechanisms of the
   development and/or maintenance of chronic inflammatory pain. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{The investigations covering the work hardening behavior of metals under
   strain path changes have pointed out the possibility of employing the
   strain softening phenomenon in sequential forming operations, specially
   in the case of cyclic straining. In this paper, the effects of cyclic
   torsion on the drawing stress of low carbon steel bars have been
   investigated. The material was drawn up to five passes. Cyclic straining
   was carried out between the last two stages of drawing and between every
   drawing pass. The substructural aspects of the bars were also analyzed.
   Cyclic torsion led to a decrease in the drawing stress values, whose
   magnitude depended on the number of forming passes considered in the
   experiment. The results also showed the occurrence of non-cumulative
   strain softening effects. Dislocation restructuring was found to be the
   softening mechanism related to the results. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Hydroxyapatite, chitosan, and aliphatic polyester were compounded using
   a twin-screw extruder. The polyesters include poly(epsilon-caprolac
   tone) (PCL), poly(lactic acid), poly(butylene succinate) (PBS), and
   poly(butylene terephthalate adipate). The mass fraction of chitosan
   ranged from 17.5 to 45\%, while that of HA ranged from 10 to 30\%. These
   blends were injection molded and evaluated for thermal, morphological,
   and mechanical properties. The addition of hydroxyapatite decreased the
   crystallinity in chitosan/PBS blends, while in blends containing
   chitosan/PCL, the crystallinity increased. Addition of hydroxyapatite
   significantly decreased the tensile strength and elongation of
   polyester/hydroxyapatite composites as well as
   chitosan/polyester/hydroxyapatite composites with elongations undergoing
   decreases over an order of magnitude. The tensile strength of the
   composite was dictated by the adhesion of HA to the chitosan/polyester
   matrix. The tensile strength of composites containing hydroxyapatite
   could be predicted using the Nicolai and Narkis equation for weak filler
   adhesion (K approximate to 1.21). Tensile-fractured and
   cryogenically-fractured surface indicates extensive debonding of
   hydroxyapatite crystals from the matrix, indicating weak adhesion. The
   adhe-sion of hydroxyapatite was higher for pure polyester than those
   containing chitosan and polyester. The modulus of the composites
   registered modest increase. The two main diffraction peaks observed
   using WAXS are unaffected by the amount of chitosan or hydroxyapatite.}},

Abstract = {{Because of its unique role in the viral replication process, HIV-1
   integrase (IN) is an important antiretroviral drug target. The
   beta-diketo acid class of IN inhibitors has played a major role in
   validating IN as a legitimate target for antiretroviral drug design.
   S-1360 (1) and L-870,810 (2) are examples of beta-diketo acid related
   compounds to enter clinical trials. With an aim to discover novel lead
   compounds with diverse structural scaffolds, we employed common feature
   pharmacophore models using four known beta-diketo acid analogues
   including S-1360 (J. Med. Chem. 2005, 1, 111-120). The best-ranked
   pharmacophore model (Hypol) contained a hydrophobic (HYA), an H-bond
   acceptor (HBA), and two H-bond donor (HBD) features. A search of a 3D
   database containing similar to 150 000 small molecules using Hypol found
   1700 compounds that satisfied all the features of the pharmacophore
   query. Of the 1700 compounds, 110 were selected for in vitro screening
   studies on the basis of their docking scores, predicted binding location
   inside the active site of IN, and their druglike properties. Forty-eight
   compounds inhibited IN catalytic activities with an IC50 value less than
   100 mu M. Twenty-seven structurally diverse inhibitors are reported
   here. Out of the 27 compounds, 13 compounds inhibited strand transfer
   activity of IN with an IC50 value less than 30 mu M. These compounds are
   novel, druglike, and readily amenable for synthetic optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To determine if supervised cardiovascular training improves
   exercise tolerance, aerobic capacity, depression, functional capacity,
   and quality of life in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
   Methods. Sixty women with SLE (ages 18-55 years) were evaluated using
   Short Form 36, visual analog scale for pain, scale for fatigue, Beck
   Depression Inventory, and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and
   participated in a training protocol of incremental load on a treadmill
   with computed gas metabolic analysis. Maximum oxygen consumption
   (Vo(2max)) and anaerobic threshold Vo(2) were calculated with a
   SensorMedics Vmax29C analyzer (Sensor Medics, Yorba Linda, CA), and
   heart rate was measured by electrocardiogram. Patients were divided into
   2 groups: a training group (41 patients) that participated in the
   supervised cardiovascular training program and a control group (19
   patients) that did not participate in the program. All variables were
   analyzed at baseline and after 12 weeks for both groups. The training
   program occurred in the morning for 60 minutes, 3 times a week for 12
   weeks. Statistical analysis included Wilcoxon's rank sum test,
   Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test, and Fisher's exact test. P values
   < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
   Results. The 2 groups were homogeneous and comparable at baseline. The
   training group showed a significant improvement (14.67 +/- 3.03 versus
   17.08 +/- 3.35 ml/kg/minute, P < 0.001). Comparison of the training
   group and control group after 12 weeks showed a significant difference
   relating to Vo(2) (24.31 +/- 4.61 versus 21.21 +/- 3.88 ml/kg/minute, P
   = 0.01) and anaerobic threshold Vo(2) (17.08 3.35 versus 13.66 +/- 2.82
   ml/kg/minute, P < 0.0001). After cardiovascular training, we found a
   significant improvement of Beck inventory score (8.37 +/- 12.79 versus
   2.90 +/- 3.00, P < 0.001) and HAQ score (0.14 +/- 0.21 versus 0.06 +/-
   0.19, P < 0.01) in the training group.
   Conclusion. This study showed significant improvement in exercise
   tolerance, aerobic capacity, quality of life, and depression after a
   supervised cardiovascular training program in patients with SLE.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Blastomycosis is a systemic fungal disease that may be
   asymptomatic or progressive and may lead to death.
   Methods. In response to a reported increase in the number of cases of
   blastomycosis in Illinois, surveillance data reported to the Illinois
   Department of Public Health from January 1993 to August 2003 were
   analyzed and the medical records of 4 patients who died were reviewed.
   Results. Among the 500 cases reported, the median age of the patients
   was 43 years (range, 4-87 years), and 34 patients (7\%) died. Higher
   rates of mortality were observed among persons who were black, who were
   >= 65 years of age, and who were male. The median time from onset of
   illness to diagnosis was 128 days (range, 12-489 days). Death was
   associated with a time from onset of illness to diagnosis of 128 days
   (OR, 2.1; 95\% CI, 1.0-4.8). During the period from 1993 through 2002,
   the number of cases reported per year increased from 24 to 87 (P < .05).
   Conclusions. The incidence of blastomycosis has been increasing in
   Illinois. To reduce mortality related to delay in diagnosis and
   treatment, medical providers need to be educated about blastomycosis,
   with an emphasis on symptom recognition, methods of diagnosis, and
   appropriate antifungal treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Background: This study focused on metabolic brain alterations in

   reversibility after 3 (S2) and 6 months (S3) of abstinence.
   Methods: Thirty-three alcohol-dependent patients and 30 healthy control
   subjects were studied with multislice proton magnetic resonance
   spectroscopic imaging (echo time = 135 msec at 1.5 T at three time
   points).
   Results: In the patient group, we found that choline-containing
   compounds (Ch) in three frontal and cerebellar subregions at S1
   were,differences did not reach significance but showed a trend toward
   significantly below normal, whereas N-acetyl asparlate (AAA)
   below-normal values infrontal white matter. Abstinent patients showed a
   significant increase of Ch in all subregions at S2. At S3, no further
   significant metabolite changes in abstinent patients compared with S2
   could be detected. No significant increase of NAA could be detected at
   follow-up.
   Conclusions. The increase of the Ch signal in the follow-up measurement
   after 3 months in abstinent alcohol-dependent patients supports the
   hypotheses of an alcohol- or alcohol detoxification-induced altered
   cerebral metabolism of lipids in membranes or myelin, which seems to be
   reversible with duration of alcohol abstinence.}},

Abstract = {{Electrolytic conductivity behavior of some cationic polysaccharides in
   water, methanol, and the mixtures water/methanol is presented. The
   polyelectrolytes investigated contain quaternary ammonium salt groups,
   N-alkyl-N,N-dimethyl-2-hydroxypropyleneammonium chloride, attached to a
   dextran backbone. This study considers the influences of polymer
   concentration (1 x 10(-6) < C < 1 x 10(-2) monomol L-1) and the charge
   density (xi = 0.48-3.17) modified either by changing charge distance (b)
   or dielectric constant of the solvent (epsilon) on polyion-counterion
   interaction in salt-free solutions. Above the critical value, xi(c) = 1,
   the variation of the equivalent conductivity (Lambda) as a function of
   concentration is typical for a polyelectrolyte behavior. The
   conductometric data in water were analyzed in terms of the Manning's

Abstract = {{Purpose: The European Cooperative Trial in Operable breast cancer (ECTO)
   randomly tested whether efficacy of adjuvant doxorubicin followed by
   i.v. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF; doxorubicin
   -> 4CMF, arm A) could be improved by adding paclitaxel
   (doxorubicin/paclitaxel -> CMF) as adjuvant (arm 13) or primary systemic
   therapy (PST, arm C). We report here feasibility, tolerability,
   locoregional antitumor activity, and breast conservation rate.
   Methods: A total of 1,355 women entered the study Feasibility and safety
   were compared in arm A versus arms B plus C. Surgical findings were
   compared in arms A plus B versus arm C.
   Results: Grade 3 or 4 National Cancer Institute toxicities were low (<
   5\%) in all arms. Neuropathy was more frequent in the
   paclitaxel-containing arms (grade 2, 20.5\% versus 5.0\%; grade 3, 1.3\%
   versus 0.2\%). At 31 months of follow-up, asymptomatic drop of left
   ventricular ejection fraction was similar in all arms, whereas
   symptomatic cardiotoxicity was recorded in three patients (0.5\%) in A
   and in three patients (0.3\%) in B plus C. PST induced clinical complete
   plus partial remission in 78\%, with an in-breast pathologic complete
   response rate of 23\% and an in-breast plus axilla pathologic complete
   response rate of 20\%. In the multivariate analysis, only estrogen
   receptor (ER) status was significantly associated with pathologic
   complete response (odds ratio for ER negative, 5.77; 95\% confidence
   interval, 3.49-9.52; P < 0.0001). PTS induced a significant axillary
   downstaging (P < 0.001), and breast sparing surgery was feasible in 65\%
   versus 34\% (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Doxorubicin/paclitaxel -> CMF is feasible,safe, and well
   tolerated. Given as PST, it is markedly active, allowing for
   breast-sparing. surgery in a large fraction of patients.}},

Abstract = {{In eukaryotes, the interaction of DNA with proteins and supramolecular
   complexes involved in gene expression is controlled by the dynamic
   organization of chromatin inasmuch as it defines the DNA accessibility.
   Here, the nuclear distribution of microinjected fluorescein-labeled
   dextrans of 42 kDa to 2.5 MDa molecular mass was used to characterize
   the chromatin accessibility in dependence on histone acetylation.
   Measurements of the fluorescein-dextran sizes were combined with an
   image correlation spectroscopy analysis, and three different interphase
   chromatin condensation states with apparent pore sizes of 16-20 nm,
   36-56 nm and 60-100 nm were identified. A reversible change of the
   chromatin conformation to a uniform 60-100 nm pore size distribution was
   observed upon increased histone acetylation. This result identifies
   histone acetylation as a central factor in the dynamic regulation of
   chromatin accessibility during interphase. In mitotic chromosomes, the
   chromatin exclusion limit was 10-20 nm and independent of the histone
   acetylation state.}},

Abstract = {{Both increased and decreased dyskinesias have been reported from open
   label clinical trials of transplantation of human embryonic dopamine
   rich tissue in Parkinson's disease patients. In the first double-blind
   clinical transplantation trial, 15\% of the grafted patients developed
   severe postoperative dyskinesias in the ``off{''} phase. Since then,
   postoperative off-medication dyskinesias have been reported from two
   additional series of grafted patients. However, such dyskinesias are
   probably not a novel phenomenon. These dyskinesias have shown a
   different temporal development postoperatively compared to the
   antiparkinsonian graft effects, and no significant relationship with the
   magnitude of graft-derived dopaminergic reinnervation or symptomatic
   relief. However, positron emission tomography studies have indicated
   that an unbalanced putaminal dopaminergic function may contribute to
   this postoperative complication. While there is little doubt that
   intrastriatal grafts can induce dyskinesias, these appear to differ from
   common drug-induced dyskinesias. The term graft-induced dyskinesias
   (GID) is therefore suggested to more clearly identify this complication.
   While GID, bear some phenomenological resemblance to biphasic drug
   induced dyskinesias, the mechanism(s) behind this complication
   remains,obscure. Available data are scarce but allow for hypotheses to
   be generated that could (and should) be addressed in experimental
   animals. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Optical writing of small structures is usually governed by the

   properties, it is possible to break this limit with conventional optical
   focusing systems. We estimate here theoretically the fundamental limits
   of resolution achievable in two different classes of nonlinear materials
   using a scalar approximation. Within this approximation our calculations
   suggest that the best possible resolution is given by 0.45 lambda(0)/(NA
   root(SNR)), where lambda(0) is the wavelength in vacuum, NA is the
   numerical aperture of the focusing system, and SNR is the signal to
   noise ratio of the system. Thus, we find that nanometer resolution is
   only feasible if the SNR is sufficiently large. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{We studied ion beam mixing and He accumulation in Cu/Nb multilayer thin

   1.5x10(17) atoms/cm(2). Multilayered thin films consisting of
   alternating Cu and Nb layers were produced by magnetron sputtering. Two
   types of samples, one with an individual layer thickness of 4 nm and
   another with 40 nm were examined. The Cu/Nb samples were analyzed in the
   as-deposited state, after He ion implantation, as well as after
   post-implantation annealing. The ion beam mixing of the interface
   structure was monitored by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry and
   cross-section transmission electron microscopy imaging. Elastic recoil
   detection analysis was performed to examine the helium concentration
   depth distribution. Scanning electron microscopy was employed to
   investigate He blister formation upon annealing. A comparison of the
   results deduced from the methods listed above reveals a very high
   morphological stability of the nanolayered structure. The nanolayered

Abstract = {{A magnetic force microscopy is used to examine the domain walls in
   nickel and cobalt films deposited by argon ion sputtering. Thin nickel
   films deposited at high substrate temperatures exhibit coexistent Bloch
   and Neel walls. Films grown at room temperature display alternative
   Bloch lines with cap switches. These films agglomerate to form grains
   after annealed at high temperatures. The film composed of larger grains
   behaves better nucleation implying magnetic domains of closure, while
   the film composed of smaller grains exhibits more defects implying
   alternative Bloch lines. We have also observed domain displacements and
   cap switches, which occur due to precipitation of particles in small
   grain size films. Stripe domains are observed for film thicknesses
   larger than 100 nm. They become zigzag cells when an external field of
   1.5 T is applied perpendicular to the surface of the films. This
   experiment indicates that the domain sizes in thin films and the strip
   widths for thick films both depend on the square-root of the film
   thickness, which varies from 5 to 45 nm and from 100 to 450 nm,
   respectively. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Our recent studies on PEG-Hb {[}poly(ethylene glycol)-Hb] conjugates
   generated by thiolation-mediated maleimide-chemistry based PEGylation
   demonstrated that the vasoactivity of the PEG-Hb conjugates is a
   function of the configuration of the PEG chains on the sufface of the
   protein and is independent of the PEG/ protein-mass ratio {[}Manjula, A.
   G. Tsai, Intaglietta, H.-C. Tsai, Ho, Smith, Perumalsamy, Kanika,
   Friedman and Acharya (2005) Protein J. 24, 133-146]. A Hb conjugated
   with six PEG5k chains (SP-PEG5k)(6)-Hb, was vasoinactive. In an attempt
   to understand whether the chemistry of conjugation of PEG to Hb has any
   influence on the modulation of its functional and solution properties,
   we have now generated a new hexaPEGylated-Hb, (propylPEG5k)(6)-Hb, by
   reductive alkylation chemistry. CD (circular dichroism) spectral
   measurements indicated that the overall secondary structure of Hb is not
   adversely influenced upon PEGylation. (Propyl-PEG5k)(6)-Hb exhibited an
   increased O-2 affinity with decreased co-operativity and decreased
   modulation by allosteric effectors comparable with that of
   (SP-PEG5k),-Hb, although its Cys-93(beta) is not derivatized as in the
   latter. On a molecular mass basis, PEG linked to Hb by reductive
   alkylation increased its COP (colloidal osmotic pressure) more
   efficiently than when linked by thiolation-mediated maleimide-chemistry.
   These results demonstrate that the functional properties of PEG-Hb
   conjugates may be a direct consequence of surface decoration of Hb with
   PEG, but are independent of the site (pattern) and/or the chemistry of
   PEGylation. However the solution properties of PEGylated Hb are
   influenced by the site (pattern) and/or the chemistry of PEGylation and
   the presence or absence of an `extension arm' between the conjugating
   site of Hb and the PEG chain.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a robust fault detection and identification approach
   based on an adaptive observer is developed for uncertain continuous
   linear time-invariant systems with multiple discrete time-delays in both

   unstructured bounded unknown inputs. Based on the scheme of {[}Trunov,

   Transactions on Neural Networks, 11, 91-101], a novel adaptive observer
   for detecting and estimating faults in the considered system is
   constructed, and robustness with respect to unknown inputs and
   sensitivity to faults of the detecting scheme are rigorously analyzed.
   The fault estimate and the state estimation error are then proved to be
   uniformly bounded. Finally, simulations of a heating process demonstrate
   that the proposed approach can detect the faults shortly after the
   occurrences without any false alarm and can approximate the faults with

Abstract = {{Exposure to indoor air pollution from household energy use depends on
   fuel, stove, housing characteristics, and stove use behavior. We
   monitored three important indoor air pollutants-respirable particles
   (RPM), carbon monoxide (CO), and sulfur dioxide (SO2)-for a total of 457
   household-days in four poor provinces in China (Gansu, 129
   household-days; Guizhou, 127 household-days; Inner Mongolia, 65
   household-days; and Shaanxi, 136 household-days), in two time intervals
   during the heating season to investigate spatial and temporal patterns
   of pollution. The two provinces where biomass is the primary fuel (Inner
   Mongolia and Gansu) had the highest RPM concentrations (719 mu g/m(3) in
   the single cooking/living/bedroom in Inner Mongolia in December and
   351-661 mu g/m(3) in different rooms and months in Gansu); lower RPM
   concentration were observed in the primarily coal-burning provinces of
   Guizhou and Shaanxi (202-352 mu g/m(3) and 187-361 mu g/m(3) in
   different rooms and months in Guizhou and Shaanxi, respectively). Inner
   Mongolia and Gansu also had higher CO concentrations (7.4 ppm in the
   single cooking/living/bedroom in Inner Mongolia in December and 4.8-11.3
   ppm in different rooms and months in Gansu). Among the two primarily
   coal-burning provinces, Guizhou had lower concentrations of CO than
   Shaanxi (1.2-1.8 ppm in Guizhou vs 2.0-13.3 ppm in different rooms and
   months in Shaanxi). In the two coal-burning provinces, SO2
   concentrations were substantially higher in Shaanxi than in Guizhou.
   Relative concentrations in different rooms and provinces indicate that
   in the northern provinces heating is an important source of exposure to
   indoor pollutants from energy use. Day-to-day variability of
   concentrations within individual households, although substantial, was
   smaller than variation across households. The implications of the
   findings for designing environmental health interventions in each
   province are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed Anax junius dragonfly naiad strike frequencies and kill

   into five categories according to their placement on the tadpole body:
   anterior head/body, posterior head/body, head/body-tail intersection,
   anterior tail, and posterior tail. The kill probability was calculated
   for each category as the number of kills divided by the number of
   contacts made in that category. These probabilities varied; a higher
   probability was found for both the anterior and posterior head/body, and
   values declined for successively posterior categories. Neither the kill
   probability nor the size of the body zone influenced the number of
   strikes to that zone. Surprisingly, the dragonfly naiads struck most
   frequently at the relatively narrow region of the head/body-tail
   intersection, suggesting that dragonfly naiads may aim at a specific

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{We have developed a novel double-layer zymographic method for the
   detection of specific processing proteases of a target proprotease using
   a specific fluorescent substrate. The target processing proteases were
   separated using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
   electrophoresis, and the gel was subsequently incubated with the target
   proenzyme used as the substrate. A cellulose acetate membrane was
   immersed in 10\% glycerol and then soaked in the fluorescent substrate
   solution. The slab gel of the processing protease was covered with the
   fluorescent substrate membrane, making a double layer. The double layer
   was incubated at 37 degrees C, and the released fluorescent band, in
   which the processing protease was located, was detected using UV light.
   The advantages of the double-layer fluorescent zymographic method are as
   follows: (i) the specific detection of target proprotease using a
   specific substrate, (ii) a relatively rapid and sensitive method, (iii)
   effective detection using small amounts of crude material, and (iv) wide
   applications that include the detection of processing proteases and
   activators for target proteases. Typical examples used for the detection
   of the processing proteases, such as plasminogen activator,
   chymotrypsinogen activator, procaspase-3 processing protease and
   caspase-3 activators, using this new method are described in this

Abstract = {{The MN1-TEL (meningioma 1-translocation-ETS-leukemia) fusion oncoprotein
   is the product of the t(12;22)(p13;q11) in human myeloid leukemia
   consisting of N-terminal MN1 sequences, a transcriptional coactivator,
   fused to C-terminal TEL sequences, an E26-transformation-specific (ETS)
   transcription factor. To analyze the role of MN1-TEL in leukemogenesis,
   we created a site-directed transgenic (knock-in) mouse model carrying a
   conditional MN1-TEL transgene under the control of the Aml1 regulatory
   sequences. After induction, MN1-TEL expression was detected in both
   myeloid and lymphoid cells. Activation of MN1-TEL expression enhanced
   the repopulation ability of myeloid progenitors in vitro as well as
   partially inhibited their differentiation in vivo. MN1-TEL also promoted
   the proliferation of thymocytes while it blocked their differentiation
   from CD4(-)/CD8(-) to CD4(+)/CD8(+) in vivo. After long latency, 30\% of
   the MN1-TEL-positive mice developed T-lymphoid tumors. This process was
   accelerated by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mutations. MN1-TEL-positive
   T-lymphoid tumors showed elevated expression of the Notch-1, Hes-1,
   c-Myc, and Lmo-2 genes while their lnk4a/pRB and Arf/p53 pathways were
   impaired, suggesting that these alterations cooperatively transform T
   progenitors. We conclude that MN1-TEL exerts its nonlineage-specific
   leukemogenic effects by promoting the growth of primitive progenitors
   and blocking their differentiation, but cooperative mutations are
   necessary to fully induce leukemic transformation.}},

Abstract = {{The nonlinear transient dynamics and stability of a two-dimensional
   (2-D) model of the isothermal film casting process have been
   investigated 0 using newly devised simulation techniques employing
   finite element methods (FEM), which can incorporate the viscoelastic
   nature of polymer melts as well as the Newtonian features of other
   fluids. To effectively solve the time-dependent free surface problem of
   this system, the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) algorithm together
   with a spine method well-suited for free surface tracking was
   incorporated. Adopting robust numerical stabilization techniques for the
   hyperbolic system of extensional deformation processes in this study,
   the transient dynamic behavior of viscoelastic fluids in the 2-D film
   casting process are presented for the first time in the literature. It
   is also demonstrated that simulation models in the present study can
   successfully describe the basic flow behavior of the system including
   the three instability modes therein, i.e., draw resonance, neck-in, and
   development of edge beads. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Myocardial perfusion (MP) may differ in physiologic and pathologic left
   ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). We compared MP in LVH in elite athletes
   and patients with hypertension with healthy, age-matched subjects. We
   included 12 rowers with LVH, 19 patients with hypertension with LVH, and
   2 age-matched groups of healthy subjects (n=11 and n=12). The left
   ventricular mass index was determined echocardiographically. MP was
   measured by N-13 ammonia positron emission tomography. The maximal
   perfusion and perfusion reserve were studied using dipyridamole,and
   endothelial function was assessed by a cold pressor test. The degree of
   LVH was similar in athletes and those with hypertension. Compared with
   controls, athletes had 20\% lower baseline MP (p<0.05), a similar
   response to the cold pressor test, and a higher perfusion reserve (31\%,
   p<0.05). The patients with hypertension had a 25\% higher baseline MP
   (p<0.05), a reduced increase during the cold pressor test (12\% vs 25\%
   in controls, p<0.05), and a reduced perfusion reserve (27\% lower,
   p<0.001). The peak global perfusion (MP X left ventricular mass index)
   was 62\% higher in athletes (p<0.05) than in controls, but the peak
   global perfusion in patients with hypertension did not differ from that
   of controls. In conclusion, physiologic LVH in athletes is suited for a
   high peak workload at the cost of only a small increase in basal
   myocardial oxygen consumption. In contrast, LVH in the presence of
   hypertension is a good adaptation to the increased baseline workload
   with maintained maximal cardiac performance. Endothelial dysfunction may
   contribute to the reduced perfusion reserve seen in hypertensive LVH.

   Two isolates from the same locality did not produce domoic acid. Of the
   21 isolates from Bulacan Estuary, Manila Bay, none produced domoic acid.
   They did, however, produce two substances that seemed to be domoic acid
   derivatives. One of the strains was mass cultured and the substances
   were extracted, purified and analyzed by LC-MS/MS, proton and (13)C NMR,
   and UV spectra. The produced substances were determined as isodomoic

Abstract = {{Objective: Evidence suggests that cognitive functioning in bipolar
   disorder may be impaired even in euthymic states, but it is unclear if
   the pattern of deficits is similar to the deficits found in
   schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to review quantitatively the
   studies on cognitive performance in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
   Methods: Articles for consideration were identified through a literature
   search in MEDLINE and PsycLIT in the period between 1985 and October
   2004, using the keywords ``schizophrenia{''} combined with ``bipolar
   disorder{''}, or ``manic-depress{*}{''} or ``manic{''} combined with
   ``cogniti{*}{''} or ``neuropsycholog{*}{''}. Thirty-one studies were
   included that: i) evaluated cognitive performance using standardized and
   reliable neuropsychological testing procedures; ii) compared adult
   patients with schizophrenia and with bipolar disorder; iii) reported
   test scores of both patient groups, or exact p-values, t-values, or
   F-values; and iv) were published as an original article in a
   peer-reviewed English language journal.
   Results: Meta-analyses of all studies indicated that patients with
   bipolar disorder generally perform better than patients with
   schizophrenia, but the distribution of effect sizes showed substantial
   heterogeneity. Results based on a more homogeneous subset of studies
   that matched patient groups on clinical and demographic characteristics
   pointed in the same direction, with effect sizes in the moderate range.
   Conclusions: Patients with bipolar disorder show better cognitive
   performance than patients with schizophrenia, even when matched for
   clinical and demographic characteristics. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{H-2-loaded Ge-doped preform plates have been UV hyper-sensitized and
   subsequently post-exposed by means of UV ArF laser pulses at 193 nm.
   Both Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Vacuum Ultraviolet (VUV)
   absorption spectroscopy has been carried out at each step of the
   sensitization process with a view to get a better understanding of the
   UV hyper-sensitization process at 193 nm. Exposing the H2-loaded samples
   firstly triggers a partial bleaching of the 5 eV absorption band,
   followed by a new growth of the band for longer exposure time. As it has
   already been reported for exposure at 248 nm, the exposure at 193 nut
   firstly yields an increase in the absorption ascribed to hydroxyl (3600
   cm(-1)), hydride species (approximate to 2140-2185 cm(-1)) and GeE'
   defects ( approximate to 6.3 eV). The evolution of the absorption
   related to the GeH2 species is not monotonous but rather the absorption
   reaches a peak (N-pre = 2000) and then slightly decreases for further
   exposure time. Post-exposing the hyper-sensitized samples (N-pre = 2000)
   lead to a partial bleaching of the absorption ascribed to hydride
   species and to increases in the intensity of the GeE' defect-related
   absorption and in the absorption ascribed to hydroxyl species. The
   accurate determination of the species concentration from the absorption
   spectra proved to be rather tricky due to the problem of accurately
   measuring the depth of the UV beam penetration at each time of the
   exposure. Nevertheless, a correlation could be established between the
   growth of the UV-induced UV excess loss ascribed to GeE' species and the
   UV-induced decrease in the intensity of the IR bands related to hydride
   species. These observations are discussed within the frame-work of the
   two step model. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Study Design. A spinal cord injury and in vitro neural hypoxia models
   were used to evaluate the hypoxia responsive gene expression.
   Objectives. To limit the risk of unwanted overexpression of therapeutic
   genes, we developed a hypoxia-inducible gene therapy system using the
   erythropoietin (Epo) enhancer and the RTP801 promoter.
   Summary of Background Data. Gene therapy is an emerging therapeutic
   technique to treat spinal cord injury. However, uncontrolled
   overexpression of therapeutic genes in nondisease tissues during gene
   therapy raises a doubt about its safety. Post-traumatic ischemia is an
   important factor worsening the spinal cord damage, and hypoxia could
   regulate the gene expressions using a hypoxia-inducible promoter.
   Methods. The plasmids, pEpo-SV-Luc and pRTP801-Luc, were constructed.
   Mouse neuroblastoma cells (N2A) were used to evaluate the
   hypoxia-inducible gene expression in vitro. Gene transfection and
   expression were allowed for 24 hours under normoxia (pO(2), 152 mm Hg)
   or hypoxia (pO(2), 7.6 mm Hg). Spinal cord injury was made using clip
   compression. Plasmids were injected directly into the injured spinal
   cord immediately following injury. The gene expression was assessed by
   luciferase assay.
   Results. pEpo-SV-Luc and pRTP801-Luc showed more than three times higher
   gene expression in N2A cells under hypoxia than normoxia. The expression
   level of luciferase in the injured spinal cord was higher than in the
   normal spinal cord. Immunostaining demonstrated that neurons,
   astrocytes, and capillary endothelial cells expressed luciferase in the
   cytoplasm.
   Conclusions. The pEpo- SV-Luc and pRTP801-Luc systems are effective in
   that they induce gene expression specifically in neurons under the
   hypoxic condition and spinal cord injury.}},

Abstract = {{A sequential injection analysis (SIA) system was developed to monitor
   the concentration of L-cysteine in biological processes on-line. It is
   based on the redox reaction of L-cysteine with iron(III) in the presence
   of 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) and the detection of the red-iron(H)-phen
   complex with a spectrophotometry. The system was fully automated using
   software written in the LabVIEW (TM) development environment. A number
   of system variables such as the flow rate of the carrier buffer
   solution, the volume ratio of the sample to the reagents, and the
   reaction coil length, etc., were evaluated to increase the sensitivity
   and performance of the SIA system. Under partially optimized operating
   conditions the performance of the SIA system was linear up to a
   concentration of L-cysteine of 1 mM (R-2 =0.998) with a detection limit
   of 0.005 mM and a sample frequency of 15 hr(-1). The SIA system was
   employed to monitor the concentration of L-cysteine on-line in a
   continuously stirred reactor and a fermentation process of Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae. The on-line monitored data were in good agreement with the
   off-line data measured by a HPLC with a fluorescence detector (n= 15,
   R-2 =09899). (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We experimentally determined the boron partitioning and boron isotope
   fractionation between coexisting liquid and vapor in the system
   H2O-NaCl-B2O3. Experiments were performed along the 400 and 450 degrees
   C isotherms. Pressure conditions ranged from 23 to 28 MPa at 400 degrees
   C and from 38 to 42 MPa at 450 degrees C. Boron partitions
   preferentially into the liquid. Its overall liquid-vapor fractionation
   is, however, weak: Calculated boron distribution coefficients
   D-B(liquid-vapor) are < 2.5 at all run conditions. With decreasing
   pressure (i.e. increasing opening of the solvus) D-B(liquid-vapor)
   increases along the individual isotherms. Extrapolation to salt
   saturated conditions yields maximum boron liquid-vapor fractionations of
   D, liquid-vapor = 1.8 at 450 degrees C and D-B(liquid-vapor) = 2.7 at
   400 degrees C. B-11 preferentially fractionates into the vapor.
   Calculated Delta B-11(vapor-liquid)

   (951)\}{*}1000 are small and range from 0.2 (+/- 0.7) to 0.9 (+/- 0.5)
   parts per thousand at 450 degrees C and from 0.1 (+/- 0.6) to 0.7 (+/-
   0.6) parts per thousand at 400 degrees C. The data indicate increasing
   isotopic fractionation with decreasing pressure (i.e. increasing opening
   of the solvus). Extrapolation to salt saturated conditions yields
   maximum boron isotope liquid-vapor fractionations of Delta
   B-11(vapor-liquid) = 1.5 (+/- 0.7) parts per thousand at 450 degrees C
   and Delta B-11(vapor-liquid)-1.3 (+/- 0.6) parts per thousand at 400
   degrees C. The weak boron isotope fractionation suggests similar
   trigonal speciation in liquid and vapor. Although the boron and boron
   isotope fractionation between liquid and vapor is only weak, mass
   balance calculations indicate that for high degrees of fractionation
   liquid-vapor phase separation in an open system can significantly alter
   the boron and boron isotope signature of low-salinity hydrous fluids in
   hydrothermal systems. Comparing the model calculations with natural
   oceanic hydrothermal fluids, however, indicate that other processes than
   fluid phase separation dominate the boron geochemistry in oceanic
   hydrothermal fluids. Copyright (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{{[}1] Numerous simulations were conducted in order to quantify the
   influence of nightside conductance morphology and intensity on the
   storm-time ring current and plasmasphere. The study focused on the
   moderate magnetic storm of 17 April 2002. The simulation results were
   compared against measurements of the ring current and plasmasphere in
   order to assess the accuracy as a function of conductance parameter
   setting. In particular, three data sets were used: Dst{*}, plasmapause
   location as extracted from IMAGE EUV snapshots, and IMAGE HENA flux
   observations for the 39 - 60 keV energy range. While no single
   simulation conducted for this study proved itself to be the best overall
   match to the selected data sets, many things were learned from the
   simulations. The most important scientific finding is that there is an
   optimal conductance level for maximal ring current intensity. Too little
   conductance leads to large shielding potentials that effectively inhibit
   ring current growth, while too much conductance leads to continual
   flow-through of the hot ions with no significant hot ion accumulation in
   the inner magnetosphere. It was found that the poleward shift of the
   high conductance region of the auroral oval was the most important
   factor affecting the data-model comparisons. The peak intensity of the
   auroral oval conductance was also determined to be a significant factor
   affecting model accuracy. Tilting the dawnside location of the oval
   equatorward with respect to its duskside latitude had little effect on
   the results, as did the setting for the uniformly applied baseline
   conductance. The high-latitude boundary condition for the potential
   solution was also found to have little influence on the results.}},

Abstract = {{Mcl-1 is a Bcl-2-family, antiapoptotic molecule that is critical for the
   survival of T and B lymphocytes and macrophages; however, its role in
   nonhemopoietic cells remains to be fully elucidated. The current study
   focuses on the role of Mcl-1 in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Mcl-1 was
   strongly expressed in the synovial lining and was increased in the
   sublining fibroblasts of patients with RA, compared with control
   synovial tissue. The expression of Mcl-1 in sublining fibroblasts
   correlated with the degree of inflammation and TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta
   treatment of cultured synovial fibroblasts resulted in the increased
   expression of Mcl-1 at the mRNA and protein levels. Mcl-1 was critical
   for the survival of RA synovial fibroblasts, because the forced
   reduction of Mcl-1 using a Mcl-1 antisense-expressing adenoviral vector
   induced apoptotic cell death, which was mediated through Bax, Bak, and
   Bim. These observations document a critical role for Mcl-1 in protecting
   against apoptosis in RA and suggest that Mcl-1 is a potential
   therapeutic target in this disease.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Both the Arthritis Self-Management Program (ASMP) and the
   generic Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP) have been shown
   to be successful in improving conditions in patients with arthritis.
   This study compared the relative effectiveness of the 2 programs for
   individuals with arthritis.
   Methods. Patients whose primary disease was arthritis were randomized to
   the ASMP (n = 239) or to the CDSMP (n 116). Analyses of covariance were
   used to compare the outcome measures for the 2 programs at 4 months and
   1 year. Measures included quality of life outcomes (self reported,
   health distress, disability, activity limitation, global health, pain,
   and fatigue), health behaviors (practice of mental stress management,
   stretching and strength exercise, aerobic exercise), self efficacy, and
   health care utilization (physician visits and hospitalizations).
   Results. Both programs showed positive results. The disease-specific
   ASMP appeared to have advantages over the more generic CDSMP for
   patients with arthritis at 4 months. These advantages had lessened
   slightly by 1 year.
   Conclusion. The disease-specific ASMP should be considered first where
   there are sufficient resources and participants. However, both programs
   had positive effects, and the CDSMP should be considered a viable
   alternative.}},

Abstract = {{Iron(II)-dithiocarbamate complexes are used to trap nitrogen monoxide in
   biological samples, and the resulting nitrosyliron(II)dithiocarbamate is
   detected and quantified by ESR. As the chemical properties of these
   compounds have been little studied, we investigated whether iron
   dithiocarbamate complexes can redox cycle. The electrode potentials of
   iron complexes of N-(dithiocarboxy)sarcosine (dtcs) and
   N-methyl-D-glucamine dithiocarbarnate (mgd) are 56 and -25 mV at pH 7.4,
   respectively, as measured by cyclic voltammetry. The autoxidation and
   Fenton reaction of iron(II)-dtcs and iron(II)-mgd were studied by
   stopped-flow spectrophotometry with both iron(II) complexes and dioxygen
   or hydrogen peroxide in excess. In the case of excess iron(II)-dtcs and
   -mgd complexes, the rate constants of the autoxidation and the Fenton
   reaction are (1.6-3.2) x 10(4) and (0.7- 1.1) x 10(5) M-1 s(-1),
   respectively. In the presence of nitrogen monoxide, the oxidation of
   iron(II)-dtcs and iron(II)-mgd by hydrogen peroxide is significantly
   slower (ca. 10-15 M-1 s(-1)). The physiological reductants ascorbate,
   cysteine, and glutathione efficiently reduce iron(Ill)-dtcs and
   iron(Ill)-mgd. Therefore, iron bound to dies and mgd can redox cycle
   between iron(II) and iron(III), The ligands dtcs and mgd are slowly
   oxidized by hydrogen peroxide with rate constants of 5.0 and 3.8 M-1
   s(-1), respectively. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In many cells, endocytotic membrane retrieval is accelerated by Ca2+.
   The effect of Ca2+ on single endocytotic vesicles and fission pore
   kinetics was examined by measuring capacitance and conductance changes
   in small membrane patches of insulin-secreting INS-1 cells. In intact
   cells, elevation of Ca2+ by glucose stimulation induced a 1.8-fold
   increase in membrane internalisation. This surprisingly resulted from an
   increased unitary capacitance of endocytotic vesicles whereas the
   frequency of endocytosis was unaltered. This effect of glucose was
   prevented by inhibition of L- or R-type Ca2+ channels. Extracellular
   (pipette) Ca2+ was found to regulate endocytotic vesicle capacitance in
   a bimodal manner. Vesicle capacitance was increased at intermediate Ca2+
   (2.6 mM), but not at high Ca2+ (10 mM). Similar results were obtained
   upon direct application of 100 nM and 0.5 mM Ca2+ to the intracellular
   surface of inside-out excised membrane patches, and in these experiments
   the increase in vesicle capacitance was prevented by the calcineurin
   inhibitor deltamethrin. Endocytotic fission pore kinetics were
   accelerated by Ca2+ in both the intact cells and isolated membrane
   patches; however, the effect in this case was neither bimodal nor
   deltamethrin sensitive. Membrane retrieval can therefore be upregulated
   by a Ca2+-dependent increase in endocytotic vesicle size and
   acceleration of membrane fission in insulin-secreting INS-1 cells.}},

Abstract = {{Transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) plays a central
   role in the pathogenesis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). In
   anaplastic large-cell lymphomas (ALCLs), which share molecular lesions
   with cHL, the NF-kappa B system has not been equivalently investigated.
   Here we describe constitutive NF-kappa B p50 homodimer {[}(p50)(2)]
   activity in ALCL cells in the absence of constitutive activation of the
   I kappa B kinase (IKK) complex. Furthermore, (p50)(2) contributes to the
   NF-kappa B activity in Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells. Bcl-3, which
   is an inducer of nuclear (p50)(2) and is associated with (p50)(2) in
   ALCL and HRS cell lines, is abundantly expressed in ALCL and HRS cells.
   Notably, a selective overexpression of Bcl-3 target genes is found in
   ALCL cells. By immunohistochemical screening of 288 lymphoma cases, a
   strong Bcl-3 expression in cHL and in peripheral T-cell non-Hodgkin
   lymphoma (T-NHL) including ALCL was found. In 3 of 6 HRS cell lines and
   25\% of primary ALCL, a copy number increase of the BCL3 gene locus was
   identified. Together, these data suggest that elevated Bcl-3 expression
   has an important function in cHL and peripheral T-NHL, in particular
   ALCL.}},

Abstract = {{Antimicrobial peptides are small-sized, cationic and amphipathic
   molecules able to neutralize pathogenic microorganisms. Their
   antimicrobial effects tie them to mechanisms of immune defense, which is
   why they have been normally purified from immune cells. We describe an
   apparently new group of antimicrobial peptides from gill tissues of the
   mussel Mytilus edulis chilensis. 20 specimens yielded 40 g of gills
   which produced 16 mg of an enriched fraction with antimicrobial activity
   as low as 0.045 mu g/mu l over reference strains. Considering the
   chemical nature of these molecules we used an acid extraction procedure
   followed by consecutive cationic exchange and hydrophobic interaction
   chromatography steps for peptide enrichment. The resulting post Seppak
   C-18 (R) 20\% acetonitrile (ACN) eluate was fractionated by reverse
   phase HPLC and all resulting fractions were the source for in vitro
   antimicrobial activity evaluation. Active fractions were characterized
   by SDS-containing protein gel electrophoresis. All fractions were
   particularly enriched with low molecular weight peptides displaying
   neutralizing growth activity against Gram positive and Gram negative
   bacteria and 10 times more efficient over fungal pathogens. Active
   fractions resulted to be thermostable and non cytotoxic to eukaryotic
   cells. Considering these results, industrial waste gills of bivalves
   arise as a new source for antimicrobial molecules.}},

Title = {{Provenance of Late Cretaceous to Paleocene submarine fan sandstones in
   the Norwegian Sea: Integration of heavy mineral, mineral chemical and
   zircon age data}},
Journal = {{SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{182}},

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes a strategy for effective discrimination and
   provenance evaluation of sandstones transported by different sediment
   dispersal systems using an integrated programme of heavy mineral
   analysis, mineral chemistry and zircon age dating. Sandstones derived
   from different source regions are initially discriminated using
   provenance-sensitive heavy mineral parameters (ratios of abundances of
   stable, hydraulically equivalent minerals). Differences between the
   heavy mineral populations are reinforced by single-grain mineral
   chemical analysis, which also provides further information on the nature
   of the source terrains. Zircon age dating of representative samples
   places further constraints on the location of the source areas, by
   identifying the main crust-forming events. In addition, the validity of
   the mineralogical discrimination can be tested by the zircon age data.
   The value of this integrated approach is illustrated by a case study of
   deep marine Late Cretaceous-Paleocene sandstones in the Norwegian Sea.
   Potential sources of coarse elastic sediment lie both to the east, in
   mid-Norway, and the west, in East Greenland. Three main sand types (MN1,
   MN2 and MN3) have been identified, each of which has a unique
   combination of heavy mineral ratios (rutile/zircon, monazite/zircon,
   chrome spinel/zircon and apatite/tourmaline) and mineral chemistry
   (garnet and tourmaline). Sand type MN1 has a simple zircon age spectrum,
   with a large Early-Middle Proterozoic group and a small Early Paleozoic
   group, indicating derivation from northern mid-Norway. Sand type MN2 has
   a complex age structure including Archaean and early Proterozoic
   zircons. It can be divided into two subtypes, MN2a and MN2b, and can be
   ascribed to a source in East Greenland. Sand type MN3 has a simple age
   structure dominated by Middle Proterozoic zircons, and it was sourced
   from southern mid-Norway. Since reservoir presence is a major area of
   uncertainty in the deep water Norwegian Sea, the use of heavy mineral,
   mineral chemical and zircon age data to discriminate sandstones of
   eastern and western origin is crucial to hydrocarbon exploration of the
   area. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, the suitability of optical ASTER satellite data
   (with 9 spectral bands) for estimating the biomass of boreal forest
   stands in mineral soils was tested. The remote sensing data were
   analysed and tested together with standwise forest inventory data. Stand
   volume estimates were converted to aboveground tree biomass using
   biomass expansion factors, and the aboveground biomass of understory
   vegetation was predicted according to the stand age. Non-linear
   regression analysis and neural networks were applied to develop models
   for predicting biomass according to standwise ASTER reflectance. All
   ASTER bands appeared to be sensitive to tree biomass, in particular the
   green band 1. The relative estimation errors (RMSE,) of the total
   aboveground biomass of the forest stands were 44.7\% and 41.0\% using
   multiple regression analysis and neural networks, respectively. Although
   the estimation errors remained large, the predictions were relatively
   accurate in comparison to previous studies. Furthermore, the predictions
   obtained here were significantly close to the municipality-level mean

Abstract = {{Human monkeypox is a viral zoonotic disease that occurs mostly in the
   rain forests of central and western Africa. However, the disease
   recently emerged in the United States in imported wild rodents from
   Africa. Monkeypox has a clinical presentation very similar to that of
   ordinary forms of smallpox, including flulike symptoms, fever, malaise,
   back pain, headache, and characteristic rash. Given this clinical
   spectrum, differential diagnosis to rule out smallpox is very important.
   There are no licensed therapies for human monkeypox; however, the
   smallpox vaccine can protect against the disease. The discontinuation of
   general vaccination in the 1980s has given rise to increasing
   susceptibility to monkeypox virus infection in the human population.
   This has led to fears that monkeypox virus could be used as a
   bioterrorism agent. Effective prevention relies on limiting the contact
   with infected patients or animals and limiting the respiratory exposure
   to infected patients.}},

Abstract = {{Adenosine receptor ligands have anti-inflammatory effects and modulate
   immune responses by up-regulating IL-10 production by immunostimulated
   macrophages. The adenosine receptor family comprises G protein-coupled
   heptahelical transmembrane receptors classified into four types: A(1),
   A(2A), A(2B), and A(3). Our understanding of the signaling mechanisms
   leading to enhanced IL-10 production following adenosine receptor
   occupancy on macrophages is limited. In this study, we demonstrate that
   adenosine receptor occupancy increases IL-10 production by
   LPS-stimulated macrophages without affecting IL-10 promoter activity and
   IL-10 mRNA levels, indicating a posttranscriptional mechanism.
   Transfection experiments with reporter constructs containing sequences
   corresponding to the AU-rich Y-untranslated region (UTR) of IL-10 mRNA
   confirmed that adenosine receptor activation acts by relieving the
   translational repressive effect of the IL-10 3'-UTR. By contrast,
   adenosine receptor activation failed to liberate the translational
   arrest conferred by the 3'-UTR of TNF-alpha mRNA. The IL-10 3'-UTR
   formed specific complexes with proteins present in cytoplasmic extracts
   of RAW 264.7 cells. Adenosine enhanced binding of proteins to a region
   of the IL-10 3'-UTR containing the GUAUUUAUU nonamer. The stimulatory
   effect of adenosine on IL-10 production was mediated through the A(2B)
   receptor, because the order of potency of selective agonists was
   5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) >
   N-6-(3-iodobenzyl)-adenosine-5'-N-methyluronamide (IB-MECA) >
   2-chloro-N-6-cyclopentyladenosine (CCPA) =
   2-p-(2-carboxyethyl)-phenethylamino-5'-N-ethyl-carboxamidoadenosine
   (CGS-21680). Also, the selective A(2B) antagonist, alloxazine, prevented
   the effect of adenosine. Collectively, these studies identify a novel
   pathway in which activation of a G protein-coupled receptor augments
   translation of an anti-inflammatory gene.}},

Abstract = {{To the authors' knowledge, little is known regarding the participation
   of Asian Americans in cancer prevention research. In 2002, the authors
   mailed surveys to primary care physicians in Northern California to
   assess their knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, and barriers concerning
   the participation of Asian-American women in breast cancer
   chemoprevention research. The response rate was 52.3\% (n = 306
   physicians). For physician barriers, most respondents selected lack of
   study knowledge (73\%) and effort required to establish eligibility
   (75\%) and to explain risks and benefits (68\%). For patient barriers,
   most physicians chose the following: physicians did not inform patients
   about trials (76\%), limited English proficiency (78\%),
   researcher-participant language discordance (74\%), and complex
   protocols (69\%). Significantly more Asian-American physicians than
   non-Asian-American physicians (but a majority of each) selected as
   patient barriers a lack of culturally relevant information on breast
   cancer, a lack of knowledge about research concepts, and fear of
   experimentation. A majority of Asian-American physicians also selected
   the following patient barriers: lack of knowledge of preventive care or
   breast cancer, work concern, misperception that experimental treatment
   is inferior, personal modesty, and lack of personal benefit. In
   multivariate analyses, physicians who were in practice longer, who spent
   more time with patients, or who knew of tools to estimate breast cancer
   risk were more likely to discuss such trials with Asian-American women;
   whereas male physicians and those who believed that Asian-American
   women's deference to physicians was a barrier were less likely to have
   discussed such trials with Asian-American women. Efforts to increase
   research participation among Asian Americans should include physician
   education and linguistically appropriate recruitment efforts.}},

Title = {{Socio-economic inequity in demand for insecticide-treated nets, in-door
   residual house spraying, larviciding and fogging in Sudan}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: In order to optimally prioritize and use public and private
   budgets for equitable malaria vector control, there is a need to
   determine the level and determinants of consumer demand for different
   vector control tools.
   Objectives: To determine the demand from people of different
   socio-economic groups for indoor residual house-spraying (IRHS),
   insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), larviciding with chemicals (LWC), and
   space spraying/fogging (SS) and the disease control implications of the
   result.
   Methods: Ratings and levels of willingness-to-pay (WTP) for the vector
   control tools were determined using a random cross-sectional sample of
   720 householdes drawn from two states. WTP was elicited using the
   bidding game. An asset-based socio-economic status (SES) index was used
   to explore whether WTP was related to SES of the respondents.
   Results: IRHS received the highest proportion of highest preferred
   rating (41.0\%) followed by ITNs (23.1\%). However, ITNs had the highest
   mean WTP followed by IRHS, while LWC had the least. The regression
   analysis showed that SES was positively and statistically significantly
   related to WTP across the four vector control tools and that the
   respondents' rating of IRHS and ITNs significantly explained their
   levels of WTP for the two tools.
   Conclusion: People were willing to pay for all the vector-control tools,
   but the demand for the vector control tools was related to the SES of
   the respondents. Hence, it is vital that there are public policies and
   financing mechanisms to ensure equitable provision and utilisation of
   vector control tools, as well as protecting the poor from cost-sharing
   arrangements.}},

Abstract = {{The reactivity of human acetylcholinesterase (HuAChE) toward the
   chemical warfare agent VX \{O-ethyl S-{[}2(diisopropylamino)ethyl]
   methyl-phosphonothioatel\} and its stereoselectivity toward the
   P-s-enantiomer were investigated by examining the reactivity of HuAChE
   and its mutant derivatives toward purified enantiomers of VX and its
   noncharged isostere nc-VX {[}O-ethyl S-(3-isopropyl-4-methyl-pentyl)
   methylphosphonothioate]. Stereoselectivity of the wild-type HuAChE
   toward VXs is manifested by a 115-fold higher bimolecular rate constant
   (1.4 x 10(8) min(-1) m(-1)) as compared to that of VXR HuAChE was also
   12,500-fold more reactive toward VXS than toward nc-VXS, demonstrating
   the significance of the polar interactions of the ammonium substituent
   to their overall affinity toward VX. Indeed, substitution of the
   cation-binding subsite residue Trp86 by alanine resulted in a decrease
   of three orders of magnitude in HuAChE reactivity toward both VX
   enantiomers, with only a marginal effect on the reactivity toward the
   enantiomers of nc-VX. These results demonstrate that accommodation of
   the charged moieties of both VX enantiomers depends predominantly on
   interactions with the aromatic moiety of Trp86. Yet, these interactions
   seem to limit the stereoselectivity toward the Ps-enantiomer, which for
   charged methylphosphonates is much lower than for the noncharged
   analogs, like sarin or soman. Marked decrease in stereoselectivity
   toward VXs was observed following replacements of Phe295 at the acyl
   pocket (F295A and F295A/F297A). Replacement of the peripheral anionic
   site (PAS) residue Asp74 by asparagine (D74N) practically abolished
   stereoselectivity toward VXS (a 130-fold decrease), while substitution
   which retained the negative charge at position 74 (D74E) had no effect.
   The results from kinetic studies and molecular simulations suggest that
   the differential reactivity toward the VX enantiomers originates
   predominantly from a different orientation of the charged leaving group
   with respect to residue Asp74. Such different orientations of the
   charged leaving group in the HuAChE adducts of the VX enantiomers seem
   to be a consequence of intramolecular interactions with the bulky
   phosphorus alkoxy group. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{{[}1] One of the primary goals of the Center for Integrated Space
   Weather Modeling (CISM) effort is to assess and improve prediction of
   the solar wind conditions in near-Earth space, arising from both
   quasi-steady and transient structures. We compare 8 years of L1 in situ
   observations to predictions of the solar wind speed made by the
   Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) empirical model. The mean-square error (MSE)
   between the observed and model predictions is used to reach a number of
   useful conclusions: there is no systematic lag in the WSA predictions,
   the MSE is found to be highest at solar minimum and lowest during the
   rise to solar maximum, and the optimal lead time for 1 AU solar wind
   speed predictions is found to be 3 days. However, MSE is shown to
   frequently be an inadequate ``figure of merit'' for assessing solar wind
   speed predictions. A complementary, event-based analysis technique is
   developed in which high-speed enhancements (HSEs) are systematically
   selected and associated from observed and model time series. WSA model
   is validated using comparisons of the number of hit, missed, and false
   HSEs, along with the timing and speed magnitude errors between the
   forecasted and observed events. Morphological differences between the
   different HSE populations are investigated to aid interpretation of the
   results and improvements to the model. Finally, by defining discrete
   events in the time series, model predictions from above and below the
   ecliptic plane can be used to estimate an uncertainty in the predicted
   HSE arrival times.}},

Abstract = {{A combined fatty acid metabolism assay was employed to determine fatty
   acid uptake and relative utilisation in enterocytes isolated from the
   pyloric caeca of rainbow trout. In addition, the effect of a diet high
   in long-chain monoenoic fatty alcohols present as wax esters in oil
   derived from Calanus finmarchicus, compared to a standard fish oil diet,
   on caecal enterocyte fatty acid metabolism was investigated. The diets
   were fed for 8 weeks before caccal enterocytes from each dietary group
   were isolated and incubated with {[}1-C-14] fatty acids: 16:0, 18:1n-9,
   18:2n-6, 18:3n3, 20: 1 n-9, 20:4n-6, 20:5n-3, and 22:6n-3. Uptake was
   measured over 2 h with relative utilisation of different {[}1-C-14]fatty
   acids calculated as a percentage of uptake. Differences in uptake were
   observed, with 18:1n-9 and 18:2n-6 showing the highest rates.
   Esterification into cellular lipids was highest with 16:0 and C-18 fatty
   acids, accounting for over one-third of total uptake, through
   predominant incorporation in triacylglycerol (TAG). The overall
   utilisation of fatty acids in phospholipid synthesis was low, but
   highest with 16:0, the most prevalent fatty acid recovered in
   intracellular phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylinositol (PI),
   although exported PC exhibited higher proportions of C-20/C-22
   polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Other than 16:0, incorporation into
   PC and PI was highest with C-20/C-22 PUFA and 20:4n-6 respectively.
   Recovery of labelled 18:1n-9 in exported TAG was 3-fold greater than any
   other fatty acid which could be due to multiple esterification on the
   glycerol `backbone' and/or increased export. Approximately 20-40\% of
   fatty acids taken up were beta-oxidised, and was highest with 20:4n-6.
   Oxidation of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 was also surprisingly high, although
   22:6n-3 oxidation was mainly attributed to retroconversion to 20:5n-3.
   Metabolic modification of fatty acids by elongation-desaturation was
   generally low at < 10\% of {[}1-C-14] fatty acid uptake. Dietary copepod
   oil had generally little effect on fatty acid metabolism in enterocytes,
   although it stimulated the elongation and desaturation of 16:0 and
   elongation of 18:1n-9, with radioactivity recovered in longer n-9
   monoenes. The monoenoic fatty acid, 20:1n-9, abundant in copepod oil as

Abstract = {{Programmed cell death 4 (Pdcd4) is a tumor suppressor protein that
   interacts with eukaryotic initiation factor 4A and inhibits protein
   synthesis. Pdcd4 also suppresses the transactivation of activator
   protein-1 (AP-1)-responsive promoters by c-Jun. The Akt (protein kinase
   B) serine/threonine kinase is a key mediator of phosphoinositide
   3-kinase pathway involved in the regulation of cell proliferation,
   survival, and growth. Because Pdcd4 has two putative Akt phosphorylation
   sites at Ser(67) and Ser(457), We investigated whether Akt
   phosphorylates and regulates Pdcd4. Our results show that Akt
   specifically phosphorylates Ser(67) and Ser(457) residues of Pdcd4 in
   vitro and in vivo. We further show that phosphorylation of Pdcd4 by Akt
   causes nuclear translocation of Pdcd4. Using luciferase assay, we show
   that phosphorylation of Pdcd4 by Akt also causes a significant decrease
   of the ability of Pdcd4 to interfere With the transactivation of
   AP-1-responsive promoter by c-Jun.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the interfacial characteristics between pentacene and Au
   layers were investigated with varying of the deposition rate of Au layer
   from 1.0 to 15.0 angstrom/s. For the devices with the structure of
   bottorn-Au/pentacene/top-Au, it was observed that the electrical
   characteristics could be improved by increasing the deposition rate of
   top-Au, and the highest electrical conductivity value, 1.5 x 10(-6)
   S/cm, was obtained for the device with the top-Au-deposited at 15.0
   angstrom/s. AES results showed that the integrated atomic content of Au
   in top-Au layer is substantially increased with the deposition rate of
   top-Au, but there was no critical difference in the depth profile of An
   atoms regardless of the deposition rate of top-Au. And also, we
   fabricated pentacene-based Schottky diodes and measured the hole
   injection barrier heights from Au electrode into pentacene layer using
   Fowler-Nordheim theory. Upon the investigations, it was observed that
   the hole injection barrier was reduced with increasing the deposition
   rate of Au electrode and the lowest value of 0.12 eV was obtained for
   the device with the Au electrode deposited at 15.0 angstrom/s. As a
   result, the performance of top-contact OTFT could be improved with
   increasing the deposition rate of Au electrodes (source and drain). (C)

Abstract = {{Objective. To assess the characteristics of calcium pyrophosphate
   deposition disease (CPDD) with proximal involvement mimicking
   polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), and to identify the best predictive
   factors for the presence of a clinical pattern of CPDD in patients
   presenting with polymyalgia symptoms.
   Methods. Patients diagnosed with either PMR or CPDD at the Rheumatology
   Division of Hospital Meixoeiro (Vigo, Spain) over a 7-year period
   (1997-2003) were prospectively followed for at least 12 months.
   Results. The study group comprised 118 patients with PMR features and
   112 patients with CPDD. Eighty-two of the 118 patients with PMR
   manifestations were diagnosed as having pure PMR, and 36 met the
   diagnostic criteria for both PMR and CPDD. Patients with CPDD mimicking
   PMR were older (P = 0.02) and had peripheral arthritis more frequently
   (P = 0.004) than those with pure PMR. Radiologic osteoarthritic changes
   in the hands and knees,'including more advanced radiologic grade of knee
   osteoarthritis, and tendinous calcifications were more frequent in
   patients with PMR/CPDD (P < 0.001). The best predictive factors for the
   occurrence of this atypical pattern of CPDD in a patient presenting with
   PMR features were the age at diagnosis and the presence of tibiofemoral
   osteoarthritis, tendinous calcifications, and ankle arthritis.
   Conclusion. Involvement of proximal joints may be the clinical
   presentation of CPDD. CPDD should be included in the spectrum of
   diseases mimicking PMR. The presence of tibiofemoral osteoarthritis,
   tendinous calcifications, and ankle arthritis are clues that may alert
   the clinician to the presence of CPDD in an elderly patient presenting
   with PMR manifestations.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Huntington's disease (HD) is characterized by a progressive
   multisystem neuronal atrophy in the brain. Apart from motor signs,
   cognitive symptoms, particularly executive dysfunctions, are proposed to
   be recognizable in early stages of disease. The aim of the present study
   was to clarify if cognitive dysfunction in early stages of HD is
   correlated with loco-regional structural changes in 3D-MRI.
   Methods: Twenty-five patients with genetically confirmed HD in early
   clinical stages were included in the study and underwent
   neuropsychological testing, i.e., the executive tasks Tower of Hanoi
   (ToH), Stroop Colour Word Interference Test (STROOP), and modified
   Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (mWCST). High-resolution volume-rendering
   MRI scans (MP-RAGE) were acquired on a 1.5 T scanner in all patients and
   were analyzed by statistical parametric mapping and voxel-based
   morphometry (VBM) in comparison to an age-matched control group.
   Results: Group analysis of HD patients demonstrated robust regional
   decreases of gray matter volumes (p<0.05, corrected for multiple
   comparisons) in the caudate and the putamen bilaterally with a global
   maximum at Talairach coordinates 11/4/11 (Z-score = 7.06). Executive
   dysfunction was significantly correlated with the areas of highest
   significant differences out of VBM results which were located
   bilaterally ill the caudate (ToH: r = 0.647 p < 0.001; STROOP: r = 0.503
   p < 0.01 ; mWCST: r = 0.452, p < 0.05). Moreover, subgroup analyses
   revealed marked insular atrophy (Talairach coordinates 43/-3/1; Z-score
   5.64) in HID patients who performed worse in the single executive tasks.
   Conclusion: Two aspects were most remarkable in this Correlational
   Study: (i) striatal atrophy in HD patients in early stages plays all
   important role not only in impaired motor control but also in executive
   dysfunction, and (ii) extrastriatal cortical areas, i.e., the insular
   lobe, seem to be involved in executive dysfunction as assessed by
   neuropsychological tests requiring for planning and problem solving,
   stimulus response selectivity and concept formation. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Corticosteroid therapy has been associated with bone toxicities (eg,
   osteonecrosis) and Cushing syndrome in HIV-infected patients; this may
   be partially attributable to a pharmacokinetic drug interaction between
   HIV protease inhibitors and corticosteroids. The purpose of this study
   was to characterize the influence of low-dose ritonavir on prednisolone
   pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects. Ten HIV-seronegative volunteers
   were given single oral doses of prednisone, 20 mg, before (baseline) and
   after receiving ritonavir, 200 mg, twice daily for 4 and 14 days. After
   each prednisone close, serial blood samples were collected and
   prednisolone concentrations were determined; pharmacokinetic parameter
   values were compared between the groups. Geometric mean ratios (GMRs,
   90\% confidence interval {[}Cl]) of the prednisolone area under the
   plasma concentration versus time Curve (AUC(0-infinity)) after 4 and 14
   days of ritonavir versus baseline were 1.41 (90\% Cl: 1.08 to 1.74) and
   1.30 (90\% Cl: 1.09 to 1.49), respectively (P = 0.002 and P = 0.004,
   respectively). GMRs of prednisolone apparent oral clearance (Cl/F) were
   0.71 (09\% Cl: 0.57 to 0.93) and 0.77 (90\%, Cl: 0.67 to 0.92) after 4
   and 14 days of ritonavir versus baseline, respectively (P = 0.0004 and P
   = 0.0003, respectively). Ritonavir significantly increased the systemic
   exposure of prednisolone in healthy subjects. Results from this
   investigation suggest that corticosteroid exposure is likely elevated in
   HIV-infected patients receiving protease inhibitors.}},

Abstract = {{Systems governed by time reversible equations of motion often give rise
   to irreversible behaviour(1-3). The transition from reversible to
   irreversible behaviour is fundamental to statistical physics, but has
   not been observed experimentally in many-body systems. The flow of a
   newtonian fluid at low Reynolds number can be reversible: for example,
   if the fluid between concentric cylinders is sheared by boundary motion
   that is subsequently reversed, then all fluid elements return to their
   starting positions(4). Similarly, slowly sheared suspensions of solid
   particles, which occur widely in nature and science(5), are governed by
   time reversible equations of motion. Here we report an experiment
   showing precisely how time reversibility(6) fails for slowly sheared
   suspensions. We find that there is a concentration dependent threshold
   for the deformation or strain beyond which particles do not return to
   their starting configurations after one or more cycles. Instead, their
   displacements follow the statistics of an anisotropic random walk(7). By
   comparing the experimental results with numerical simulations, we
   demonstrate that the threshold strain is associated with a pronounced
   growth in the Lyapunov exponent ( a measure of the strength of chaotic
   particle interactions). The comparison illuminates the connections
   between chaos, reversibility and predictability.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To examine the associations between arthritis and insomnia
   symptoms and unrefreshing sleep, as well as the role of pain as a
   mediator of these relationships.
   Methods. Analyses were conducted on the cross-sectional, nationally
   representative, weighted sample of adults : :18 years of age (n =
   118,336) in the 2000/2001 Canadian Community Health Survey. Four
   logistic regression models were estimated for each sleep problem (model
   1: arthritis only; model 2: model 1 + sociodemographic characteristics,
   lifestyle factors, and other chronic conditions; model 3: model 2 +
   mental health {[}stress, depression]; and model 4: model 3 + pain).
   Mediation by pain was quantified by the percentage change in the effect
   of arthritis on a particular sleep problem by comparing models 3 and 4.
   Results. The prevalence of insomnia symptoms and unrefreshing sleep in
   persons with arthritis was 24.8\% and 11.9\%, respectively. These
   estimates are twice as high as those for persons without arthritis. In
   multivariate regression analyses, the addition of pain decreased the
   effect of arthritis by 53\% (insomnia symptoms) and 64\% (unrefreshing
   sleep). The effect of arthritis was still statistically significant in
   these models, suggesting that pain is a partial mediator of these
   relationships.
   Conclusion. Insomnia symptoms and unrefreshing sleep affect a
   considerable proportion of individuals with arthritis. Pain mediates a
   substantial amount of the relationship between arthritis and sleep
   problems. Better pain management could significantly improve sleep in
   individuals with arthritis.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Secondary-ion-mass spectrometry measurements were used to study Cu
   diffusion in porous silica. The total concentration of Cu+ decreases
   with increasing porosity of the dielectric. This behavior is the
   combined result of both the chemistry and the morphology of the
   dielectric. The injection of Cu is triggered by outgassing of hydroxyl
   and water-related species from the dielectric; furthermore, the reduced
   available cross-sectional area of solid for diffusion, due to porosity,
   leads to reduced diffusion through the porous film. This suggests that
   surface diffusion does not play an important role in this process. The
   Cu+ concentration at the Cu/dielectric interface is on the order of
   10(23) at./m(3), but decreases with time and exponentially with
   porosity, which suggests the occurrence of a chemical reaction at the
   interface. A model of molecular diffusion and ion drift that considers
   the porosity of the film is developed and the results are consistent
   with the experimental data. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic muscle pain is common and often difficult to treat. In this
   study, we further characterize a model of chronic muscle pain induced by
   repeated intramuscular injection of acidic saline. Two injections of
   acid into muscle separated by 5 days result in secondary mechanical
   hyperalgesia that lasts for up to 4 weeks. Blockade of spinal NMDA
   receptors prior to the second injection intramuscular acid injection
   delays the onset of hyperalgesia, where as the maintenance phase of
   hyperalgesia, evaluated 1 week after the second intramuscular injection,
   is dependent on activation of spinal AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptors. In
   order to determine if behavioral hyperalgesia and glutamate receptor
   involvement are associated with increased concentrations of excitatory
   amino acids (EAA), we utilized microdialysis to evaluate extracellular
   glutamate and aspartate concentrations in the spinal dorsal horn during
   the first and second intramuscular acid injections, and 1 week after the
   development of mechanical hyperalgesia. The second intramuscular
   injection evoked a calcium-dependent increase in both spinal glutamate
   and aspartate concentrations. Glutamate concentrations within the dorsal
   horn were also increased I week after the second acid injection. Our
   data suggest increased release of spinal EAAs in the dorsal horn
   contributes to the development and maintenance of hyperalgesia. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Dietary glucosinolates are under intensive investigation as precursors
   of cancer-preventive isothiocyanates. Quantitation of the dose and
   bioavailability of glucosinolates and isothiocyanates requires a
   comprehensive analysis of the major dietary glucosinolates,
   isothiocyanates, and related metabolites. We report a liquid
   chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS/MS)
   analytical method for the comprehensive analysis of the seven major
   dietary glucosinolates, related isothiocyanates, and putative amine
   degradation products. The parent glucosinolates were sinigrin,
   gluconapin, progoitrin, glucoiberin, glucoraphanin, glucoalyssin, and
   gluconasturtiin. The LC-MS/MS analysis method for these compounds was
   developed and validated; a standard addition analysis protocol was used
   generally to avoid the requirement for stable isotopic standards. Where
   stable isotopic standards were available, internal standardization with
   these gave estimates in agreement with those obtained by the standard
   addition analysis protocol. For glucosinolates, negative ion
   electrospray LC-MS/MS analysis was performed. Isothiocyanates and amines
   were prederivatized to the corresponding thiourea and N-acetamides,
   respectively, and were quantified by positive ion electrospray LC-MS/MS.
   The limits of detection were 0.5-2pmol; the recoveries for
   glucosinolates, isothiocyanates, and amines were 85-90\%, 50-85\%, and
   60-70\%, respectively;, and the intra- and interbatch coefficients of

Abstract = {{Rationale: Exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
   commonly causes hospitalization. The change in lung mechanics during
   exacerbation and its relationship to symptoms in spontaneously breathing
   individuals has not been described.
   Objective: We hypothesized that changes in both airflow and lung volumes
   would occur during an exacerbation, but that only volume change would
   relate to symptomatic improvement.
   Methods: Lung mechanics and resting dyspnea were recorded in 22
   hospitalized patients during recovery from exacerbation.
   Measurements: Spirometry, inspiratory capacity, respiratory system
   resistance and reactance, tidal breathing patterns, and expiratory flow
   limitation were recorded after nebulized bronchodilator therapy on the
   first 3 d after admission, at discharge, and 6 wk postadmission (Day
   42). Prebronchodilator measurements were taken on Day 2, at discharge,
   and on Day 42.
   Main Results: Postbronchodilator inspiratory capacity increased 0.23 +/-
   0.07 L by discharge and 0.42 +/- 0.1 L by Day 42, FEV1, rose 0.09 +/-
   0.04 and 0.2 +/- 0.05 L at discharge and Day 42, respectively, and FVC
   increased 0.21 +/- 0.08 and 0.47 +/- 0.09 L at discharge and Day 42 (all
   p < 0.05). Consistent reduction in dyspnea was seen as the exacerbation
   resolved. Respiratory system resistance, FEV1/FVC, and expiratory flow
   limitation were unchanged throughout, indicating that changes in lung
   volume rather than airflow resistance predominated.
   Conclusions: Improvement in operating lung volumes is the principal
   change seen as a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation
   resolves and increase in inspiratory capacity is a useful guide to a
   reduction in dyspnea.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: Analysis and simulation of pathway data is of high
   importance in bioinformatics. Standards for representation of
   information about pathways are necessary for integration and analysis of
   data from various sources. Recently, a number of representation formats
   for pathway data, SBML, PSI MI and BioPAX, have been proposed.
   Results: In this paper we compare these formats and evaluate them with
   respect to their underlying models, information content and
   possibilities for easy creation of tools. The evaluation shows that the
   main structure of the formats is similar. However, SBML is tuned towards
   simulation models of molecular pathways while PSI MI is more suitable
   for representing details about particular interactions and experiments.
   BioPAX is the most general and expressive of the formats. These
   differences are apparent in allowed information and the structure for
   representation of interactions. We discuss the impact of these
   differences both with respect to information content in existing
   databases and computational properties for import and analysis of data.}},

Abstract = {{The interactions between an oxyphenylethylene-oxyethylene nonionic
   diblock copolymer with the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate
   (SDS) have been studied in dilute aqueous solutions by static and
   dynamic light scattering (SLS and DLS, respectively), isothermal
   titration calorimetry (ITC), and C-13 and self-diffusion nuclear
   magnetic resonance techniques. The studied copolymer, S20E67, where S
   denotes the hydrophobic styrene oxide unit and E the hydrophilic
   oxyethylene unit, forms micelles of 15.6 nm at 25 degrees C, whose core
   is formed by the styrene oxide chains surrounded by a water swollen
   polyoxyethylene corona. The S20E67/SDS system has been investigated at a
   copolymer concentration of 2.5 g dm(-3), for which the copolymer is
   fully micellized, and with varying surfactant concentration up to
   approximately 0.15 M. When SDS is added to the solution, two different
   types of complexes are observed at various surfactant concentrations.
   From SLS and DLS it can be seen that, at low SDS concentrations, a
   copolymer-rich surfactant mixed micelle or complex is formed after
   association of SDS molecules to block copolymer micelles. These
   interactions give rise to a strong decrease in both light scattering
   intensity and hydrodynamic radius of the mixed micelles, which has been
   ascribed to an effective reduction of the complex size, and also an
   effect arising from the increasing electrostatic repulsion of charged
   surfactant-copolymer micelles. At higher surfactant concentrations, the
   copolymer-rich surfactant micelles progressively are destroyed to give
   surfactant-rich-copolymer micelles, which would be formed by a
   surfactant micelle bound to one or very few copolymer unimers. ITC data
   seem to confirm the results of light scattering, showing the dehydration
   and rehydration processes accompanying the formation and subsequent
   destruction of the copolymer-rich surfactant mixed micelles. The extent
   of interaction between the copolymer and the surfactant is seen to
   involve as much as carbon 3 (0) of the SDS molecule. Self-diffusion
   coefficients corroborated light scattering data.}},

Abstract = {{The metalloprotease ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with
   thrombospondin motif) converts the hyperreactive unusually large (UL)
   forms of von Willebrand factor (VWF) that are newly released from
   endothelial cells into less active plasma forms by cleaving a peptide
   bond in the VWF A2 domain. Familial or acquired deficiency of this
   metalloprotease is associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
   (TTP). ADAMTS13 belongs to the ADAMTS metalloprotease family, but,
   unlike other members, it also contains 2 C-terminal CUB domains
   (complement component Clr/Cls, Uegf, and bone morphogenic protein 1).
   Mutations in the CUB region have been found in congenital TTP, but
   deletion of the region did not impair enzyme activity in conventional in
   vitro assays. We investigated the functions of the CUB domain in
   ADAMTS13 activity under flow conditions. We found that recombinant CUB-1
   and CUB-1 +2 polypeptides and synthetic peptides derived from CUB-1
   partially blocked the cleavage of ULVWF by ADAMTS13 on the surface of
   endothelial cells under flow. The polypeptide bound immobilized and
   soluble forms of ULVWF, and blocked the adhesion of ADAMTS13-coated
   beads to immobilized ULVWF under flow. These results suggest that the
   CUB-1 domain may serve as the docking site for ADAMTS13 to bind ULVWF
   under flow, a critical step to initiate ULVWF proteolysis.}},

Abstract = {{In the period 1998-2002 thermal spring discharges of Rincon de la Vieja
   volcano (NW Costa Rica) have been sampled and analyzed for major, trace
   and isotopic (O-18/O-16 and D/H in waters and He-3/He-4 and C-11/C-12 in
   CO2 in gases) composition. The boiling pools hosted inside the summit
   crater (Active Crater) are characterized by high contents of
   magmatic-related compounds (SO2, HCl and HF) that strongly affect the
   chemistry of the crater lake. These chemical features are not shown by
   the thermal discharges seeping out in the surrounding area of the
   volcano. Here, the shallow aquifer apparently masks any possible clues
   related to the magmatic system. This suggests that the fluid vents
   located inside the Active Crater are likely to represent the most
   appropriate sampling sites for geochemical surveillance purposes,
   although the high gas discharge rate from the lake may occasionally
   prevent any fluid sampling. Alternatively, as already suggested by
   recent studies on the behavior of light hydrocarbons in different
   volcanic environments, the compositional features of the organic gas
   fraction in the more accessible outer flank thermal discharges could
   usefully be utilized, at least, to assess the thermodynamic conditions
   of the volcanic-hydrothermal system, since these compounds are affected
   by secondary processes only at limited extent. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All

   potential-energy surfaces and couplings, but with the nonadiabatic
   dynamics modeled using a semiclassical surface hopping (SH) method. We
   concentrate on the dynamical effects that determine the
   photoisomerization quantum yields, namely, the rate of radiationless
   electronic relaxation and the character of motion along the reaction
   coordinate. The quantal and semiclassical results are in good general
   agreement, confirming our previous analysis of the photodynamics. The SH
   method slightly overestimates the rate of excited state decay, leading
   in this case to lower quantum yields. (c) 2005 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Eukaryotic phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITPs) are composed
   predominantly of small (similar to 32 kDa) soluble proteins that bind
   and transfer a single phospholipid, normally phosphatidylinositol or
   phosphatidycholine. Two forms, PITP alpha and PITP beta, which share
   approximately 80\% amino acid sequence similarity, are known. Rat PITP
   alpha was labeled at specific single reactive Cys residues with I-AEDANS
   and used to examine PITP-membrane interactions. Upon binding to
   phospholipid vesicles, PITP labeled with AEDANS at the C-terminus, a
   region postulated to be involved in membrane binding, shows significant
   decreases in both steady-state and dynamic fluorescence anisotropy. In
   contrast, PITPs labeled with AEDANS at sites located distal to the
   C-terminus show increases in both steady-state and dynamic anisotropy.
   These results suggest that interaction of PITP with membrane surfaces
   leads to significant alterations in conformation and perhaps melting of
   the C-terminal helix. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Actin protofilaments in the erythrocyte membrane skeleton are uniformly

   N-terminal heptad repeat residues ``a{''} (I-7, I-14), ``d{''} (V-10)

   at L-116, E-117 and/or E-118 by identifying among 35 deletion clones and
   a series of point mutations that no longer bind to human TM5 and rat
   TM5b. Upstream residues 71-104 contain an actin binding site. The

Abstract = {{Electrical conductivity in a novel nonconjugated conductive polymer,
   poly(l-pinene), has been measured as a function of molar concentration
   of iodine. The conductivity increases about 10 orders of magnitude to a
   maximum value similar to 8 x 10(-3) S/cm. The molar concentration of
   iodine, corresponding to saturation, is similar to 0.85. The optical
   absorption measurements after light doping have shown two peaks: one at
   4.0 eV and the other at 3.1 eV The first peak is due to the radical
   cation, and the second due to the charge-transfer between the double
   bond and the dopant. As observed in other nonconjugated conductive
   polymers, the second peak becomes broader and undergoes a red shift,
   upon higher doping. The FTIR spectroscopic studies have shown that the
   C=C stretching vibration at 1610 cm(-1) and the =C-H bending vibration
   band at 728 cm-1 decrease upon doping, because of decrease of double
   bonds. Photoluminescence studies of poly(beta-pinene) show a maximum
   value at 360 nm for excitation at 280 nm. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{Rationale: Exposure to second-hand smoke (SHS) has been associated with
   increased risk of respiratory illness in children including respiratory
   illness-related school absences. The role of genetic susceptibility in
   risk for adverse effects from SHS has not been extensively investigated
   in children.
   Objective: To determine whether the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) G-308A
   genotype influences the risk for respiratory illness-related school
   absences associated with SHS exposure.
   Methods: Incident school absences were collected, using an active
   surveillance system, between January and June 1996, as part of the Air
   Pollution and Absence Study, a prospective cohort study nested in the
   Children's Health Study. Buccal cells and absence reports were collected
   on 1,351 students from 27 elementary schools in California.
   Measurements and Main Results: Illness-related school absences were
   classified as nonrespiratory and respiratory illness-related, which were
   further categorized into upper or lower respiratory illness-related
   absences based on symptoms. The effect of SHS exposure on respiratory
   illness-related absences differed by TNF genotype (p interaction, 0.02).
   In children possessing at least one copy of the TNF-308 A variant,
   exposure to two or more household smokers was associated with a twofold
   risk of a school absence due to respiratory illness (relative risk,
   2.13; 95\% confidence interval, 1.34, 3.40) and a fourfold risk of lower
   respiratory illness-related school absence (relative risk, 4.15; 95\%
   confidence interval, 2.57, 6.71) compared with unexposed children
   homozygous for the common TNF-308 G allele.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that a subgroup of genetically
   susceptible children are at substantially greater risk of respiratory
   illness if exposed to SHS.}},

Abstract = {{To look for high energy density materials (HEDM), the relationships
   between the structures and the performances of polynitroadamantanes
   (PNAs) were studied. The assigned infrared spectra of PNAs obtained at
   the density functional theory (DFT) B3LYP/6-31G{*} level were used to
   compute the thermodynamic properties on the basis of the principle of
   statistical thermodynamics. The thermodynamic properties are linearly
   related with the number of nitro groups as well as with the
   temperatures. Detonation properties of PNAs were evaluated by using the
   Kamlet-Jacobs equation based on the calculated densities and heats of
   formation for titled compounds, and it is found that only when the
   number of nitro groups of PNA is equal to or more than eight can it be
   possible for PNAs to be used as HEDMs. The relative stabilities of PNAs
   were studied by the pyrolysis mechanism using the UHF-PM3 method. The
   homolysis of the C-NO2 bond is predicted to be the initial step of
   thermal decomposition. The activation energies (E-a) for the homolysis
   decrease with the number of nitro groups being increased on the whole.
   The stability order of dinitroadamantane isomers derived from the
   interactions among nitro groups is consistent with what is determined by
   E-a. The relations between the E-a's and the electronic structure
   parameters were discussed. In combination with the stability, PNA
   (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10-) is recommended as the target of HEDM with
   insensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{By using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method a model for
   organic molecule-based ferromagnetic chain is proposed. It is found that
   the ground states of undoped and doped systems both exhibit
   ferrimagnetic ordering. The e-e repulsion plays an important role in the
   stability of the ferromagnetic state either in doped system or undoped
   system. For the undoped system, each unit cell contains half of the
   total spins, which is consistent with Lieb's theorem. It is convinced
   that when the system is doped with one electron, a charge density wave
   is excited, which decreases the amplitude of spin density wave,
   therefore acting against the stability of ferromagnetic state.}},

Abstract = {{Two types of membrane reactors, the packed-bed membrane reactor (PBMR)

   condensation reaction between benzaldehyde and ethyl cyanoacetate to
   produce ethyl 2-cyano-3-phenylacrylate. Supra-equilibrium conversion and
   high product purity were obtained from selective removal of water during
   the reaction. A simple computation model was developed to simulate the
   reaction in the multichannel membrane microreactor using kinetic data
   from batch reaction, correlated data from membrane separation and
   published transport data. The influence of reactor geometry (i.e.
   channel width and membrane location), membrane separation and catalyst
   properties were evaluated and the results compared well with

   several ways of improving the reactor performance. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Purpose: Little information is available on the heterogeneity of the
   vascular endothelium in hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of this study
   was to identify the differentially expressed genes in tumor endothelial
   cells from highly metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.
   Experimental Design: Magnetic beads conjugated with anti-CD31 antibody
   were used to isolate vascular endothelial cells from hepatocellular
   carcinoma xenografts with different metastatic potentials in nude mice.
   Gene expression profiles for different endothelial cells were compared
   by use of cDNA microarray. The up-regulated gene was confirmed by
   reverse transcription- PCR, real-time PCR, and immunchistochemistry.
   Results: cDNA microarray analysis revealed differential expression
   patterns in seven genes consistently presented in endothelial cells
   isolated from hepatocellular carcinoma with different metastatic
   potentials. Overexpression of platelet- derived growth factor receptor a
   was found only in the endothelium of highly metastatic hepatocellular
   carcinoma, which was confirmed by reverse transcription- PCR, real-time
   PCR, and immunohistochemistry. Oral administration of ST1571 (imatinib
   mesylate or Glivec), a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor of
   platelet-derived growth factor receptor, combined with s.c. injection of
   IFN-alpha not only effectively reduced tumor weight (by 81.8\%) and
   microvessel density (by 70.2\%) but also inhibited lung metastasis (by
   100\%). Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis of platelet-derived
   growth factor receptor a in human hepatocellular carcinoma tissues
   revealed its correlation with postoperative recurrence, especially in
   patients without microvessel invasion.
   Conclusions: The gene expression of hepatocellular carcinoma vascular
   endothelium is different between tumors with different metastatic
   potential. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha, which is
   overexpressed in endothelium of highly metastatic hepatocellular
   carcinoma, may serve as a biomarker for predicting metastasis and a
   therapeutic target for highly metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.}},

Abstract = {{Two types of ZnO single-sided nanocombs, namely the straight comb and

   is a {[}0 (1) over bar(1) over bar0] oriented nanobelt, with combteeth

   stress. The crescent comb is interesting as it is not only a
   hierarchical assembly of one-dimensional nanostructures, but also folded
   into a secondary structure as well. The structures of our nanocombs are
   controlled by supersaturation. Taking advantage of our low-temperature
   synthesis, we studied the growth process by freezing the growth stages.

   in AlSi7Mg0.6 alloy during directional solidification is investigated
   experimentally. For that purpose a Bridgman-type gradient furnace is
   equipped with a rotating magnetic field to induce flow in the melt. As a
   result the forced melt flow substantially changes the dendritic
   solidification microstructure. Increasing intensity of the melt flow
   leads to axial macrosegregation and enrichment of silicon in the centre
   part of a sample. Here, this yields to a transition to mixed
   columnar-equiaxed or even to equiaxed growth, whereas in the
   out-of-centre region columnar dendritic growth persists. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Electron transfer from reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)
   to the hydroxylase component (MMOH) of soluble methane monooxygenase
   (sMMO) primes its non-heme diiron centers for reaction with dioxygen to
   generate high-valent iron intermediates that convert methane to
   methanol. This intermolecular electron-transfer step is facilitated by a
   reductase (MMOR), which contains {[}2Fe-2S] and flavin adenine
   dinucleotide (FAD) prosthetic groups. To investigate interprotein
   electron transfer, chemically reduced MMOR was mixed rapidly with
   oxidized MMOH in a stopped-flow apparatus, and optical changes
   associated with reductase oxidation were recorded. The reaction proceeds
   via four discrete kinetic phases corresponding to the transfer of four
   electrons into the two dinuclear iron sites of MMOH. Pre-equilibrating
   the hydroxylase with sMMO auxiliary proteins MMOB or MMOD severely
   diminishes electron-transfer throughput from MMOR, primarily by shifting
   the bulk of electron transfer to the slowest pathway. The biphasic
   reactions for electron transfer to MMOH from several MMOR ferredoxin
   analogues are also inhibited by MMOB and MMOD. These results, in
   conjunction with the previous finding that MMOB enhances
   electron-transfer rates from MMOR to MMOH when preformed MMOR-MMOH-MMOB
   complexes are allowed to react with NADH {[}Gassner, G. T.; Lippard, S.
   J. Biochemistry 1999, 38, 12768-12785], suggest that isomerization of
   the initial ternary complex is required for maximal electron-transfer
   rates. To account for the slow electron transfer observed for the
   ternary precomplex in this work, a model is proposed in which
   conformational changes imparted to the hydroxylase by MMOR are retained
   throughout the catalytic cycle. Several electron-transfer schemes are
   discussed with emphasis on those that invoke multiple interconverting
   MMOH populations.}},

   metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT)-M-1 transition from the
   metal-based delta HOMO to the pi(star) O2C-Ar LUMO. The Mo-2(O2C-Ar)(4)
   complexes exhibit weak short-lived emission (<10 ns) and a nonemissive,
   long-lived (40-76 mu s) excited state detected by transient absorption
   spectroscopy. The short- and long-lived species are attributed to the
   (MLCT)-M-1 and (MLCT)-M-3 excited states, respectively, based on the
   large Stokes shift, vibronic progression in the low-temperature emission
   spectrum, and solvent dependence. Comparisons are made to the
   W-2(O2C-Ar)4 complexes, which are easier to oxidize and exhibit greater
   spin-orbit coupling than the Mo-2 systems. From the excited-state energy
   of the emissive (MLCT)-M-1 state and the electrochemical properties of
   the complexes, it is predicted that this excited state should be a
   powerful reducing agent. The crystal and molecular structure of
   Mo-2(O2C-9-an)(4) is also reported together with electronic structure
   calculations employing density functional theory. To our knowledge, this
   is the first observation of MLCT excited states in quadruply bonded
   complexes. In addition, the photophysical properties of the present
   systems parallel those of organic aromatic molecules and may be viewed
   as metal-mediated organics. The introduction of the M-2 delta(star)
   orbital in the complexes in conjugation with the organic pi-system of
   the ligands affords the opportunity to tune the excited-state energies
   and redox potentials.}},

Abstract = {{The current paper illustrates a method to operationally apply the model
   FOREST-BGC for the estimation of forest carbon fluxes in Mediterranean
   environments. The work was carried out in a pine forest stand within the
   coastal area of San Rossore (Central Italy) using both conventionally
   collected and remotely sensed data. The calibration of the model was
   performed using estimates of net primary productivity (NPP) derived from
   the carbon accumulated in the forest stems during the last four decades.
   Such estimates were obtained by transforming dendrochronological
   measurements collected in the stand into annual increments of woody
   biomass and carbon matter. Next, the model performance was validated
   against values of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and gross primary
   productivity (GPP) collected during four years (1999-2002) by an eddy
   covariance flux tower. A method based on deriving fraction of
   photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) from remotely sensed
   normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) data was also calibrated
   and validated in order to more directly assess forest GPR The results
   achieved indicate that the multi-year calibration against past carbon
   accumulation was essential in properly configuring the model in terms of
   respiration and allocation functions. Due to the importance of these
   functions, only the calibrated model was in fact able to correctly
   simulate the forest carbon fluxes, giving monthly estimates of both NEE
   and GPP quite close to those measured by the flux tower. These estimates
   were further improved by the proper integration of remotely sensed GPP
   evaluation and model carbon partitioning, which could be particularly
   useful for operational monitoring applications on a regional scale. (c)

Title = {{Distribution of carbon isotopes in the glacial ocean: A model study}},
Journal = {{PALEOCEANOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{A series of simulations are conducted with a global climate model of
   intermediate complexity (MoBidiC). This model includes ocean circulation
   dynamics, including the carbon cycle, coupled to a zonally averaged
   atmosphere. Oceanic distributions of nutrients, apparent oxygen
   utilization, radiocarbon, and carbon 13 are discussed for the
   preindustrial era (validation) as well as three states of the glacial
   ocean, termed interstadial (very active formation of deep water in the
   North Atlantic Ocean), stadial (moderate convection and important flow
   of Antarctic Deep Water in the Atlantic), and Heinrich (no formation of
   North Atlantic Deep Water). The stadial and interstadial states are
   stable. The Heinrich state is forced by a continuous freshwater
   discharge into the North Atlantic. The model exhibits significant
   changes in the isotopic composition of the ocean between the three
   modeled glacial states. Results for delta C-13 tend to be in qualitative
   agreement with paleoceanographic data, except that the model fails at
   representing the strong depletion in delta C-13 in the Southern Ocean.
   The Heinrich Atlantic Ocean is older than the stadial ocean at all
   depths (up to 1500 years). The ``interstadial{''} ocean has younger deep
   water and older intermediate water than the ``stadial.{''} It is
   recognized that the simulated changes in intermediate water age are less
   reliable because of the structure of the model. Color tracers are used
   to show that changes in the isotopic composition of Atlantic bottom
   water are mainly related to a redistribution of water masses. A simple
   method is tested, by which it is possible to reconstruct the North
   Atlantic water flow from the zonal profiles of salinity and D 14 C.
   Finally, dividing artificially the gas exchange rate in the Southern
   Ocean by four results in a 0.4\% decrease in the delta C-13 of Antarctic
   Bottom Water. Changes in new production are, comparatively, less
   effective at altering the delta 13C ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG) is an important DNA repair enzyme that
   recognizes and excises uracil bases in DNA using an extrahelical
   recognition mechanism. It is emerging as a desirable target for
   small-molecule inhibitors given its key role in a wide range of
   biological processes including the generation of antibody diversity, DNA
   replication in a number of viruses, and the formation of DNA strand
   breaks during anticancer drug therapy. To accelerate the discovery of
   inhibitors of UNG we have developed a uracil-directed ligand tethering
   strategy. In this efficient approach, a uracil aldehyde ligand is
   tethered via alkyloxyamine linker chemistry to a diverse array of
   aldehyde binding elements. Thus, the mechanism of extrahelical
   recognition of the uracil ligand is exploited to target the UNG active
   site, and alkyloxyamine linker tethering is used to randomly explore
   peripheral binding pockets. Since no compound purification is required,
   this approach rapidly identified the first small-molecule inhibitors of
   human UNG with micromolar to submicromolar binding affinities. In a
   surprising result, these uracil-based ligands are found not only to bind
   to the active site but also to bind to a second uncompetitive site. The
   weaker uncompetitive site suggests the existence of a transient binding
   site for uracil during the multistep extrahelical recognition mechanism.
   This very general inhibitor design strategy can be easily adapted to
   target other enzymes that recognize nucleobases, including other DNA
   repair enzymes that recognize other types of extrahelical DNA bases.}},

Abstract = {{We study the influence of two resonant laser beams (to be referred to as
   the control and probe beams) on the centre-of-mass motion of ultra-cold
   atoms characterized by three energy levels of the A-type. The laser
   beams being in the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)
   configuration drive the atoms to their dark states. We impose the
   adiabatic approximation and obtain an effective equation of motion for
   the dark state atoms. The equation contains a vector potential type
   interaction as well as an effective trapping potential. We concentrate
   on the situation where the control and probe beams are co-propagating
   and have orbital angular momenta (OAM). The effective magnetic field is
   then oriented along the propagation direction of the control and probe
   beams. Its spatial profile can be shaped by choosing proper laser beams.
   We analyse several situations where the effective magnetic field
   exhibits a radial dependence. In particular, we study effective magnetic
   fields induced by Bessel beams, and demonstrate how to generate a
   constant effective magnetic field for a ring geometry of the atomic
   trap. We also discuss a possibility of creating an effective field of a
   magnetic monopole.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, to elucidate the effect of altered P2X receptor
   transmission on GABA(A) receptor expression and its transmission, we
   studied the morphological and electrophysiological responses of GABA(A)
   receptor in the gerbil hippocampus following P2X receptor
   antagonist/agonist treatment. Suramin or pyridoxal
   phosphate-6-azophenyl-2,4-disulfonic acid (PPADS) treatment did not
   affect GABA(A) receptor immunoreactivities and paired-pulse responses in
   the gerbil hippocampus. In addition, ATP treatment did not significantly
   affect population spike amplitude ratios and EPSP slope ratios in the
   gerbil dentate gyrus. Co-application. but not pretreatment, of PPADS or
   suramin enhanced the effect of muscimol on paired-pulse inhibition in
   the dentate gyrus. In contrast, co-application of ATP reduced the effect
   of muscimol in the dentate gyrus. These findings indicate that the
   blockade of P2X receptor did not affect GABA(A) receptor
   immunoreactivities, and P2X receptor may modulate GABA(A)
   receptor-mediated inhibition when in co-activation with GABA(A)
   receptor. Therefore, our findings suggest that the relationship between
   GABA(A) receptor and P,X receptor may not be reciprocal, although
   GABA(A) receptor activity affects P2X receptor functionality and its
   expression. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{AIM: To assess the usefulness of urinary trypsinogen-2 test strip,
   urinary trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP), and serum and urine
   concentrations of the activation peptide of carboxypeptidase B (CAPAP)
   in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.
   METHODS: Patients with acute abdominal pain and hospitalized within 24 h
   after the onset of symptoms were prospectively studied. Urinary
   trypsinogen-2 was considered positive when a clear blue line was
   observed (detection limit 50 mu g/L). Urinary TAP was measured using a
   quantitative solid-phase ELISA, and serum and urinary CAPAP by a
   radioimmunoassay method.
   RESULTS: Acute abdominal pain was due to acute pancreatitis in 50
   patients and turned out to be extrapancreatic in origin in 22 patients.
   Patients with acute pancreatitis showed significantly higher median
   levels of serum and urinary CAPAP levels, as well as amylase and lipase
   than extrapancreatic controls. Median TAP levels were similar in both
   groups. The urinary trypsinogen-2 test strip was positive in 68\% of
   patients with acute pancreatitis and 13.6\% in extrapancreatic controls
   (P < 0.01). Urinary CAPAP was the most reliable test for the diagnosis
   of acute pancreatitis (sensitivity 66.7\%, specificity 95.5\%, positive
   and negative predictive values 96.6\% and 56.7\%, respectively), with a
   14.6 positive likelihood ratio for a cut-off value of 2.32 nmol/L.
   CONCLUSION: In patients with acute abdominal pain, hospitalized within
   24 h of symptom onset, CAPAP in serum and urine was a reliable
   diagnostic marker of acute pancreatitis. Urinary trypsinogen-2 test
   strip showed a clinical value similar to amylase and lipase. Urinary TAP
   was not a useful screening test for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.

Abstract = {{Caspase-1 plays a role in the pathogenesis of a variety of neurological
   diseases. Caspase-1 activation is an early event in models of
   Huntington's disease (HD). However, mechanisms regulating the activation
   of this apical caspase in cell death are not known. Receptor interacting
   protein-2 (Rip2) and caspase recruitment domain (CARD) only protein
   (Cop) are two CARD proteins with significant homology to the caspase-1
   CARD and modulate caspase-1 activation in inflammation. Rip2 is a
   caspase-1 activator, and Cop is a caspase-1 inhibitor. We demonstrate in
   models of HD that caspase-1 activation results from dysregulation of
   caspase-1 activation pathways. Associated with disease progression, we
   detect elevation of the caspase-1 activator Rip2 and reduction of the
   caspase-1 inhibitor Cop. Knocking down endogenous Rip2/Cop respectively
   results in reduced/increased sensitivity to neurotoxic stimuli. Our data
   provide evidence that caspase-1-mediated cell death is regulated, at
   least in part, by the balance of Rip2 and Cop, and alterations of this
   balance may contribute to aberrant caspase-1-mediated pathogenesis in
   Huntington's disease.}},

   kinetics and thermodynamics measured by both the imaging system and
   traditional SPR. Instrument response and sensitivity is further
   demonstrated by successful measurement of association and dissociation
   kinetics of actinomycin-D binding to a low-density doubled-stranded DNA
   binding sequence. Without independent calibration, analysis of
   angle-resolved SPR imaging data yields 2.9 +/- 0.1 drugs per duplex at

Title = {{p21(WAF1) Expression induced by MEK/ERK pathway activation or inhibition
   correlates with growth arrest, myogenic differentiation and
   onco-phenotype reversal in rhabdomyosarcoma cells}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR CANCER}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: p21(WAF1), implicated in the cell cycle control of both
   normal and malignant cells, can be induced by p53-dependent and
   independent mechanisms. In some cells, MEKs/ERKs regulate p21(WAF1)
   transcriptionally, while in others they also affect the
   post-transcriptional processes. In myogenic differentiation, p21(WAF1)
   expression is also controlled by the myogenic transcription factor MyoD.
   We have previously demonstrated that the embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma cell
   line undergoes growth arrest and myogenic differentiation following
   treatments with TPA and the MEK inhibitor U0126, which respectively
   activate and inhibit the ERK pathway.
   In this paper we attempt to clarify the mechanism of ERK-mediated and
   ERK-independent growth arrest and myogenic differentiation of embryonal
   and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines, particularly as regards the
   expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21(WAF1).
   Results: p21(WAF1) expression and growth arrest are induced in both
   embryonal ( RD) and alveolar ( RH30) rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines
   following TPA or MEK/ERK inhibitor ( U0126) treatments, whereas myogenic
   differentiation is induced in RD cells alone. Furthermore, the
   TPA-mediated post-transcriptional mechanism of p21(WAF1)-enhanced
   expression in RD cells is due to activation of the MEK/ERK pathway, as
   shown by transfections with constitutively active MEK1 or MEK2, which
   induces p21(WAF1) expression, and with ERK1 and ERK2 siRNA, which
   prevents p21(WAF1) expression. By contrast, U0126-mediated p21(WAF1)
   expression is controlled transcriptionally by the p38 pathway.
   Similarly, myogenin and MyoD expression is induced both by U0126 and TPA
   and is prevented by p38 inhibition. Although MyoD and myogenin depletion
   by siRNA prevents U0126-mediated p21(WAF1) expression, the
   over-expression of these two transcription factors is insufficient to
   induce p21(WAF1). These data suggest that the transcriptional mechanism
   of p21(WAF1) expression in RD cells is rescued when MEK/ERK inhibition
   relieves the functions of myogenic transcription factors. Notably, the
   forced expression of p21(WAF1) in RD cells causes growth arrest and the
   reversion of anchorage- independent growth.
   Conclusion: Our data provide evidence of the key role played by the
   MEK/ERK pathway in the growth arrest of Rhabdomyosarcoma cells. The
   results of this study suggest that the targeting of MEK/ERKs to rescue
   p21(WAF1) expression and myogenic transcription factor functions leads
   to the reversal of the Rhabdomyosarcoma phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{We report the electrochemical study of cubic and monoclinic NiP2
   polymorphs toward Li, as a candidate for anodic applications for Li-ion
   batteries. We found that the monoclinic form is the most attractive one
   performance-wise. Monoclinic NiP2 can reversibly uptake 5 lithium per
   formula unit, leading to reversible capacities of 1000 mAh/g at an
   average potential of 0.9 V vs Li+/Li degrees. From complementary X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) and HRTEM (high-resolution transmission electron
   microscopy) measurements, it was shown that, during the first discharge,
   the cubic phase undergoes a pure conversion process (NiP2 + 6 Li+ +
   6e(-) -> Ni degrees + 2Li(3)P) as opposed to a sequential
   insertion-conversion process for monoclinic NiP2. Such a different
   behavior rooted in subtle structural changes was explained through
   electronic structure calculations. Once the first discharged is
   achieved, both phases were shown to react with Li through a classical
   conversion process. More importantly, we report a novel way to design
   NiP2 electrodes with enhanced capacity retention and rate capabilities.
   It consists in growing the monoclinic NiP2 phase, through a vapor-phase
   transport process, on a commercial Ni-foam commonly used in Ni-based
   alkaline batteries. These new self-supported electrodes, based on
   chemically made interfaces, offer new opportunities to fully exploit the
   capacity gains provided by conversion reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Peptidyl prolyl cis/trans-isomerases catalyze the cis-trans
   isomerization of prolyl bonds in oligopeptides and various folding
   states of proteins. The proline residue in PPIase substrates at the P1'
   subsite, which follows the isomerizing peptide bond, appears to be the
   common recognition element for all subfamilies of this enzyme class. The
   molecular principles that govern substrate specificity at the P1'
   subsite were analyzed using 4-fluoroproline-containing tetrapeptide
   4-nitroanilides and barstar Cys40Ala/Cys82Ala/Pro27Ala/Pro48 ->
   4-fluoroproline quadruple variants. Generally, PPIase catalysis
   demonstrated stereo specificity for monofluoro substitutions at the
   4-position of the pyrrolidine ring. However, the replacement of
   hydrogens with fluoro atoms did not impair productive interactions for
   the majority of PPIase-substrate complexes. Comparison of specificity
   constants for oligopeptide and protein substrates revealed striking
   differences in the 4-fluoroproline substituent effects between members
   of the PPIase families. Introduction of 4(R)-fluoroproline resulted in
   an olligopeptide substrate completely resistant to catalytic effects of
   FKBP-like PPIases. By contrast, the 4(R)-fluoroproline barstar variant
   demonstrated only slightly reduced or even better catalytic
   susceptibility when compared to the parent barstar Cys40Ala/
   Cys82AIa/Pro27AIa/Pro48 substrate. On the other hand,
   Sue-Ala-Ser-4(S)-FPro-Phe-pNA exhibits a discriminating specificity
   toward the prototypic parvulin, the Escherichia coli Par10. The E. coli
   trigger factor, in the extreme, catalyzes
   Cys40Ala/Cys82Ala/Pro27Ala/4-F(2)Pro48 with a more than 20-fold higher
   efficiency when compared to the proline-containing congener. These
   findings support the combined subsite concept for PPIase catalysis in
   which the positioning of a substrate in the active cleft must activate a
   still unknown number of remote subsites in the transition state of the
   reaction. The number of critical subsites was shown to vary between the
   PPIase families.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin types A, B, and E cause
   most cases of the paralytic disease botulism. Little is known about the
   epidemiology, clinical features, or microbiology of botulism type F.
   Methods: Cases of adult type F botulism were identified by review of
   data collected by CDC's National Botulism Surveillance System between
   1981 and 2002. A case was either an individual whose serum or stool
   demonstrated type F toxin or whose stool culture yielded an organism
   producing toxin type F. A detailed review of cases' medical charts and
   laboratory data from CDC and local health departments was performed.
   Results: Between 1981 and 2002, 1,269 cases of botulism among adults and
   infants were reported to CDC; 13 (1\%) were adult type F. The median age
   of type F cases was 54 years; 7 (54\%) were female. None were part of
   outbreaks. A toxigenic Clostridium baratii was identified in 9 (69\%) of
   13 cases. Among 11 cases for which clinical data were available, all
   required mechanical ventilation for a median duration of 17 days (
   range, 10 to 84); 8 (73\%) were intubated within 24 hours of symptom
   onset. All patients had nearly complete or complete quadriplegia at the
   nadir of neurologic dysfunction, which occurred on average on day 5. On
   average by day 8, improvement in neuromuscular function was noted. The
   median duration of acute hospitalization was 31 days ( range, 20 to 60).
   No deaths were reported. In only one case was a possible foodborne
   etiology identified. Conclusions: Toxigenic C baratii are the sole
   documented causes of type F botulism in the United States since 1981.
   These cases are characterized by a fulminant course with rapid
   progression to respiratory failure and paralysis, making early
   recognition and intervention critical to appropriate management.}},

Abstract = {{Bone and dentin biomineralization are well-regulated processes mediated
   by extracellular matrix proteins. it is widely believed that specific
   matrix proteins in these tissues modulate nucleation of apatite
   nanoparticles and their growth into micrometer-sized crystals via
   molecular recognition at the proteinmineral interface. However, this
   assumption has been supported only circumstantially, and the exact
   mechanism remains unknown. Dentin matrix protein I (DMPl) is an acidic
   matrix protein, present in the mineralized matrix of bone and dentin. In
   this study, we have demonstrated using synchrotron smallangle X-ray
   scattering that DMPI in solution can undergo oligornerization and
   temporarily stabilize the newly formed calcium phosphate nanoparticle
   precursors by sequestering them and preventing their further aggregation
   and precipitation. The solution structure represents the first
   low-resolution structural information for DMPl. Atomic force microscopy
   and transmission electron microscopy studies further confirmed that the
   nascent calcium phosphate nuclei formed in solution were assembled into
   ordered protein-mineral complexes with the aid of oligomerized DMP1,
   recombinant and native. This study reveals a novel mechanism by which
   DMP1 might facilitate initiation of mineral nucleation at specific sites
   during bone and dentin mineralization and prevent spontaneous calcium
   phosphate precipitation in areas in which mineralization is not
   desirable.}},

   frost-heave features at seven study sites along a N-S-transect from the
   Arctic Ocean to the Arctic Foothills, Alaska. We established 117 releves
   in frost-heave features and surrounding tundra and classified the
   vegetation according to the Braun-Blanquet sorted-table method. We used
   Detrended Correspondence Analysis to analyze relationships between
   vegetation and environmental variables. We identified nine communities:
   Braya purpurascens-Puccinellia angustata community (dry nonsorted
   circles, subzone C); Dryas integrifolia-Salix arctica community (dry
   tundra, subzone C); Salici rotundifoliae-Caricetum aquatilis ass. nov.
   (moist coastal tundra, subzone C); Junco biglumis-Dryadetum
   integrifoliae ass. nov. (moist nonsorted circles, subzone D); Dryado
   integrifoliae-Caricetum bigelowii Walker et al. 1994 (moist tundra,
   subzone D); Scorpidium scorpioides-Carex aquatilis community (wet
   tundra, subzone D); Cladino-Vaccinietum vitis-idaeae ass. nov. (dry

   vaginati Walker et al. 1994 (moist tundra, subzone E); and Anthelia
   juratzkana-Juncus biglumis community (wet nonsorted circles, subzone E).
   The DCA ordination displayed the vegetation types with respect to
   complex environmental gradients. The first axis of the ordination
   corresponds to a bioclimate/pH gradient, and the second axis corresponds
   to a disturbance/soil moisture gradient. Frost-heave features are
   dominated by lichens, whereas the adjacent tundra supports more dwarf
   shrubs, graminoids and mosses. Frost-heave features have greater thaw
   depths, more bare ground, thinner organic horizons and lower soil
   moisture than the surrounding tundra. The morphology of frost-heave
   features changes along the climatic gradient, with large, barren
   nonsorted circles dominating the northern sites and vegetated, less
   active earth hummocks dotting the southern sites. Thawing of permafrost
   and a possible shift in plant community composition due to global
   warming could lead to a decline in frost-heave features and result in
   the loss of landscape heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{A glycosylphosphaticlylinositol (GPI)-anchored hyaluronidase, PH20, on
   the sperm surface has long been believed to assist sperm penetration
   through the cumulus mass surrounding the eggs. However, mouse sperm
   lacking PH-20 were still capable of penetrating the cumulus mass despite
   a delayed dispersal of cumulus cells. Intriguingly, a 55-kDa
   hyaluronan-hydrolyzing protein was abundantly present in wild-type and
   PH-20-deficient mouse sperm. In this study, we purified the 55-kDa mouse
   protein from soluble protein extracts released from epididymal sperm by
   acrosome reaction and identified as a hyaluronidase, HyaI5. HyaI5 was
   exclusively expressed in the testis and formed a 160-kbp gene cluster
   together with HyaIp1, HyaI4, and Ph-20 on mouse chromosome 6. HyaI5 was
   a single-chain hyaluronidase present on the plasma and acrosomal
   membranes of sperm presumably as a GPI-anchored protein. Moreover,
   hyaluronan zymography revealed that HyaI5 is enzymatically active in the
   pH range 5-7 and inactive at pH 3 and 4. Both HyaI5-enriched PH-20-free
   soluble protein extracts and PH-20-deficient mouse sperm were capable of
   dispersing cumulus cells from the cumulus mass. Cumulus cell dispersal
   was strongly inhibited by the presence of a hyaluronidase inhibitor,
   apigenin. These results suggest that in the mouse, HyaI5 may function
   principally as a ``cumulus matrix depolymerase{''} in the sperm
   penetration through the cumulus mass and in the local hyaluronan
   hydrolysis near or on the surface of the egg zona pellucida to enable
   the proximal region of sperm tail to move freely. PH-20 may compensate
   in part for the functional roles of HyaI5.}},

Abstract = {{Recently synthesized proteins are sorted at the trans-Golgi network into

   expressed a GFP-tagged plasma membrane protein in the yeast deletion
   library and identified mutants with altered marker localization. This
   screen revealed a requirement of several enzymes regulating the
   synthesis of sphingolipids and ergosterol in the correct and efficient
   delivery of the marker protein to the cell surface. Additionally, we
   identified mutants regulating the actin cytoskeleton (Rvs161p and
   Vrp1p), known membrane traffic regulators (Kes1p and Chs5p), and several
   unknown genes. This visual screening method can now be used for
   different cargo proteins to search in a genome-wide fashion for
   machinery involved in post-Golgi sorting.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a clonal
   myeloproliferative disease associated with thrombohemorrhagic
   complications and myeloid transformation to diseases such as
   myelofibrosis and acute myeloid leukemia.
   Methods: A multicenter study was conducted among 231 consecutive Chinese
   patients with ET. The literature about leukemogenic risk associated with
   the use of hydroxyurea therapy was reviewed.
   Results: The median patient age was 65 years. Thrombosis rates at and
   after diagnosis of ET were comparable to those of white patients, but
   bleeding rates at and after diagnosis were much lower. The projected
   10-year thrombosis-free, bleeding-free, and overall survival rates were
   66\%, 83\%, and 80\%, respectively. There were no deaths among patients
   60 years or younger during a maximum follow-up of 15 years, and
   splenomegaly at diagnosis of ET appeared to protect against thrombosis.
   In multivariate analysis, advanced age predicted inferior 10-year
   thrombosis-free and overall survival, and male sex predicted inferior
   bleeding-free survival. Half the deaths were related to ET. The
   probability of myelofibrosis transformation was 9.7\% at 10 years. Prior
   myelofibrosis (P=.008) and the use of melphalan treatment (P=.002) were
   risk factors for acute myeloid leukemia evolution.
   Conclusions: Essential thrombocythemia is a benign disease of older
   persons. Chinese patients have a low risk of bleeding, and prior
   myelofibrosis is a major risk factor for evolution to acute myeloid
   leukemia. Leukemic transformation with hydroxyurea therapy alone is rare
   and warrants further prospective studies.}},

Title = {{Cost, affordability and cost-effectiveness of strategies to control
   tuberculosis in countries with high HIV prevalence}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: The HIV epidemic has caused a dramatic increase in
   tuberculosis ( TB) in East and southern Africa. Several strategies have
   the potential to reduce the burden of TB in high HIV prevalence
   settings, and cost and cost-effectiveness analyses can help to
   prioritize them when budget constraints exist. However, published cost
   and cost-effectiveness studies are limited. Methods: Our objective was
   to compare the cost, affordability and cost-effectiveness of seven
   strategies for reducing the burden of TB in countries with high HIV
   prevalence. A compartmental difference equation model of TB and HIV and
   recent cost data were used to assess the costs (year 2003 US\$ prices)
   and effects (TB cases averted, deaths averted, DALYs gained) of these
   strategies in Kenya during the period 2004-2023. Results: The three
   lowest cost and most cost-effective strategies were improving TB cure
   rates, improving TB case detection rates, and improving both together.
   The incremental cost of combined improvements to case detection and cure
   was below US\$15 million per year (7.5\% of year 2000 government health
   expenditure); the mean cost per DALY gained of these three strategies
   ranged from US\$18 to US\$34. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) had the
   highest incremental costs, which by 2007 could be as large as total
   government health expenditures in year 2000. ART could also gain more
   DALYs than the other strategies, at a cost per DALY gained of around
   US\$260 to US\$530. Both the costs and effects of treatment for latent
   tuberculosis infection (TLTI) for HIV+ individuals were low; the cost
   per DALY gained ranged from about US\$85 to US\$370. Averting one HIV
   infection for less than US\$250 would be as cost-effective as improving
   TB case detection and cure rates to WHO target levels. Conclusion: To
   reduce the burden of TB in high HIV prevalence settings, the immediate
   goal should be to increase TB case detection rates and, to the extent
   possible, improve TB cure rates, preferably in combination. Realising
   the full potential of ART will require substantial new funding and
   strengthening of health system capacity so that increased funding can be
   used effectively.}},

Abstract = {{In this investigation different experimental methods to determine the
   platinum dispersion of Pt/BaO/Al2O3 NOx storage catalysts are compared.
   The dispersion of platinum is determined independently using temperature
   programmed desorption of CO, dissociation of N2O, static volumetric CO
   and H-2 chemisorption, dynamic CO chemisorption and transmission
   electron microscopy. For Pt/BaO/Al2O3, reproducible results are obtained
   when the platinum dispersion is determined from N2O dissociation, CO and
   H-2 chemisorption. However, repeated CO-TPD experiments result in
   decreased amount of desorbed CO, which limits this method to determine
   platinum dispersion for Pt/BaO/Al2O3 samples. For Pt/Al2O3, Similar
   values for platinum dispersion are obtained for all methods used in the
   study.
   In addition to the platinum dispersion investigations, the surface
   morphology of Pt/Ba/Al2O3 samples and the distribution of different
   elements are studied using SEWEDS. The SEM-EDS analyses show that the
   platinum is evenly distributed over the entire sample surface, while the
   distribution of barium is more uneven. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Grazing incidence reflection absorption Fourier transform infrared
   (GIRA-FTIR) spectroscopy was used to characterize the ferroelectric
   behavior of a thin poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene)
   P(VDF-TrFE) copolymer. The lab-built GIRA-FTIR apparatus allowed the
   heating and corona poling process to be carried out whilst collecting
   the GIRA spectra of the thin polymer film. The Curie transition from the
   ferroelectric to paraelectric phase was confirmed from the abrupt change
   in intensity of the 849 cm(-1) band in the RA-FTIR spectrum. It was
   found that the Curie temperature dropped dramatically when the film
   thickness was lowered to below a certain critical value of approximately
   100 nm. The switching of the CF2 dipoles in the ferroelectric crystals
   after applying the external electric field could be determined by
   monitoring the change in the 849 cm(-1) band intensity. For the 600 nm
   thick P(VDF-TrFE) film, the switching of the dipoles appears to occur
   almost instantaneously, while the kinetics of dipole switching of the 75
   nm thick film were significantly retarded. The repeated switchability of
   the CF2 dipoles upon the application of a bipolar cyclic electric field
   was also confirmed. The bistability of the film due to remnant
   polarization was also confirmed from the absorbance of the 849 cm(-1)
   band after removing the applied voltage during corona poling. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Two different alkylammonium modified montmorillonites have been
   dispersed in epoxy network precursors in order to study the influence of
   the organophilic treatment on the reactivity and cure behavior of the
   networks, on the morphology of the final composites and on their elastic
   and fracture properties. An increase in the interplatelet distance
   during curing of the network (in addition to the initial swelling by the
   network precursors) is possible when the competition between cure
   kinetics, diffusion kinetics and interactions between network precursors
   and organophilic montmorillonite allows it. Network structure is not
   modified and a catalytic effect of the organoclays has been
   demonstrated. Correlation between morphologies and mechanical properties
   reveals that exfoliated nanocomposites lead to interesting stiffness
   improvements. However, intercalated nanostructures can lead to very
   interesting stiffness/toughness balance for glassy epoxy networks
   without lowering their glass transition temperature. This suggests that
   stiffness and toughness improvements might not be ruled by the same kind
   of morphologies. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Blends of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and
   poly(4-vinylphenol-co-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PVPh-HEM) were
   studied by means of synchrotron small and wide angle X-ray scattering
   (SAXS and WAXS, respectively) and by differential scanning calorimetry
   (DSC). The DSC measurements were used in the determination of the
   Flory-Huggins interaction parameter and also to study the isothermal and
   non-isothermal crystallisation kinetics of the PEO/PVPh-HEM blend. The
   interaction parameter, x(12), was found to be negative (between -0.5 and
   -2.5, approximately) and presented a significant dependence on the blend
   composition, which is expected for a system with specific interactions
   such as hydrogen bonding. From the kinetic studies with Kissinger,
   Friedman and Avrami models, it was shown that crystallisation of PEO
   chains is slower in the blend than in the pure polymer, despite the
   decrease in the energy barrier to the crystallisation with the increase
   in PVPh-HEM concentration.
   From the SAXS and WAXS profiles, the nanostructure of the blend was
   elucidated, exhibiting the formation of PEO lamellae even in the blends
   containing high concentrations of PVPh-HEM, which are non-crystalline
   (as observed by the WAXS profiles). The thickness of the PEO lamellae
   (R-c, approximately 8 nm) remains almost unchanged with the blend
   composition, while the crystalline peaks, observed at 19.78 and 23.98
   degrees, vanish, and the WAXS profile exhibits only a non-crystalline
   halo. For the non-crystalline blends with high concentrations of
   PVPh-HEM, PEO chains keep their crystalline structural memory. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{The Semi-Structured Assessment for Drug Dependence and Alcoholism
   (SSADDA) is a diagnostic instrument developed for studies of the
   genetics Of Substance use and associated disorders. The SSADDA provides
   more detailed coverage of specific drug use disorders, particularly
   cocaine and opioid dependence, than existing psychiatric diagnostic
   instruments. A computerized version of the SSADDA was developed to
   permit direct entry of subject responses by the interviewer. This study
   examines the diagnostic reliability of the SSADDA for Substance use
   disorders and for other DSM-IV disorders that are commonly associated
   with substance use disorders.
   Methods: Two hundred and ninety-three Subjects (mean age= 39 yr, 52.2\%
   women) were interviewed twice over a 2-week period in two sub-studies
   examining the inter-rater (n = 173) or test-retest reliability (n = 120)
   of the SSADDA. The K statistic and Yule's Y were used to measure
   reliability.
   Results: The reliability of most substance dependence diagnoses was good
   to excellent, although the reliability of substance abuse diagnoses was
   substantially lower. The reliability of the associated psychiatric
   diagnoses varied from fair to excellent.
   Conclusions: The SSADDA yields reliable diagnoses for a variety of
   psychiatric disorders, including alcohol and drug dependence. Although
   developed for use in genetic studies, its broad and detailed coverage of
   disorders and computer-assisted format will allow it to be used in a
   variety of applications requiring careful diagnostic assessment. (c)

   1,5,9-triazacyclododecane (12(ane]N3), and
   1-hydroxyethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane (9{[}ane]N30H) promote cleavage
   of the RNA analogue, 2-hydroxypropyl4-nitrophenyl phosphate (HpPNP) at
   pH 8.0, I = 0.10 M (NaCl), 25 degrees C with second-order rate constants
   of 8.9 x 10(-3), 9.0 X 10(-3), and 3.3 x 10(-3) M-1 s(-1), respectively.
   Cleavage of HpPNP by these catalysts is inhibited by uridine with
   inhibition constants (K-i) of 1.2, 0.46, and 45 mM, respectively, under
   these conditions. Binding constants derived from these inhibition
   constants are 2-200-fold larger than those for binding of related Zn(II)
   complexes to phosphate diesters under similar conditions, suggesting
   that uridine sequences in RNA will inhibit Zn(II)-catalyzed cleavage by
   competing with phosphate diester binding sites. Further studies are
   carried out that utilize pH-potentiometric titrations to monitor uridine
   binding to five Zn(II) macrocyclic complexes in aqueous solution at 25
   degrees C, / = 0.10 M (NaCl). The data are consistent with binding of
   the Zn(II) complexes to the N3-deprotonated form of uridine to give log
   K-U values of 5.29, 4.57, 4.56, 3.47, and 2.65 for the Zn(II) complexes

Abstract = {{Numerous routes to 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, a feedstock for
   high performance polyester polyethylene naphthalate, exist starting with
   the alkylation of an aromatic ring. However, the route beginning with
   naphthalenic compounds has an economic advantage because of reduction in
   the number of reaction steps to build the naphthalene ring. This has
   spurred a lot of interest in the shape selective dialkylation of
   naphthalene. Mono alkylation of naphthalene is simple, but its further
   shape selective dialkylation to 2,6-dialkylnaphthalene (2-DAN), is
   challenging. A variety of solid acid catalysts especially zeolites have
   been reported in studies to investigate the effect of acidity, pore
   geometry and shape selectivity in this reaction. However, the activity
   of most catalysts is susceptible to coke formation within a few hours of
   time on stream. It is in this perspective that we report the novelties
   of UDCaT-4, a synergistic combination of persulfated alumina and
   zirconia with hexagonal mesoporous silica, which exhibits tremendous
   stability, activity and selectivity in the vapour-phase isopropylation
   of naphthalene with isopropanol to 2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene (DIPN). It
   leads to better yields and selectivity in comparison with other
   catalysts reported in literature. A systematic investigation of the
   effects of various operating parameters was accomplished. Furthermore, a
   mathematical model was developed to describe the reaction pathway and
   the model validated with experimental results. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Chemical insults, whether of endogenous or exogenous origins, play major
   roles in the etiopathogenesis of many cancers. As such, strategies to
   blunt their formation and limit their damage to biomolecules are a
   central aspect of chemoprevention. Cellular defenses against such
   insults are regulated in part by the transcription factor Nrf2. Nrf2, in
   turn, regulates gene expression through interactions with the ARE (anti
   oxidant-response-element) found in the promoter regions of many
   cytoprotective genes. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is tethered in the
   cytoplasm to an actin binding protein Keap1. Pharmacological and
   food-derived agents such as dithiolethiones and isothiocyanates trigger
   the release of Nrf2 from Keap1, allowing it to translocate into the
   nucleus and stimulate gene transcription. Studies using nrf2-deficient
   mice have revealed that Nrf2 regulates basal and inducible expression of
   multiple categories of genes, including xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes,
   antioxidant enzymes, molecular chaperones/stress response proteins, as
   well as proteasome subunits, that collectively reflect the complex and
   important role Nrf2 plays in the cellular defense against carcinogens.
   Nrf2 knockout mice are greatly predisposed to chemical-induced DNA
   damage and exhibit higher susceptibility towards cancer development in
   several models of chemical carcinogenesis. Nrf2 also mediates protection
   against oxidative stress and influences inflammatory processes, both of
   which contribute to carcinogenesis. Observations that nrf2-deficient
   mice are refractory to the protective actions of some chemopreventive
   agents highlight the importance of the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway
   as a molecular target for prevention. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) survivin is overexpressed in
   many tumors but is absent in most normal adult tissues. We report high
   levels of survivin expression in small cell lung cancer (SCL-C), and
   describe the role of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt
   pathway in survivin upregulation. Moreover, the cytoprotective function
   of survivin in response to the anti-cancer agent cisplatin (CDDP) was
   investigated. Negative modulation of PI3K/Akt using pharmacological
   inhibitors or dominant negative Akt (DN-Akt) decreased Akt kinase
   activity and resulted in decreased survivin expression and
   phosphorylation on Thr34, whereas transfection of constitutively active
   Akt (CA-Akt) increased survivin expression and phosphorylation.
   Interestingly, we found that treatment of SCLC cells with CDDP further
   increased survivin expression in a cell cycle independent manner by
   activation of Akt. CA-Akt or lentiviral survivin also inhibited
   apoptosis induced by CDDP, whereas DN-Akt or survivin-specific RNA
   interference sensitized cells to CDDP. We identified survivin as an
   anti-apoptotic protein in SCLC cells that is regulated by Akt, and
   demonstrate that treatment with the DNA damaging agent CDDP activates
   the PI3K/Akt/survivin pathway that in part protects cells from
   drug-induced apoptosis. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{In the context of relativistic quantum mechanics, we obtain a nonlinear
   first order differential equation for the energy as a function of the
   coupling constant of a central potential. This differential equation is
   only exact for power law and logarithmic potentials in the massless
   limit. For other potentials, we discuss under which conditions the

Abstract = {{A nonlinear time series analysis is performed on light intensity data
   for the variable DB white dwarf PG 1351+489. The data were collected
   during the XCov12 campaign of the Whole Earth Telescope. Two data sets
   integrated to 30 and 10 s, taken at different times during the campaign,
   were analyzed. The power spectrum of PG 1351+489 is broadband, with a
   dominant fundamental frequency f(0), and its harmonics, subharmonics,
   and other lower amplitude peaks. Our time delay phase-space portrait in
   3 dimensions is a rhombohedral shape wrapped around a torus with
   triangular projections. This differs from earlier reports of a more
   circular two-dimensional representation. We show that the difference is
   due to binning and subsequent filtering in the earlier work. A circular
   phase-space portrait is obtained if only the fundamental frequency is
   used, the reconstruction subsequently growing in complexity as more and
   more of the power spectrum is included. Poincare section return times
   for the 30 s integrated data correspond to the fundamental period. For
   the 10 s integrated data, other return times are observed. These are
   shown to be due to dynamical resetting. An example of dynamical
   resetting on a theoretical model is given. Since resetting takes the
   phase-space point off the trajectory, locally projective nonlinear noise
   reduction was used. Locally projective nonlinear noise reduction results
   in lower white noise by a factor of similar to 50. Thus, three more
   harmonics of the fundamental frequency f(0), four more (n + 0.47) f(0)
   subharmonics, and at least 12 other peaks are identified.}},

Abstract = {{The potential antiparasitic and immunomodulatory effect of three
   treatments against myxosporean parasites on the innate immune system of
   sharpsnout sea bream (Diplodus puntazzo) was investigated. Fish
   naturally infected with Myxobolus sp. (Bivalvulida/Platysporina), a
   histozoic parasite mainly affecting the renal interstitial tissue, were
   treated by oral administration of a combination of salinomycin with
   amprolium, Origanum essential oil or fumagillin in a small-scale field
   trial. Various leucocyte functions influenced by myxosporean infection
   were examined in order to determine treatment effects on leucocyte
   immunocompetence of treated fish. One month post treatment all drugs
   caused a significant decrease in prevalence and intensity of infection
   in comparison to untreated, infected fish. The effect was most prominent
   in salinomycin with amprolium treated fish, which I-month post treatment
   contained either no cysts at all or a few spores free in
   melanomacrophage centres revealing almost total elimination of the
   parasite and the antiparasitic action of the treatment. There was no
   histopathological evidence of drug toxicity. Antiparasitic action was
   accompanied by a significant enhancement of phagocytic activity
   demonstrated by ingestion of large numbers of latex beads and the
   secretion of high levels of reactive nitrogen intermediates by
   phagocytes in vitro. Complete restoration of the diminished mitogenic
   responses and serum lysozyme secretion was also detected in salinomycin
   with amprolium-treated fish compared to untreated, infected fish. These
   data suggest that salilomycin with amprolium may be a promising
   treatment for myxosporean infections in intensively cultured warm-water
   fish, exhibiting action partially via the enhancement of host. innate
   immune functions and leading to parasite elimination. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The efficacy of T cell-based immunotherapy is primarily due to efficient
   cellular activation that requires the engagement of 2 separate signals,
   i.e., via the T cell receptor complex and via costimulatory molecules
   the prototype of which is CD28. In cellular activation, the CD28 ligands
   B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) are thought to play nearly identical roles
   in T cell activation. We monitored the T cell response upon co-culture
   with HLA Class I-matched and mismatched renal carcinoma cells,
   respectively, that express different levels of B7-1 and B7-2,
   respectively. In a HLA Class I-mismatched co-culture, T cell
   proliferation, IFN-gamma and GM-CSF secretion equally depend on the
   levels of B7-1 and B7-2 on tumor cells. In contrast, in a HLA Class
   I-matched situation, B7-2 is more effective in the induction of
   IFN-gamma and GMCSF secretion than B7-1, but both B7 molecules induce T
   cell proliferation equally efficient. B7-2 is more effective than B7-1
   in inducing TNF-alpha and IL-10 secretion in both HLA Class I-matched
   and mismatched situations. The distinct patterns of cytokine induction
   by B7-1 and B7-2 obviously depend on the HLA Class I compatibility.
   These conclusions have substantial implications for the development of
   B7-based vaccines used for immunotherapies. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Harmful algal blooms (HAB) have been widely reported and have become a
   serious environmental problem world wide due to its negative impacts to
   aquatic ecosystems, fisheries, and human health. A capability to predict
   the occurrence of algal blooms with an acceptable accuracy and lead-time
   would clearly be very beneficial to fisheries and environmental
   management. In this study, we present the first real-time modelling and
   prediction of algal blooms using a data driven evolutionary algorithm,
   Genetic Programming (GP). The daily prediction of the algal blooms is
   carried out at Kat O station in Hong Kong using 3 years of high
   frequency (two-hourly) chlorophyll fluorescence and related
   hydro-meteorological and water quality data. The results for the
   prediction of chlorophyll fluorescence, a measure of algal biomass, are
   within reasonable accuracy for a lead-time of up to I day. The results
   generally concur with those obtained with artificial neural network. As
   compared to traditional data-driven models, GP has the advantage of
   evolving an equation relating input and output variables. A detailed
   analysis of the results of the GP models shows that GP not only
   correctly identifies the key input variables in accordance with
   ecological reasoning, but also demonstrates the relationship between the
   auto-regressive nature of bloom dynamics and flushing time. This study
   shows GP to be a viable alternative for algal bloom modelling and
   prediction; the interpretation of the results is greatly facilitated by
   the analytical form of the evolved equations. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The three-dimensional structure and decay of a dipolar vortex in a
   linearly stratified fluid is investigated experimentally using a
   high-resolution three-dimensional scanning correlation image velocimetry
   system (SCIV). Comparisons with simple theoretical and numerical models
   are made for late times in the low-Froude-number regime. The relatively
   well-known stratified dipole, most of the time assumed to be
   quasi-two-dimensional, is revealed to have a complex three-dimensional
   vortex topology arising from its self-induced propagation. As the
   buoyancy scale u/N approaches zero the dynamics of such a structure are
   dominated by the horizontal velocity field, whereas the diffusion is
   mainly vertical. The evolution is then governed by an effective Reynolds
   number, Re-eff, based on vertical diffusion and horizontal advection. At
   early times this effective Reynolds number is large, horizontal
   advection terms dominate and a decrease of aspect ratio of the structure
   is observed until Re-eff reaches a critical value Re-eff(c)similar to
   O(1), independent of the initial condition and associated with a
   horizontal advection-vertical diffusion balance. Thereafter the
   evolution becomes purely diffusive with decay time R-eff(c).}},

Abstract = {{An early result from the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE)
   was that the EUV filter ratios for many narrow coronal loops (widths of
   a few arcseconds) were found to cluster within the small range
   0.50-1.70, as functions of position along loop length. The most common
   interpretation is that the temperature along the loop is in fact nearly
   constant with a value between 1.1 and 1.3 MK. This interpretation has
   resulted in a class of TRACE loop models with heating close to the
   footpoints. We analyze the filter ratio method to show that the constant
   TRACE 195 angstrom/173 angstrom ratios can be reproduced by multithermal
   differential emission measures (DEMs) along the line of sight over a
   wide range of peak temperatures, so long as the distribution is
   relatively flat and spans the temperature response of both channels.
   Furthermore, in the limit of flat (i.e., very multithermal) DEMs, the
   filter ratio method is biased toward the ratio of the integrals of the
   temperature response functions. This result is general to any
   measurement of intensity ratios that are formed over a nonzero
   temperature range (e.g., narrow passbands and ion emission lines).}},

Abstract = {{Submergent aquatic vegetation (SAV) is a powerful indicator of
   environmental conditions in both marine and fresh water ecosystems.
   Quickbird imagery was used to map SAV at three sites across the Great
   Lakes. Unsupervised classifications were performed at each site using
   summer Quickbird sensor data. At one site, a multi-temporal
   classification approach was added, combining visible red difference
   (May-August) with August red and green visible band data. Multi-temporal
   SAV classification was superior to single-date results at this site.
   Muck bottom was not seriously confused with SAV, which was unexpected.
   Multi-temporal classification results showed less confusion between deep
   water and SAV, although spectral variability due to sub-surface sandbar
   structure was a source of error in both single- and multi-date
   classifications. Nevertheless, some of the confounding effects of water
   column on SAV classification appear to have been mitigated using this
   multi-temporal approach. Future efforts would be well served by
   incorporating detailed, continuous, bathymetry data in the
   classification process. Quickbird sensor data are very useful for
   classifying SAV under US Great Lakes conditions. However, regional
   classification efforts using these data may be impractical at this time,
   as high cost, rigid tasking parameters and unpredictable water
   conditions limit availability of suitable imagery.}},

Abstract = {{Nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B transcription factors play an evolutionarily
   conserved and critical role in the triggering and coordination of both
   innate and adaptive immune responses. Therefore, there is intense
   interest in understanding the regulation of this transcription factor in
   the context of various diseases. Studies investigated the suppression
   mechanism of NF-kappa B signaling pathways by a beta-carboline alkaloid
   (C-1) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells.
   beta-Carboline alkaloid decreased the level of inducible nitric oxide
   sythase (iNOS) protein and NOS promoter activities in a
   concentration-dependent manner. This effect was accompanied by the
   reduction of NF-kappa B DNA binding activity as well as NF-kappa B
   nuclear translocation. In addition, beta-carboline alkaloid reduced the
   degradation and phosphorylation of I kappa B, and attenuated IKK
   activity in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Taken together, these
   results indicate that beta-carboline alkaloid has the capability to
   suppress NF-kappa B signaling pathway through inhibition of IKK activity
   in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of Ag addition in the composite

   resistivity (p) due to the improvement of grain boundaries resulted from
   the segregation of Ag on the grain surfaces. In addition, 27\% molar
   ratio of Ag addition induces a large room temperature magnetoresistance
   (MR) ratio of 35\%. The good agreement of experimental data with
   Brillouin function indicates that the MR behavior in this composite

Abstract = {{Cytochronies P450 2E1 of human and minipig origin were examined by
   absorption spectroscopy under high hydrostatic pressure and by resonance
   Raman spectroscopy. Human enzyme tends to denature to the P420 form more
   easily than the minipig form moreover, the apparent compressibility of
   the heme active site (as judged from a redshift of the absorption
   maximum with pressure) is greater than that of the minipig counterpart.
   Relative compactness of the minipig enzyme is also seen in the Raman
   spectra, where the presence of planar heme conformation was inferred
   from band positions characteristic of the low-spin heme with high degree
   of symmetry. In this respect, the CYP2E1 seems to be another example of
   P450 conformational heterogeneity Lis shown, e.g., by Davydov et al. for
   CYP3A4 {[}Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 312 (2003) 121-130]. The

Abstract = {{A quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) of a series of
   substituted benzo{[}a]phenazines, in regard to their anticancer
   activity, has been studied using the density functional theory (DFT)
   method, molecular mechanics method (MM+) and statistical method. Via a
   stepwise regression analysis, some main independent factors affecting
   the activity of the compounds were selected out, and then the QSAR
   equation was established. In this equation, the total net charge (Q(R))
   of the substituent (R) (excluding H atoms), the net charge (Q(C4)) of
   the C atom at site 4 on A-ring, as well as the ratio (r=V-R/S-R) of the
   volume to the area of the substituent R are the main independent factors
   contributing to the anticancer activity of the compounds. The fitting
   correlation coefficient (R-2) and the cross-validated coefficient (q(2))
   values for the model established by this study are 0.815 and 0.745,
   respectively. The results suggest that among the three selected
   parameters in the QSAR equation, two are R's properties (Q(R) and r)
   itself and one is the property (Q(C4)) Of C-4 atom directly linked to R,
   and thus R should be a part of active zone. This simple equation can be
   used to estimate the anticancer activity for new compounds of this
   series of compounds by calculating these three independent parameters
   prior to synthesis. Based on this model, four new compounds with rather
   high anticancer activity have been theoretically designed and they are
   waiting for experimental verification. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{One of the classical DNA-binding proteins, bacteriophage lambda Cro,
   forms a homodimer with a unique fold of alpha-helices and beta-sheets.
   We have computationally designed an artificial sequence of 60 amino acid
   residues to stabilize the backbone tertiary structure of the lambda Cro
   dimer by simulated annealing using knowledge-based structure-sequence
   compatibility functions. The designed amino acid sequence has 25\%
   identity with that of natural lambda Cro and preserves Phe58, which is
   important for formation of the stably folded structure of lambda Cro.
   The designed dimer protein and its monomeric variant, which was
   redesigned by the insertion of a beta-hairpin sequence at the C-terminal
   region to prevent dimerization, were synthesized and biochemically
   characterized to be well folded. The designed protein was monomeric
   under a wide range of protein concentrations and its solution structure
   was determined by NMR spectroscopy. The solved structure is similar to
   that of a monomeric variant of natural lambda Cro with a
   root-mean-square deviation of the polypeptide backbones at 2.1 angstrom
   and has a well-packed protein core. Thus, our knowledge-based functions
   provide approximate but essential relationships between amino acid
   sequences and protein structures, and are useful for finding novel
   sequences that are foldable into a given target structure.}},

Abstract = {{We previously reconstituted a minimal DNA replicase from Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa consisting of alpha and epsilon ( polymerase and editing
   nuclease), beta( processivity factor), and the essential tau, delta, and
   delta' components of the clamp loader complex ( Jarvis, T., Beaudry, A.,
   Bullard, J., Janjic, N., and McHenry, C. ( 2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280,
   7890-7900). In Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, alpha and
   Psi are tightly associated clamp loader accessory subunits. The addition
   of E. coli chi Psi to the minimal P. aeruginosa replicase stimulated its
   activity, suggesting the existence of alpha and beta counterparts in P.
   aeruginosa. The P. aeruginosa chi subunit was recognizable from sequence
   similarity, but Psi was not. Here we report purification of an
   endogenous replication complex from P. aeruginosa. Identification of the
   components led to the discovery of the cryptic psi subunit, encoded by
   holD. P. aeruginosa alpha and epsilon were co-expressed and purified as
   a 1: 1 complex. P. aeruginosa chi psi increased the specific activity of
   tau(3)delta delta' 25-fold and enabled the holoenzyme to function under
   physiological salt conditions. A synergistic effect between tau,delta
   and single-stranded DNA binding protein was observed. Sequence
   similarity to P. aeruginosa psi allowed us to identify psi subunits from
   several other Pseudomonads and to predict probable translational start
   sites for this protein family. This represents the first identification
   of a highly divergent branch of the psi family and confirms the
   existence of psi in several organisms in which psi was not identifiable
   based on sequence similarity alone.}},

Abstract = {{Co-II, Ni-II, and N-oxalylglycine (NOG) are well-known inhibitors of
   Fe-II/alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha KG)-dependent hydroxylases, but few
   studies describe their kinetics and no spectroscopic investigations have
   been reported. Using taurine/alpha KG dioxygenase (TauD) as a paradigm
   for this enzyme family, time-dependent inhibition assays showed that
   Co-II and Ni-II follow slow-binding inhibition kinetics. Whereas
   Ni-II-substituted TauD was non-chromophoric, spectroscopic studies of
   the Co-II-substituted enzyme revealed a six-coordinate site (protein
   alone or with alpha KG) that became five-coordinate upon taurine
   addition. The Co-II spectrum was not perturbed by a series of anions or
   oxidants, suggesting the Co-II is inaccessible and could be used to
   stabilize the protein. NOG competed weakly (K-i similar to 290 mu M)
   with alpha KG for binding to TauD, with the increased electron density
   of NOG yielding electronic transitions for NOG-Fe-II-TauD and
   taurine-NOG-Fe-II-TauD and taurine-NOG-Fe-II-TauD at 380 nm
   (epsilon(380) 90-105 M-1 cm(-1)). The spectra of the NOG-bound TauD
   species did not change significantly upon oxygen exposure, arguing
   against the formation of an oxygen-bound state mimicking an early
   intermediate in catalysis. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Neutrophil activation and increased migration is associated with
   preeclampsia and is resolved after delivery. Preeclampsia is an
   inflammatory disorder where altered levels of vascular endothelial
   growth factor ( VEGF) and the circulating soluble fms-like tyrosine
   kinase 1 (sFlt-1) have a pathogenic role. VEGF, by binding to FLT-1,
   induces leukocytic chemotaxis. We studied expression and function of
   FLT-1 in maternal neutrophils during preeclampsia and normal
   pregnancies. Analysis of maternal neutrophils showed the relationship
   between FLT-1 expression and week of gestation. Preeclamptic women
   express lower FLT-1 and sFLT-1 in neutrophils. In contrast, serum levels
   of sFLT-1 in patients with preeclampsia are increased and, therefore,
   inhibit upregulation of FLT-1 in neutrophils by neutralizing VEGF.
   VEGF-dependent FLT-1 expression is regulated by changing FLT-1-promoter
   activity. Promoter activity is decreased by sFLT-1. In vitro experiments
   demonstrated that migration of neutrophils is regulated by VEGF via
   FLT-1 and excess of sFLT-1. Thus, VEGF-dependent migration of
   neutrophils is decreased during preeclampsia as a consequence of excess
   circulating sFlt1. But, they still increase migration by fMLP and,
   therefore, migration of neutrophils from preeclamptic women is highly
   activated when compared with the normotensive group. In conclusion,
   besides being involved in inducing an antiangiogenic state in the serum,
   excess of sFLT-1 seems to prevent activated neutrophils from women with
   preeclampsia from additional migration by VEGF. We provide evidence that
   neutrophils may be involved in the pathophysiology of pregnancy-related
   hypertensive disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Separation and purification of chlorogenic acid by removal of the
   impurities compounds co-existed in the product using molecular
   imprinting technique was firstly reported. In this work, an in situ
   synthesis method was utilized for the preparation of molecularly
   imprinted polymer monolithic stationary phase using the impurity
   molecule (caffeic acid) as template, the mixture of tetrahydrofuran and
   isooctane as solvent, and methacrylic acid and ethyl glycol
   dimethacrylate as functional monomer and cross-linker, respectively. The
   retention behavior of the monolithic polymer to chlorogenic acid
   molecule, the template and several main impurities compounds in the
   product was studied and the adsorption capacity of compounds on the
   stationary phase determined by frontal chromatographic technique. A
   relatively weak retention of the target product molecule (chlorogenic
   acid) on the polymer and a strong adsorption capability of the monolith
   to the template and several main impurities were observed. This might
   mainly result from the `shape' difference of chlorogenic acid molecule
   with the impurities compounds molecules. This approach was shown to be
   successful for the separation and purification of chlorogenic acid from
   the extract of Eucommia ulmodies leaves. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{STAT proteins have the function of signaling from the cell membrane into
   the nucleus, where they regulate gene transcription. Latent mammalian
   STAT proteins can form dimers in the cytoplasm even before
   receptor-mediated activation by specific tyrosine phosphorylation. Here
   we describe the 3.21-angstrom crystal structure of an unphosphorylated
   STAT5a homodimer lacking the N-terminal domain as well as the C-terminal
   transactivation domain. The overall structure of this fragment is very
   similar to phosphorylated STATs. However, important differences exist in
   the dimerization mode. Although the interface between phosphorylated
   STATs is mediated by their Src-homology 2 domains, the unphosphorylated
   STAT5a fragment dimerizes in a completely different manner via
   interactions between their beta-barrel and four-helix bundle domains.
   The STAT4 N-terminal domain dimer can be docked onto this STAT5a core
   fragment dimer based on shape and charge complementarities. The
   separation of the dimeric arrangement, taking place upon activation and
   nuclear translocation of STAT5a, is demonstrated by fluorescence
   resonance energy transfer experiments in living cells.}},

Abstract = {{Transcription factor NF-kappa B has the ability to recognize and to bind
   the DNA sequence of various genes involved in numerous physiological
   processes, such as a regulation of immunoresponse, inflammation or
   cellular growth and development. Replacement of the phosphodiester
   fragment in the kappa B site by the trisubstituted pyrophosphate (TSP)
   residue can cause the DNA molecule to become an irreversible and
   specific inhibitor of NF-kappa B protein. It arises from the fact that
   the TSP residue has ability to create the covalent bond with F-amino
   groups of lysine. The main purpose of this work was to investigate if
   the modifications of the sugar-phosphate backbone influences
   considerably the structure of the DNA molecule. Three models of the
   asymmetric DNA duplexes containing target sequences for NF-kappa B
   factor (5'-GGAAAGTCCC-3') were a subject of the examinations of the
   structural changes. Two of them had incorporated TSP residue. The
   results show that the TSP group seems to not cause global changes in the
   structure of the native DNA fragment, however some local distortions
   occur but their magnitudes are small. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Polyunsaturated fatty acids are potent inhibitors of lipogenic gene
   expression in liver. The lipogenic enzyme glucose-6-phosphate
   dehydrogenase (G6PD) is unique in this gene family, in that fatty acids
   inhibit at a post-transcriptional step. In this study, we have provided
   evidence for a signaling pathway for the arachidonic acid inhibition of
   G6PD mRNA abundance. Arachidonic acid decreases the insulin induction of
   G6PD expression; by itself, arachidonic acid does not inhibit basal G6PD
   mRNA accumulation. The insulin stimulation of G6PD involves the
   phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) pathway (Wagle, A., Jivraj, S.,
   Garlock, G. L., and Stapleton, S. R. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 14968 -
   14974). Incubation of hepatocytes with arachidonic acid blocks the
   activation of PI 3-kinase by insulin as observed by a decrease in
   Ser(473) phosphorylation of Akt, the downstream effector of PI 3-kinase.
   The decrease in PI 3-kinase activity was associated with an increase in
   Ser(307) phosphorylation of IRS-1. Western analysis demonstrated
   increased phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (
   MAPK) in arachidonic acid-treated cells, whereas extracellular
   signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activity was not
   changed. Incubating the hepatocytes with the p38 MAPK inhibitor,
   SB203580, blocked the arachidonic acid inhibition of G6PD mRNA
   accumulation. Furthermore, SB203580 decreased the arachidonic
   acid-mediated Ser(307) phosphorylation of IRS-1 and rescued Akt
   activation that was otherwise decreased by arachidonic acid. Thus,
   arachidonic acid inhibits the insulin stimulation of G6PD mRNA
   accumulation by stimulating the p38 MAPK pathway, thereby inhibiting
   insulin signal transduction.}},

Abstract = {{Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) for the determination of
   phenylurea herbicides have been synthesized by polymerisation of the

   silica particles leading to a silica-MIP composite material.
   Subsequently, the silica matrix was etched away resulting in MIP beads
   which can be considered the ``mirror image{''} of the original silica
   mold. The MIP particles were packed in stainless steal HPLC columns (125
   turn x 4.6 mm I.D.) and the materials were evaluated as
   imprinted-stationary phases for phenylurea herbicides. The imprinting
   effect of the originated specific binding sites for the selective
   recognition of phenylurea herbicides was clearly demonstrated. An
   efficient separation of a mixture of phenylurea herbicides in two
   groups, with or without a methoxy group in the chemical structure, was
   achieved and well shaped and defined peaks were obtained. Finally, the
   optimum imprinted column (prepared using linuron as template,
   2-(trifluoromethyl)-acrylic acid as monomer, 72 h of polymerisation time

Title = {{The AraC-type regulator RipA represses aconitase and other iron proteins

Abstract = {{The mRNA level of the aconitase gene acn of Corynebacterium glutamicum
   is reduced under iron limitation. Here we show that an AraC-type
   regulator, termed RipA for ``regulator of iron proteins A,{''} is
   involved in this type of regulation. A C. glutamicum Delta ripA mutant
   has a 2-fold higher aconitase activity than the wild type under iron
   limitation, but not under iron excess. Comparison of the mRNA profiles
   of the Delta ripA mutant and the wild type revealed that the acn mRNA
   level was increased in the Delta ripA mutant under iron limitation, but
   not under iron excess, indicating a repressor function of RipA. Besides
   acn, some other genes showed increased mRNA levels in the Delta ripA
   mutant under iron starvation ( i. e. those encoding succinate
   dehydrogenase (sdhCAB), nitrate/nitrite transporter and nitrate
   reductase (narKGHJI), isopropylmalate dehydratase (leuCD), catechol
   1,2-dioxygenase (catA), and phosphotransacetylase (pta)). Most of these
   proteins contain iron. Purified RipA binds to the upstream regions of
   all operons mentioned above and in addition to that of the catalase gene
   ( katA). From 13 identified binding sites, the RipA consensus binding
   motif RRGCGN(4)RYGAC was deduced. Expression of ripA itself is repressed
   under iron excess by DtxR, since purified DtxR binds to a well conserved
   binding site upstream of ripA. Thus, repression of acn and the other
   target genes indicated above under iron limitation involves a regulatory
   cascade of two repressors, DtxR and its target RipA. The modulation of
   the intracellular iron usage by RipA supplements mechanisms for iron
   acquisition that are directly regulated by DtxR.}},

   phase, which are polarized along the {[}110] direction with a
   considerable magnitude. This effect does not exist in the
   superconducting phase. On the other hand, if the d-density wave order
   does not exist at zero field, a magnetic field along the {[}110]

   experimental constraints on the DDW states in light of our theoretical
   predictions.}},

Abstract = {{To mimic the electron-donor side of photosystem II (PSII), three
   trinuclear ruthenium complexes (2, 2a, 2b) were synthesized. In these
   compl plexes, a mixed-valent dinuclear Ru-2(II,III) moiety with one
   phenoxy and two acetato bridges is covalently linked to a Ru-II
   tris-bipyridine photosensitizer. The properties and photoinduced
   electron/energy transfer of these complexes were studied. The results
   show that the Ru-2(II,III) moieties in the complexes readily undergo
   reversible one-electron reduction and one-electron oxidation to give the
   Ru-2(II,II) and Ru-2(II,III) states, respectively. This could allow for
   photooxidation of the sensitizer part with an external acceptor and
   subsequent electron transfer from the dinuclear ruthenium moiety to
   regenerate the sensitizer. However, all trinuclear ruthenium complexes
   have a very short excited-state lifetime, in the range of a few
   nanoseconds to less than 100 ps. Studies by femtosecond time-resolved
   techniques suggest that a mixture of intramolecular energy and electron
   transfer between the dinuclear ruthenium moiety and the excited
   {[}Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) photosensitizer is responsible for the short
   lifetimes. This problem is overcome by anchoring the complexes with
   ester- or carboxyl-substituted bipyridine ligands (2a, 2b) to
   nanocrystalline TiO2, and the desired electron transfer from the excited
   state of the {[}Ru(bPY)(3)](2+) moiety to the conduction band of TiO2,
   followed by intramolecular electron transfer from the dinuclear
   Ru-2(II,III) moiety to photogenerated Ru-III was observed. The resulting
   long-lived Ru-2(III,III) state decays on the millisecond timescale.}},

Abstract = {{We have systematically investigated the structural features, electronic
   properties, thermally-induced structural phase transitions and
   absorption spectra depending on the solvent for ten Cu(II) complexes
   with 3,5-halogen-substituted Schiff base ligands. Structural
   characterization of two new complexes, bis(N-R-1-phenylethyl- and
   N-R,S-2-butyl-5-bromosalicydenaminato-kappa N-2,O)copper(II), reveals
   that they afford a compressed tetrahedral trans-{[}CuN2O2] coordination
   geometry with trans-N-Cu-N = 159.4(2)degrees and trans-O-Cu-O =
   151.7(3)degrees for the 1-phenylethyl complex and trans-N-Cu-N =
   157.9(3)degrees and trans-O-Cu-O = 151.0(3)degrees for the 2-butyl one.
   All the complexes exhibit a structural phase transition by heating in
   the solid state regardless of their structures at room temperature. The
   absorption spectra of a series of ten complexes exhibit a slight shift
   of the d-d band at 1600020 000 cm(-1) and remarkable shift of the
   pi-pi{*} band at 24 000-28 000 cm-1, which suggests that the dipole
   moment of the solvents presumably affects the conformation of the
   pi-conjugated moieties of the ligands rather than the coordination
   environment. We have also attempted `photochromic solute-induced
   solvatochromism' by a system of
   bis(N-R-1-phenylethyl-3,5-dichlorosalicydenaminato-kappa
   N-2,O)copper(II) and photochromic 4-hydroxyazobenzene in chloroform
   solution. We successfully observed a change of the d-d and pi-pi{*}
   bands of the complex in the absorption spectra caused by cis-trans
   photoisomerization of 4-hydroxyazobenzene. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The visual cortex is organized into retinotopic maps that preserve an
   orderly representation of the visual world, achieved by topographically
   precise inputs from the lateral geniculate nucleus. We show here that
   geniculocortical mapping is imprecise when the waves of spontaneous
   activity in the retina during the first postnatal week are disrupted
   genetically. This anatomical mapping defect is present by postnatal day
   8 and has functional consequences, as revealed by optical imaging and
   microelectrode recording in adults. Pharmacological disruption of these
   retinal waves during the first week phenocopies the mapping defect,
   confirming both the site and the timing of the disruption in neural
   activity responsible for the defect. Analysis shows that the
   geniculocortical miswiring is not a trivial or necessary consequence of
   the retinogeniculate defect. Our findings demonstrate that disrupting
   early spontaneous activity in the eye alters thalamic connections to the
   cortex.}},

Abstract = {{An instance of a constraint satisfaction problem is l-consistent if any
   l constraints of it can be simultaneously satisfied. For a set pi of
   constraint types, p(l)(pi) denotes the largest ratio of constraints
   which can be satisfied in any l-consistent instance composed by
   constraints of types from pi. In the case of sets pi consisting of
   finitely many Boolean predicates, we express the limit p(infinity)(pi) :
   =lim(l) p(l)(pi) as the minimum of a certain functional on a convex set
   of polynomials. Our results yield a robust deterministic algorithm (for
   a fixed set pi) running in time linear in the size of the input and
   I/epsilon which finds either an inconsistent set of constraints (of size
   bounded by the function of F,) or a truth assignment which satisfies the
   fraction of at least p(infinity) (pi)-epsilon of the given constraints.

Abstract = {{Melarsoprol, a water-insoluble drug, is mainly used in the treatment of
   trypanosomiasis and has demonstrated an in vitro activity on myeloid and
   lymphoid leukemia derived cell lines. It is marketed as a very poorly
   tolerated non-aqueous solution (Arsobal (R)). The aim of our work was to
   develop melarsoprol-cyclodextrin complexes in order to improve the
   tolerability and the bioavailability of melarsoprol. Phase-solubility
   analysis showed A(L)-type diagrams with beta-cyclodextrin (beta CD),
   randomly methylated beta-cyclodextrin (RAME beta CD) and
   hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP beta CD), which suggested the
   formation of 1: 1 inclusion complexes. The solubility enhancement factor
   of melarsoprol (solubility in 250 mM of cyclodextrin/solubility in
   water) was about 7.2 x 10(3) with both beta-cyclodextrin derivatives.
   The 1: 1 stoichiometry was confirmed in the aqueous solutions by the UV
   spectrophotometer using Job's plot method. The apparent stability
   constants K-1:1, calculated from mole-ratio titration plots, were 57 143
   +/- 4 425 M-1 for RAME beta CD and 50 761 +/- 5 070 M-1 for HP beta CD.
   Data from H-1-NMR and ROESY experiments provided a clear evidence of
   inclusion complexation of melarsoprol with its dithiaarsane extremity
   inserted into the wide rim of the cyclodextrin torus. Moreover, RAME
   beta CD had a pronounced effect on the drug hydrolysis and the
   dissolution rate of melarsoprol. However, the cytotoxic properties of
   melarsoprol on K562 and U937 human leukemia cell lines was not modified
   by complexation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction of the ethyl xanthate (EX) anion with a copper electrode
   in a borate buffer solution, pH 9.2, has been investigated by cyclic
   voltammetry (CV), electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM),
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and measurements of
   contact angle (CA) under controlled potential. The results obtained
   allow establishing that, in the potential range from -0.80 and -0.60 V,
   two parallel reactions were characterized. These reactions were the
   ethyl xanthate electroadsorption and the hydrogen evolution reaction
   (HER). This last reaction has not been described by previous authors.
   Besides, the EIS measurements show that the mechanism of the HER on
   copper electrodes is not affected by the presence of a ethyl xanthate
   species. The EQCM study shows that in the electrodesorption process the
   departure of each ethyl xanthate species from the copper electrode is
   accompanied with the simultaneous entry of four to five water molecules.
   This fact is in accordance with the number of copper atoms involved in
   the adsorption of one ethyl xanthate species.}},

   hydrogen-induced amorphization (HIA) and the precipitation of BiF3-type
   NdH3 which occur simultaneously, and (3) the decomposition of the
   remaining amorphous phase into alpha-Mn and NdH3 were observed with
   increasing temperature between 0.1 and 1.0 MPa H-2. HIA and the
   precipitation of NdH3 occurred separately above 2.0 MPa H-2. The peak
   temperature for HIA of C14 Laves phase NdMn2 and its pressure dependence
   is higher and smaller than those of C15 Laves phases RFe2. HIA of NdMn2
   occurred for every hydrogen pressure, although the single phase
   amorphous hydride is not formed below 1.0 MPa H-2 (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

   destroys the energy gap. With increasing hydrogen content for x = 1, 4/3
   the H 1s band broadens (-1.5 to -8 eV). The calculations of the density

Abstract = {{The initial stages of SBA-15 synthesis have been studied by using in
   situ time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering with a synchrotron
   radiation source. The quantitative analysis of X-ray scattering and
   diffraction intensities allows the structures of intermediates to be
   identified at the different stages of SBA- 15 synthesis. Following
   tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) addition, an intense small-angle
   scattering and an associated secondary maximum are observed, which are
   attributed to non-interactin- surfactant tern late rnicelles encrusted
   with silicate species. After 25-30 min of the reaction, the broad
   scattering disappears and narrow Bragg diffraction peaks typical of
   hexagonally ordered structure are observed. The cylindrical micelles
   identified from X-ray scattering data appear to be the direct precursors
   of 2D hexagonal SBA-15 structure. Just after the formation of the SBA-15
   hexagonal phase, the cylindrical micelles are only weakly linked in the
   hexagonal structure. As the synthesis proceeds, the solvent in the void
   volume between the cylindrical micelles is gradually replaced by more
   dense silicate species. The unit cell parameter of SBA-15 is
   progressively decreasing during the SBA-15 synthesis, which can be
   related to the condensation and densification of silicate fragments in
   the spaces between the cylinders. The volume fraction of the 2D
   hexagonally ordered phase is sharply growing during the first 2 h of the
   reaction. The inner core radius of SBA- 15 material remains almost
   constant during the whole synthesis and is principally affected by the
   size of the poly(propylene oxide) inner core in the original cylindrical
   micelles.}},

   on the structural and optical properties of these particles was studied
   over a range of 100-400 degrees C, The results of X-ray diffraction and
   photoluminescence showed that the silica shell not only improved the
   thermal stability but also resisted the lattice-deformation and

Abstract = {{Proton transport in perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) membranes is
   investigated through a statistical mechanical model that includes the
   effects of the interaction of the tethered sulfonate groups with both
   the water and solvated protons. We first derive a potential that
   describes the electrostatic field due to the dissociated sulfonic acid
   groups by extending the work of Gronbech-Jensen {[} Mol. Phys. 92, 941
   (1997)] to a finite array of point charges. A highly convergent series
   is obtained which includes the effects of screening due to the protons.
   We then investigate the effects of both dielectric saturation and two
   distinct formulations of ionic screening on the proton self-diffusion
   coefficient in Nafion membranes over a range of water contents. Our
   computations show that the two phenomena (i.e., dielectric saturation
   and ionic screening) under constant temperature conditions result in
   canceling affects. Our calculations provide a radial dependence of the
   proton mobility suggesting that the dominant self-diffusion occurs in
   the central region of the pores, well separated from the sulfonate
   groups. Through comparison of our calculated diffusion coefficients with
   the experimental values we derived a slightly smaller average separation
   distance of the hydronium ion from the sulfonate ions than suggested by
   either electronic structure calculations or multistate empirical valence
   bond molecular-dynamics simulations.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new adaptive resolution technique for efficient
   particle-based multiscale molecular-dynamics simulations. The presented
   approach is tailor-made for molecular systems where atomistic resolution
   is required only in spatially localized domains whereas a lower
   mesoscopic level of detail is sufficient for the rest of the system. Our
   method allows an on-the-fly interchange between a given molecule's
   atomic and coarse-grained levels of description, enabling us to reach
   large length and time scales while spatially retaining atomistic details
   of the system. The new approach is tested on a model system of a liquid
   of tetrahedral molecules. The simulation box is divided into two
   regions: one containing only atomistically resolved tetrahedral
   molecules, and the other containing only one-particle coarse-grained
   spherical molecules. The molecules can freely move between the two
   regions while changing their level of resolution accordingly. The hybrid
   and the atomistically resolved systems have the same statistical
   properties at the same physical conditions. (c) 2005 American Institute

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND:
   Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against tumor
   necrosis factor (alpha), is an established treatment for Crohn's disease
   but not ulcerative colitis.
   METHODS:
   Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies -- the Active
   Ulcerative Colitis Trials 1 and 2 (ACT 1 and ACT 2, respectively) --
   evaluated the efficacy of infliximab for induction and maintenance
   therapy in adults with ulcerative colitis. In each study, 364 patients
   with moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis despite treatment with
   concurrent medications received placebo or infliximab (5 mg or 10 mg per
   kilogram of body weight) intravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 6 and then
   every eight weeks through week 46 (in ACT 1) or week 22 (in ACT 2).
   Patients were followed for 54 weeks in ACT 1 and 30 weeks in ACT 2.
   RESULTS:
   In ACT 1, 69 percent of patients who received 5 mg of infliximab and 61
   percent of those who received 10 mg had a clinical response at week 8,
   as compared with 37 percent of those who received placebo (P<0.001 for
   both comparisons with placebo). A response was defined as a decrease in
   the Mayo score of at least 3 points and at least 30 percent, with an
   accompanying decrease in the subscore for rectal bleeding of at least 1
   point or an absolute rectal-bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. In ACT 2, 64
   percent of patients who received 5 mg of infliximab and 69 percent of
   those who received 10 mg had a clinical response at week 8, as compared
   with 29 percent of those who received placebo (P<0.001 for both
   comparisons with placebo). In both studies, patients who received
   infliximab were more likely to have a clinical response at week 30 (P
   lessthan/equal 0.002 for all comparisons). In ACT 1, more patients who
   received 5 mg or 10 mg of infliximab had a clinical response at week 54
   (45 percent and 44 percent, respectively) than did those who received
   placebo (20 percent, P<0.001 for both comparisons).
   CONCLUSIONS:
   Patients with moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis treated with
   infliximab at weeks 0, 2, and 6 and every eight weeks thereafter were
   more likely to have a clinical response at weeks 8, 30, and 54 than were
   those receiving placebo. (ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT00036439 and

Abstract = {{Savannas are globally important ecosystems of great significance to
   human economies. In these biomes, which are characterized by the
   co-dominance of trees and grasses, woody cover is a chief determinant of
   ecosystem properties(1-3). The availability of resources ( water,
   nutrients) and disturbance regimes ( fire, herbivory) are thought to be
   important in regulating woody cover(1,2,4,5), but perceptions differ on
   which of these are the primary drivers of savanna structure. Here we
   show, using data from 854 sites across Africa, that maximum woody cover
   in savannas receiving a mean annual precipitation (MAP) of less than
   similar to 650 mm is constrained by, and increases linearly with, MAP.
   These arid and semi-arid savannas may be considered `stable' systems in
   which water constrains woody cover and permits grasses to coexist, while
   fire, herbivory and soil properties interact to reduce woody cover below
   the MAP-controlled upper bound. Above a MAP of similar to 650 mm,
   savannas are `unstable' systems in which MAP is sufficient for woody
   canopy closure, and disturbances ( fire, herbivory) are required for the
   coexistence of trees and grass. These results provide insights into the
   nature of African savannas and suggest that future changes in
   precipitation(6) may considerably affect their distribution and
   dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{The reduction in the length scale of materials to the nanometer range
   brings about fundamental changes that lead to novel and unusual
   phenomena, very different from their coarse-grained counterparts. These
   differences are not only due to the different physical properties of the
   small-size system but it is also affected by the type of the stabiliser
   used on these materials.
   In situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) investigations of the hydrogen
   absorption behaviour in different nanometer sized palladium samples were
   performed during loading and unloading. Pressure-lattice parameter
   isotherms were constructed for three different samples: surfactant
   stabilised clusters, and two types of polymer stabilised samples
   (clusters and closed clusters layers sample). The pressure-lattice
   parameter isotherms for the samples show a narrowed lattice parameter
   miscibility gap. The closed clusters layers sample shows the smallest
   lattice parameter expansion values. The effect of the samples morphology
   on the lattice expansion will be discussed. It will be shown that not
   only the sample sizes affect the expansion but also the cluster
   surrounding plays an important rule. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper the phenomena of hydrogen cracking and hydrogen-induced
   second phases formation in titanium based alloys is discussed in detail,
   addressing to three different alloys; the alpha + beta Ti-6Al-4V alloy,
   the metastable Beta-21S and the Ti-20 wt.\%Nb refractory alloy. The
   prior microstructure of the alloy plays a very significant role on its
   behavior under exposure to a hydrogen-containing environment. In the
   Ti-6Al-4V alloy the main mechanism of hydrogen cracking is the formation
   and rupture of brittle titanium hydride phases. The severity of hydrogen
   degradation in the Ti-6Al-4V alloy depends on the amount and
   distribution of the beta phase in the microstructure due to a more rapid
   diffusion transport of hydrogen in the bcc beta phase. On the other
   hand, the Timetal Beta-21S beta alloy, exposed to the electrochemical
   (high fugacity) hydrogen environment at room temperature, exhibits a
   fair resistance to hydrogen. In the Ti-20 wt.\%Nb alloy hydrogen-induced
   phase transitions and hydrides formation were followed by an interesting
   softening effect, irrespective of the charging procedure. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Hydrogen absorption by a Pd capped thin Mg2Ni film results in the
   nucleation of the Mg2NiH4 phase at the film/substrate interface and thus
   induces a self-organized two-layer system. This leads to the optical
   black state in Mg2Ni thin films upon hydrogenation. This unusual
   hydrogenation behaviour is completely unexpected since the hydrogen
   enters through the top film surface. To explain the nucleation of
   Mg2NiH4 close to the substrate/film interface we performed scanning
   tunneling microscopy (STM) on as-prepared Mg2Ni films with various
   thicknesses (20-150 nm). For films thinner than 50 nm, the film consists
   of small grains and clusters of small grains whereas on further growth
   the grain size increases and a columnar microstructure develops. We
   propose, therefore, that close to the substrate, the relatively porous
   structure of the film with small Mg2Ni grains locally reduces the
   nucleation barrier for Mg2NiH4 formation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo simulation with PENELOPE (version 2003) is applied to

   phantoms. The usual spherical water phantom is modified with a spherical
   bone shell simulating the skull and an air-filled cube simulating the
   frontal or maxillary sinuses. Different simulations of the 201 source
   configuration of the Gamma Knife have been carried out with a simplified
   model of the geometry of the source channel of the Gamma Knife recently
   tested for both single source and multisource configurations. The dose
   distributions determined for heterogeneous phantoms including the bone-
   and/or air-tissue interfaces show non-negligible differences with
   respect to those calculated for a homogeneous one, mainly when the Gamma
   Knife isocentre approaches the separation surfaces. Our findings confirm
   an important underdosage (similar to 10\%) nearby the air-tissue
   interface, in accordance with previous results obtained with the
   PENELOPE code with a procedure different from ours. On the other hand,
   the presence of the spherical shell simulating the skull produces a few

   better performance in comparison with uniform catalysts. However, during
   cycling, performance depends on working conditions and catalytic
   properties. Therefore, catalyst design and mode of operation are related
   issues that need to be defined jointly. The relevance of internal
   processes (reaction, diffusion, and accumulation) and external transport
   on overall performance has been addressed. Therefore, the model would

Abstract = {{We discuss geodesic motion in the vacuum C metric using Bondi-like
   spherical coordinates, with special attention to the role played by the
   `equatorial plane'. We show that the spatial trajectory of photons on
   such a hypersurface is formally the same as that of photons on the
   equatorial plane of the Schwarzschild spacetime, apart from an energy
   shift involving the spacetime acceleration parameter. Furthermore, we
   show that photons starting their motion from this hypersurface with
   vanishing component of the momentum along 0, remain confined on it,
   differently from the case of massive particles. This effect is shown to
   have a counterpart also in the massless limit of the C metric, i.e. in
   Minkowski spacetime. Finally, we give the explicit map between
   Bondi-like spherical coordinates and Fermi coordinates (up to the second
   order) for the world line of an observer at rest at a fixed spatial
   point of the equatorial plane of the C metric, a result which may be
   useful to estimate both the mass and the acceleration parameter of
   accelerated sources.}},

Abstract = {{in yeast, glucose depletion elicits a quick response in the
   transcription of stress-related genes. The main transcriptional
   activator that orchestrates this response is Msn2, whose nuclear
   localization and DNA binding are negatively controlled by the
   cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Msn2 activation by sudden glucose
   depletion correlates with a fast but transient decrease in
   phosphorylation of several sites in its nuclear localization signal
   (NLS). Here we show that protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is the direct
   antagonist of PKA-dependent phosphorylation at the Msn2 nuclear import
   domain and therefore a potential mediator of glucose starvation signals
   that target this transcription factor. Apart from PKA, the protein
   kinase Snf1 can also directly modify one of the Msn2 phosphorylation
   sites (S582) and thereby repress Msn2 function. Consequently, in snf1
   mutants, rephosphorylation of the NLS happens to be much slower during
   prolonged starvation. Thus, a second, Reg1-dependent form of PP1
   indirectly influences Msn2 functionality by modulating Snf1 kinase
   activation and repression. Different activities of PP1 are therefore
   involved in shaping induction and adaptation of the transcriptional
   stress response during acute glucose starvation.}},

Abstract = {{We present a study of the magnetoresistance, the specific heat and the
   magnetocaloric effect of equiatomic RETMg intermetallics with RE = La,
   Eu, Gd, Yb and T = Ag, Au and of GdAuIn. Depending on the composition
   these compounds are paramagnetic (RE = La, Yb) or they order either
   ferro-or antiferromagnetically with transition temperatures ranging from
   about 13 to 81 K. All of them are metallic, but the resistivity varies
   over three orders of magnitude. The magnetic order causes a strong
   decrease of the resistivity and around the ordering temperature we find
   pronounced magnetoresistance effects. The magnetic ordering also leads
   to well defined anomalies in the specific heat. An analysis of the
   entropy change leads to the conclusion that generally the magnetic
   transition can be described by an ordering of localized S = 7/2 moments
   arising from the half-filled 4f(7) shells of Eu2+ or Gd3+. However, for
   GdAgMg we find clear evidence for two phase transitions, indicating that
   the magnetic ordering sets in partially below about 125 K and is
   completed via an almost first-order transition at 39 K. The
   magnetocaloric effect is weak for the antiferromagnets and rather
   pronounced for the ferromagnets for low magnetic fields around the
   zero-field Curie temperature.}},

   of electron-lepton number was later shown to imply the existence of a
   repulsive force between electrons. Although Eotvos experiments showed
   the force to be undetectably small at that time, such a force may be
   related to the dark-energy-induced acceleration of the expansion of the
   universe. If the gauge invariant Lagrangian involves a spacetime
   derivative of the field strength, the resultant potential has properties

Abstract = {{Context A 1990 National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference
   recommended that patients with stage III colon cancer receive adjuvant
   chemotherapy because survival was improved in clinical trials in
   patients who received a 5-fluorouracil-based regimen.
   Objective To determine whether adjuvant chemotherapy is used in the
   community as a standard of practice that improves outcome and whether it
   failed to benefit any specific sets of patients.
   Design, Setting, and Participants Prospective data from 85 934 patients
   with stage III colon cancer from 560 hospital cancer registries were
   entered into the National Cancer Data Base between 1990 and 2002 and
   included standard clinical, pathological, and first course of treatment
   variables.
   Main Outcome Measures Prevalence of adjuvant chemotherapy usage and
   5-year survival in patients treated in US hospitals.
   Results Adjuvant chemotherapy use increased from 39\% in 1991 to 64\% in
   2002 but was lower in black, female, and elderly patients. It improved
   5-year survival from almost 8\% in 1991 to more than 16\% in 1997
   compared with surgery alone. Adjuvant chemotherapy increases survival in
   elderly patients as much as it does in younger patients. However, the
   benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in blacks and, those with high-grade
   cancers is not as great.
   Conclusions Adjuvant chemotherapy use has increased from 1990 to 2002
   for patients with stage III colon cancer with an associated increase in
   5-year survival of 16\%. The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy seems to
   be lower in black patients and high-grade cancers. Women have the same
   benefit but are less often treated. Elderly patients have the same
   benefit as younger patients but are less frequently treated. New options
   for adjuvant therapy in 2004-2005 may further improve the outcome of
   patients with stage III colon cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Fermentable carbohydrates can lead to changes in the gut microflora,
   which may have positive consequences for health. However, often,
   ingredients are added to diets without prior investigating about their
   potential fermentability within the target animal. The experiment
   reported, was conducted to investigate the fermentation kinetics of some
   non-digestible carbohydrates (NDC) by the caecal microbial community of
   broiler chickens by an assessment of the cumulative gas production
   during fermentation of each substrate. It also aimed to study changes in
   the microbial community, following fermentation of these non-digestible
   carbohydrates, by use of polymerase chain reactiondenaturing gradient
   gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Four extracted non-digestible
   carbohydrates (ENC): soybean meal oligo- and water-soluble
   polysaccharides (SMO and SMP), alfalfa meal oligo-and water-soluble
   polysaccharides (AMO and AMP) were studied. Two pure sugars, raffinose
   (RAF) and stachyose (STA) were also included. To assess the
   fermentability of the substrates, cumulative gas pressure was monitored
   continuously, for 72 h, and at the end of fermentation, pH, volatile
   fatty acid (VIA), and ammonia (NH3) concentrations were measured in the
   fermentation solution. The PCR-DGGE technique was applied to compare
   microbial DNA fingerprints between substrates at the end of the
   fermentation. The inoculum for the in vitro gas production was obtained
   from a mixture of caecal contents of forty 81-day-old broiler birds. Soy
   oligosaccharides led to significantly more butyric acid production (P <
   0.05) after fermentation compared with other ENC. The production of
   butyric acid was 155.2 mg/g DM, 100.3 mg/g DM, 84.5 mg/g DM and 71.8
   mg/g DM for SMO, SMP, AMP and AMO, respectively. Soy oligosaccharides
   had the lowest pH (5.5) and ammonia-nitrogen concentration (199.3 mg/l)
   after fermentation. This was significantly different from other ENC and
   the pure sugars. DGGE analysis revealed that, the fingerprint of caecal
   bacterial communities showed some variation (C, value > 60-80\%) between
   some of the substrates. It was concluded that SMO, SMP, AMO and AMP, as
   well as RAF and STA were significantly different, both in terms of their
   fermentation kinetics and end-products using caecal contents from adult
   broilers. The extent to which these non-digestible, but fermentable,
   carbohydrates could change the microbial community of the broiler
   caecum, either in terms of the species detected, or its activity, needs
   to be investigated further, and then related to its effect on gut health
   in the animal itself. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and
   leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Neurospheres labeled with a lipophilic
   dye were placed onto explants, and tissue interactions were analyzed
   after 2-6 days of culture. Immunocytochemical analysis of neurospheres
   revealed the presence of neuronal and glial cells. Proliferating
   neuronal and glial cells were observed after 2 weeks, whereas the
   neuronal cell proliferation declined considerably after 4 weeks. Few
   apoptotic cells were observed in the neurospheres. Neurospheres cultured
   on explanted adult retina engrafted with the surrounding tissue, but
   progenitor cell migration into the explants was low. However, the
   grafted neurospheres appeared to limit the experimentally induced
   photoreceptor apoptosis in the surrounding explant tissue. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Rats suppress intake of a saccharin cue when paired with a drug of abuse
   such as morphine or cocaine. Relative to Lewis rats, Fischer rats
   exhibit greater avoidance of a saccharin cue following
   saccharin-morphine pairings. The present study used the mu agonist,
   {[}D-Ala(2),N-MePhe(4),Gly-ol(5)]enkephalin (DAMGO), to test whether
   strain differences in sensitivity of the mu receptor contribute to this
   effect. Water-deprived Lewis and Fischer rats were given 5 min access to
   0.15\% saccharin followed by an icv injection of either DAMGO (0.5
   microg/l microl/rat) or an equal volume of saline. There were six
   taste-drug pairings occurring at 48 h intervals. The results showed
   that, relative to the saline treated controls, all rats reduced intake
   of the saccharin cue following saccharin-DAMGO pairings. No differences
   occurred between strains. These data suggest that greater
   morphine-induced suppression of saccharin intake by the Fischer rats is
   not likely mediated by differences in sensitivity of the mu receptor.

Abstract = {{A new instrument, the Fugatron, is presented that was developed to make
   in situ measurements of dissolved hydrogen concentrations in laboratory
   reactors. The principle of measurement is based on a probe with a tip
   that consists of a small porous metal substrate coated with a dense
   layer of fluoropolymer. The probe is exposed to the liquid phase and is
   internally purged by a constant flow of carrier gas. Driven by the
   hydrogen concentration gradient between the external and internal side
   of the composite layer, the hydrogen molecules permeate into the carrier
   gas stream. The concentration of the permeate in the carrier gas stream
   is measured by a gas analyzer. The analyzer signal is proportional to
   the partial pressure of dissolved gas. The steady-state concentration of
   dissolved hydrogen in the liquid is calculated from the analyzer signal
   by using solubility data. Calibration methods are described for
   immersion probes used for in situ measurements in reactors which are
   operated in batch or continuous mode as well as for flow-through probes
   used for liquid stream analysis. The sensitivity of the instrument and
   the reliability of the measurements were tested in different solutions
   as a function of temperature and pressure. The hydrogenation of an
   alkyne with a suspended palladium catalyst was chosen as a model
   reaction for in situ measurements. The hydrogenation experiments were
   carried out in a 0.5-L stirred-tank reactor with a turbine stirrer in a
   semibatch mode. Initial hydrogen uptake rates and dissolved hydrogen
   concentrations during this model reaction were measured as a function of
   the amount of catalyst in the liquid. The solubility of hydrogen in the
   pure liquid was determined by a gas absorption measurement at reaction
   conditions. From these measurements, the volumetric :liquid-side mass
   transfer coefficient k(L)a at the gas-liquid interface was calculated as
   a function of catalyst loading. In addition, the k(La) value was also
   determined in the absence of solid particles by the dynamic pressure
   drop method. Discrepancies that may result from calculating steady-state
   dissolved hydrogen concentrations using k(La) values obtained from
   measurements conducted either in pure liquids or in liquids that contain
   suspended catalyst particles are discussed and illustrated by these
   measurements. The new method allows direct measurement of the
   concentrations of dissolved gases during a reaction, which can be a
   decisive factor for the rate as well as for the selectivity of a
   process. Estimations of the gas concentrations via reaction rate data
   and cumbersome determinations of k(L)a values are, therefore, no longer
   necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Aposematic, or warning, signals are generally interspecific in form: one
   species advertises noxiousness to a predator or parasite species. In a
   study of the pipevine swallowtail butterfly (Battus philenor), we show
   that a pattern of colouration in the caterpillars that is considered to
   be aposematic in the context of attack by natural enemies also deters
   oviposition by conspecific females. In field and laboratory assays,
   females avoided oviposition on plants bearing live conspecific larvae.
   Females avoided oviposition on plants bearing artificially constructed
   models identical to larvae in shape, size and colour pattern. Finally,
   oviposition on plants harbouring a model bearing the larval colour
   pattern was reduced relative to plants bearing a leaf-green model,
   suggesting that the larval colour pattern was essential for avoidance.
   We discuss how intraspecific and interspecific processes might interact
   in the evolution of an aposematic signal.}},

Abstract = {{We propose kinetic capillary electrophoresis (KCE) as a conceptual
   platform for the development of kinetic homogeneous affinity methods.
   KCE is defined as the CE separation of species that interact during
   electrophoresis. Depending on how the interaction is arranged, different
   KCE methods can be designed. All KCE methods are described by the same
   mathematics: the same system of partial differential equations with only
   initial and boundary conditions being different. Every qualitatively
   unique set of initial and boundary conditions defines a unique KCE
   method. Here, we (i) present the theoretical bases of KCE, (ii) define
   four new KCE methods, and (iii) propose a multimethod KCE toolbox as an
   integrated kinetic technique. Using the KCE toolbox, we were able to,
   for the first time, observe high-affinity (specific) and low-affinity
   (nonspecific) interactions within the same protein-ligand pair. The
   concept of KCE allows for the creation of an expanding toolset of
   powerful kinetic homogeneous affinity methods, which will find their
   applications in studies of biomolecular interactions, quantitative
   analyses, and selecting affinity probes and drug candidates from complex

Abstract = {{Cell survival is regulated by the balance between death and survival
   signals. Previous studies have shown that the N-methyl-D-aspartate
   receptors (NMDARs) are responsible for the glutamate-induced
   excitotoxicity in the postischemic brain. Meanwhile, nerve growth factor
   (NGF) is critically involved in cell survival and neuroprotective
   effects via the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway or the
   phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway mediated by the high
   affinity NGF receptor, tropomyosin-related kinase A (TrkA). Clinically,
   electroacupuncture (EA) has been shown to produce beneficial effects on
   stroke patients. However, the detailed mechanisms mediating the
   beneficial effects of EA on stroke are still unknown. In the present
   study, we found that EA treatment reversed the high expression of NR1
   subunit and up-regulated the level of TrkA in a rat model of middle
   cerebral artery occlusion. Using protein kinase inhibitors of specific
   intracellular signaling pathways, we found that the neuroprotective
   effects of EA appear to be mediated by stimulation of the PI3-K pathway,
   but not ERK pathway. These findings may provide important experimental
   evidence for the clinical application of EA treatment for stroke
   patients. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, a commercial system capable of x-ray image guided patient

   are triggered from within the gated delivery window portion of the
   breathing trace and after positioning, the tumour will cross the linac
   isocentre during gated delivery. We tested geometric accuracy of this
   system by localizing and delivering gated fields to a moving phantom.

   phantom rotations on positioning and gating accuracy were investigated.
   The system delivered gated fields to both a moving and static phantom
   with equal accuracy. The position of the gating window affects accuracy
   only to the extent that an asymmetric breathing motion could affect dose
   distribution within its boundaries. Positioning errors were found to be
   less then 0.5 +/- 0.2 mm for phantom rotations up to 5 degrees. We found
   and corrected a synchronization error caused by a faulty x-ray duration
   setting and detected a 60 +/- 20 ms time delay in our linear
   accelerator.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory membrane reactors have been studied with the main aim of
   using such types of devices in kinetic studies of gas-liquid and
   gas-liquid-solid reactions. As a matter of fact, these reactors allow a
   better control of the gas-liquid mass transfer phenomena thanks to the
   absence of emulsions and foams, the interfacial area being constant and
   stable with different flow rates, and the modular design and ease of
   scale-up. Four different reactors have been tested to determine what
   impacts gas absorption from the internal part of the membrane-tube
   toward the liquid, both in the absence and in the presence of a chemical
   reaction. In particular, two different agitated reactors have been used:
   one well-stirred without membranes and the other moderately stirred and
   containing a coiled bundle of membranes. These two reactors had exactly
   the same size and stirrer, with the presence of the membrane being the
   unique difference. The performances of these reactors have been compared
   for both the physical absorption of oxygen in water and the absorption
   of oxygen. in a sulfite solution containing a cobalt salt. Furthermore,
   two tubular membrane reactors have been used: one with a single
   membrane-tube and another one containing a bundle of membrane-tubes. The
   tubular reactors have been tested in both oxygen physical absorption in
   water and CO2 chemical absorption in a solution of NaOH. Finally, an
   attempt has been made to quantitatively evaluate the effect of very fast
   chemical reactions on the mass transfer rate in membrane reactors.}},

Abstract = {{While the energy levels in Ho:YLF have been measured previously, they
   have not been as thoroughly investigated in the isomorphs, Ho:LuLF and
   Ho:GdLF. We report here the measurement of the energy levels of the
   trivalent lanthanide Ho3+ in GdLiF4 (GdLF), YLiF4 (YLF), and LuLiF4
   (LuLF). The measurement of the energy levels of Ho:YLF, although they
   have been measured before, are repeated here for self-consistent
   comparison to Ho:LuLF and Ho:GdLF The Stark split levels for the first
   ten Ho manifolds in these materials have been measured, and the results
   have been fitted to a free-ion plus crystal-field Hamiltonian to
   generate a theoretical set of energy levels. Crystal-field parameters
   were varied to determine the best fit between experimental and
   theoretical energy levels. The energy levels of Ho:GdLF and Ho:LuLF are
   seen to be very similar to those in Ho:YLF. However, subtle changes
   resulting from replacing Y3+ with Gd3+ or Lu3+ in the fluoride crystal
   YLiF4 result in shorter transition wavelengths in GdLF and longer
   transition wavelengths in LuLF. This has implications for Ho I-5(7) ->
   I-5(8) lasers operating at similar to 2.0 mu m. The energy levels for
   Ho:GdLF and Ho:LuLF determined here indicate that Ho:GdLF will have a
   larger lower laser level thermal population than Ho:YLF, while Ho:LuLF
   lasers will have a smaller lower laser level thermal population than
   Ho:YLF. This is consistent with the larger Stark splitting associated
   with the larger host ions that Ho Substitutes for in these lithium
   fluoride materials. The intensity parameters are also determined from a
   Judd-Ofelt analysis and used to calculate radiative lifetimes and
   branching ratios for the first ten manifolds in Ho:GdLF, Ho:YLF and
   Ho:LuLF}},

Abstract = {{The hair follicle bulge area is an abundant, easily accessible source of
   actively growing, pluripotent adult stem cells. Nestin, a protein marker
   for neural stem cells, also is expressed in follicle stem cells and
   their immediate, differentiated progeny. The fluorescent protein GFP,
   whose expression is driven by the nestin regulatory element in
   transgenic mice, served to mark the follicle cell fate. The pluripotent
   nestin-driven GFP stem cells are positive for the stem cell marker CD34
   but negative for keratinocyte marker keratin 15, suggesting their
   relatively undifferentiated state. These cells can differentiate into
   neurons, glia, keratinocytes, smooth muscle cells, and melanocytes in
   vitro. In vivo studies show the nestin-driven GFP hair follicle stem
   cells can differentiate into blood vessels and neural tissue after
   transplantation to the subcutis of nude mice. Equivalent hair follicle
   stem cells derived from transgenic mice with beta-actin-driven GFP
   implanted into the gap region of a severed sciatic nerve greatly enhance
   the rate of nerve regeneration and the restoration of nerve function.
   The follicle cells transdifferentiate largely into Schwann cells, which
   are known to support neuron regrowth. Function of the rejoined sciatic
   nerve was measured by contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle upon
   electrical stimulation. After severing the tibial nerve and subsequent
   transplantation of hair follicle stem cells, walking print length and
   intermediate toe spread significantly recovered, indicating that the
   transplanted mice recovered the ability to walk normally. These results
   suggest that hair follicle stem cells provide an important, accessible,
   autologous source of adult stem cells for regenerative medicine.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES The purpose of this research was to assess the safety and
   efficacy of ultrafiltration (UF) in patients admitted with decompensated
   congestive heart failure (CHF).
   BACKGROUND Ultrafiltration for CHF is usually reserved for patients with
   renal failure or those unresponsive to pharmacologic management. We
   performed a randomized trial of UF versus usual medical care using a
   simple UF device that does not require special monitoring or central
   intravenous access.
   METHODS Patients admitted for CHF with evidence of volume overload were
   randomized to a single, 8 h UF session in addition to usual care or
   usual care alone. The primary end point was weight loss 24 h after the
   time of enrollment.
   RESULTS Forty patients were enrolled (20 UF, 20 usual care).
   Ultrafiltration was successful in 18 of the 20 patients in the UF group.
   Fluid removal after 24 h was 4,650 ml and 2,838 ml in the UF and usual
   care groups, respectively (p = 0.001). Weight loss after 24 h, the
   primary end point, was 2.5 kg and 1.86 kg in the UF and usual care
   groups, respectively (p = 0.240). Patients tolerated UF well.
   CONCLUSIONS The early application of UF for patients with CHF was
   feasible, well-tolerated, and resulted in significant weight loss and
   fluid removal. A larger trial is underway to determine the relative
   efficacy of UF versus standard care in acute decompensated heart
   failure.}},

Abstract = {{Four experiments investigated the role of frequency information in
   compound production by independently varying the frequencies of the
   first and second constituent as well as the frequency of the compound
   itself. Pairs of Dutch noun-noun compounds were selected such that there
   was a maximal contrast for one frequency while matching the other two
   frequencies. In a position-response association task, participants first
   learned to associate a compound with a visually marked position on a
   computer screen. In the test phase, participants had to produce the
   associated compound in response to the appearance of the position mark,
   and we measured speech onset latencies. The compound production
   latencies varied significantly according to factorial contrasts in the
   frequencies of both constituting morphemes but not according to a
   factorial contrast in compound frequency, providing further evidence for
   decompositional models of speech production. In a stepwise regression
   analysis of the joint data of Experiments 1-4, however, compound
   frequency was a significant nonlinear predictor, with facilitation in
   the low-frequency range and a trend toward inhibition in the
   high-frequency range. Furthermore, a combination of structural measures
   of constituent frequencies and entropies explained significantly more
   variance than a strict decompositional model, including cumulative root
   frequency as the only measure of constituent frequency, suggesting a
   role for paradigmatic relations in the mental lexicon.}},

Abstract = {{Photoinitiated chemical vapor deposition (piCVD) is an evolutionary CVD
   technique for depositing polymeric thin films in one step without using
   any solvents. The technique requires no pre- or post-treatment and uses
   a volatile photoinitiator to initiate free-radical polymerization of
   gaseous monomers under UV irradiation. Glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) was
   used as a test monomer for its ability to undergo free-radical
   polymerization, and 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropane) (ABMP) was used as the
   photoinitiator, as it is known to produce radicals when excited by
   photons. GMA and ABMP vapors were fed into a vacuum chamber in which
   film growth was observed on a substrate exposed to UV irradiation. The
   resulting poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA) thin films were comprised
   of linear chains and had high structural resemblance to conventionally
   polymerized PGMA, as shown by the high solubility in tetrahydrofuran and
   the infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. The
   introduction of ABMP into the vacuum chamber significantly increased
   growth rates. The maximum growth rate achieved was similar to 140 nm/min
   and represents a 7-fold enhancement over the case without ABMP. The
   molecular weight was found to increase with increasing
   monomer-to-initiator (M/I) feed ratio, and the polydispersity indexes
   (PDIs) of the samples were between 1.8 and 2.2, lower than the values
   obtained in conventional batch polymerization but in agreement with the
   theoretical expressions developed for low-conversion solution-phase
   polymerization, which are applicable to continuous processes such as
   piCVD. Molecular-weight distributions can be narrowed by filtering out
   wavelengths shorter than 300 nm, which induce branching and/or
   cross-linking. The strong dependence of the molecular weight on the M/I
   ratio, the rate enhancement due to the use of a radical photoinitiator,
   the good agreement between the experimental, and the theoretical PI)Is
   provide evidence of a free-radical mechanism in piCVD. The clear films
   obtained in this work had number-average molecular weights between 12
   500 and 97 000 g/mol. The similarities in growth conditions, growth
   rates, and molecular weights between the initiated CVD, a previously
   reported thermal process able to synthesize a wide range of polymers,
   and the piCVD of PGMA suggest that piCVD can also be used to produce
   those polymers and potentially others whose monomers undergo
   free-radical mechanisms. This paper serves as an introduction to the
   technique by demonstrating piCVD's ability in synthesizing
   highmolecular-weight PGMA thin films with narrow molecular-weight
   distributions from vapors of GMA and ABMP in a single, dry step under UV
   irradiation.}},

Abstract = {{Reactions that occur at interfaces often show different behaviors from
   their solution analogues. In this paper, we demonstrated how proximity
   effect, one of the unique phenomena at interfaces, could control the
   product distributions of interfacial reactions. Self-assembled
   monolayers (SAMs) of 16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid on gold surfaces were
   treated with cyanuric fluoride and pyridine, which are generally used
   for forming acid fluorides from carboxylic acids in the solution-based
   reaction. After the treatment, two different products, acid fluorides
   (AFs) and interchain carboxylic anhydrides (ICAs), were controllably
   obtained at surfaces under different reaction conditions with keeping
   the reagents the same. Various factors, such as the concentrations of
   reagents, reaction time, and additives, affected the product
   distribution (or the reaction pathway) at surfaces. We found that one of
   the key factors in controlling the reaction pathway was a relative
   contribution from the proximity effect of adjacent carboxylic acid
   chains in the SAMs (kinetic control) and the equilibrium shift
   (thermodynamic control). The relative reactivity of AF- and
   ICA-presenting surfaces toward primary amines, such as undecylamine and
   {[}((6-aminohexyl)amino)carbonyl]ferrocene, was also investigated, in
   terms of the number and the ordering of the amines coupled onto the
   surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Batch experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of initial
   pH, between 5 and 10, on fermentative hydrogen production from crude
   cheese whey (87.5\% (v/v) by Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum).
   Hydrogen was produced over the range of pH studied. The hydrogen
   production rate and yield peaked at an initial pH 6 and then steadily
   decreased as the pH increased. The highest rate and yield were 28.3 ml
   h(-1) and 7.89 mmol g(-1) lactose, respectively. Sugar consumption was
   unaffected between pH 5 and 9 and remained at 97\%. All final pHs were
   acidic and increased alongside the initial pH. There was no correlation
   between the initial pH and the fermentation time; the times were shorter
   (50-52 h) between pH 6 and 8, and longer (62-82 h) outside this range. A
   modified Gompertz equation adequately described fermentative hydrogen
   production from cheese whey. The respective maximum hydrogen production
   rate and hydrogen potential at an optimal pH of 6 were 47.07 ml h(-1)
   and 1432 ml. Lag phase times were much longer at acidic pHs than at
   alkaline pHs. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report the characterization of aqueous solutions (0.1MLi(2)SO(4)) of

   measurements of clouding temperatures and dynamic light scattering. The
   investigation sought to test the hypothesis that FTMA, which forms
   micelles in aqueous solution in its reduced state but not in its
   oxidized state, would permit reversible control over the formation of
   polymer-surfactant complexes in solution. Our measurements revealed that
   low concentrations of reduced FTMA enhance aggregation, whereas high
   concentrations of reduced FTMA disperse polymer-surfactant aggregates.
   This behavior is qualitatively similar to both dodecyltrimethylammonium.
   bromide and sodium dodecyl sulfate and reflects cooperative interactions
   between FTMA and EHEC. In contrast, oxidized FTMA was found not to
   promote EHEC aggregration at low concentrations of oxidized FTMA nor
   disperse EHEC aggregates at high concentrations. Measurements of dynamic
   light scattering revealed that the reduction of oxidized FTMA in
   solutions of EHEC containing 0.1-0.3 mmolal FTMA causes an increase in
   the sizes of polymersurfactant aggregates of more than 1 order of
   magnitude. Our cloud point measurements also revealed that clouding can
   be induced isothermally via the electrochemical reduction of oxidized
   FTMA at room temperature at FTMA concentrations between 0.4 and 10
   mmolal. In contrast, at concentrations of FTMA greater than 15 mmolal,
   the reduction of oxidized FTMA induces the clearing of EHEC solutions.
   We conclude that aggregation of EHEC in dilute solutions can be
   controlled by the manipulation of the oxidation state of FTM.}},

Abstract = {{In a genetic screen for Kinesin heavy chain (Khc)interacting proteins,
   we identified APLIP1, a neuronally expressed Drosophila homolog of
   JIP-1, a JNK scaffolding protein {[}1]. JIP-1 and its homologs have been
   proposed to act as physical linkers between kinesin-1, which is a
   plus-end-directed microtubule motor, and certain anterograde vesicles in
   the axons of cultured neurons {[}2]. Mutation of Aplip1 caused larval
   paralysis, axonal swellings, and reduced levels of both anterograde and
   retrograde vesicle transport, similar to the effects of kinesin-1
   inhibition. In contrast, Aplip1 mutation caused a decrease only in
   retrograde transport of mitochondria, suggesting inhibition of the
   minus-end microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein {[}3]. Consistent with
   dynein defects, combining heterozygous mutations in Aplip1 and Dynein
   heavy chain (Dhc64C) generated synthetic axonal transport phenotypes.
   Thus, APLIP1 may be an important part of motor-cargo linkage complexes
   for both kinesin-1 and dynein. However, it is also worth considering
   that APLIP1 and its associated JNK signaling proteins could serve as an
   important signaling module for regulating transport by the two opposing

Abstract = {{Single-walled carbon nanohorns (SWNHs) are interesting carbon
   nanostructures that have applications to science and technology. Using
   M13 phage display technology, polypeptides directed again SWNHs surfaces
   have been created for a number of nanotechnology and pharmaceutical
   purposes, yet the molecular mechanism of polypeptide sequence
   interaction and binding to SWNHs surfaces is not known. Recently, we
   identified a linear 12-AA M13 phage pIII sequence, NH-12-5-2
   (DYFSSPYYEQLF), that binds with high affinity to SWNHs surfaces. To
   probe the structure of this pIII tail polypeptide further, we
   investigated the conformation of a model peptide representing the 12 AA
   NH-12-5-2 sequence. At neutral pH, the NH-12-5-2 model polypeptide is
   conformationally labile and exhibits two-state conformational exchange
   involving the D1-S5 N-terminal segment. Simultaneous with this
   conformational exchange process is the observation that the P6 residue
   exhibits imido ring conformational variation. In the presence of the
   structure-stabilizing solvent, TFE, or at pH 2.5, both the exchange
   process and Pro ring motion phenomena disappear, indicating that the
   structure of this peptide sequence can be stabilized by extrinsic
   factors. Interestingly, we observe NMR parameters (ROEs, (3)J coupling
   constants) for NH-12-5-2 in 90\% v/v TFE that are consistent with the
   presence of a partial helical structure, similar to what was observed at
   low pH in our earlier CD experiments. We conclude that the NH-12-5-2
   model polypeptide sequence possesses an inherent conformational
   instability that involves the D1-S5 sequence segment and the P6 residue
   but that this instability can be offset by extrinsic factors (e.g.,
   charge neutralization, imido ring interconversion, and hydrophobic-
   hydrophobic interactions). These nonbonding interactions may play a role
   in the recognition and binding of this phage sequence region to SWNHs
   surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{K114, (trans,trans)-1-bromo-2,5-bis(4-hydroxystyryl)benzene, is a
   fluorescent Congo Red analogue that binds tightly to amyloid fibrils,
   but not the monomeric proteins, with a concomitant enhancement in
   fluorescence. The mechanism for the low aqueous fluorescence and the
   subsequent enhancement by A beta(1-40) fibrils was investigated by
   fluorescence spectroscopy and binding analysis. K114's unusually low
   buffer fluorescence is due to self-quenching in sedimentable aggregates
   or micelles which upon interacting with amyloid fibrils undergo an
   enhancement in fluorescence intensity and shifts in the excitation and
   emission spectra. These spectral changes are suggestive of a
   stabilization of the phenolate anion, perhaps by hydrogen bonding,
   rather than an increase in the microenvironment dielectric constant or
   dye immobilization. 1,4-Bis(4-aminophenylethenyl)-2-methoxybenzane,
   which lacks the phenol moiety, and X-34, which contains a stabilized
   phenol (pK similar to 13.4), do not display the phenolate anion
   fluorescence in the presence of fibrils. The apparent affinity of K114
   for fibril binding is 20-30 nM with a stoichiometry of 2.2 mol of
   K114/mol of A beta(1-40) monomer. Competition Studies indicate that K114
   and Congo Red share a site, but K114 does not bind to sites on A beta(l
   -40) fibrils for neutral benzothiazole (BTA-1), cationic thioflavin T,
   or the hydrophobic (S)-naproxen and (R)-ibuprofen molecules. Comparison
   of benzothiazole binding stoichiometry which has been suggested to
   reflect disease-relevant amyloid Structures to that of Congo Red
   analogues which reflect total fibril content may be useful in defining
   biologically pertinent conformational forms of amyloid.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoparticles of metal oxides have applications as additives in thin
   nanocomposite films. For optical applications that include transparent
   films and coatings, nanoparticles should be uniformly dispersed in the
   polymer film. Most commercially available nanoparticles are large
   agglomerates about 1 mu m in maximum dimensions composed of primary
   particles with sizes ranging from 5 to 50 run. The large agglomerates
   scatter light and are not directly suitable for optical systems.
   Ultrasonication of liquid suspensions was used to prepare stable
   dispersions from commercial titania nanopowders. The mean diameter of
   sonicated titania nanopowders was correlated inversely to the specific
   energy. After a rapid initial size reduction, continued ultrasonication
   lead to insignificant reduction and even reagglomeration of the
   particles. Both erosion and fracture mechanisms were observed. None of
   the commercial nanopowders were successfully broken to their primary
   particle sizes. Reagglomeration of the dispersion could be prevented by
   electrostatic stabilization with nitric acid or ammonium hydroxide when
   its zeta potential value was less than -30 mV or greater than +30 mV (c)

Abstract = {{Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an important human pathogen and has
   developed sophisticated mechanisms to evade the host immune system.
   These could involve the use of cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling
   systems, since the M. tuberculosis genome encodes a large number of
   functional adenylyl cyclases. Using bioinformatic approaches, we
   identify, clone, and biochemically characterize the Rv0805 gene product,
   the first cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase identified in M.
   tuberculosis and a homologue of the cAMP phosphodiesterase present in
   Escherichia coli (cpdA). The Rv0805 gene product, a class III
   phosphodiesterase, is a member of the metallophosphoesterase family, and
   computational modeling and mutational analyses indicate that the protein
   possesses interesting properties not reported earlier in this class of
   enzymes. Mutational analysis of critical histidine and aspartate
   residues predicted to be essential for metal coordination reduced
   catalytic activity by 90-50\%, and several mutant proteins showed
   sigmoidal kinetics with respect to Mn in contrast to the wild-type
   enzyme. Mutation of an asparagine residue in the GNHD motif that is
   conserved throughout the metal lophosphoesterase enzymes almost
   completely abolished catalytic activity, and these Studies therefore
   represent the first mutational analysis of this class of
   phosphodiesterases. The Rv0805 protein hydrolyzes cAMP and cGMP in
   vitro, and overexpression in Mycobacterium smegmatis and E. coli reduces
   intracellular cAMP levels. The presence of an orthologue of Rv0805 in
   Mycobacterium leprae suggests that the Rv0805 protein could have an
   important role to play in regulating cAMP levels in these bacteria and
   adds an additional level of complexity to cyclic nucleotide signaling in
   this organism.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES The aim of the present double-blind, Placebo-controlled study
   was to evaluate the efficacy of a systemic imatinib treatment, a potent
   platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor kinase inhibitor, for the
   prevention of recurrent restenosis in patients with in-stent restenosis
   (ISR).
   BACKGROUND Neointima proliferation after stent placement has been
   associated with the effect of potent mitogenes such as PDGF, and their
   inhibition has resulted in reduction of neointima formation in
   experimental models.
   METHODS A total of 180 patients with either symptoms or a positive
   stress test in the presence of angiographically signficiant ISR were
   randomly assigned to two treatment arms: imatinib treatment or placebo.
   Patients received imatinib (600 mg/day) for 10 days starting 2 days
   before repeat intervention. Angiographic restenosis at follow-up
   angiography was the primary end point of the study.
   RESULTS Repeat angiography was performed in 160 of 180 patients
   (88.9\%). The combined rate of death or MI at one year was 1.0\% in
   patients randomized to either group (p = 0.67). Compared with the
   placebo group, imatinib treatment did not affect the angiographic
   restenosis rate (38.8\% with imatinib vs. 41.3\% with placebo; p =
   0.75). Similarily, the need for target lesion revascularization did not
   differ between both groups (28.1\% with imatinib vs. 28.6\% with
   placebo; p = 0.94).
   CONCLUSIONS Systemic imatinib therapy does not affect the risk of
   recurrence in patients with ISR.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To describe the epidemiology and clinical features of box
   jellyfish envenoming in the Top End of the Northern Territory and, in
   particular, confirmed stings from the major Australian box jellyfish,
   Chironex fleckeri.
   Design: Prospective collection of clinical data and skin scrapings or
   sticky-tape tests for nematocyst identification from patients presenting
   to Royal Darwin Hospital and remote coastal community health clinics in
   the Northern Territory, spanning 10950km of coastline; analysis of
   tidal, weather and seasonal data.
   Patients: All patients with jellyfish sting details recorded between 1
   April 1991 and 30 May 2004. Main outcome measures: Demographic and
   clinical features, use of C. fieckeri antivenom, and associations
   between weather, seasonal and tidal factors and confirmed C. fieckeri
   stings.
   Results: Of 606 jellyfish stings documented, 225 were confirmed to have
   been caused by C. fleckeri. 37\% of C. fleckeri stings were in children,
   92\% occurred during the ``stinger season{''} (1 October to 1 June),
   83\% occurred in water I m or less deep, and 17\% occured while victims
   were entering the water. Stings were least common on outgoing tides (P <
   0.001) and commonest between 15:00 and 18:00 (P < 0.001) and on days
   with wind speed less than that month's average (P < 0.001). Nearly all
   victims experienced immediate pain, but this could often be controlled
   with ice; only 30\% required parenteral narcotics and 8\% required
   hospital admission. Cardiorespiratory arrest occurred within several
   minutes of the sting in the one fatal case, involving a 3-year-old girl
   with only 1.2 m of visible tentacle contact. C. fieckeri antivenom was
   given to another 21 patients, none of whom had life-threatening features
   at the time they were given antivenom. \textbackslash{}
   Conclusions: Most C. fleckeri stings are not life-threatening; patients
   who die usually have cardiopulmonary arrest within minutes of the sting.
   The potential benefit of antivenom and magnesium under these
   circumstances remains to be shown, but a protocol with their rapid use

Abstract = {{Extracellular adenosine ( Ado) has been implicated as central signaling
   molecule during conditions of limited oxygen availability ( hypoxia),
   regulating physiologic outcomes as diverse as vascular leak, leukocyte
   activation, and accumulation. Presently, the molecular mechanisms that
   elevate extracellular Ado during hypoxia are unclear. In the present
   study, we pursued the hypothesis that diminished uptake of Ado
   effectively enhances extracellular Ado signaling. Initial studies
   indicated that the half- life of Ado was increased by as much as
   fivefold after exposure of endothelia to hypoxia. Examination of
   expressional levels of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter ( ENT) 1
   and ENT2 revealed a transcriptionally dependent decrease in mRNA,
   protein, and function in endothelia and epithelia. Examination of the
   ENT1 promoter identified a hypoxia inducible factor 1 ( HIF- 1) -
   dependent repression of ENT1 during hypoxia. Using in vitro and in vivo
   models of Ado signaling, we revealed that decreased Ado uptake promotes
   vascular barrier and dampens neutrophil tissue accumulation during
   hypoxia. Moreover, epithelial Hif1 alpha mutant animals displayed
   increased epithelial ENT1 expression. Together, these results identify
   transcriptional repression of ENT as an innate mechanism to elevate
   extracellular Ado during hypoxia.}},

Abstract = {{Lightweight and flexible composite coatings of p-toluene sulfonic acid
   doped polyaniline (PANT-TSA) with various mass fractions and
   polyacrylate were prepared for electromagnetic interference (EMI)
   shielding. Both the volume and surface conductivities of the composite

   conductivity showed a typical percolation behavior with a percolation
   threshold at about 0.21. The EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) of the
   PANI-TSA/polyacrylate coatings over the range of 14 kHz to 15 GHz
   increased with increasing PANI-TSA as the direct-current conductivity
   did. EMI SE of the coatings at the low frequencies (14 kHz to I GHz) was
   around 30-80 dB, higher than that at the high frequencies (1-15 GHz);
   this indicated possible commercial application of the coatings for
   far-field EMI shielding. The highest EMI SE value was 79 dB at 200 MHz
   with a coating thickness of 70 +/- 5 mu m. The moderate SE, light
   weight, and easy preparation of the coating are advantages for future
   applications for EMI shielding. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to examine the stability of bovine serum
   albumin (BSA) in poly(DL-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)
   microspheres upon addition of a new excipient, poly(ethylene
   glycol)-poly(L-histidine) diblock copolymer (PEG-PH). Poly(L-histidine)
   component can form an ionic complex with BSA under acidic conditions
   within a narrow pH range. To optimize the ionic complexation conditions
   for BSA with PEG-PH, the resulting complex sizes were monitored using
   the Zetasizer. PLGA microspheres containing BSA as a model protein were
   prepared by w/o/w double emulsion method. BSA stability in aqueous
   solutions and after release from PLGA microspheres was determined using
   circular dichroism, (CD) spectroscopy for secondary structure analyses
   and fluorescence measurements for tertiary structure analyses. The
   release profile of BSA from the microspheres was monitored using UV
   spectrophotometry. The rate of PLGA degradation was monitored by gel
   permeation chromatography. The pH profile within microspheres was
   further evaluated by confocal microscopy using a pH-sensitive dye.
   Approximately 19 PEG-PH molecules and one BSA molecule coalesced to form
   an ionic complex around a pH range of 5.0-6.0. Plain BSA/PLGA and
   BSA/PEG-PH/PLGA microspheres had a mean size of 27-35 mu m. PLGA
   microspheres with a BSA loading efficiency > 80\% were prepared using
   the double emulsion method. PEG-PH significantly improved the stability
   of BSA both in aqueous solutions and in PLGA microspheres. The release
   profiles of BSA from different formulations of PLGA microspheres were
   significantly different. PEG-PH effectively buffered the local acidity
   inside the microspheres and improved BSA release kinetics by reducing
   initial burst release and extending continuous release over a period of
   time, when encapsulated as an ionic complex. PLGA degradation rate was
   found to be delayed by PEG-PH. There was clear evidence that PEG-PH
   played multiple roles when complexed with BSA and incorporated into PLGA
   microspheres. PEG-PH is an effective excipient for preserving the
   structural stability of BSA in aqueous solution and BSA/PLGA
   microspheres formulation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Alcohol dependence is characterized by frequent, compulsive and
   uncontrolled consumption of alcohol associated with behavior of
   maladaption and destruction. It is an etiologically and clinically
   heterogeneous syndrome, moderately to highly heritable, and caused by
   interaction of genes and environment. Alcohol dependence is related to
   other psychiatric diseases by common Deurobiological pathways, including
   those that modulate reward, behavioral control as well as anxiety and
   stress response. Alcohol induces adaptive changes in brain function
   providing the basis for tolerance, craving, withdrawal, and emotional
   disturbance. The differentiation of psychobiological traits of addictive
   behavior reflecting neurobiological processes is therefore of particular
   importance for the dissection of the complex genetic susceptibility to
   alcohol dependence. A central serotonin (5-HT) deficit is thought to be
   involved in the pathogenesis of alcohol dependence by modulating
   motivational behavior, neuroadaptive processes, and resulting emotional
   disturbance. 5-HT-related impulsive, aggressive, and suicidal behavior
   has been linked to a primordial personality that is susceptible to
   alcohol dependence. Although variations in many of the genes that encode
   receptors, enzymes, and transporters of the 5-HT system have been tested
   as risk factors for alcohol dependence, genetic analyses of 5-HT
   signaling in alcohol dependence have mainly been focused on the 5-HT
   transporter (5-HTT) gene. Due to its central role in the fine-tuning
   serotonergic neurotransmission, a regulatory variant of the 5-HTT, which
   is associated with anxiety related traits, is not only a key player in
   the neurobiological mechanism of gene x environment interaction in the
   etiology of depression, but also contributes to the risk to develop
   alcohol dependence with antisocial behavior and suicidality. Evidence
   for a modulatory effect of allelic variation of 5-HTT function on limbic
   circuit responses to emotional stimuli suggests that
   genotype-endophenotype correlations may be accessible to molecular
   functional imaging of the brain. These new developments have broad
   implications for our understanding how genetic vulnerability to alcohol
   dependence is manifested in the brain's response to emotional stimuli.

Abstract = {{The multicomponent Strecker reaction using trimethylsilyl cyanide was
   accomplished without any type of Lewis acid. The reaction performed in
   acetonitrile as solvent gave excellent results for any class of
   aldehydes (aromatic or aliphatic), Lis well as amines (aromatic or
   aliphatic). In many cases, alpha-artimonitrile product was isolated pure
   after the usual work-up, with quantitative chemical yields. A comparison
   between different solvents indicated that acetonitrile is the best
   choice. The rate comparison using different Lewis acids showed that all
   of them catalyzed the reaction in a similar extent, the difference with
   the acid Lewis-free being minimal. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   consists of the main patch with a slant slit and L-shaped patch,

   frequencies are obtained by changing both the length and width of a
   slant slit on the main patch and a position of feed line. A broadband
   characteristic is achieved by optimizing not only the length and height
   of the L-shaped patch, but also the length and width of the slant slit
   on the main patch, which is excited blip the modified CPW-fed antenna.
   Good broadside radiation patterns with reasonable gains are achieved for
   all four-frequency hands of interest. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals. Inc.}},

   different styrene contents and different numbers of blocks in the
   copolymer chain were functionalized by melt radical grafting with
   glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and employed as compatibilizers for
   PET-based blends. Binary blends of PET with both functionalized
   (SEBS-g-GMA, SEP-g-GMA, SEPSEP-g-GMA) and neat (SEBS, SEP, SEPSEP)

   with various amounts (2.5-10 phr) of both modified and unmodified
   copolymers were prepared in an internal mixer, and their properties were
   evaluated by SEM, DSC, melt viscosimetry, and tensile and impact tests.
   The roles of the chemical structure, grafting degree, and concentration
   of the various copolymers on blend compatibilization was investigated.
   The blends with the grafted copolymers showed a neat improvement of
   phase dispersion and interfacial adhesion compared to the blends with
   nonfunctionalized copolymers. The addition of grafted copolymers
   resulted in a marked increase in melt viscosity, which was accounted for
   by the occurrence of chemical reactions between the epoxide groups of
   GMA and the carboxyl/hydroxyl end groups of PET during melt mixing.
   Blends with SEPSEP-g-GMA and SEBS-g-GMA, at concentrations of 5-10 phr,
   showed a higher compatibilizing effect with enhanced elongation at break
   and impact resistance. The effectiveness of GMA-functionalized SEBS was
   then compared to that of maleic anhydride-grafted SEBS. (c) 2005 Wiley

   order to make a statistical study of the damage features, we have

   displaced atoms (DA) from perfect lattice positions and the size of
   defect clusters formed increases with ion mass. This dependence has not

   indicates that multiple interactions play an important role in the

   or triphenylindium with 3,5-diphenylpyrazole or 3,5-dimethylpyrazole in
   2:1 or 1:1 stoichiometry afforded the dimeric complexes
   {[}(C6H5)(2)Ga(mu-tBu(2)pz)](2) (63\%), {[}(C6H5)(2)In(mu-Ph(2)pz)](2)
   (40\%), and {[}(C6H5)(2)In(mu-Me(2)pz)](2) (92\%), respectively, as
   colorless crystalline solids. The dimeric nature of these complexes was
   determined by X-ray crystallography. Treatment of
   3,5-di-tert-butylpyrazole with excess trimethylgallium afforded the
   dimeric complex {[}Me2Ga(mu-tBu(2)pz)](2) (82\%) as the major product
   and Me2Ga(mu-tBu(2)pz)(mu-OCH3)GaMe2 (2.6\%) as a minor product. There
   was no evidence for the formation of the methyl-bridged complex
   Me2Ga(mu-tBu(2)pz)(mu-CH3)GaMe2. The kinetics of bridge-terminal phenyl
   exchange in (C6H5)(2)Ga(mu-Me(2)pz)(mu-C6H5)Ga(C6H5)(2),
   (C6H5)(2)Ga(mu-Ph(2)pz)(mu-C6H5)Ga(C6H5)2(.)C(7)H(8),
   (C6H5)(2)Ga(mu-tBu(2)pz)(mu-C6H5)Ga(C6H5)(2), and
   (C6H5)2In(,u-tBU2PZ)(,U-C6H5)In(C6H5)2'(C6Hl4)0.5 was determined by C-13
   NMR spectroscopy and afforded the following range of activation
   parameters: Delta H-double dagger = 6.0-8.
   9 kcal/mol, Delta S-double dagger = -231 to -32.0 eu, and Delta G((298
   K))(double dagger) = 15.5-15.8 kcal/mol. The large, negative values of
   Delta S-double dagger imply ordered transition states relative to the
   ground state and rotation along the N-GaPh3 or N-InPh3 vector without
   metal-nitrogen bond cleavage. The combined results suggest that the
   close proximity of the metal atoms is the principal determinant of the
   bridging phenyl interactions and that complexes of the heavier group 13
   elements with bridging hydrocarbon ligands are likely to be more
   accessible than the current state of literature would suggest.}},

Abstract = {{Fibrous composites have found applications in aircraft from the first
   flight of the Wright Brothers' Flyer 1, in North Carolina oil December
   17th, 1903, to the plethora of uses now enjoyed by them on both military
   and civil aircraft, in addition to more exotic applications on unmanned
   aerial vehicles, space launchers, and satellites. Their growing use has
   arisen from their high specific Strength and stiffness, when compared to
   the more conventional materials, and the ability to shape and tailor
   their structure to produce more aerodynamically efficient structural
   configurations. In this paper, it is argued that fiber reinforced
   polymers, especially carbon fiber reinforced plastics can and will in
   the future contribute more than 50\% of the structural mass of an
   aircraft. However, affordability is the key to survival in aerospace
   manufacturing, whether civil or military, and therefore effort should be
   devoted to analysis and computational simulation of the manufacturing
   and assembly process as well as the simulation of the performance of the
   structure, since they are intimately connected. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Various transporters such as H+/peptide cotransporter PEPT1 are
   expressed in the intestine, and play important physiological and
   pharmacological roles in the body. Present study was performed to
   examine the expression profile of 20 kinds of transporters (PEPT I and
   2, P-glycoprotein, amino acid transporters and organic ion transporters)
   along the human digestive tract, especially focusing on PEPT1. Using
   normal mucosal specimens, real-time polymerase chain reactions were
   carried out. Immunoblot analyses were also performed for PEPT1
   expression. PEPT1 mRNA was highly expressed in the small intestine
   (duodenum > jejunum > ileum) compared to other tissues, and some
   patients showed a significant level of expression in the stomach. The
   expressional pattern of PEPT1 in the stomach and histological diagnosis
   indicated that gastric PEPT1 originated from the intestinal metaplasia.
   The amino acid transporters showed unique mRNA expression levels and
   distributions in the digestive tract. For example, the expression levels
   of B(0)AT1, a Na+-dependent and chloride-independent neutral amino acid
   transporter, were increased from the duodenum to ileum, which pattern is
   completely inverted to that for PEPT I. There is little expression of
   organic ion transporters except for organic cation/carnitine transporter
   OCTN2. In conclusion, PEPT1 was abundantly expressed in the small
   intestine, and the reciprocal expression of PEPT1 and B(0)AT1 may serve
   for the efficient absorption of protein digestive products. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{The search for cold electron field emission materials, with low

   fabrication has continued to attract a significant research interest
   over the past several years. This is primarily driven by their potential
   applications in vacuum microelectronic devices and flat panel displays.
   In this paper, the preparation of Ag-SiO2 nanocomposite layers on Si
   substrates by Ag implantation into thermally oxidized SiO2 layers is
   reported. The electron field emission (FE) properties of these
   nanocomposite layers were studied and correlated with results using
   other characterisation techniques, including atomic force microscopy,
   Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and
   transmission electron microscopy. The experimental results indicate that
   these nanocomposite layers have good FE properties with threshold fields
   as low as 13 V/mu m. The FE mechanisms of these layers are discussed in
   term of an electrical inhomogeneity effect. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

   The results show that the wear-resistances of various shape non-smooth
   materials are all better than that of the smooth material. The
   wear-resistance of non-smooth surface changed along with the variety of
   non-smooth shape. The wear-resistance of reticulate shape non-smooth
   surface material whose distributing distance is smaller is the best in
   the experiments. The higher hardness of non-smooth unit would prevent
   abrasive particles from penetrating into the matrix material, sever the
   ploughing and paring of abrasive particles to material, and block the
   wear progress during wear process, so that the wear-resistance is

Abstract = {{This paper aims at the characterization of acid-base properties of
   nucleoside analogs using a pH-gradient flow injection -diode array

   transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) extensively used in AIDS treatment,
   including zidovudine (AZT), didanosine (ddl), stavudine (d4T) and
   zalcitabine (ddC). The FI system consists of a two-channel manifold in
   which the sample injection into an acid carrier is responsible of the
   generation of a pH gradient. A first step is focused on an accurate
   calibration of the pH-gradient shape inside the FI peak using nucleoside
   analogs of known pK(a) values as standard compounds. The pH gradient in
   the FI peak is estimated from the concentration profiles of standard
   compounds. In a second step, the pH-gradient profile is exploited for a
   rapid estimation of unknown pK(a) values of test drugs. Various
   approaches for calculating pK(a) values are evaluated using the peak
   front or peak tail gradient ranges. As a result, overall errors in pKa
   estimations are lower than 2.5\%. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: High-resolution B-mode ultrasound measurements
   of carotid intimamedia thickness (IMT) and determination of plaque
   presence are useful to assess preclinical atherosclerosis. Normal IMT
   values have not been reported in Spanish subjects. Our aim was to define
   normality data of carotid ultrasound by sex and age.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We studied 250 healthy, normolipidemic subjects,
   125 men and 125 women, with mean age 49 years (range, 20-81). We
   assessed cardiovascular risk factors and performed ultrasound
   determination of mean and maximum IMT in the far wall of the common
   carotid artery, plaque occurrence, and maximum plaque height.
   RESULTS: Reference values for carotid IMT, expressed as 25th, 50th, and
   75th percentiles by sex and 5 age groups, have been obtained. The 50th
   percentiles of mean IMT ranged from 0.50 to 0.74 mm in men in the age
   groups 35 years or younger and 65 years or older, respectively. For
   women, corresponding IMT values ranged from 0.40 to 0.65 mm. IMT was
   strongly related (p < 0.001) to age, both in men (r = 0.57) and women (r
   = 0.61). From the regression equations, the estimated yearly increase in
   IMT was 0.005 mm in men and 0.007 mm in women. More than 50\% of men
   aged 55 years and older, and of women aged 65 years and older, had
   carotid plaques.
   CONCLUSIONS: Both IMT and plaque frequency were associated with age in
   men and women. Carotid IMT values in a Spanish community cohort were
   lower than those reported for countries with higher cardiovascular risk,
   such as Northern European countries and the US.}},

Volume = {{110}},

Abstract = {{{[}1] Numerous quantitative models have been developed to simulate the
   long-term evolution of river basin topography. Most of these models
   reach an equilibrium state when the base level is lowered at a constant
   rate and the substrate and climate are constant in time. At equilibrium
   the erosion balances the base level lowering, so the topography remains
   frozen in time. However, some recent laboratory experiments contradict
   this behavior. In these experiments the space-time mean erosion rate
   balances the base level lowering rate, but the actual erosion rates are
   highly variable in space and time. Consequently, the channel networks
   are substantially mobile. The experimental flow conditions are
   approximately similar but not dynamically equivalent to those in nature,
   so it is unclear whether the observed dynamics are representative. This
   paper examines whether the processes occurring in the experiments
   produce basins that are geometrically similar to typical natural basins.
   To make this comparison, the conceptual framework of scaling invariance
   is used. Many similarities are observed, but we find that the
   experimental basins are slightly more elongated across a range of scales
   than the natural basins we consider and the relationship between channel
   slope and drainage area exhibits a break that is not found in the
   natural basins we analyze. In the experiments the slopes of small
   channels also depend on the proximity of large channels. This dependency
   is more pronounced for experiments with more mobile channel networks,
   and it is not observed in most of the natural basins we analyze.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To determine whether twins have lower IQ scores in childhood
   than singletons in the same family and, if so, whether differences in
   fetal growth explain this deficit.
   Design Cohort study.
   Setting Scotland.
   Participants 9832 singletons and 236 twins born in Aberdeen between 1950
   and 1956.
   Results At age 7, the mean IQ score of twins was 5.3 points lower (95\%
   confidence interval 1.5 to 9.1) and at age 9, 6.0 points lower (1.7 to
   10.2) than that of singletons in the same family. Adjustment for sex,
   mother's age, and number of older siblings had little effect on these
   differences. Further adjustment for birth weight and gestational age
   attenuated the IQ difference between twins and singletons: the
   difference in mean IQ was 2.6 points (- 1.5 to 6.7) at age 7 and 4.1
   points (-0.5 to 8.8) at.age 9.
   Conclusions Twins have substantially lower IQ in childhood than
   singletons in the same family. This effect cannot be explained by
   confounding due to socioeconomic, maternal, or other family
   characteristics, or by recruitment bias. The reduced prenatal growth and
   shorter gestations of twins may explain an important part of their lower

Abstract = {{Background: Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) has been often associated to
   RPL since 1980 and some reports in the Literature rarely described
   antibodies to factor XII in patients with APS.
   Case history: We report the case history of 34-year-old caucasian women
   with recurrent fetal loss and persistent prolonged activated partial
   thromboplastin time. Haemostatic tests revealed persistent light
   decrease of clotting factor XII with normal values of IgG and IgM
   anticardiolipin antibodies and transient positivity for lupus
   anticoagulant ( LA). Few reports in the Literature described antibodies
   to factor XII in patient with antiphospholipid syndrome ( APS) and
   transient LA. So, once other causes of RPL were excluded, the patient
   was diagnosed an unusual form of APS associated to antibodies to factor
   XII, reduced factor XII plasma levels, transient LA and prolonged
   activated partial thromboplastin time.
   Discussion: We suggest to consider also antibodies directed to clotting
   factors ( e. g. factor XII in our case) as second step of thrombophilia
   screening in RPL, in particular if a persistent prolonged aPTT is
   present without an apparent cause.}},

   the activity of extracellular heparan sulfate 6-O-endosulfatases (
   Sulfs), fibroblast growth factor 2-, heparin binding epidermal growth
   factor-, and hepatocyte growth factor- mediated signaling are
   attenuated. This represents a novel mechanism for regulating cell
   growth, particularly within the tumor microenvironment where the Sulfs
   are known to be misregulated. To directly test the role of Sulfs in
   tumor growth control in vivo, a human myeloma cell line was transfected
   with cDNAs encoding either of the two known human endosulfatases,
   HSulf-1 or HSulf-2. When implanted into severe combined immunodeficient
   ( SCID) mice, the growth of these tumors was dramatically reduced on the
   order of 5- to 10-fold as compared with controls. In addition to an
   inhibition of tumor growth, these studies revealed the following. ( i)
   HSulf-1 and HSulf-2 have similar functions in vivo. ( ii) The
   extracellular activity of Sulfs is restricted to the local tumor cell
   surface. ( iii) The Sulfs promote a marked increase in extracellular
   matrix deposition within tumors that may, along with attenuated growth
   factor signaling, contribute to the reduction in tumor growth. These
   findings demonstrate that dynamic regulation of heparan sulfate
   structure by Sulfs present within the tumor microenvironment can have a
   dramatic impact on the growth and progression of malignant cells in
   vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Though known as a sensor of energy balance, AMP-activated protein kinase
   (AMPK) was recently shown to limit damage and apoptotic activity and
   contribute to the late preconditioning in heart. Interleukin-6 was also
   reported to involve in anti-apoptosis and cardio-protection in
   myocardium. Interestingly, both AMPK activity and IL-6 level were
   increased in response to ischemia, hypertrophy and oxidative stress. To
   determine whether AMPK activation will promote IL-6 production, cardiac
   fibroblasts (CFs) from mice were incubated with AMPK activator,
   5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-4-ribofuranoside (AICAR). The results
   demonstrated that AICAR time and dose-dependently stimulated IL-6
   production by ELISA and immunoflurescence. Pretreatment with p38
   nitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor blocked AICAR-induced
   IL-6 production; furthermore, AICAR-activated p38 MAPK phosphorylation
   by Western blot. To confirm that the increase in IL-6 production is
   ascribed to AMPK activation, we used another known AMPK activator.
   metformin. It also dose-dependently potentiated IL-6 production in CFs,
   and this potentiation could be reversed by p38 MAPK inhibitor. In
   conclusion, AMPK activation promoted IL-6 production in CFs via p38
   MAPK-dependent pathway. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The symbiotic bacterium Holospora obtusa infects the macronucleus of the
   ciliate Paramecium caudatum. After ingestion by its host, an infectious
   form of Holospora with an electron-translucent tip passes through the
   host digestive vacuole and penetrates the macronuclear envelope with
   this tip. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanism of this
   process, we raised a monoclonal antibody against the tip-specific 89-kDa
   protein, sequenced this partially, and identified the corresponding
   complete gene. The deduced protein sequence carries two actin-binding
   motifs. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy shows that during escape
   from the host digestive vacuole, the 89-kDa proteins translocates from
   the inside to the outside of the tip. When the bacterium invades the
   macronucleus, the 89-kDa protein is left behind at the entry point of
   the nuclear envelope. Transmission electron microscopy shows the
   formation of fine fibrous structures that co-localize with the
   antibody-labeled regions of the bacterium. Our findings suggest that the
   89-kDa protein plays a role in Holospora's escape from the host
   digestive vacuole, the migration through the host cytoplasm, and the
   invasion into the macronucleus. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The human immunodeficiency virus-1 ( HIV-1) Nef protein, originally
   identified as a negative factor, has now emerged as one of the most
   important viral proteins necessary for viral pathogenesis and disease
   progression. Nef has been also implicated in viral infectivity and
   replication, however, the molecular mechanism of Nef-induced viral gene
   expression and replication is not clearly understood. Although
   involvement of heat shock proteins in viral pathogenesis has been
   reported earlier, a clear understanding of their role remains to be
   elucidated. Here we report for the first time that Nef not only
   interacts with heat shock protein 40 ( Hsp40) but it also induces the
   expression of Hsp40 in HIV-1-infected cells. The interaction between Nef
   and Hsp40 is important for increased Hsp40 translocation into the
   nucleus of infected cells, which seems to facilitate viral gene
   expression by becoming part of the cyclin-dependent kinase 9-associated
   transcription complex regulating long terminal repeat-mediated gene
   expression. The finding is consistent with the failure of the
   nef-deleted virus to induce Hsp40, resulting in reduced virus
   production. Our data further shows that, whereas, Hsp40 overexpression
   induces viral gene expression, silencing of Hsp40 reduces the gene
   expression in a Nef-dependent manner. Thus our results clearly indicate
   that Hsp40 is crucial for Nef-mediated enhancement of viral gene
   expression and replication.}},

Abstract = {{Senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) are the prominent
   lesions in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. NFT are
   mainly composed of an abnormally phosphorylated form of tau protein,
   which has lost its function to bind microtubules and promote their
   assembly. Tau hyperphosphorylation critically decreases tau function and
   precedes neurodegeneration. The majority of tau phosphorylation sites
   are Ser/Thr-Pro motifs, which are known to exist in two distinct. cis
   and trans conformations. The prolyl isomerase Pin1 catalyses the
   conversion of those conformations. Pin1 binds to tau specifically at the
   Thr231-Pro site and restores tau function, either by inducing
   conformational changes or facilitating dephosphorylation. It has been
   shown that Pin1 expression levels inversely correlate with the predicted
   vulnerability of different brain areas to neurodegeneration and soluble
   Pin1 is depleted in neurons from AD brains; furthermore, Pin1 knock-out
   mice develop signs and symptoms of tau-related pathologies late in life.
   It seems that Pin1 plays an important role in maintaining tau function,
   thereby preserving neuronal homeostasis and preventing age-dependent
   neurodegeneration. DNA sequence variations in Pin1 gene may affect its
   expression level or function and influence the individual risk for
   developing AD. We screened by denaturing high performance liquid
   chromatography the genomic DNA of 120 AD subjects and 134 age-matched
   controls and we found very few and rare sequence variations in the
   promoter region and in exons 2 and 3. We conclude that Pin1 is a very
   well conserved gene, whose rare nucleotide variations have no effect on
   the individual genetic risk for AD. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

   kinase domain (KD) of the catalytic subunit of yeast AMPK (commonly
   known as SNF1). The Snf1-KD structure shares strong similarity to other
   protein kinases, with a small N-terminal lobe and a large C-terminal
   lobe. Two negative surface patches in the structure may be important for
   the recognition of the substrates of this kinase. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{The steroid hormone aldosterone stimulates sodium ( Na+) transport in
   tight epithelia by altering the expression of target genes that regulate
   the activity and trafficking of the epithelial sodium channel ( ENaC).
   We performed microarray analysis to identify aldosterone-regulated
   transcripts in mammalian kidney epithelial cells ( mpkC-CDc14). One
   target, glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper protein ( GILZ), was
   previously identified by serial analysis of gene expression ( SAGE);
   however, its function in epithelial ion transport was unknown. Here we
   show that GILZ expression is rapidly stimulated by aldosterone in
   mpkCCD(c14) and that GILZ, in turn, strongly stimulates ENaC-mediated
   Na+ transport by inhibiting extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK)
   signaling. In Xenopus oocytes with activated ERK, heterologous GILZ
   expression consistently inhibited phospho-ERK expression and markedly
   stimulated ENaC-mediated Na+ current, in a manner similar to that of
   U0126 ( a pharmacologic inhibitor of ERK signaling). In mpkCCD(c14)
   cells, GILZ transfection similarly consistently inhibited phospho-ERK
   expression and stimulated transepithelial Na+ transport. Furthermore,
   aldosterone treatment of mpkCCD(c14) cells suppressed phospho-ERK levels
   with a time course that paralleled their increase of Na+ transport.
   Finally, GILZ expression markedly increased cell surface ENaC expression
   in epidermal growth factor-treated mammalian kidney epithelial cells,
   HEK293. These observations suggest a novel link between GILZ and
   regulation of epithelial sodium transport through modulation of ERK
   signaling and could represent an important pathway for mediating
   aldosterone actions in health and disease.}},

Journal = {{STROKE}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{165-168}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background and Purpose - Intracranial stenting is associated with a 32\%
   rate of restenosis. Drug-eluting stents (DES) have revolutionized the
   treatment of coronary artery disease and have greatly reduced the risk
   of in-stent stenosis. We present our experience with the feasibility and
   safety of using DES for patients with symptomatic intracranial
   atherosclerosis.
   Methods - All of the patients had > 70\% stenoses and had failed maximal
   medical therapy. They were pretreated with aspirin, clopidogrel, and
   intraprocedural heparin. All of the lesions were predilated, and
   balloons and stents were slightly undersized. Clopidogrel and aspirin
   were continued for 1 year, and patients had clinical follow-up and
   vascular imaging at 30 days, 6 months, and 1 year.
   Results - Eight patients with intracranial internal carotid artery (3),
   middle cerebral (2), basilar (2), and vertebral artery (1) stenoses were
   successfully treated with 4 Cypher (Cordis Corp) and 4 Taxus (Boston
   Scientific Inc) stents. The mean stenosis severity was reduced from
   84.4\% +/- 10.2\% to 2.5\% +/- 4.6\%. One patient had an intraprocedural
   retinal embolism, but there were no other complications. Over a mean
   follow-up of 11.1 +/- 4.9 months (range, 2 to 17.3 months), patients
   have had repeat angiography (5) or transcranial Doppler with or without
   CT angiography (3). None of the patients have had clinical or
   significant angiographic restenosis or required target vessel
   revascularization.
   Conclusions - Elective intracranial stenting with DES appears to be
   feasible and safe, but additional clinical experience is required to
   assess its efficacy.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: to describe the qualitatively different ways in which
   midwives make sense of how to approach women smokers.
   Design, setting and participants: a more person-centred national project
   `Smoke-free pregnancy' has been in progress in Sweden since 1992. Using
   a phenomenographic approach, 24 midwives who have been regularly working
   in antenatal care were interviewed about addressing smoking during
   pregnancy.
   Findings: four different story types of how the midwives made sense of
   their experiences in addressing smoking in pregnancy were identified:
   `avoiding', `informing', `friend-making', `co-operating'.
   Key conclusion: the midwives' story types about how they approached
   women who smoke illustrated the difficulties of changing from being an
   expert who gives information and advice to being an expert on how to
   enable a woman in finding out why she smoked and how to stop smoking.
   Implications for practice: health education about smoking that is built
   on cooperation and dialogue was seen by the midwives as a productive way
   of working. The starting point should be the lay perspective of a woman,
   which means that her thoughts about smoking cessation are given the
   space to grow while she talks. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) seeded on three-dimensional (3D) coralline
   (Porites lutea) biomatrices were irradiated with low-level laser
   irradiation (LLLI). The consequent phenotype modulation and development

   biomatrix/LLLI system and in a control group, which was similarly grown,
   but was not treated by LLLI. The irradiated and non irradiated MSC were
   tested at 1-7, 10, 14, 21, 28 days of culturing via analysis of cellular
   distribution on matrices (trypan blue), calcium incorporation to newly
   formed tissue (alizarin red), bone nodule formation (von Kossa), fat
   aggregates formation (oil red O), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity,
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron dispersive spectrometry
   (EDS). The results obtained from the irradiated samples showed enhanced
   tissue formation, appearance of phosphorous peaks and calcium and
   phosphate incorporation to newly formed tissue. Moreover, in irradiated
   samples ALP activity was significantly enhanced in early stages and
   notably reduced in late stages of culturing. These findings of cell and
   tissue parameters up to 28 days of culture revealed higher ossification
   levels in irradiated samples compared with the control group. We suggest
   that both the surface properties of the 3D crystalline biomatrices and

   sequence was not elicited by an olfactory conditioned stimulus. In the
   second experiment, a latent inhibition paradigm was used to pre-expose
   R. prolixus to an olfactory conditioned stimulus before pairing the odor

   (namely, in any of the intervals 0 <= -t <= 0.025.... 0.1 GeV2), the
   asymmetry normalized in such a way that it takes values between -1 and 1
   must undergo a jump Close in magnitude to unity in the region of the eta
   pi(o) invariant masses between 0.965 and 1.01 GeV A large jump of the
   asymmetry is due exclusively to a(o)(o)(980)-f(o)(980) mixing. A very
   high resolution in the eta pi(o) invariant mass is not required for
   observing the jump of the asymmetry. The energy dependence of the
   polarization effect is expected to be rather weak therefore, the
   polarization effect in question can be studied at any high energy-for
   example, in the range between 8 and 100 GeV (C) 2005 Pleiades

Abstract = {{Objective: To study adjunctive medications used with antipsychotic
   agents in schizophrenia via comparisons of antidepressant, anxiolytic
   and antiparkinsonian co-prescribing. Method: In the context of a
   national naturalistic prospective observational study, a database
   containing all the prescriptions from 100 French psychiatrists during
   the year 2002 was analysed. The inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of
   schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and age over 18. A log-linear
   model and generalised linear mixed models were used. Results: In all
   5,257 prescriptions for 922 patients were analysed. The proportion of
   patients who were prescribed an antiparkinsonian drug was 32.9\%.
   Amisulpride, haloperidol, phenothiazines with a sedative action and
   depot typical antipsychotics proved more likely to be prescribed with
   antiparkinsonians. The frequency of antidepressant and anxiolytic
   prescriptions was 51.2\% and 52.3\%, respectively. Associations between
   atypical antipsychotics (except clozapine) and antidepressants were
   positive while associations between typical antipsychotics and
   antidepressants were not. There were no differences among antipsychotics
   for the prescription of anxiolytics. Conclusions: Atypical
   antipsychotics can be expected to be less likely associated with
   antiparkinsonians. This result is indeed found for olanzapine, clozapine
   and to a limited extent for risperidone. Furthermore, a trend towards a
   positive association between atypical antipsychotics and antidepressants
   appears. In view of the antidepressive action of certain atypical
   antipsychotics, this result is surprising. The increase in the
   prescriptions of anxiolytics concerns all types of antipsychotics. In
   view of the increase in associated medications in schizophrenia and the
   difficulty of estimating it in randomised trials, this study underlines
   the contribution of naturalistic studies on this score.}},

Abstract = {{p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1) participates in the repair of DNA double
   stranded breaks (DSBs) where it is recruited to or near sites of DNA
   damage. Although little is known about the biochemical functions of
   53BP1, the protein possesses several motifs that are likely important
   for its role as a DNA damage response element. This includes two BRCA1
   C-terminal repeats, tandem Tudor domains, and a variety of
   phosphorylation sites. Here we show that a glycine-arginine rich (GAR)
   stretch of 53BP1 lying upstream of the Tudor motifs is methylated. We
   demonstrate that arginine residues within this region are important for
   asymmetric methylation by the PRMT1 methyltransferase. We further show
   that sequences upstream of the Tudor domains that do not include the GAR
   stretch are sufficient for 53BP1 oligomerization in vivo. Thus, although
   Tudor domains bind methylated proteins, 53BP1 homo-oligomerization
   occurs independently of Tudor function. Lastly, we find that
   deficiencies in 53BP1 generate a ``hyper-rec{''} phenotype.
   Collectively, these data provide new insight into 53BP1, an important
   component in maintaining genomic stability.}},

Abstract = {{Social influences have been shown to be very important to overcome food
   neophobia in young children. However, there is no experimental evidence
   about whether social influences on food acceptance are specific, that is
   if models eating the same food as the child are more effective in
   promoting food acceptance than models eating a different food. We
   assessed children's behavior towards novel foods when an adult model (a)
   was not eating (Presence condition), (b) was eating a food of a
   Different color (Different color condition), and (c) was eating a food
   of the Same color (Same color condition). We tested 27 children (ages 2-
   to 5-years-old) recruited from The Pennsylvania State University
   day-care facilities. Results show that children accepted and ate their
   novel food more in the Same color condition than in the Different color
   and in the Presence conditions. Therefore, in young children food
   acceptance is promoted by specific social influences. These data
   indicate that children are more likely to eat new food if others are
   eating the same type of food than when others are merely present or
   eating another kind of food. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to determine the boundary
   conditions to be imposed on one edge of the prototype panel during the
   tests to simulate the presence of the other two in the actual structure.
   The FEA was also used to determine the critical (independent) snow and

Abstract = {{Damage, destruction and casualties related to landslide and debris flow
   are common phenomena in the Himalaya, especially during the summer
   monsoon. This fact was tragically illustrated on 22 July 1996, when
   Larcha, situated at the 109-km mark of the Arniko Highway, upper
   Bhotekoshi Valley, central Nepal, experienced a catastrophic debris flow
   powered by the Bhairab Kunda Stream. Of the 22 houses in Larcha, 16 were
   swept away, two were partially damaged and 54 people were killed in a
   matter of a few minutes. The event attracted attention when media linked
   it to a glacial lake outburst flood as a result of the fact that the
   source of the stream is a glacial lake. To understand the cause,
   initiation mechanism and deposition process, the basin area was studied
   from geological, geomorphologic and engineering geological points of
   view and the role of precipitation was evaluated. A combination of
   rainfall, runoff from cliff faces and stream undercutting triggered
   failure of the bedrock and colluvium, both on the dip and counterdip
   slopes, 500 m upstream from the highway. The landslide debris dammed the
   channel, which was eventually breached, and deposited approximately 104
   000 m(3) of coarse debris, dominated by the metasediments of the Lesser
   Himalayan origin, and overwhelmed the village of Larcha. The debris
   deposit was studied for clast size, composition, texture and dimensions.
   Lack of sorting and the presence of abundant silt and clay in the source
   area helped in the initiation of debris flow. The abundance of the
   Lesser Himalayan metasediment clasts together with the absence of debris
   traces upstream from the landslide site ruled out the possibility of a
   glacial lake outburst flood. The disaster was a result of landslide
   damming triggered by precipitation and stream undercutting and sudden
   bursting.}},

Abstract = {{shown to have anti-tumor activity, highly active in inhibiting
   replication of HIV-1 and SARS-associated virus and exhibits a number of
   pharmacological effects. The principle objective of the current study
   was to evaluate the effects of different spectral quality including red,
   blue, white and UV-B radiation on the production of glycyrrhizin, in a
   controlled environment. Plants were grown under artificial lights with
   elevated CO2 concentration and both the pot and hydroponic plants were
   assigned to red and blue light treatments and those grown under white
   fluorescent lamps were used as control. In a separate experiment, pot
   plants were exposed to ultraviolet (UV)-B radiation (wavelength: 280-315
   nm). The net photosynthetic rates (NPR) of the leaves reduced
   significantly immediately after exposure to the high intensity UV-B
   radiation (3 days at 1. 13 W m(-2)). In case of the low intensity UV-B
   radiation (15 days at 0.43 W m(-2)), NPR was also reduced, but the rate
   of reduction was significantly slower than that of the high intensity
   treatment. The concentrations of glycyrrhizin quantified in the root
   tissues were highest in the plants grown under red light in both
   hydroponic and pot systems and the concentration increased linearly from
   1- to 3-month-old pot plants. Both the low and high intensity of UV-B
   exposure increased the concentration of glycyrrhizin in the root tissues
   of 3-month-old pot plants, the values being nearly X1.5 those of the
   control. The results also indicate that the glycyrrhizin concentrations
   of 3-6 months old pot plants were similar or even higher than the
   previously reported values for 3-4 years old field-grown plants and
   confirm that high concentration of glycyrrhizin production is possible
   within a very short production period under controlled environments. (c)

Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: Systemic corticosteroid therapy increases risk of
   postoperative sepsis in Crohn's disease. This study investigates its
   effect on risk for sepsis in non-operated patients. Methods: A
   retrospective case-control study was performed in 432 patients with
   Crohn's disease (the 94\% of our database for whom adequate
   documentation could be retrieved). Two analyses were performed. The
   first tested the hypothesis that patients with perforating Crohn's
   disease (n = 86) were more likely to develop intra-abdominal or pelvic
   abscess (n = 29) if they had received systemic corticosteroids during
   the previous 3 months. The second analysis, confined to interventions
   since 1998, tested the hypothesis that corticosteroid therapy was more
   common during the 3 months before presentation with intra-abdominal or
   pelvic abscess (n = 12) than during the 3 months after presentation with
   a relapse of nonperforating disease (n = 24 consecutive patients). In
   both analyses adjustment was made for any other significant variable.
   Results: Systemic corticosteroid therapy was associated with an adjusted
   odds ratio (OR) for intra-abdominal or pelvic abscess of 9.03 (95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI], 2.40-33.98) in patients with perforating
   Crohn's disease. Patients receiving prednisolone :20 mg per day had an
   OR of 2.81 (95\% CI, 0.99-7.99) for abscess compared with those
   receiving a lower dose. In patients with relapsed active disease,
   corticosteroid therapy was associated with an unadjusted OR of 9.31
   (95\% CI, 1.03-83.91) for intra-abdominal or pelvic abscess. Neither
   smoking nor azathloprine usage was associated with increased risk for
   abscess. Conclusions: Systemic corticosteroid therapy for Crohn's
   disease is associated with increased risk for intra-abdominal or pelvic
   abscess.}},

Abstract = {{Conserved protein sequence segments are commonly believed to correspond
   to functional sites in the protein sequence. A novel approach is
   proposed to profile the changing degree of conservation along the
   protein sequence, by evaluating the occurrence frequencies of all short
   oligopeptides of the given sequence in a large proteome database. Thus,
   a protein sequence conservation profile can be plotted for every
   protein. The profile indicates where along the sequences the potential
   functional (conserved) sites are located. The corresponding
   oligopeptides belonging to the sites are very frequent across many
   prokaryotic species. Analysis of a representative set of such profiles
   reveals a common feature of all examined proteins: they consist of
   sequence modules represented by the peaks of conservation. Typical size
   of the modules (peak-to-peak distance) is 25-30 amino acid residues.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Study Aim: As for any manual procedure, the learning
   curves for medical interventions can have undesirable phases, occurring
   mostly in the early experience of applying a technique. There have been
   impressive advances in endoscopic procedures during recent years, and
   there is an emerging trend that the number of procedures is increasing
   in parallel with these. In addition, the introduction of screening
   programs for colorectal cancer will also increase the numbers of
   procedures needed. Recent developments in medical simulation seem
   promising with regard to the possibility of ``training out{''}
   undesirable parts of the learning curve outside the operating room. The
   aim of this study was to investigate whether the use of the Accu-Touch
   flexible endoscopy simulator improves the early part of the learning
   curve in colonoscopy training.
   Method: 12 endoscopy trainees, 10 surgeons and two medical
   gastroenterologists, all with experience in gastroscopy but with no
   specific colonoscopy experience, were randomly assigned to either
   simulator training or to a control group. They all received the same
   theoretical study package and the training group practiced with the
   AccuTouch colonoscopy simulator until a predefined expert level of
   performance was reached. All trainees performed their first ten
   individual colonoscopies described in detail in a separate protocol.
   Results: Trainees in the simulator-trained group performed significantly
   better (P = 0.0011) and managed to reach the cecum in 52\% of their
   cases (vs. 19\% in the control group), and were 4.53 times more likely
   to succeed compared with the controls. Additionally, there was a
   significantly shorter procedure time and less patient discomfort in the
   hands of the simulator-trained group.
   Conclusion: Skills acquired using the AccuTouch simulator transfer well
   into the clinical colonoscopy environment. The results of this trial
   clearly support the plan to integrate simulator training into endoscopic
   education curricula.}},

Abstract = {{Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), a member of the genus
   Nairovirus of the family Bunyaviridae, causes severe disease in humans
   with high rates of mortality. The virus has a tripartite genome composed
   of a small (S), a medium (M) and a large Q RNA segment; the M segment
   encodes the two viral glycoproteins, G(N) and G(C). Whilst relatively
   few full-length M segment sequences are available, it is apparent that
   both G(N) and G(C) may exhibit significant sequence diversity. It is
   unknown whether considerable antigenic differences exist between
   divergent CCHFV strains, or whether there are conserved neutralizing
   epitopes. The M segments derived from viral isolates of a human case of
   CCHF in South Africa (SPU 41/84), an infected tick (Hyalomma marginatum)
   in South Africa (SPU 128/81), a human case in Congo (UG 3010), an
   infected individual in Uzbekistan (U2-2-002) and an infected tick
   (Hyalomma asiaticum) in China (Hy13) were sequenced fully, and the
   glycoproteins were expressed. These novel sequences showed high
   variability in the N-terminal region of G(N) and more modest differences
   in the remainder of G(N) and in G(C). Phylogenetic analyses placed these
   newly identified strains in three of the four previously described M
   segment groups. Studies with a panel of mAbs specific to G(N) and Gc
   indicated that there were significant antigenic differences between the
   M segment groups, although several neutralizing epitopes in both G(N)
   and G(C) were conserved among all strains examined. Thus, the genetic
   diversity exhibited by CCHFV strains results in significant antigenic
   differences that will need to be taken into consideration for vaccine
   development.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a looper controller design for a hot strip finishing mill in
   steel plants. The main function of the looper system is to balance the
   mass flow of the strip by accumulating material in the middle of the
   stands. Another function is to control the strip tension which
   influences the width of the strip. To ensure strip quality, it is very
   important to control the tension of the hot strip finishing mill.
   However, because there is a mutual interaction between the looper angle
   and the strip tension, it is difficult to control the looper system.
   Previous researches examined only the operation of a single stand. But
   it is not sufficient to examine the operation and effect of whole stands
   because the operation is wholly interdependent. In this paper, we
   present a full model of the hot strip finishing mill in order to more
   effectively control strip tension. We propose several control methods
   for the full-stand hot strip finishing mill, denoted as conventional PI,
   PI with cross gain, and coefficient diagram method (MM) PID control. In
   the real plants, there are some problems by using higher order
   controllers such as LQ, LQG and H-infinity. By comparison, the PID
   controller is very simple and easy to apply to all real plants. To that
   end, we present our findings on PID controls and their potential use in
   the hot strip finishing mill.}},

   were given a structured questionnaire to complete and return between
   September and November, 2004. The respondents perceived the increase as
   a welcome measure, long overdue, which would make library books more
   readily available and accessible. There was no gender bias in their
   reaction. It is therefore concluded that fines should be imposed to meet
   the information needs of the users. It is recommended that a periodic
   review of the measure should be carried out and that early completion of
   library automation, especially circulation operations, is essential.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a fully implicit integration scheme is developed for a
   nonisothermal viscoplastic, nonlinear kinematic hardening model.
   Nonlinear dynamic recovery in addition to strain hardening is assumed
   for the evolution of multiple back stresses so that ratcheting and
   mean-stress relaxation can be properly simulated. Temperature dependence
   of back stress evolution is also taken into account in the constitutive
   model. By discretizing a set of such advanced constitutive relations
   using the backward Euler method, a tensor equation is derived and
   linearized to iteratively achieve the implicit integration of
   constitutive variables. The fully implicit integration scheme developed
   is programmed as a subroutine in a finite element code by assuming a
   power-law of dynamic recovery. Nonisothemial numerical examples are then
   given to demonstrate the performance of the implicit integration scheme.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a job shop scheduling problem of assigning preemptive
   tasks with precedence constraints to flexible resources is defined. A
   significant characteristic of this problem is that each task has a
   reward structure that defines the amount of reward based on its
   completion time. The objective is to maximize the total reward in the
   job shop. An optimal solution to this problem cannot be realistically
   obtained, as even significantly simpler problems are strongly NP-hard;
   therefore, a heuristic is proposed to obtain applicable solutions. The
   method is based on calculating (heuristic) penalty indices for each task
   as a function of time in order to allocate tasks to resources. A
   mathematical programming technique is then used to optimally minimize
   the penalty. This approach combines sound management science principles
   in order to emphasize analytical solutions to complicated real-life
   problems. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The study investigated activity of honey towards pathogens
   when grown in media contained honey, or when honey was added to cultures
   after inoculation.
   Material/Methods: 1 - Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Streptococcus
   pyogenes (S. pyogenes), E.coli and Candida albicans (C albicans) were
   cultured into broth containing 10-100\% (wt/v) honey concentrations. 2 -
   Honey was added to broth inoculated with isolates after inoculation. 3 -
   Optimum growth of isolates, therapeutic period of honey, and time after
   addition of honey that showed Optimum effect was measured.
   Results: The optimum growth of E. coli and C albicans was 10 hrs and S.
   aureus was 12 hrs. Honey (30-70\%) prevents growth of all isolates.
   Honey (80\%) inhibited growth of small (1 ul) and large size of inoculum
   (10 ul) of E. coli and S. aureus when added to their cultures during 24
   hrs after inoculation. Honey inhibited growth of C albicans when added
   during 2 to 6 hrs after inoculation. Honey delayed the appearance of
   microbial growth on the plates. Reculturing of specimens collected from
   media that showed no growth after addition of honey yielded recovery
   growth for E. coli and C albicans, and therapeutic period of honey for
   E.coli and S. aureus was 2-24 hrs and for C albicans was 2-6 hrs.
   Conclusions: Honey prevents growth of the isolates and inhibits their
   growth when hone), was added to growing culture. The therapeutic period
   of honey and recovery growth of inhibited isolates necessitates
   adjustment of honey doses according to type of isolate and grade of
   growth.}},

Abstract = {{The successful DVB standard has now evolved into the DVB-S2 standard,
   which promises to bring very significant capacity gains. The main DVB-S2
   feature is its adaptive air interface, where coding and modulation
   techniques are varied flexibly to maximize performance and coverage.
   This article addresses the design of the entire DVB-S2 communication
   chain, considering practical algorithms for coding, modulation,
   predistortion, carrier and SNR estimation, frame synchronization, and
   data recovery. The design complexity is exacerbated by the fact that
   DVB-S2 foresees 28 different coding/modulation pairs, demanding specific
   optimization and variable frame length. The performance achieved
   considering all possible impairments is compared to the ideal
   performance achievable in the Gaussian channel in terms of integral
   degradation, which ranges from 0.4 to 2.5 dB in going from QPSK to
   32-APSK.}},

Abstract = {{Leptin upregulates collagen expression in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs),
   but the possible modulation of other actions has not been elucidated.
   The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and function of
   leptin receptors (ObR) in human HSCs and the biological actions
   regulated by leptin. Exposure of HSCs to leptin resulted in upregulation
   of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) expression. Leptin also
   increased gene expression of the proangiogenic cytokines vascular
   endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoictin-1, and VEGF was also
   upregulated at the protein level. Activated HSCs express ObRb and
   possibly other ObR isoforms. Exposure to leptin increased the tyrosine
   kinase activity of ObR immunoprecipitates and resulted in activation of
   signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. Several signaling
   pathways were activated by leptin in HSCs, including
   extracellular-signal-regulated kinase, Akt, and nuclear factor kappa B,
   the latter being relevant for chemokine expression. Leptin also
   increased the abundance of hypoxia-inducible factor I a, which regulates
   angiogenic gene expression, in an extracellular-signal-regulated kinase-
   and phoshatidylinositol 3-kinase- dependent fashion. In vivo, leptin
   administration induced higher MCP-l expression and more severe
   inflammation in mice after acute liver injury. Conversely, in
   leptin-deficient mice, the increase in MCP-1 messenger RNA and
   mononuclear infiltration was less marked than in wild-type littermates.
   Finally, ObR expression colocalized with VEGF and a-smooth muscle actin
   after induction of fibrosis in rats. In conclusion, ObR activation in
   HSCs leads to increased expression of proinflammatory and proangiogenic
   cytokines, indicating a complex role for leptin in the regulation of the
   liver wound-healing response. Supplementary material for this article

Abstract = {{The folding, transport and modification of recombinant proteins in the
   constitutive secretory pathway of eukaryotic cell expression systems are
   reported to be a bottleneck in their production. We have utilised a
   proteomic approach to investigate the processes catalysed by proteins
   constituting the secretory pathway to further our understanding of those
   processes involved in high-level antibody secretion. We used GS-NS0 cell
   populations differing in qmAb to prepare enriched microsome fractions
   from each cell population at mid-exponential growth phase. These were
   analysed by 2-D PAGE to characterise the microsome protein component and
   test the hypothesis that bottlenecks in recombinant protein synthesis
   exist in these compartments, which are alleviated in high producers by
   the up-regulation of key secretory pathway proteins. Proteins whose
   abundance changed in a statistically significant manner with increasing
   qmAb were involved in a range of cellular functions: energy metabolism,
   mAb folding/assembly, cytoskeletal organisation and protein turnover.
   Amongst these were BiP and PDI, chaperones resident in the ER that
   interact with nascent immunoglobulins during their folding/assembly.
   However, our results suggest that there are diverse mechanisms by which
   these cells achieve qmAb. The results imply that cell-engineering
   strategies for improving qmAb should target proteins associated with
   altered functional phenotype identified in this study.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to assess the potential of polymeric micelles
   to modify the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of cyclosporine A
   (CsA). Drug-loaded methoxy poly(ethylene
   oxide)-b-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PEO-b-PCL) micellar solutions in
   isotonic medium were prepared and administered intravenously to healthy
   Sprague-Dawley rats. Blood and tissues were harvested and assayed for
   CsA, and resultant pharmacokinetic parameters and tissue distribution of
   CsA in its polymeric micellar formulation were compared to its
   commercially available intravenous formulation (Sandimmune (R)). In the
   pharmacokinetic assessment, a 6.1 fold increase in the area under the
   blood concentration versus time curve (AUC) was observed for CsA when
   given as polymeric micellar formulation as compared to Sandimmune (R).
   The volume of distribution and clearance of CsA as PEO-b-PCL formulation
   were observed to be 10.0 and 7.6 fold lower, respectively, compared to
   the commercial formulation. No significant differences in t(1/2) or MRT
   could be detected. In the biodistribution study, analysis of tissue
   samples indicated that the mean AUC of CsA in polymeric micelles was
   lower in liver, spleen and kidney (1.5, 2.1 and 1.4-fold, respectively).
   Similar to the pharmacokinetic study in these rats, the polymeric
   micellar formulation gave rise to 5.7 and 4.9-fold increase in the AUC
   of CsA in blood and plasma, respectively. Our results show that
   PEO-b-PCL micelles can effectively solubilize CsA, at the same time
   confining CsA to the blood circulation and restricting its access to
   tissues such as kidney, perhaps limiting the onset of toxicity. (c) 2005

   the EU has shown interest in expanding its trading system to include

   this paper, we briefly value of the implications of the Emissions

   with trade to illustrate the effect of a trade bait put in place by the
   EU, first, when it is fully binding and second, when there are countries
   that call act to arbitrage both markets (e.g., Japan). We also look at
   the possibilities of using harmonization frameworks to control trade, as

   We show that it is highly unlikely that a trade barrier will increase
   the use of emission reduction (and decreased use of sinks), and that,
   parlicularly lit the likely case that Canada will import credits, trade
   barriers will actually increase the use of sinks. We do find, however,
   that the use of discounting could serve as a possible policy alternative
   to increase the use of EU reductions, while decreasing the quantitly of
   Canadian sink credits.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Assess in vivo O-demethylation activity in the first months
   of life. Methods: Time-concentration profiles of tramadol (M) and
   O-demethyl tramadol (M1) in plasma and urine were simultaneously
   collected in the first 24 h of continuous intravenous tramadol
   administration in neonates and young infants. M and M1 were determined
   by high performance liquid chromatography. Correlations between
   perinatal characteristics {[}postnatal age (PNA), postmenstrual age
   (PMA)] and the contribution of metabolites (M, M1) to overall tramadol
   elimination and to the plasma and urine log M/M1 were calculated.
   Results: Plasma samples were available in 20/29 and complete 24-h urine
   collections were available in 25/29 neonates (25-53 weeks PMA). Mean
   plasma log M/M1 value (> 4 h, n=86) was 0.8 (SD 0.4). A significant
   correlation between plasma log M/M1 and PMA (r=-0.73, P < 0.0001) and
   PNA (r=-0.58, P < 0.005) was observed. In a multiple regression model,
   only PMA remained an independent variable. Mean urine log M/M1 was 0.94
   (SD 0.7). Significant correlations of the urine log M/M1 ratio with PMA
   (r=-0.73, P < 0.0001) and PNA (r=-0.56, P=0.0035) were observed. In a
   multiple regression model with the urine log M/M1 ratio as dependent
   variable, only PMA remained an independent variable. The maturational
   half-life of the log M/M1 ratio in early neonatal life in the age range
   evaluated is about 12-16 weeks without plateau. Conclusions:
   O-demethylation activity was already observed in early neonatal life. A
   significant correlation with PMA was documented, but PMA can only
   partially explain the observed variability in O-demethylation activity.
   Polymorphism therefore likely already contributes to the interindividual
   variability observed in neonates.}},

Abstract = {{The Central Outer Tracker (COT) is a large axial drift chamber in the
   Collider Detector at Fermilab operating with a gas mixture that is 50/50
   argon/ethane with an admixture of 1.7\% isopropanol. In its first two
   years of operation the COT showed unexpected aging with the worst parts
   of the chamber experiencing a gain loss of similar to 50\% for an
   accumulated charge of similar to 35 mC/cm. By monitoring the pulse
   height of hits on good tracks, it was possible to determine the gain as
   a function of time and location in the chamber. In addition, the
   currents of the high voltage supplies gave another monitor of chamber
   gain and its dependence on the charge deposition rate. The aging was
   worse on the exhaust end of the chamber consistent with polymer buildup
   as the gas flows through the chamber. The distribution in azimuth
   suggests that aging is enhanced at lower temperatures, but other factors
   such as gas flow patterns may be involved. Elemental and molecular
   analysis of the sense wires found a coating that is mostly carbon and
   hydrogen with a small amount of oxygen; no silicon or other contaminants
   were identified. High resolution electron microscope pictures of the
   wire surface show that the coating is smooth with small sub-micron
   nodules. In the course of working with the chamber gas system, we
   discovered a small amount of O-2 is enough to reverse the aging.
   Operating the chamber with similar to 100 ppm of O-2 reversed almost two
   years of gain loss in less than 10 days while accumulating <= 2 mC/cm.}},

Abstract = {{Intestinal metaplasia (IM) is a preneoplastic lesion of the stomach in
   which there is transdifferentiation of the gastric mucosa to an
   intestinal phenotype. The caudal-related homeobox gene CDX2 encodes an
   intestine-specific transcription factor crucial for the regulation of
   proliferation and differentiation of intestinal cells. In addition, CDX2
   is involved in the induction of IM in the stomach. The aim of this study
   was to access the putative involvement of OCT-1 in the induction of CDX2
   expression de novo in gastric mucosa leading to the onset of IM. OCT-1
   protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 31 biopsies
   with chronic gastritis, 15 biopsies with foci of IM and adjacent gastric
   mucosa and 42 gastric carcinomas. Furthermore, we evaluated OCT-1
   binding by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and activation of the
   CDX2 promoter by co-transfecting a CDX2 promoter/reporter construct with
   an OCT-1 expression vector in two gastric carcinoma cell lines, GP220
   and MKN45. Our results show that OCT-1 is expressed in chronic
   gastritis, particularly when it is adjacent to IM and is expressed in
   87\% of IM foci. Furthermore, 74\% of the gastric carcinomas were
   positive for OCT-1 and a strong association was observed between OCT-1
   expression and intestinal-type carcinoma. We identified that OCT-1 binds
   to the CDX2 promoter, although we could not see a transactivation effect
   in gastric carcinoma cell lines. In conclusion, we observed increased
   OCT-1 expression in IM and in intestinal gastric carcinomas and
   identified the capacity of OCT-1 to bind to the CDX2 promoter, although
   we could not demonstrate a direct effect of OCT-1 in the transactivation
   of CDX2. Copyright (c) 2005 Pathological Society of Great Britain and

Abstract = {{Purpose. To assess the feasibility of endovascular aortic repair (EVAR)
   on patients presenting with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)
   in a teaching hospital, and to compare there post-operative outcomes
   with contemporaneous patients treated with open repair (OR).
   Methods. A series of consecutive of patients presenting ruptured AAA
   with retro/intraperitoneal haematoma were included in the study. EVAR
   was attempted whenever possible. In all other cases (severe haemodynamic
   instability, adverse anatomy, device unavailability), ruptured AAA were
   treated by OR.
   Results. Thirty-seven patients were enrolled between January 2001 and
   July 2004. Seventeen (46\%) patients were treated using adapted designed
   aortoiliac endografts (eight bifurcated, eight aorto-uniiliac, one iliac
   extension). Twenty (54\%) patients unfit for EVAR because of severe
   haemodynamic instability (n = 8), adverse anatomical configuration (n =
   7), or unavailability of an appropriate endograft (n=5) were treated by
   OR. Twenty-seven (73\%) had a retrospective suitable anatomy for EVAR.
   Three early conversions from EVAR to OR were performed. Blood loss,
   operating time, and intensive care stay were significantly decreased in
   EVAR patients (respectively: 156 min +/- 60, 1520 ml +/- 1175, 3 days
   for EVAR; vs. 222 min +/- 82, 3075 ml +/- 1750,13 days for OS; P <.01).
   The 30-day mortality rate was 23.5\% for EVAR vs. 50\% for OR (P =
   0.09).
   Conclusion. EVAR of ruptured AAA is feasible for selected patients based
   on haemodynamic and morphologic criteria, and should be associated with
   improved immediate outcomes as compared with OR. These results should be
   tempered by the fact that these patients have heavy comorbodities which
   explains the absence of difference in mid-term mortality rates between
   the two groups, but should also encourage surgical institutions that are
   managing such life-threatening emergencies to introduce EVAR as part of
   their therapeutic arsenal for ruptured AAA.}},

Abstract = {{This work reviews the procedures involved in the conversion of the
   petrographic characterization data of blended coals into weight
   percentages of the single coals in the blends, the selection of the most
   suitable parameter for describing the density of the coals being
   critical. First, the fundamentals of the volume-to-weight transformation
   of the petrographic data were developed by means of mathematical
   formulae. This part of the procedure highlighted the need to use a
   density value adapted to the resolving power of the optical microscope.
   It was found that mercury penetration at 5 MPa, as determined by mercury
   porosimetry, was best suited for this purpose. A literature survey of
   published coal density data revealed that the use of correlations
   between coal density and rank was not an accurate enough procedure to
   deal with the relatively low corrections involved in the transformation
   of petrographic data. In the end, three binary blends were prepared from
   six carefully selected coals and polished particulate blocks of these
   blends were petrographically analysed to determine their compositions on
   a volume per cent basis. The best fit of these volume percentages with
   the weight percentages used in the formulation of the blends was found
   for a density correction based on mercury penetration at 5 MPa, in
   agreement with the empirical analysis.}},

   thickness was cut to strips and joined end-to-end with Gelatin Resorcin
   Formaldehyde (GRF) or bioglue. All combinations of glutaraldehyde and
   albumin produced bioglue with satisfactory shear and tensile strength,
   which were better than GRF. A needle hole was created in ventral
   abdominal aorta of 9 (6 treatment, 3 control) crossbred dogs and then
   the glues were applied to prevent the oozing of blood. After 6 weeks,
   the animals were sacrificed for histopathological study of puncture
   site. No significant difference was noticed comparing the intima, media
   and serosa layers between the treatment and controls. No hemorrhage,
   acute inflammation, marked fibrosis, necrosis or granulomatous

Abstract = {{We discuss a specific quasifree mechanism (QFM) of the ionization
   processes. which requires only small momentum transfer to the nucleus.
   The QFM mechanism is important in the kinematical regions where the
   two-electron system can absorb a photon without participation of the
   nucleus. The QFM leads to the complicated shape of the double
   photoionization spectrum curve. providing the breakdown of the
   nonrelativistic high energy asymptotic of the double-to single
   photoionization ratio. Calculation of the QFM contribution requires a
   consistent theoretical approach. Use of oversimplified approximations
   leads to misleading results. In certain kinematical regions the QFM
   provides the leading contribution, and thus the results obtained without
   inclusion of QFM are erroneous. Experimental detection of QFM is a
   complicated. but interesting problem.}},

Abstract = {{New nonlocal symmetries and conservation laws are derived for Maxwell's
   equations in 3 + 1 dimensional Minkowski space using a covariant system
   of joint vector potentials for the electromagnetic tensor field and its
   dual. A key property of this system, as well as of this class of new
   symmetries and conservation laws, is their invariance under the duality
   transformation that exchanges the electromagnetic field with its dual.
   (In contrast the standard potential system using a single vector
   potential is not duality-invariant.) The nonlocal symmetries of
   Maxwell's equations come from an explicit classification of all
   symmetries of a certain natural geometric form admitted by the joint
   potential system in Lorentz gauge. In addition to scaling and
   duality-rotation symmetries, and the well-known Poincare and dilation
   symmetries which involve homothetic Killing vectors, the classification
   yields new geometric symmetries involving Killing-Yano tensors related
   to rotations/boosts and inversions. The nonlocal conservation laws of
   Maxwell's equations are constructed from these geometric symmetries by
   applying a conserved current formula that uses the joint potentials and
   directly generates conservation laws from any (local or nonlocal)
   symmetries of Maxwell's equations. This formula is shown to arise
   through a series of mappings that relate, respectively,
   symmetries/adjoint-symmetries of the joint potential system and
   adjoint-symmetries/symmetries of Maxwell's equations. The mappings are
   derived as by-products of the study of cohomology of closed one-forms
   and two-forms locally constructed from the electromagnetic field and its
   derivatives to any finite order for all solutions of Maxwell's
   equations. In particular it is shown that the only nontrivial cohomology
   consists of the electromagnetic field (two-form) itself as well as its
   dual (two-form), and that this two-form cohomology is killed by the
   introduction of corresponding potentials.}},

Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This document outlines a practical strategy for achieving an
   observationally based quantification of direct climate forcing by
   anthropogenic aerosols. The strategy involves a four-step program for
   shifting the current assumption-laden estimates to an increasingly
   empirical basis using satellite observations coordinated with suborbital
   remote and in situ measurements and with chemical transport models.
   Conceptually, the problem is framed as a need for complete global
   mapping of four parameters: clear-sky aerosol optical depth 8, radiative
   efficiency per unit optical depth E, fine-mode fraction of optical depth
   f(f) and the anthropogenic fraction of the fine a(f). The first three
   parameters can be retrieved from satellites, but correlative, suborbital
   measurements are required for quantifying the aerosol properties that
   control E, for validating the retrieval of f(f), and for partitioning
   fine-mode delta between natural and anthropogeniccomponents. The
   satellite focus is on the ``A-Train,{''} a constellation of six
   spacecraft that will fly in formation from about 2005 to 2008. Key
   satellite instruments for this report are the Moderate Resolution
   Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Clouds and the Earth's Radiant
   Energy System (CERES) radiometers on Aqua, the Ozone Monitoring,
   Instrument (OMI) radiometer on Aura, the Polarization and Directionality
   of Earth's Reflectances (POLDER) polarimeter on the Polarization and
   Anistropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Sciences Coupled with
   Observations from a Lidar (PARASOL), and the Cloud and Aerosol Lider
   with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) lidar on the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar
   and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO). This strategy
   is offered as an framework-subject to improvement over time-for
   scientists around the world to participate in the A-Train opportunity.
   It is a specific implementation of the Progressive Aerosol Retrieval and
   Assimilation Global Observing Network (PARAGON) program, presented
   earlier in this journal, which identified the integration of diverse
   data as the central challenge to progress in quantifying global-scale
   aerosol effects. By designing a strategy around this need for
   integration, we develop recommendations for both satellite data
   interpretation and correlative suborbital activities that represent, in
   many respects, departures from current practice.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of rearing system
   (mixed or single-sex) on performance and carcass quality of entire male
   and female pigs slaughtered at around 90 or 115 kg live weight. We also
   studied the combined effect of live weight and dietary supplement of raw
   potato starch (RPS) on technological meat quality for both sexes, and
   boar taint compounds in entire male pigs. Furthermore, we investigated
   pre-slaughter routines (pen-wise or mixing with unfamiliar pigs) and
   sexual maturity. A total of 408 growing/ finishing pigs were included in
   this two-year study. Performance did not differ significantly between
   entire male and female pigs irrespective of rearing system, except for
   daily weight gain in the interval from 90 kg to slaughter. Mixed pigs
   had significantly higher daily weight gain in this interval than
   single-sex pigs. Entire male pigs had higher carcass lean meat content
   than female pigs (1.6 percentage units). Technological meat quality
   differed only slightly between the sexes. Females reared in mixed pens
   were sexually more mature than female pigs reared in single-sex pens,
   and mature females had higher growth rate but lower meat content in
   carcasses than immature females. In contrast, female contact did not
   influence sexual maturity of entire male pigs. Mixing entire male pigs
   with unfamiliar pigs at the abattoir resulted in more damaged skin
   compared with pen-wise keeping, whereas female pigs had almost no
   visible skin damage. We therefore recommend that entire male pigs are
   not mixed with unfamiliar pigs during transport and at the abattoir,
   because of fighting and subsequent skin damage. The levels of skatole in
   fat were significantly lower in high-weight entire male pigs fed RPS
   compared to high-weight pigs without RPS. Androstenone levels in fat
   were high in all groups.}},

Abstract = {{The continuum notions of effective mechanical quantities as well as the
   conditions that give meaningful deformation processes for homogenization
   problems with large deformations are reviewed. A continuum
   homogenization model is presented and recast as a Lagrangian-based
   approach for heterogeneous media that allows for an extension to
   discrete systems simulated via molecular dynamics (MD). A novel
   constitutive relation for the effective stress is derived so that the
   proposed Lagrangian-based approach can be used for the determination of
   the ``stress-deformation{''} behavior of particle systems. The paper is
   concluded with a careful comparison between the proposed method and the
   Parrinello-Rahman approach to the determination of the
   ``stress-deformation{''} behavior for MD systems. When compared with the
   Parrinello-Rahman method, the proposed approach clearly delineates under
   what conditions the Parrinello-Rahman scheme is valid. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Dirofilaria immitis is a worldwide filarial nematode causing licartworm
   disease in dogs and cats. Several mosquito Species, Which are able to
   feed both on humans and animals, can transmit this parasite.
   Inflammatory progression of host tissues induced by parasites are
   mediated by several molecules, including nitric oxide (NO), which
   usually exerts deleterious effects on parasites and occasionally on the
   host. We analyze the in vitro effect of total D. immitis adult worm
   somatic antigens on naive rat alveolar macrophage NO production and
   further separation of parasite proteins to define specific D. immitis
   somatic molecules influencing host cell NO secretion. Additionally, we
   address the possible influence of Wolbachia spp. on the in vitro
   production of NO by macrophages. Our results demonstrate that D. immitis
   adult worm Soluble antigens are able to specifically induce NO
   production from host macrophages. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this
   effect is due to nematode antigens rather than to defined components
   (LPS and metabolic molecules) derived from its enclosymbiont, Wolbachia
   spp. In addition, we were able to isolate and identify one of the
   parasite specific components from the DiSo extract, denominated DiID35.3
   and Putatively belonging to the Immunoglobulin Superfamily Protein (ISP)
   group, triggering NO release from macrophages in a dose-dependent and
   specific manner. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A 45 degrees eight flat bladed swirler was investigated with eight

   expansion from the swirler discharge duct (diameter d) to the combustor
   cylinder (diameter D) with an expansion ratio D/d of 1.84. The axial
   swirler and the dump flow expansion were typical of the size used in
   industrial low NOx swirler combustors with 60\% of the combustion air
   flow through the swirler. The axial swirler had a 25 mm diameter central
   hub that was used to house a central fuel injector with eight radial
   outward injector holes. The results showed that with outer swirler wall
   fuel injection, ultra low NOx emissions were obtained with natural gas
   and propane at 600 K and 740 K inlet temperatures and atmospheric
   pressure combustion. Central fuel injection was shown to have superior
   flame stability and inferior NOx emissions and was a good location for a

Abstract = {{White-coat hypertension is defined by the coexistence of persistently
   high office blood pressure (BP) with normal self-measured or ambulatory
   blood pressure. The prognostic impact of white-coat hypertension is a
   subject of debate. Cardiovascular morbidity seems to be lower in
   white-coat hypertension than in ambulatory hypertension, and, according
   to some but not all studies, is not dissimilar between white-coat
   hypertension and clinical normotension. In a large collaborative study
   including individual data from four prospective cohort studies, the
   incidence of stroke tended to increase in the white-coat hypertension
   group in the long run, crossing the hazard curve of the ambulatory
   hypertension by the ninth year of follow-up. These data raise the
   hypothesis, to be tested in future studies, that white-coat hypertension
   might not be a benign condition for stroke in the long term. Further
   studies are needed in order to: (1) test whether white-coat hypertension
   is really a benign condition for stroke in the long term; (2) compare,
   in patients with white-coat hypertension, a regimen based on life-style
   measures without drugs and a standard regimen consisting of life-style
   measures with the possible addition of drugs. On the basis of current
   evidence, it is reasonable to suggest a treatment based on life-style
   measures in the low-risk stratum of patients with white-coat
   hypertension under the conditions of correct definition, absence of
   comorbid conditions and target-organ damage, and adequate follow-up

Abstract = {{Between late January and early February 1997, an outbreak of plague,
   associated with cervical lymphadenopathy and fever, occurred in the
   Jordanian village of Azraq ad-Druze, which lies about 50 km west of the
   border with Saudi Arabia. The 12 cases who presented at hospital were
   initially assumed to have tularaemia, and all were successfully treated
   with gentamicin. When, however, their sera were tested for evidence of
   Yersinia pestis or Francisella tularensis infection (using
   haemagglutination, enzyme immuno-assays for specific IgM or the F1
   antigen of Y. pestis, and micro-agglutination tests), all 12 were found
   to have anti-Y. pestis IgM. Three dogs shot near the Saudi Arabian
   border were also found seropositive for antibodies against Y. pestis.
   Eleven of the 12 patients reported that, 2 - 4 days before their
   symptoms appeared, they had eaten the meat cut from the carcass of the

Title = {{Global height datum unification: a new approach in gravity potential

Abstract = {{The problem of ``global height datum unification{''} is solved in the
   gravity potential space based on: (1) high-resolution local gravity
   field modeling, (2) geocentric coordinates of the reference benchmark,
   and (3) a known value of the geoid's potential. The high-resolution
   local gravity field model is derived based on a solution of the
   fixed-free two-boundary-value problem of the Earth's gravity field using
   (a) potential difference values (from precise leveling), (b) modulus of
   the gravity vector (from gravimetry), (c) astronomical longitude and
   latitude (from geodetic astronomy and/or combination of (GNSS) Global
   Navigation Satellite System observations with total station
   measurements), (d) and satellite altimetry. Knowing the height of the
   reference benchmark in the national height system and its geocentric
   GNSS coordinates, and using the derived high-resolution local gravity
   field model, the gravity potential value of the zero point of the height
   system is computed. The difference between the derived gravity potential
   value of the zero point of the height system and the geoid's potential
   value is computed. This potential difference gives the offset of the
   zero point of the height system from geoid in the ``potential space{''},
   which is transferred into ``geometry space{''} using the transformation
   formula derived in this paper. The method was applied to the computation
   of the offset of the zero point of the Iranian height datum from the
   geoid's potential value W-0=62636855.8 m(2)/s(2). According to the
   geometry space computations, the height datum of Iran is 0.09 m below
   the geoid.}},

Abstract = {{Although the prevalence of insulin resistance (IR) and compensatory
   hyperinsulinemia (CH) is increased in patients with nonalcoholic fatty
   liver disease, the role of IR/CH in regulation of hepatic fat content in
   healthy volunteers with normal concentrations of alanine transaminase
   (ALT) has not been defined. To address this issue, hepatic fat content
   was quantified by ultrasound in 69 (30 men, 39 women) healthy
   individuals, without known risk factors for liver disease and with
   plasma ALT concentrations of less than 30 U/L. Experimental variables
   quantified included body mass index, waist circumference, systolic and
   diastolic blood pressures, and fasting plasma glucose, fasting plasma
   insulin (FPI), and lipid concentrations. Subjects were classified as
   having no (55\%), mild (27\%), or moderate to severe (18\%) hepatic
   steatosis on the basis of the ultrasound results. Statistically
   significant (P <.05-.001) correlations (Spearman rho values) existed
   between liver fat content and ALT (0.26), body mass index (0.52), waist
   circumference (0.50), systolic blood pressure (0.28), diastolic blood
   pressure (0.27), fasting plasma glucose (0.47), FPI (0.56),
   triglycerides (0.30), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-0.35).
   Multivariate general discriminant analysis and multiple linear
   regression analysis indicated that FPI was the only independent
   predictor (P <.001) of both liver fat content and ALT concentrations.
   Fasting plasma insulin (a surrogate estimate of IR/CH) predicts hepatic
   fat content and ALT in healthy volunteers with normal transaminase
   concentrations, independently of the other anthropometric and metabolic
   variables measured. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   Prototype and instance manifestations get a semi-qualitative

   in a new approach, suited to human diagnostician's conceptual view. The
   Computer Aided Knowledge Elicitation (CAKE) tool proposed copes with

Abstract = {{Angular momentum loss to circumbinary gas provides a possible mechanism
   for overcoming the ``last parsec'' problem and allowing the most massive
   black hole binaries formed from galactic mergers to coalesce. Here we
   show that if gas disks also catalyze the merger of the somewhat lower
   mass binaries detectable with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
   (LISA), then there may be a purely gravitational wave signature of the
   role of gas in the form of a small but finite eccentricity just prior to
   merger. Numerical simulations suggest that eccentricity, excited by the
   interaction between the binary and surrounding gas disk, is only
   partially damped during the final phase of gravitational
   radiation-driven inspiral. We estimate a typical eccentricity at 1 week
   prior to coalescence of e approximate to 0.01. Higher terminal
   eccentricities, which can approach e 0: 1, are possible if the binary
   has an extreme mass ratio. The detection of even a small eccentricity
   prior to merger by LISA provides a possible discriminant between
   gas-driven inspirals and those effected by stellar processes.}},

Abstract = {{Driven by growing international demand for shrimp and stagnating catches
   of wild shrimp, the shrimp aquaculture industry has grown remarkably
   over the past two decades. Initial hopes that farmed shrimp could
   provide an environmentally benign alternative to over-exploited wild
   stocks have, however, proven disappointing. Although global growth has
   been steady, the industry has experienced dramatic production crashes at
   national and sub-national scales associated with severe environmental
   damage. From a systems perspective, the industry is prone to exceed and
   consume its environmental carrying capacity, resulting in boom and bust
   patterns of development. In this paper we describe a dynamic commodity
   system model built to examine boom and bust in the shrimp aquaculture
   industry. Experiments with the model suggest that a policy that taxes
   the industry and rebates proceeds to licensed producers may help shift
   the system toward sustainability. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{1. Water velocity plays an important role in shaping plant community
   structure in flowing waters although few authors have yet attempted to
   explain the adaptation of plants to flow.
   2. We aimed to test two hypotheses, that: (i) some emergent macrophytes
   reconfigure their shoot distribution in fast currents and form clumps,
   and (ii) the shape and morphology of such clumps minimises drag caused
   by the current. The study focuses on three emergent macrophytes that
   co-occur along a gradient of water velocity.
   3. The species showed a clear zonation in response to water depth and
   current velocity. Phragmites australis occupied shallower and more
   slowly flowing water than Typha angustifolia and Zizania latifolia,
   which had similar preferences.
   4. Both T. angustifolia and Z. latifolia shoots were more clumped at
   high velocity, whereas they were more randomly distributed at low flow
   or in stagnant water. Because of the low shoot density, water flowed
   more easily through T. angustifolia clumps, whereas Z. latifolia clumps
   had a high shoot density and large amounts of trapped litter, causing
   stagnant water in the centre of the clump. The clumps of Z. latifolia
   with a high density of shoots were longer and narrower than T.
   angustifolia clumps. Phragmites australis was less tolerant of flow than
   the other two species and large amounts of litter trapped in the clumps
   impaired flow.
   5. The shoot distribution of both T. angustifolia and Z. latifolia is
   reconfigured at high flow and this minimises drag on the clumps.}},

   imaging revealed that the tumor was localized to a soft-tissue
   attenuation mass behind the CP cavity in the right thorax, but did not
   infiltrate the CP cavity. A total dose of 40 Gy was administered to the
   area that included the PET-positive lesion, instead of including the
   entire CP cavity in the radiation field. Although computed tomography
   (CT) showed a residual mass, no FDG uptake was indicated by FDG-PET
   imaging performed just after the end of radiotherapy, and additional
   irradiation was not performed. No sign of relapse was found by FDG-PET
   imaging 3 months later. FDG-PET imaging was useful for both the planning

   among 74 families were examined for (R)- and (S)-HNL activities using
   the method. We discovered that homogenate of leaves of Baliospermum
   montanum shows (S)HNL activity, while leaves and seeds from Passiflora
   edulis, and seeds from Eriobotrya japonica, Chaenomles sinensis, Sorbus
   anucuparia, Prunus mume, and Prunus persica show (R)-HNL activity.
   Partially purified (R)HNLs from Passiflora edulis and Eriobotrya
   japonica acted not only on benzaldehyde but also on aliphatic ketone.
   The enantiomeric excess of (R)-methylpropylketone cyanohydrin
   synthesized from 2-pentanone using homogenate from leaves of Passiflora
   edulis was 87.0\%, and that of (R)-mandelonitrile synthesized by
   homogenate from seeds of Eriobotrya japonica was 85.0\%.}},

Abstract = {{A gas particle partitioner (GPP, US patent 6,761,752 B2) that allows
   highly efficient separation of gas and particles with no effect on the
   thermodynamic conditions and substantially no change of the composition
   of the gas has been developed. The GPP is a coaxial arrangement with
   inner and outer electrode. It utilizes a corona discharge to
   electrically charge the particles and a strong electric field in a
   separate unit to take them out of the sample flow. Several measures were
   taken to minimize an effect of the corona discharge on the gas
   composition.
   The GPP is designed such that when switched on, the sample flow is
   particle free, whereas when switched off, the sample flow contains a
   representative sample of the aerosol. The GPP as described in this
   manuscript was designed to meet the requirements for precise artifact
   correction with particle mass concentration monitors, such as the TEOM.
   This paper focuses on the gas particle separation efficiency of the
   instrument. The separation efficiency was determined for both, (ultra-)
   fine and coarse particles. The (ultra-) fine particles were generated
   with diameters ranging from 18 to 255 nm of polystyrene latex particles
   and their size distributions measured with a scanning mobility particle
   sizer (SNIPS). Coarse particles with diameters between 4.5 and 10.7 mu m
   were generated from a sodium chloride solution and characterized with an
   aerodynamic particle sizer (APS) and a tapered element oscillating
   microbalance (TEOM). The investigations showed that the separation
   efficiency was very near 100\% for all particles with diameters larger
   than 25 nm, whereas it decreased for smaller diameters. Particles of
   size 18 nm were separated from the gas flow with an efficiency of
   approximately 97\%. Along with near 100\% separation efficiency, the
   additional gas concentrations were 42 ppbV for O-3 and 15 ppbV for NO2.

Abstract = {{Background and Objective: To investigate which method of ankle-arm index
   (AAI) measurement in terms of selected arteries and blood pressure
   devices yields the highest reproducibility.
   Study Design and Setting: In this cross-sectional study, duplicate AAI
   measurements were obtained at the right and left side in 320
   postmenopausal women. Analyses were done as proposed by Bland and Altman
   and intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated.
   Results: The mean and standard deviation (SD) of the first and second
   systolic blood pressure (SBP) measurement separately did not differ from
   the mean and SD of the duplicate SBP measurements averaged. Coefficients
   of repeatability and intraclass correlation coefficients were comparable
   when the ankle SBP was measured in the posterior tibial artery or
   dorsalis pedis artery. Coefficients of repeatability as well as the
   intraclass correlation were better when the SBP in the brachial artery
   was measured with Doppler than with Dinamap.
   Conclusions: To achieve the best reproducibility and smallest systematic
   difference in the AAI, single SBP measurements should be obtained by
   Doppler in the brachial artery, posterior tibial artery and dorsalis
   pedis artery. The AAI should be calculated for each foot separately by
   dividing the highest ankle SBP by the highest arm SBP. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Stricter and ever increasing environmental legislations and demand for
   higher quality products are the driving forces for the refiner in an
   attempt to characterise the refining streams on the molecular basis. The
   objective of this work is to develop a new methodology to interrelate
   the bulk properties and molecular information of the refining streams in
   order for refiners to look at the contribution of each molecular group
   on the properties of the refining streams.
   The molecular information of a particular refining stream is presented
   in the form of MTHS (molecular type homologous series) matrix
   representation {[}Peng, B., 1999. Molecular modelling of petroleum
   processes. Ph.D. Thesis, UMIST]. To enhance the accuracy and usability
   of the method, structural contribution of each isomer on various
   properties such as octane number, and reid vapour pressure, etc. are
   considered. Structural lumping rules are then applied to obtain the
   physical properties of each homologous series. Databases are set up for
   the properties and molecular information of typical refining streams.
   Automatic selection of sample matrices through linear combination is
   used to predict new composition matrices. The methodology is illustrated
   for refining streams with gasoline range hydrocarbons. The properties
   predicted based on the new methodology proves to be within 5-6\% error

Abstract = {{We propose novel cooperative transmission protocols for delay-limited
   coherent fading channels consisting of N (half-duplex and
   single-antenna) partners and one cell site. In our work, we
   differentiate between the relay, cooperative broadcast (down-link), and
   cooperative multiple-access (CMA) (up-link) channels. The proposed
   protocols are evaluated using Zheng-Tse diversity-multiplexing tradeoff.
   For the relay channel, we investigate two classes of cooperation
   schemes; namely, amplify and forward AF protocols and decode and forward
   (DF) protocols. For the first class, we establish an upper bound on the
   achievable diversity-multiplexing tradeoff with a single relay. We then
   construct a new AF protocol that achieves this upper bound. The proposed
   algorithm is then extended to the general case with (N - 1) relays where
   it is shown to outperform the space-time coded protocol of Laneman and
   Wornell without requiring decoding/encoding at the relays. For the class
   of DF protocols, we develop a dynamic decode and forward (DDF) protocol
   that achieves the optimal tradeoff for multiplexing gains 0 <= r <= 1/N.
   Furthermore, with a single relay, the DDF protocofis shown to dominate
   the class of AF protocols for all multiplexing gains. The superiority of
   the DDF protocol is shown to be more significant in the cooperative
   broadcast channel. The situation is reversed in the CMA channel where we
   propose a new AF protocol that achieves the optimal tradeoff for all
   multiplexing gains. A distinguishing feature of the proposed protocols
   in the three scenarios is that they do not rely on orthogonal subspaces,
   allowing for a more efficient use of resources. In fact, using our
   results one can argue that the suboptimality of previously proposed
   protocols stems from their use of orthogonal subspaces rather than the
   half-duplex constraint.}},

   3,5-dithio-2,7-dimethyl-{[}1,2,4]-triazepine in solution, in

   percentages. The comparison of the obtained measures to the calculated
   allowed absorption transitions, using ZINDO/S package, reveals the
   coexistence of all the tautomeric forms in aprotic polar solution with a
   high dominance of the dithione form. The solute-water hydrogen bond,
   which seems to be of 1:n-type, favours the dithiol and monothiol
   conformers to the detriment of the dithione one. Further experimental
   investigations lead to the result that standing at ambient Laboratory

   standing at indirect sunlight shifts the tautomeric equilibrium away

Abstract = {{The objective of this work is identifying changes in the collagen bands
   in heated and rehydrated dentine. We use bovine dentine slices that were
   heated in oven between 100 and 300 degrees C. The sample hydration was
   conducted in sodium chloride solution at 0.9 wt.\%; the spectra were
   acquired by a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer in the spectral
   range of 4000-400 cm(-1). Our results show a temperature range (T <= 175
   degrees C where the dentinal collagen can be partially denatured and
   reverted to initial conformation; a second region (175 degrees C< T< 225
   degrees C) where this process occurs partially and a third region (T>
   225 degrees C) where the collagen is denatured and no reversion is
   observed after rehydration. This work identifies an important
   characteristic that dentinal collagen can assume when the tissue is
   heated and rehydrated; these results indicate the denaturation
   temperature of dentinal collagen to be near 175-200 degrees C. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{We have developed a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen for patients
   with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) undergoing alternative donor
   transplants, which includes. udarabine (120 mg/m(2)), cyclophosphamide
   (1200 mg/m(2)) and antithymocyte globulin (7.5 mg/ kg).
   Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine
   and methotrexate. We have enrolled 38 SAA patients in this trial: median
   age of 14 (3-37) years, transplanted from unrelated (n=33) or family
   mismatched (n=5) donors, with unmanipulated marrow (n=36) or peripheral
   blood (n=2). Seven patients (18\%) had evidence of graft failure, 11\%
   developed grade II-III acute GvHD and 27\% developed chronic GvHD. The
   actuarial 2-year survival is 73\%, with a median follow-up of 621 days.
   Younger patients (<= 14 years) had a lower risk of rejection (5\%) and
   improved actuarial survival (84\%). Causes of death were infections
   (n=3), graft failure (n=2), Epstein-Barr virus lymphoma (n=2) and
   hemorrhage (n=2). In conclusion, the actuarial 2-year survival is
   encouraging in young SAA patients receiving a radiation-free
   conditioning regimen. The significant risk of graft failure in patients
   15 years or older may require modification of the conditioning regimen
   in adults.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have reported the sex differences in heart
   susceptibility to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, but the mechanisms
   are not understood. The present study tested the hypothesis that Akt and
   protein kinase C (PKC)epsilon play an important role in the sexual
   dimorphism of heart susceptibility to I/R injury. Isolated hearts from
   2-month-old male and female rats were subjected to I/R in the
   Langendorff preparation. The post-ischemic recovery of left ventricular
   function was significantly better, and infarct size was significantly
   smaller in female (37.1 +/- 1.9\%) than in male (48.3 +/- 2.3\%) hearts
   after 25-min ischemia followed by 2-h reperfusion. Inhibition of
   phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway by wortmannin or PKC by
   chelerythrine chloride before ischemia significantly reduced
   postischemic recovery and increased infarct size in female but not male
   hearts. There were no differences in myocardial protein levels of heat
   shock protein 70, Akt, and PKC epsilon, respectively, between male and
   female rats. However, the ratio of phosphorylated (p)-Akt/Akt (0.58 +/-
   0.05 versus 0.22 +/- 0.04; P < 0.05) and p-PKC epsilon/PKC epsilon (0.35
   +/- 0.03 versus 0.22 +/- 0.02; P < 0.05) was significantly higher in
   female than in male hearts. In addition, there were significant
   increases in p-Akt and pPKC epsilon levels during reperfusion in female
   but not in male hearts. The results suggest that increased p-Akt and
   p-PKC epsilon levels in female hearts contribute to the gender-related
   differences in heart susceptibility to I/R and play an important role in
   cardio-protection against I/R injury in females.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{163}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Recently, multiple studies have shown that a sequence variant in CHEK2
   (CHEK2 1100delC) plays a role in the susceptibility to breast cancer.
   This mutation should confer about a twofold increased breast cancer risk
   in women and a 10-fold increased risk in men. Because the CHEK2 gene
   plays a critical role in DNA damage repair and the CHEK2 1100delC
   variant confers susceptibility to breast cancer, we investigated if
   patients carrying the CHEK2 1100delC mutation are characterized by an
   enhanced chromosomal radiosensitivity. To this end, familial breast
   cancer patients, sporadic breast cancer patients, and healthy women,
   considered in our previously studied to determine their chromosomal
   radiosensitivity with the G2 and G0-MN assay, were all tested in present
   study for the presence of the CHEK2 1100delC variant. The 1100delC
   variant was detected in none of the 100 healthy individuals, in I of 100
   (1\%) unselected breast cancer patients and in 3 of 78 (3.8\%) breast
   cancer patients with a family history of breast cancer. The breast
   cancer patients with the CHEK2 1100delC genotype had a mean
   radiation-induced yield of chromatid breaks that was not significantly
   different from that of the healthy control group. Although the mean
   yield of micronuclei (MN) was significantly higher compared to the
   healthy control group, this higher mean MN yield was due to a single
   patient who had a very high number of MN compared to the parallel
   control. Our data suggest that breast cancer patients with a CHEK2
   1100delC mutation are in general not characterized by a distinct
   enhanced chromosomal radiosensitivity. These conclusions are, however,
   very preliminary, because of the small numbers of CHEK2 1100delC breast
   cancer patients studied. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We studied habitat use and selection, seasonal variation in the use of

   to be the most used habitat in summer, whereas grassland and pastures
   were more often used in winter and spring. Human settlements were
   frequently used in winter, likely because they provide both food and
   insulation. The influence of climatic conditions on habitat use was
   assessed; both rain and temperatures seemed to affect habitat use by
   polecats. Food habits also showed a seasonal variation with small
   rodents as the main food item in all seasons, but with amphibians
   becoming an important prey in spring and summer. Our results suggest
   that habitat use is influenced by trophic factors and climatic
   conditions, which confirms the opportunistic feeding behaviour of the

   pathogenesis of POP, and to find out the relationship among these
   proteins. Through the year of 2002, uterosacral ligaments were obtained
   from 20 prolapsus and 24 non-prolapsus hysterectomized uteruses. ER, PR,
   p53, and p21 proteins were extracted by Western blot analysis and
   relative levels of proteins were compared by Student t-test and Pearson
   correlation coefficient. P value < 0.05 was considered statistically
   significant. All patients were postmenopausal and had never taken
   hormone replacement therapy. ER, PR, p53, and p21 were significantly
   lower in the study than control group (p < 0.0001). Positive
   correlations were found among all proteins in the prolapse group.
   Further researches are needed to elucidate the interrelationship among
   these proteins and their precise roles in pathogenesis of POP.}},

Abstract = {{The flesh-footed shearwater (Puffinus carneipes) is a medium-sized
   seabird (ca. 700 g) that is incidentally killed during longline fishing
   operations. We examined the levels of bycatch in Australia's Eastern
   Tuna and Billfish Fishery and developed a model to examine the impact of
   this fishery on the eastern Australian population of flesh-footed
   shearwaters, which breeds at only one site, Lord Howe Island. Observed
   bycatch rates for flesh-footed shearwaters were 0.378 birds/1000 hooks
   for night sets, and 0.945 birds/ 1000 hooks for day sets. The mean
   number of birds killed from 1998 to 2002 was estimated to be 1794-4486
   birds per year, with the estimated total killed over this period ranging
   from 8972 to 18,490 birds. Models incorporating both density-independent
   and density-dependent scenarios were applied to levels of bycatch
   representative of that observed in the fishery. Density-independent
   scenarios showed that fishing mortality levels caused declines in the
   majority of simulated populations. In contrast, density-dependent
   scenarios produced populations that were more resilient to fishing
   mortalities. Although some modelling scenarios led to population growth,
   under most stochastic simulations median population halving and
   quasi-extinction times were less than 55 and 120 years, respectively. We
   conclude that the level of bycatch observed in the fishery is most
   likely unsustainable and threatens the survival of the Lord Howe Island
   population. This situation can be improved only with the development and
   implementation of mitigation measures that will halt or greatly reduce
   the level of bycatch currently observed. Improved knowledge on a range
   of demographic parameters for the species, combined with a clearer idea
   of the at-sea distribution of breeding. and non-breeding shearwaters,
   will greatly assist in improving understanding and the management of
   this population. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The maintenance of skilled performance is of increasing interest and

   cognitive and physical abilities decline at a rate of 0.5\% per year
   from peak performance. However, examinations of expert performance in
   cognitive-motor activities suggest that performance in these areas can
   be maintained with age. This study examined the career performance of 17
   professional golfers. Results showed that the age-related decline in
   golf performance was on average 0.07\% for the period 35-49 years of age
   and 0.26\% for the period 51-60 years of age. While additional research
   is required to determine the generalizablity of these results, they

   considerably less than previously suggested.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is a study of entropy and its evolution in the time and
   frequency domains upon application of electromagnetic fields to
   materials. An understanding of entropy and its evolution in
   electromagnetic interactions bridges the boundaries between
   electromagnetism and thermodynamics. The approach used here is a
   Liouville-based statistical-mechanical theory. I show that the
   microscopic entropy is reversible and the macroscopic entropy satisfies
   an H theorem. The spectral entropy development can be very useful for
   studying the frequency response of materials. Using a
   projection-operator based nonequilibrium entropy, different equations
   are derived for the entropy and entropy production and are applied to
   the polarization, magnetization, and macroscopic fields. I begin by
   proving an exact H theorem for the entropy, progress to application of
   time-dependent entropy in electromagnetics, and then apply the theory to
   relevant applications in electromagnetics. The paper concludes with a
   discussion of the relationship of the frequency-domain form of the
   entropy to the permittivity, permeability, and impedance.}},

   the dynamics of the TMJ clicking is uncertain. The case report includes
   2 women, followed with clinical examinations, TMJ imaging, and
   electromyography (EMG), in whom local anesthetics in the LP Could
   abolish the clicking for several clays. BTX-A block of the LP (30 U
   Botox, given twice under EMG guidance with 6-month interval) temporarily
   reduced the action of the muscle, but the clicking was permanently
   eliminated and did not return during the observation period of I year,
   and a small but distinctive positional improvement in the disc-condyle
   relationship was obtained. However, the precise mechanisms behind the
   favourable treatment outcome are unclear.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Painful feet in older people can detrimentally affect
   balance and are a risk factor for falls. Pain is often associated with
   plantar hyperkeratoses, which are easily treated by podiatrists.
   Currently, there is no data defining the effect this treatment has on
   balance or functional ability.
   Objective: To determine the effects of scalpel debridement of painful
   plantar hyperkeratoses on pain, balance and functional ability in older
   people aged 65 years and over. Subjects: Nineteen men and women aged
   65-84 years (mean age 72, standard deviation 5.6).
   Methods: Pain resulting from plantar hyperkeratoses was measured using a
   visual analogue scale. Static balance and functional ability were
   measured using tests of postural sway, co-ordinated stability and timed
   walking and stepping tests. Painful plantar hyperkeratoses were debrided
   with a scalpel then all tests were repeated, immediately and 7 days
   later.
   Results: Following scalpel debridement, pain levels (sensory and
   afferent) were significantly reduced (P < 0.0001) and functional ability
   was significantly increased (P < 0.0001). There was no change in static
   balance ability. One week after debridement the improved performance in
   functional ability tests was maintained.
   Conclusions: Debridement of painful plantar hyperkeratoses reduces pain
   and improves functional ability in older people. Its effect on static
   balance was inconclusive. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To examine cross-sectional differences in insulin
   sensitivity, insulin secretion and beta-cell function during puberty in
   overweight Hispanic boys and girls with a family history of type 2
   diabetes.
   STUDY DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional, observational study
   included 214 8-13-y-old Hispanic children with a BMI percentile >= 85th
   percentile and family history of type 2 diabetes.
   METHODS AND ANALYSES: Participants underwent a physical examination,
   body composition measures, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and
   frequently-sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. Unadjusted and
   adjusted general linear models (GLM) tested whether insulin/glucose
   dynamics differed by Tanner stage and gender.
   RESULTS: Unadjusted group comparisons showed that fasting insulin
   increased whereas insulin sensitivity (SI) and the disposition index
   (DI) (a measure of pancreatic beta-cell function) decreased across
   Tanner stage groups (all P < 0.05). No differences in the acute insulin
   response to glucose (AIRg), fasting glucose or 2-h glucose were found.
   After adjusting for covariates, there was no independent effect of
   Tanner stage on SI (P = 0.9) or AIRg (P = 0.2), but DI was slightly
   lower in later Tanner stages suggesting decreased beta-cell function in
   the more mature groups (P = 0.10).
   CONCLUSIONS: Overweight Hispanic children with a family history of type
   2 diabetes may represent a unique population given that pubertal insulin
   resistance was not evident once analyses controlled for body
   composition. Longitudinal analyses are required to determine whether the
   slightly diminished beta-cell function in later Tanner stages plays a
   role in the development of type 2 diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: Obtain information about the stopover ecology of the Common
   Sandpiper, to identify the divers strategies used by juvenile and adults
   and its contribution to the differential migration as well as try to
   explain the differences in the results of studies realized in the coast
   and interior.
   Location: The study was carried out in the Duero Valley, confluence of
   Cega and Duero rivers (Valladolid, Spain).
   Methods: captures with mist nest, ringing and taking of data in hand.
   Results: high variations of body mass were observed in recoveries, with
   increments of 6.87 grams during the day and losses of 4.94 g. during the
   night. Body mass of birds captured in the dusk was larger than in the
   dawn both in adults (average = 9.85) and juvenile (6.65). The index
   means of fat found for each age and hour was 1.2 at the dawn and 2.2 at
   dusk for the juvenile, and 1.5 and 2.5 respectively for the adults. It
   was a high correlation between the body mass and the fat index on the
   captured birds. The Common sandpiper fattens a daily average of 1.93
   grams, increasing their body mass in 5.04 grams among the first and last
   capture. Some individuals increase until 60\% of body mass during their
   stay. The stragglers birds remain more time at the study area. It seems
   to exist a higher nutritious efficiency of adults regarding the younger
   that could explain the progressive delay in the migration of the younger
   birds.
   Conclusions: The species has a very active metabolism, with high
   variations of body mass along the day and high night losses. The results
   support the hypothesis that the adults travel quicker than the juvenile
   in autumn. This can be originated by a higher nutritious efficiency, a
   smaller energy expense or for the competitive domain of the adults. It
   is possible that the migration is slower in the coast, where the young
   birds prevail in the realized studies, than in the interior. Probably in
   the coast the adults use a similar strategy to the juvenile ones.}},

   the stria terminalis (BNST), an area involved in stress and anxiety, is
   critically involved in this effect and, if so, when. The authors found
   that excitotoxic lesions to the BNST prevented the enhanced conditioning
   after stressor exposure. In addition, temporary inactivation of the BNST
   during the stressor did not alter enhanced responding, whereas
   inactivation during training prevented the enhancement. These data
   indicate that stressful experience induces persistent changes in the
   BNST that are necessary for enhancing learning well after the stressful

Abstract = {{Glubran2 is a cyanoacrylate-based synthetic glue modified by addition of
   a second monomer. Among its many advantages over traditional
   cyanoacrylate products, Glubran2 has a much lower thermal polymerization
   temperature than that of cyanoacrylates used for cutaneous application.
   For many years, the new glue has been widely used in neuroradiology
   endovascular treatments. Our study aimed to assess the use of Glubran2
   to treat possible complications arising during the embolization of
   aneurysms or vascular malformations like AVM or fistulae. A complication
   encountered in some of these cases is rupture of the vessel wall by the
   microguide or perforation of the aneurysmal sac by the coils used for
   embolization. This complication could be overcome by injecting Glubran2
   into the rupture point but this would put the glue directly in contact
   with the subarachnoid space and possibly reach adjacent brain tissue.
   The aim of this experimental study was to place the glue in direct
   contact with brain tissue to ascertain its immediate compatibility and
   tolerability in vivo and any ensuing tissue damage. Three swine
   underwent neurosurgical procedures and survived for different times
   after which they were slaughtered and their brains explanted and sent
   for macroscopic and microscopic investigation by the Pathological
   Anatomy Service. As a whole, Glubran2 was well tolerated in vivo and did
   not cause major damage in direct contact with brain tissue.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: Appropriateness of prescribing is often
   assessed by standard instruments. We wished to establish whether
   judgements of appropriateness that included patients' perspectives and
   contextual factors could lead to different conclusions when compared
   with commonly used instruments. To explore the predictive accuracy of
   these instruments.
   Methods: The design was interviews of patients, audio recordings of the
   consultation and interviews of the doctors, in varied primary care
   practices in England. Participants were patients who were likely to
   discuss a medication issue. The outcome measures were judgements of
   appropriateness made by the researchers and by two instruments: the
   Prescribing Appropriateness Index and the Medication Appropriateness
   Index. Implications for the predictive accuracy of the measures was also
   investigated.
   Results: From 35 cases there was agreement between the judges and the
   instruments in 22 cases, 16 were appropriate and 6 inappropriate. Of 10
   cases classified as inappropriate by the instruments the judges thought
   four were appropriate. Of 18 cases classified as appropriate by the
   instruments, two were considered inappropriate by the judges. In seven
   cases the prescribing decisions could not be classified by the
   instruments because the decision was to not prescribe.
   Conclusions: Current measures of appropriateness of prescribing depend
   predominantly on pharmacological criteria, and so do not represent cases
   that would be judged appropriate when including the patient's views and
   contextual factors. If most prescribing is appropriate then use of these
   measures may lead to more false negatives than real negatives. The
   instruments should be renamed as measures of `pharmacological
   appropriateness' and are useful where the incidence of this type of
   inappropriate prescribing is relatively high.}},

Abstract = {{There has been limited published research assessing the range of oral
   temperature that the dental hard and soft tissues are exposed to. The
   temperatures that tooth structure and dental restorations encounter
   affect the performance of dental materials within the oral environment.
   This study therefore assessed the range of temperatures that a selected
   group could tolerate when drinking and also assessed the range of
   temperatures encountered in various intra-oral sites. These temperature
   fluctuations are for very brief periods of time but have a wide and
   varied range. Miniature dataloggers allowed for accurate measurements
   and recording of temperature from selected sites. The range of
   temperature recorded amongst the individuals tested shows the protection
   afforded to the dental hard tissues by the soft tissues of the oral
   cavity. The maximum and minimum mouth temperatures recorded show that
   hot fluids can raise the intra-oral temperature of the front teeth to
   around 70 degrees C and the consumption of iced drinks lowers the same
   teeth to around 0 degrees C. The range of temperature of hot fluids that
   can be tolerated by a selected group vary, but this does not seem to be
   the case for cold fluids. The thermistor beads mounted on the buccal
   surface of the lower front teeth and the palatal of the upper front
   teeth are exposed to the greatest temperature fluctuations during
   drinking fluids from a cup. The importance of these temperatures
   recorded in terms of dental materials testing and the role of material
   conductivity warrants further investigation.}},

   DNA Wang tiles that subsequently crystallize on a polymeric nucleating
   scaffold strand, arranging themselves in a binary counting pattern that
   could serve as a template for a molecular electronic demultiplexing
   circuit. Although the yield of counting crystals is low, and per-tile
   error rates in such crystals is roughly 10\%, this work demonstrates the
   potential of algorithmic self-assembly to create complex nanoscale
   patterns of technological interest. A subset of the tiles for counting
   form information-bearing DNA tubes that copy bit strings from layer to

Abstract = {{This paper examines the persuasability of rhetorical value framing
   within a presidential nominating campaign, in an effort to understand
   how values and value-laden language may provide useful signals in
   electoral contexts where partisan cues are absent. Relying on a
   survey-experiment conducted during the 2000 Republican nomination
   campaign, I evaluate the relative persuasiveness of arguments framed in
   either individualistic or egalitarian terms. Drawing upon an
   ``active-receiver{''} model of framing effects, I posit that Republican
   primary voters respond more readily to candidates when they use
   individualistic frames than when they use egalitarian frames, because
   individualism is a more ``chronically accessible{''} value construct for
   Republicans. Furthermore, I hypothesize that this dynamic is
   particularly pronounced among more educated respondents, who have been
   trained to recognize abstract value cues and automatically apply them to
   applied political contexts. The experimental findings support these
   hypotheses.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the qualitative characteristics of genuine, imagined, and

   investigated whether trained raters could discriminate between these
   accounts using the Memory Characteristics Questionnaire (MCQ; Johnson,
   Foley, Suengas, \& Raye, 1988) and the Aberdeen Report Judgment Scales
   (ARJS; S. L. Sporer, paper presented at the biennial meeting of the
   American Psychology-Law Society in Redondo Beach, California, March
   1998). Participants generated three accounts. The first account was of
   an event that participants genuinely experienced in childhood. The
   second account was of an event that participants did not experience, but
   merely imagined happened in childhood. The third account was of an event
   that participants did not experience, but wrote a deceptive account to
   convince someone else that the event really happened in childhood. Half
   our participants wrote about positive events and half wrote about
   negative events. Ratings made by two trained judges indicated that
   genuine, imagined, and deceptive accounts were qualitatively different
   on both the MCQ and ARJS. Moreover, based on the MCQ and ARJS scores
   raters could discriminate whether the events had been genuinely
   experienced. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of
   these findings. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Polyferrocenylsilanes {[}Fe(eta-C5H4)(2)SiMePh] (n) (3) and
   {[}Fe(eta-C5H4)(2)SiMe2] (n) (4) were prepared by transition
   metal-catalyzed ring-opening polymerization (ROP) and thin films of
   these materials were studied to investigate their potential utility as
   protective charge migration coatings for dielectrics. Films (> 15 mu m)
   of 3 or 4 cast from a concentrated toluene solution coated on Mylar did
   not experience any arc discharging when exposed to a beam of low energy
   (20 keV) electrons for a 1 h time period. In order to further
   investigate the charge migration properties of polyferrocenylsilanes,
   thick shapes and films of 3 were prepared by mold-extrusion and
   solution-casting onto a Teflon substrate, respectively. Charge
   accumulation measurements on 3 using a nonintrusive electrostatic probe
   showed that even after a 1 h exposure to a 25 keV electron flux, no
   appreciable charge accumulation existed. The direction of current flow
   was explored by constructing a device consisting of a film (thickness
   ca. 100-130 mu m) of polymer 3 coating a layer of copper. When
   positioned beneath a circular mask and exposed to a low energy electron
   flux (5-25 keV), measurements of the current at the surface of the
   polymer film either exposed to or not exposed to the electron flux were
   not significantly different, and the current recorded from the bare
   copper connection to the ground was significantly (100-1000 times)
   higher. Although the mechanism of charge migration in
   polyferrocenylsilanes is not fully understood, these experiments
   indicated it may arise from a conduction mechanism, however electron
   scattering may also be involved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To compare the results of pancreaticogastrostomy versus

   Summary Background Data: While several techniques have been proposed for
   reconstructing pancreatico-digestive continuity, only a limited number
   of randomized studies have been carried out.
   Methods: A total of 151 patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy with
   soft residual tissue were randomized to receive either
   pancreaticogastrostomy (group PG) or end-to-side pancreaticojejunostomy.
   (group PJ).
   Results: The 2 treatment groups showed no differences in vital
   statistics or underlying disease, mean duration of surgery, and need for
   intraoperative blood transfusion. Overall, the incidence of surgical
   complications was 34\% (29\% in PG, 39\% in PJ, P = not significant).
   Patients receiving PG showed a significantly lower rate of multiple
   surgical complications (P = 0.002). Pancreatic fistula was the most
   frequent complication, occurring in 14.5\% of patients (13\% in PG and
   16\% in PJ, P = not significant). Five patients in each treatment arm
   required a second surgical intervention; the postoperative mortality
   rate was 0.6\%. PG was favored over PJ due to significant differences in
   postoperative collections (P = 0.01), delayed gastric emptying (P =
   0.03), and biliary fistula (P = 0.01). The mean postoperative
   hospitalization period stay was comparable in both groups.
   Conclusions: When compared with PJ, PG did not show any significant
   differences in the overall postoperative complication rate or incidence
   of pancreatic fistula. However, biliary fistula, postoperative
   collections and delayed gastric emptying are significantly reduced in
   patients treated by PG. In addition, pancreaticogastrotomy is associated
   with a significantly lower frequency of multiple surgical complications.}},

Abstract = {{Human cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) is a phase I metabolizing enzyme. It
   is involved in the biotransformation of xenobiotics and endogenous
   substrates. Inter-individual genetic polymorphisms of the CYP2E1 gene
   are associated with different cancer diseases as well as alcohol and
   nicotine dependence. We report here for the first time three novel
   alternative spliced mRNA transcripts which are more frequently present
   in lung carcinoma cell lines as in hepatocyte cell lines. They are
   unexpected detectable in blood leukocytes from healthy volunteers but
   not in normal and cancerous lung tissue. The full-length wildtype
   transcript of CYP2E1 is described to be concomitant to an alternatively
   spliced mRNA transcript. Stimulation with CYP2E1-inducing agents did not
   change the splicing transcript pattern. The three splicing variants
   should lead to truncated non-functional proteins. Thus the genetic
   diversity of CYP2E1 is additionally extended at the transcriptional
   level of gene expression. The physiological role of the splicing
   variants is not known, yet, but they seem to be related to the
   carcinogenic property of the cell lines.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study sought to investigate whether or not low-level
   laser therapy (LLLT) with a helium-neon laser increased biomechanical
   parameters of transected medial collateral ligament (MCL) in rats.
   Background Data: It has been reported that LLLT can enhance tendon
   healing. Methods: Thirty rats received surgical transection to their
   right MCL, and five were assigned as the control group. After surgery,
   the rats were divided into three groups: group 1 (n=10) received LLLT
   with 0.01 J/cm(2) energy density per day, group 2 (n=10) received LLLT
   with 1.2 J/cm(2) energy density per day, and group 3 (sham=exposed
   group; n=10) received daily placebo laser with shut-down laser
   equipment, while the control group received neither surgery nor LLLT.
   Biomechanical tests were performed at 12 and 21 days after surgery. The
   data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. Results: The
   ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of group 2 on day 12 was significantly
   higher than that of groups 1 and 3. Furthermore, the UTS and energy
   absorption of the control (uninjured) group were significantly higher
   than those of the other groups. Conclucions: LLLT with a helium-neon
   laser is effective for the early improvement of the ultimate tensile
   strength of medial collateral ligament injuries.}},

Abstract = {{Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease characterized by
   pancreatic beta cell destruction involving auto-reactive T-cells,
   pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and loss of
   insulin. Monozygotic twin studies show a 20-60\% concordance with T1D
   indicating there may be an environmental component to the disease.
   Glutathione (GSH) is the major endogenous antioxidant produced by the
   cell. GSH participates directly in the neutralization of free radicals
   and plays a role in the immune response. Glutathione-s-transferases
   (GSTs) conjugate GSH to free-radicals or xenobiotics. GST activity
   depletes GSH levels and may either detoxify or enhance the toxicity of a
   compound. Glutathione-s-transferase mu 1 (GSTM1) and
   glutathione-s-transferase theta 1 (GSTT1) have polymorphic homozygous
   deletion (null) genotypes resulting in complete absence of enzyme
   activity. GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes in Caucasian populations have
   frequencies of approximately 40-60\% and 15-20\%, respectively. GST null
   genotypes have been associated with susceptibility to cancer and
   protection against chronic pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to
   investigate associations with GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms in a group
   T1D patients and control subjects 0-35 years old who participated in the
   Combined Swedish Childhood Diabetes Registry and Diabetes Incidence
   Study (1986-1988). Results show that the presence of the GSTM1 and not
   the null genotype (OR, 2.13 95\% CI, 1.23-3.70, p -value, 0.007,
   Bonferroni corrected p -value, 0.035) may be a susceptibility factor in
   T1D 14-20 years old. These results suggest that the GSTM1 null genotype
   is associated with T1D protection and T1D age-at-onset and that
   susceptibility to T1D may involve GST conjugation.}},

Abstract = {{Homeopathy was born as an experimental discipline, as can be seen from
   the enormous amount of homeopathic data collected over more than two
   centuries. However, the medical tradition of homeopathy has been
   separated from that of conventional science for a long time.
   Conventional scientific wisdom dictates that homeopathy should have no
   effect above placebo but experiments on ultra-high dilutions of solutes
   together with some clinical data suggest the intriguing possibility that
   it might do in some circumstances. Today, an osmotic process between
   disciplines, previously seen as in conflict, is facilitated because over
   the last few decades homeopathy has initiated the methods of current
   medical science and a substantial number of experimental studies-at
   molecular, cellular and clinical levels-are available. One area of
   dialogue and of common progress is that of inflammation and immunity,
   probably because these are closely related to the traditional `vital
   force' of the body's self-healing power. In a series of papers we review
   the historical origins of homeopathy, the laboratory and animal models.
   related to the field of immunopharmacology, the clinical evidence in
   favor and against the use of homeopathy in the inflammatory diseases and
   the hypotheses regarding its action mechanism(s). Finally, we will
   enlighten the specific characteristics of the homeopathic approach,
   which places great emphasis on identifying a cure for the whole
   organism.}},

   similarity transformations which are more general than the unitary
   transformations used usually in quantum mechanics. By performing a
   similarity transformation on a set of Hermitian physical operators the
   transformed operators are Hermitian with respect to new scalar product
   defined by the use of a new metric. It is shown that such
   transformations can be implemented experimentally by the use of
   polarization optics and the metric obtained in such transformations is
   analysed.}},

Abstract = {{Noninvasive detection of differentiated cells is increasingly demanded
   for accurate and reliable assessments of both in vitro and in vivo
   experimental systems. Here we present an efficient, innovative approach
   for imaging the beta cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. The
   main physiologic function of beta cells is glucose-stimulated insulin
   secretion. This function is facilitated through the synthesis and
   storage of insulin in secretory vesicles of beta cells, which then
   release their contents when beta cells are exposed to hyperglycemic
   conditions. To visualize beta cells in vivo in the mouse, we used
   targeted mutagenesis techniques to construct a modified insulin II
   (InsII) gene allele, InsII(EGFP) that expresses a proinsulin-EGFP
   (enhanced green fluorescent protein) fusion peptide. The EGFP portion of
   this fusion is entirely within the C-peptide portion of the proinsulin
   peptide. This fusion protein is processed in beta cells to insulin and
   EGFP-tagged C peptide, which are stored together in cytoplasmic
   secretory vesicles. The large amount of vesicular EGFP-tagged C peptide
   is evident as a characteristic robust and specific fluorescence pattern
   in the beta cells of lnsII(EGFP) mice. This innovative method of
   visualizing beta cells will be a useful tool in the study of both beta
   cell physiology and the development of the endocrine cells of the
   pancreas.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Drug resistance remains a persistent source of morbidity and
   mortality for patients with bipolar depression. A growing number of
   clinical studies support the usefulness of chronotherapeutic
   interventions, such as total sleep deprivation (TSD) and light therapy
   (LT), In the treatment of nonresistant bipolar depression.
   Method: To investigate the clinical usefulness of TSD plus LT in the
   treatment of drug-resistant bipolar depression, we treated 60 inpatients
   for I week with repeated TSD and LT combined with ongoing
   antidepressants and lithium salts. All patients had a DSM-IV diagnosis
   of bipolar I disorder. Drug resistance was rated according to Thase and
   Rush criteria. The pattern of relapses and recurrences was assessed
   during a prospective 9-month follow-up. Data were gathered from
   September 2002 to July 2004.
   Results: A 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance with changes in
   self-rated perceived mood scores as dependent variable and with time and
   group (history of drug resistance) as independent factors confirmed
   significant time-by-group interaction (p = .0339). A logistic regression
   on rates of achievement of response (50\% reduction in Hamilton Rating
   Scale for Depression ratings) confirmed the significance of observed
   differences: overall, 70\% (23/33) of nonresistant versus 44\% (12/27)
   of drug-resistant patients achieved response (p = .045). A survival time
   analysis (Cox proportional hazards model) showed that history of drug
   resistance significantly influenced the pattern of relapses and
   recurrences, with 57\% (13/23) of nonresistant responders and 17\%
   (2/12) of drug-resistant responders being euthymic after 9 months (p =
   .0212).
   Discussion: The combination of repeated TSD and LT in drug-resistant
   patients was useful in triggering an acute response. Further clinical
   research is needed to optimize this treatment option for drug-resistant
   patients in the long term.}},

Abstract = {{The motivation for this work is derived from the current interest in
   speeding up development schedules. A key implication of the shift to
   more rapid development methods is the growing emphasis on fixed time and
   fixed effort delivered during such projects. However, there appears to
   be little work that addresses the impacts of dealing with bound effort
   levels. The result of binding time and effort is to deprive project
   managers of the normal parameters that are used in trade-offs. The paper
   attempts to introduce a quantitative analytical framework for modelling
   effort-boxed development in order to uncover the effects on the overall
   development effort and the potential leverage that can be derived from
   incremental delivery in such projects. Models that predict product size
   as an exponential function of the development effort are used in the
   paper to explore the relationships between effort and the number of
   increments, thereby providing new insights into the economic impact of
   incremental approaches to effort-boxed software projects.}},

Abstract = {{The Wellington Metropolitan Area, New Zealand, about 35 km by 10 km, is
   crossed by the southernmost segment of the Wellington fault, striking
   roughly in the northeast-southwest direction. Numerical modeling of M
   6.7 earthquakes due to ruptures on this fault, intended to characterize
   the 3D effects of the region's main geological features on the ground
   motion, are performed by using a finite-differences scheme with
   staggered grid, for frequencies up to 1.5 Hz. We consider the part of
   the Wellington fault that crosses the Wellington Metropolitan Region as
   an almost vertical strike-slip fault, 30 km long, and with slip
   distribution history taken from the slip history of the 1992 M 7.3
   Landers, California, earthquake. The 3D stratigraphy of the region has
   been built by integrating all available geological and geophysical data.
   Results of the modeling show several dominant features. When the fault
   ruptures from south to north, resonance occurs within a small area close
   to the harbor, where the depth of the basin is largest. This resonance
   produces a train of seismic waves traveling northward with dominant
   frequency of about 0.5 Hz. As the rupture propagates into the harbor,
   the radiated wavefield focuses on the Lower Hutt Valley, to the north,
   due to the presence of a ridge that rises up from the bottom of the
   harbor to emerge as Somes Island. This effect considerably enhances the
   incident seismic energy in the valley, particularly the horizontal
   motions. Further focusing occurs due to the triangular shape of the
   Lower Hutt Valley, whose alluvial deposits exhibit large impedance
   contrasts with the surrounding bedrock. The combined focusing effects
   produce amplification factors in the valley of about 5 between 0.5 Hz
   and 0.7 Hz. In Wellington City the amplification factors are between 0.5
   (deamplification) and 2, except for an area on reclaimed land in the
   harbor, which shows an amplification factor as large as 9. After the
   rupture has stopped, higher frequency waves, between 1 and 1.2 Hz,
   appear trapped (reverberating) in the harbor for the remaining duration
   of the seismograms, up to 60 see. On the other hand, when the rupture is
   from north to south, none of the focusing effects occur. Only the
   long-lasting reverberations in the harbor seem a characteristic of the
   wave propagation common to both rupture directions. Nevertheless, the
   amplification factors in this north-to-south scenario are about the same
   as for the south-to-north rupture.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Plasmapheresis is a therapeutic alternative for diseases in
   which a ``humoral factor{''} has pathogenetic relevance. However it is
   not devoid of adverse effects. Aim: To review the indications, number of
   procedures, morbidity and clinical evolution of plasmapheresis in
   critical patients. Patients and Methods: A retrospective and descriptive
   study in four intensive care units of an University hospital. The
   severity of patients was evaluated with APACHE II and SOFA scores.
   Results: Twenty patients were studied. The most common indications of
   plasmapheresis were thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) in 50\% of
   subjects and small vessel vasculitides in 30\%. The number of procedures
   per patient oscillated between 2 and 14 (mean: 7.1+/-3.3). The
   registered adverse effects were hypocalcemia in 50\% of patients,
   hypotension in 42.1\%, coagulopathy in 35\%, hypokalemia in 29\%, rash
   in 20\%, procedure related infections in 18\% and fever in 10\%. There
   was a significant decrease of 17+/-28\% in prothrombin time, after the
   procedures. Seventy five percent of patients had a favorable evolution.
   Global mortality rate was 15\%. All deaths occurred in patients with TTP
   and were attributed to the progression of the disease. No death was
   attributed to the procedure. The initial APACHE II and SOFA scores were
   12.4+/-8.4 and 5.3+/-2.9, respectively. Both scores decreased after the
   procedure. Among other therapeutic measures, 15\% of the patients
   received immunosuppressant treatment, 27\% were dialyzed and 32\% were
   mechanically ventilated. Conclusions: The most common indication of
   plasmapheresis was TTP. Adverse effects were frequent, however there was
   no procedure related mortality. The global morality rate was 15\% and
   all deaths occurred in patients in TTP.}},

Abstract = {{GspB is a large cell-surface glycoprotein expressed by Streptococcus
   gordonii M99 that mediates binding of this organism to human platelets.
   This adhesin is glycosylated in the cytoplasm, and is then transported
   to the cell surface via an accessory Sec system. To assess the
   structural features of GspB that are needed for export, we examined the
   effects of altering the carbohydrate moieties or the polypeptide
   backbone of GspB. Truncated, glycosylated variants of GspB were exported
   exclusively via the accessory Sec pathway. When glycosylation was
   abolished, the GspB variants were still exported by this pathway, but
   minor amounts could also be transported by the canonical Sec system.
   GspB variants with in-frame insertions or deletions in the N-terminus
   were not secreted, indicating that this domain is necessary for export.
   However, the N-terminus is not sufficient for the transport of
   heterologous proteins, because C-terminal fusion of passenger proteins
   to this domain hindered export. In contrast, fusion of GspB to a
   canonical signal peptide resulted in the efficient export of
   non-glycosylated forms of the fusion protein via the canonical Sec
   pathway, whereas glycosylated forms could not be exported. Thus, the
   carbohydrate moieties and the atypical signal sequence of GspB interfere
   with export via the canonical pathway, and direct GspB towards the
   accessory Sec system.}},

   dementia and provide insight into disease pathogenesis. Six samples of
   matched cerebrospinal (CSF) and blood serum from patients with no, mild,

   Ciphergen system. Chips were analyzed in the matrix-assisted laser
   desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometer at low mass (700 to
   20,000 Da) and at higher mass (5000 to 100,000 Da). In both serum and
   CSF samples, differences in protein intensity appeared to correlate with
   degree of dementia. This preliminary study suggests that protein markers
   of HIV dementia may be detected by MALDI mass spectrometry.}},

Abstract = {{OPERA is part of the CNGS project and it is an experiment dedicated to
   the observation of long-baseline nu(mu) into nu(tau) oscillations
   through tau appearance. Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) with bakelite
   electrodes are used to instrument the 2 cm gaps between the magnetized
   iron slabs of the two spectrometers. The RPC installation ended in may
   2004 on the first spectrometer and in march 2005 on the second one.
   Before the installation, every RPC is subjected to a complete test chain
   in order to reject the poorer quality detectors. The tests are performed
   in dedicated facilities to ensure the proper RPC gluing, to measure its
   electrical properties and to verify the response to cosmic rays and the
   intrinsic noise levels. We have also tested the long term stability of
   real size OPERA RPC prototypes operated at cosmic ray fluxes for more
   than one year. On small size prototypes we are performing studies on the
   gas' mixtures in order to reduce the total charge released in the gas
   for each detector count. The validation of the installed RPCs has been
   performed with pure nitrogen. A small part of them has been also tested
   with the gas mixture Ar/C2H2F4/i - C4H10/SF6 = 75.4/20/4/0.6.}},

Abstract = {{Process and tubercle fractures of the talus and calcaneus can be a
   source of significant pain and dysfunction. Successful management
   requires extensive knowledge of the complex osseoligamentous anatomy of
   the hindfoot. The large posterior process of the talus is composed of a
   medial and a lateral tubercle; an os trigonum may exist posterior to the
   lateral tubercle. The talus has a lateral process that articulates with
   the fibula and subtalar joint; the calcaneus possesses a frequently
   injured anterior process that articulates with the cuboid. Injury to
   these hindfoot structures is caused by inversion and eversion of the
   ankle, which can occur during athletic activity. These injuries often
   are misdiagnosed as ankle sprains. A high degree of clinical suspicion
   is warranted, and specialized radiographs or other imaging modalities
   may be required for accurate diagnosis. Nonsurgical management with cast
   immobilization is frequently successful when the fracture is correctly
   diagnosed acutely. Large fragments may be amenable to open reduction and
   internal fixation. Untreated, chronic injuries can cause significant
   pain and functional impairment that may be improved substantially with
   late surgical intervention.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Orbitofrontal cortex lesions produce disinhibited or socially
   inappropriate behavior and emotional irregularities. Characteristics of
   borderline personality disorder include impulsivity and affective
   instability. The authors investigated whether aspects of borderline
   personality disorder, in particular impulsivity, are associated with
   orbitofrontal cortex dysfunction.
   Method: Measures of personality, emotion, impulsivity, time perception,
   sensitivity to reinforcers, and spatial working memory were administered
   to patients with borderline personality disorder (N = 19), patients with
   orbitofrontal cortex lesions (N = 23), patients with lesions in the
   prefrontal cortex but not in the orbitofrontal cortex (N = 20), and
   healthy comparison subjects (N = 39).
   Results: The patients with orbitofrontal cortex lesions and the patients
   with borderline personality disorder performed similarly on several
   measures. Both groups were more impulsive and reported more
   inappropriate behaviors, borderline personality disorder
   characteristics, and anger and less happiness than the two comparison
   groups, and both groups were less open to experience and had a faster
   perception of time (underproduced time) than the healthy comparison
   subjects. The patients with orbitofrontal cortex lesions and the
   borderline personality disorder patients performed differently on other
   measures. The borderline personality disorder patients were less
   extraverted and conscientious and more neurotic and emotional than all
   other groups. Patients with orbitofrontal cortex lesions had deficits in
   reversing stimulus-reinforcer associations and a faster perception of
   time (overestimated time) than the healthy comparison subjects.
   Conclusions: Orbitofrontal cortex dysfunction may contribute to some
   core characteristics of borderline personality disorder, in particular
   impulsivity. Other characteristics of borderline personality disorder,
   such as high levels of emotionality and personality irregularities, do
   not appear to be related to the type of dysfunction produced by
   orbitofrontal cortex damage. The similarities and differences found
   between the borderline personality disorder patients and the patients
   with orbitofrontal cortex lesions may lead to a better understanding of
   the etiology of borderline personality disorder and the functions of the
   orbitofrontal cortex.}},

Abstract = {{The Fanconi-Bickel syndrome is caused by homozygosity or compound
   heterozygosity for mutations of the facilitated glucose transporter 2
   gene (GLUT2). Glycogen accumulates in renal tubular cells and they fail
   to reabsorb multiple filtered solutes because of impairment in
   GLUT2-mediated efflux of glucose. We describe a 10-year-old male child
   with GLUT2 deficiency who produced massive amounts of 3-deoxyfructose
   (3-DF) in the kidneys. Since 3-DF is a detoxification product of a
   potent glycating agent, 3-deoxyglucosone, a precursor of advanced
   glycation end-products, this Suggests a massive accumulation Of glucose
   Within tubular cells probably as a consequence of GLUT2 deficiency. The
   level of 3-DF in the urine of this atypical patient, who also manifested
   renal glomerular hyperfiltration, microalbuminuria, and glomerular
   mesangial expansion, was higher than in any patient examined with
   diabetes mellitus. Elevated levels Of glucose and/or its metabolites in
   renal tubular cells may be necessary but not sufficient for the
   development of both the renal tubulopathy and diabetic-like glomerular
   disease in GLUT2 deficiency. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional axi-symmetric numerical model is constructed of the
   spinal cord, consisting of elastic cord tissue surrounded by aqueous
   cerebrospinal fluid, in turn surrounded by elastic dura. The geometric
   and elastic parameters are simplified but of realistic order, compared
   with existing measurements. A distal reflecting site models scar tissue
   formed by earlier trauma to the cord, which is commonly associated with
   syrinx formation. Transients equivalent to both arterial pulsation and
   percussive coughing are used to excite wave propagation. Propagation is
   investigated in this model and one with a central canal down the middle
   of the cord tissue, and in further idealized versions of it, including a
   model with no cord, one with a rigid cord, one with a rigid dura, and a
   double-length untapered variant of the rigid-dura model. Analytical
   predictions for axial and radial wave-speeds in these different
   situations are compared with, and used to explain, the numerical
   outcomes. We find that the anatomic circumstances of the spinal
   cerebrospinal fluid cavity probably do not allow for significant wave
   steepening phenomena. The results indicate that wave propagation in the
   real cord is set by the elastic properties of both the cord tissue and
   the confining dura mater fat, and bone. The central canal does not
   influence the wave propagation significantly.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, three Listeria monocytogenes strains and one
   Listeria innocua strain out of a collection of 241 Listeria isolates
   from human and food-processing sources were found to display resistance
   to tetracycline (TC) due to the presence of the tet(M) gene. Through
   sequence analysis, it was shown that tet(M) genes in two of the isolates
   belong to sequence homology group (SHG) II, a group comprising
   chromosomally encoded tet(M) genes previously found in Staphylococcus
   aureus and in lactobacilli. The tet(M) genes of the two other L.
   monocytogenes strains were associated with a member of the Tn916-Tn1545
   family of conjugative transposons and were closely related to SHG III,
   which harbours enterococcal tet(M) genes associated with Tn916. One of
   these transposon-containing strains was able to transfer the tet(M) gene
   to Enterococcus faecalis recipient strain JH2-2. Collectively, these
   sequence and conjugation data indicate that the acquisition of tet(M) by
   Listeria strains may be triggered by successive transfers between other

Abstract = {{This study examined diploid and triploid shortnose sturgeon hematology
   and stress physiology through the investigation of various
   characteristics and components of whole blood and blood plasma.
   Erythrocytic cellular and nuclear length and width were significantly
   larger in triploids than in diploids. Hematocrit was depressed in
   triploid sturgeon in comparison to diploids, but total blood hemoglobin
   content and mean erythrocytic hemoglobin concentration (MEHC) did not
   differ between ploidies. The mean erythrocytic hemoglobin (MEH) was
   elevated in proportion to the increase in erythrocyte size. Taken
   together, these data suggest that triploids and diploids likely have
   similar oxygen carrying and aerobic capacities. In response to an acute
   stressor of 15 min chasing, plasma cortisol and glucose levels did not
   differ between ploidies. Cortisol levels were significantly depressed at
   2 h post-stress with an increase back to 0 h post-stress levels at 6 h
   into recovery, whereas glucose levels did not change during the recovery
   period. There was a significant interaction between ploidy and time
   post-stress for blood hemoglobin concentrations, with diploids
   demonstrating elevated hemoglobin content at 6 h post-stress. Plasma
   osmolality, chloride ion concentrations and lactate levels were elevated
   in triploids. Overall, it does not appear that sturgeon have developed
   an elaborate stress response and the triploid stress response appears to
   be slightly reduced in comparison to diploids.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional working fluids (refrigerants) are being phased out
   worldwide to combat with the twin menace of ozone layer depletion and
   global warming and natural refrigerants are fast gaining favour lately.
   Single stage and multi stage refrigeration systems fail to widen the gap
   between heat source and heat sink temperatures required in many
   industrial applications requiring simultaneous heating and cooling and
   cascaded systems appear to be the best alternative. Modest research has
   been done in cascaded systems based on natural refrigerants thereby
   offering good potential for research. In this paper, a cascaded system
   for simultaneous heating and cooling (refrigeration and heat pump
   system) with a carbon dioxide based HT cycle and propane based LT cycle
   for simultaneous refrigeration and heating applications has been
   analyzed. To facilitate prediction of optimum performance parameters,
   performance trends with variation in the design parameters and operating
   variables have been presented in this article. Relevant expressions have
   been developed to serve as guidelines to the user for selecting
   appropriate design parameters like intermediate temperature so that the
   system yields optimum performance. Independently developed property
   codes have been employed for both carbon dioxide and propane for higher
   accuracy. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) solid
   dispersions with Felodipine or Hesperetin having up to 20 wt\% drug were
   prepared using solvent evaporation method. Solid dispersions in
   comparison with their physical mixtures were studied using differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD),
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and hot stage polarizing light
   microscopy (HSM). PVP formulations with low drug load proved to be
   amorphous, since no crystalline Felodipine or Hesperetin drugs were
   detected using DSC and WAXD. Low and fast heating rates were applied for
   DSC study, to prevent changes in the samples caused during heating.
   Similarity between results of WAXD and DSC was also found in the case of
   physical mixtures, where the drug was in the crystalline state. However,
   though specific tests showed the high sensitivity of the DSC technique,
   it was difficult to arrive to reliable results for PEG solid dispersions
   or physical mixtures with low drug content by DSC, even by high heating
   rates. Crystalline drug could not be detected by DSC, leading to
   erroneous conclusions about the physical state of the drug, in contrast
   to WAXD. On the other hand, HSM proved the presence of small drug

Abstract = {{Many nondestructive testing techniques fail to detect the presence of
   defects inside composite materials due to their complex nature.
   Microwave near-field nondestructive testing utilizing open-ended
   rectangular waveguides showed promising results in detecting defects
   inside these composite structures. Carbon-loaded composites are lossy
   materials, which, in general, reduce the range of frequency that can be
   used to inspect these kinds of composites due to the high attenuation.
   Thus far, open-ended rectangular waveguide based probes have been used
   to inspect the structural integrity and homogeneity of these structures.
   These probes were found to be suitable for detecting defects in these
   composites. However, due to the linear polarization of the fields
   radiated out of open-ended rectangular waveguide probes and the linear
   nature of the carbon fibers, high attenuation of the radiated signal is
   inevitable. Consequently, only close to the surface defects were
   detected. Circular waveguides have not been used in near-field NDT.
   Circular waveguides offer many attractive features such as the circular
   polarization of the radiated waves. This fact might be used in
   penetrating deeper in high-loss composites. In this paper, the potential
   of utilizing rectangular and circular waveguides in inspecting defects
   in carbon-loaded composites will be theoretically investigated. An air
   void will be introduced inside both types of composites and theoretical
   images will be formed. Interpretation of the captured images will be
   done through power patterns in different planes. (C) 2005 Published by

Abstract = {{This study aims to evaluate and compare the early outcome of both
   pancreas-alone transplantation (PTA) and simultaneous kidney-pancreas
   transplantation (SPKT) focusing on the complications affecting the first
   month after the procedures. The records of all patients who underwent
   PTA or SPKT were reviewed. We considered the length of ICU stay, the
   need for postoperative ventilatory support, hemodynamic and metabolic
   data (arterial pH, serum glucose, need for exogenous insulin),
   infectious diseases incidence, microbiological colonization rate and any
   kind of postoperative complication arising during the first month after
   the transplantation. PTA recipients underwent a quicker surgery (P <
   0.01) with shorter ICU stay (P < 0.05) and a lower need for
   postoperative mechanical ventilation (P < 0.05). They also had a higher
   hemodynamic stability (P < 0.05) with less cardiological complications
   (P < 0.05) in the intra- and postoperative phases; bacterial
   colonisation was also less frequent in PTA recipients (P < 0.05). On the
   contrary, no significant difference was noted with regard to
   postoperative nausea/vomiting, sudden myocardial death, ICU
   re-admissions, graft function, rate of rejection, grafts explantation
   and re-transplantation. PTA could be considered as preemptive for severe
   diabetic complications in patients with long-lasting severe type I
   diabetes. However, establishing the correct timing of PTA is of
   paramount importance in order not to expose the patients early to risks
   arising from a major surgery and heavy immunosuppressive treatments.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: There is no consensus about the risk factors for anastomotic
   failure after elective or emergency colorectal surgery. The purpose of
   this study was to analyze the factors that may contribute in
   anastornotic dehiscence. METHODS: A total of 208 patients who underwent
   left colonic resection and primary anastomosis for distal colonic
   emergencies were studied. Preoperative and operative variables analyzed
   for each patient were gender, age, American Society of Anesthesiologists
   score, comorbidities, indication for surgery, etiology of the disease,
   presence and grade of peritonitis, preoperative creatinine, hematocrit,
   hemoglobin, and leukocyte count, need for preoperative and operative
   transfusion. The end point was the clinical evident incidence of
   anastornotic leak. Bivariate comparisons of those patients with or
   without anastomotic leak were unpaired, and all tests of significance
   were two-tailed. A multivariate analysis, in which presentation of
   anastomotic leak was the dependent outcome variable, was performed by
   for-ward stepwise logistic regression model. RESULTS: One hundred five
   patients (50.4 percent) had one or more complications. Anastomotic leak
   was diagnosed in 12 patients (5.7 percent). Seventeen patients (8.2
   percent) needed a reoperation for complication. The overall mortality
   was 6.2 percent (13 patients). Obesity was significant as a predictor of
   anastornotic leak. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is a factor predicting
   anastomotic leak risk after resection and primary anastomosis for
   left-sided colonic emergencies.}},

Abstract = {{Studies were conducted to examine the behavioral response of
   fifth-instar and adult Lygus hesperus Knight (Heteroptera: Miridae) to
   odors associated with a host plant (alfalfa) when presented singly or in
   combination with a visual plant cue (530nm,green light-emitting diode
   {[}LED]). Bioassays were conducted in a modified Y-tube olfactometer,
   where incoming air was filtered and humidified before passing through
   chambers that held plant/conspecific treatments. A LED, placed behind an
   organdy screen at the end of one arm of the Y-tube, simulated a visual
   plant cue. In agreement with our previous findings, fifth-instar and
   adult female L. herperus were attracted to plant/conspecific odor
   combinations, but adult males were not. Independently, the LED also was
   attractive to immature and adult female L. hesperus, and for all life
   stages, a much larger percentage of the bugs walked to the extreme end
   of the Y-tube when the visual cue was present. When visual and volatile
   cues were presented simultaneously, responses by both immature and adult
   (male and female) L. hesperus were significantly enhanced.
   Plant/conspecific treatments that had been marginally acceptable when
   only volatile stimuli were available showed the greatest enhancement in
   response with the addition of the visual cue. Presentation of visual and
   volatile cues together led to a mean increase in the percentage of bugs
   that walked to the extreme end of the Y-tube (nymphs, 36.6\%; females,
   23.4\%; males, 26.1\%). Results are discussed in terms of stage-specific
   responses and how these behavioral differences will likely play a role
   in developing effective trapping and monitoring systems for this
   important pest.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Cardiac resynchronization therapy(CRT) has a beneficial
   effect on clinical symptoms, exercise capacity, and systolic left
   ventricular (LV) performance in patients with heart failure. The aim of
   the current study was to evaluate whether a gender difference exists in
   response to CRT.
   Methods: Consecutive patients with end-stage heart failure (New York
   Heart Association, NYHA, class LV ejection fraction (LVEF) <= 35\%, QRS
   duration > 120 ins, and left bundle branch block configuration underwent
   CRT. At baseline and 6 months post-CRT, clinical and echocardiographic
   parameters were evaluated:follow-up was obtained up to 5 years. The
   effects of CRT were compared between women and men.
   Results: The Study population comprised 137 men and 36 women (mean age
   66 +/- 11 years). No differences in baseline characteristics were
   observed except that nonischemic cardiomyopathy was more frequent in
   women than men (67\% vs 38\%, P < 0.05). In all patients, clinical and
   echocardiogrophic parameters improved significantly at 6-month
   follow-up. The magnitude of improvement in different parameters was
   similar between women and men, e.g., the improvement in NYHA Class was
   0.9 +/- 0.6 in women and 1.0 +/- 0.7 in men (ATS) and the increase in
   LVEFD was 8 +/- 8\% in women as compared to 7 +/- 9\% in men (ATS). The
   percentage of individual responders was not different between women and
   men (76\% vs 80\%, ATS) and 2-year survival was comparable for women and
   men (84\% vs 80\%, NS).
   Conclusion: No gender differences were observed in response to CRT and
   long-term survival after CRT.}},

Abstract = {{In 2002, Ochsner laparoscopic surgeons and nephrologists began placing

   We compared laparoscopically placed PD catheters (LAPD) with catheters
   most recently placed without laparoscopic aid (STPD). The method for
   this study is a retrospective chart review. Demographics of both groups
   were similar. Nine of 20 (45\%) in the STPD group and 16 of 23 (70\%) in
   the LAPD group had had previous abdominal surgery. Three of 20 (15\%) of
   STPD had complications, including one small bowel injury. Four of 23
   (17.4\%) of the LAPD had complications. One of 20 (5\%) in the STPD
   group and 3 of 23 (13\%) in the LAPD group had dialysate leaks. In the
   STPD group, 8 of 20 (40\%) had catheter problems that led to removal in
   7 (35\%). In the LAPD group, 6 of 23 (26\%) had catheter malfunction: 3
   were salvaged with a laparoscopic procedure; 3 (13\%) were removed for
   malfunction. 1) LAPD allows proper PD placement after complex abdominal
   surgery; 2) Although dialysate leak complications are increased, bowel
   perforation risk is less; 3) Because of proper placement, PD catheter
   malfunction rate is less with LAPD; 4) Although no results obtained
   statistical significance, we found LAPD superior to STPD and have
   converted to this technique.}},

   and memory in a variety of tasks. The present study was designed to
   assess the effect of pentoxifylline, an inhibitor of tumor necrosis
   factor alpha (TNF alpha), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) on
   kainate (KA)-induced impairment in spatial memory. Male mice received a
   subcutaneous injection of a dose of KA (15 mg/kg) that had no cytotoxic
   effect on hippocampal neurons as confirmed by Fluorojade B staining.
   This (lose resulted in an impairment of spatial memory in a two-trial
   recognition task 11 days later. Intraperitoneal administration of
   pentoxifylline (200 mg/kg) abrogated this effect. Repeated
   intracerebroventricuar injection of IGF-1 (2 mu g/niouse on day 1
   followed by 1 mu g/mouse on days 2-5) abrogated KA-induced deficits in
   spatial memory whereas acute IGF-1 (2 mu g/mouse on day 1 only) had
   mixed effects. These findings indicate that endogenous TNF alpha is
   probably involved in the detrimental effects of kainate on cognition and
   that exogenous IGF-I can oppose these effects, probably by antagonizing
   TNF alpha-induced neurotoxicity. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper first describes a fuzzy classifier to be used for fault
   diagnosis. Then, the paper presents a refinement of the diagnosis task
   performed with this fuzzy classifier. For each fault, a number of 20
   levels of fault strength have been considered. In previous work, more
   than one single category per fault has been used to improve the
   classifier performance, i.e. distributing the strength levels into
   small, medium and, respectively large strength subsets. However, this
   distribution scheme is too rigid. This paper introduces a flexible
   distribution scheme that takes into account the (di)similarities between
   different strength levels. The refinement proposed here offers better
   insight on the behavior of each fault and it increases separation
   between overlapping faults, which improves the final outcome of the
   diagnosis process.}},

Abstract = {{A direct antigen-capture ELISA based on the detection of mycobacterial
   lipoarabinomannan (LAM) in unprocessed urine was evaluated for its
   usefulness in clinical practice. In Tanzania, 231 patients with
   suspected pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and 103 healthy volunteers were
   screened with standard TB tests and with the new LAM-ELISA. Of 132
   patients with confirmed pulmonary mycobacterial disease (positive sputum
   culture), 106 were positive using the LAM-ELISA (sensitivity 80.3\%). In
   comparison, the sensitivity of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) sputum microscopy
   was 62.1\% (82 of 132 confirmed cases). Of the 231 patients, 17 were
   both culture- and AFB-negative, but had typical radiographic signs of
   pulmonary mycobacterial. infection and did not respond to antibiotic
   treatment. Of these 17 patients, 13 (76.5\%) had positive LAM-ELISA test
   results. To define the specificity of the assay, urine samples from 103
   healthy volunteers were also screened using LAM-ELISA. All. but one had
   an optical density below the cut-off (specificity 99\%). Of interest was
   a significant correlation between Level of microscopic density of
   mycobacteria in sputum and LAM antigen concentration in urine (chi(2) =
   8.44). The LAM-ELISA is a field-adapted tool that can improve screening
   standards in countries with a high incidence of TB. (c) 2005 Royal

Abstract = {{The four questions that Niko Tinbergen identified for behavioural
   biology - evolution, function, development and causation - are all
   important and should be studied in their own right. Recently, there has
   been a debate as to whether these four questions should be investigated
   separately or whether they should be integrated. Integration of the four
   questions has been attempted in novel research disciplines such as
   cognitive ecology, evolutionary psychology and neuroecology. Euan
   Macphail and I have criticised these integrative approaches, suggesting
   that they are fundamentally flawed as they confound function and
   mechanism. Investigating the function or evolutionary history of a
   behaviour or cognitive system is important and entirely legitimate.
   However, such investigations cannot provide us with answers to questions
   about the mechanisms underlying behaviour or cognition. At most,
   functional or evolutionary considerations can provide clues that may be
   useful for a causal analysis of the underlying mechanisms. However,
   these clues can be misleading and are often wrong, as is illustrated
   with examples from song learning and food storing in birds. After
   summarising the main issues in the neuroecology debate, I discuss some
   misunderstandings that were apparent in the responses to our critique,
   as well as some recent relevant data. Recent results do not support the
   neuroecological approach. Finally, I suggest that the way forward is a
   cautious and critical use of functional and evolutionary clues in the
   study of the mechanisms of behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{The gulf pipefish, Syngnathus scovelli is the dominant syngnathid found
   in coastal regions of the Gulf of Mexico and is the only species in this
   region known to occur in both freshwater and saltwater habitats.
   Relatively little is known about the population and reproductive cycles
   of S. scovelli, particularly for those found in low salinity
   environments. The focus of the current study was to collect population
   structure and reproductive data for S. scovelli from a low salinity
   habitat, Meaher Park, located at the mouth of Mobile Bay, Alabama.
   Sampling was conducted twice a month from January 2003 to January 2004.
   Environmental parameters, as well as population and reproductive
   parameters, were collected. Water temperature was the primary abiotic
   factor associated with both the appearance of S. scovelli and their
   breeding cycle. Based on gonadosomatic (GSI) and brood pouch somatic
   indices (BPSI), females and males were reproductively active throughout
   the summer. Peaks in male GSI and BPSI were consistent with the
   subsequent appearance of a large number of juveniles in early fall.
   These events coincided with the higher temperatures seen during late
   summer and early fall. Sex ratios (male : female 1 : 1.64) and
   operational sex ratios (1 : 4.09) indicated that this was a female
   biased population. Although there was no difference in the average size
   of males and females in this population, the largest individuals
   coflected were female. The female-biased sex ratio supports previous
   genetic analyses suggesting that S. scovelli exhibits true sex-role
   reversal and that operational sex ratios are a reliable indicator of the
   intensity of mating competition and sex roles.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To determine whether a paper-based antibiotic ordering
   system is an effective antibiotic stewardship measure.
   Methods: An antibiotic order form (AOF) was introduced in July 2001 at a
   pediatric tertiary care hospital. Vancomycin courses prescribed before
   and after the AOF introduction were retrospectively reviewed based on
   Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee guidelines. The
   impact of the AOF on the appropriateness of vancomycin prescribing was
   evaluated in univariate and multivariable analyses that adjusted for
   other factors associated with appropriateness of vancomycin use. The
   density of vancomycin use after introduction of the AOF was also
   assessed.
   Results: Compliance with the AOF was poor (< 50\%) during the planned
   study period; therefore an additional 2 months of improved compliance
   (70-80\%) were included. Rates of inappropriate vancomycin use increased
   during the study periods: 35\% before AOF; 39\% post-AOF; and 51\%
   during the improved compliance period. On adjusted analysis, vancomycin
   utilization was significantly more inappropriate after introduction of
   the AOF. Vancomycin doses per 1000 patient days increased after
   introduction of the AOF.
   Conclusions: Inappropriate vancomycin use and vancomycin use overall
   increased after the introduction of an AOF An AOF intervention did not
   have its intended effect of improving and reducing vancomycin use.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of relating state-based intraagent (or intraobject)
   behavioral descriptions with scenario-based interagent (interobject)
   descriptions has recently focused much interest among the software
   engineering community. This paper compiles the results of our
   investigation of this problem. As interagent formalism, we adopt a
   simple variant of Live Sequence Charts. For the intraagent perspective,
   we consider a game-theoretic foundation, looking at agents as
   ``strategies,{''} which encompasses the popular ``state-based{''}
   paradigm. Three classes of relationships between models are studied:
   scenario checking (called eLSC checking), synthesis, and verification.
   We set a formally defined theoretical stage that allows us to express
   these three problems very simply, to discuss their complexity, and to
   describe optimal solutions. Our study reveals the intrinsic high
   computational difficulty of these tasks. Consequently, many related
   problems and solutions are surveyed, some of which can be the basis for
   practical solutions. In this, we also offer a panorama of current
   research and directions for the future.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Arthroscopic treatment of complete meniscal lesions is well
   established. Nevertheless there is discussion, how to treat incomplete
   meniscal tears, especially in younger and active patients. This study
   was designed to evaluate our standard-therapy without refixation of the
   meniscus. Method: Between 7/89 and 3/01 in 47 patients (48 knees, 0 age
   29 years) an incomplete meniscal lesion following sports injury was
   found. The lesions were revitalized by ``needling{''} or shaving. We
   performed no refixation. All patients had a postoperative flexion limit
   in an orthosis for 6 weeks. The follow-up examination was performed 6.5
   (2-14) years postoperative. Results: The avarageLysholm-Score increased
   significantly from 55 points preoperative to 92 points at the follow-up
   examination. The Tegner-Score increased from 3.3 points preoperative to
   6.2 points at the follow-up examination. The overall result was rated
   ``exellent{''} and ``good{''} by 83\% of the patients, ``fair{''} by
   15\% of the patients and ``poor{''} by 2 \% of the patients. Return to
   sports activity was possible at an avarage of 7 (3 - 12) months
   postoperative. Conclusions: In summary we found, that shaving and
   ``needling{''} of an incomplete meniscal lesion in combination with
   partial synovectomi and standardized postoperative treatment leads to a
   high healing rate. A limited flexion for 6 weeks postoperativ in an
   orthosis at full weight bearing is recommended. In case of complete
   healing of the lesion the chon-droprotective and joint stabilizing
   function of the meniscus, especially in young and active patients is
   obtained.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the results of archaeobotanical examination of
   remains from the medieval complex of Ras in Serbia. The samples were
   collected from the fortress situated on the hilltop (Gradina) and from a
   settlement below (Podgradje) during the archaeological excavations of
   1972-1984. They were taken primarily from the buildings containing
   charred cereals dating to the 12th and 13th centuries. The main staple
   was bread wheat, followed by rye. Grains of barley, oats, and millet
   were also present. The weeds, including ruderals, were represented by
   many species. Agrostemma githago (corn cockle) was an important
   contaminant of the cereal fields. Exceptional finds include a piece of
   charred round bread, the cereal content of a pot, and peach stone
   fragments. Previous information about the agriculture and food in
   medieval Serbia was based solely on documents that were either written
   after this period or that were not pertinent to the region. This study
   is the first direct evidence providing information about agriculture and

Abstract = {{Research on the modularity of perceptual and cognitive processes has
   often pointed to a ventral-dorsal distinction in cortical pathways that
   depend upon the nature of the stimuli and the task. However, it is not
   clear whether the dorsal, occipital-parietal stream specializes in
   locating visual objects (i.e., a ``where{''} stream), or taking action
   toward objects (i.e., a ``how{''} stream), although there is some
   consensus for a ventral, occipital-temporal ``what{''} stream that
   specializes in the identification of visual objects. It is also not
   clear to what extent word and picture processing are modular along these
   streams, as functional imaging maps to date have not addressed the
   modularity question directly. Here we present two types of functional
   imaging maps that directly show modularity and intersection of
   processing function for word and picture stimuli in tasks that require
   decisions about ``what is{''}, ``where is{''}, or ``how do you interact
   with{''} a stimulus (N=6 participants). Our results reveal a middle
   dorsal ``how{''} stream with some modular regions of activation that are
   distinct from activation during ``where{''} processing, and that words
   and pictures involve several modular regions of activation along these
   streams.}},

   task and ego orientation in physical education. The modified version was
   translated into Italian and administered to 1,547 students, 786 girls
   and 761 boys ages 14 to 19 years, to examine the factor structure. To
   evaluate the goodness of fit of the expected two-factor solution as in
   the original questionnaire, confirmatory factor analysis was conducted
   on four samples of boys and girls of two classes of age (14-16 and 17-19
   years). Across sex and age, chi(2)/df ratios were less than 5.0, fit
   indices (GFI, NNFI, and CFI) not less than .90, and root mean square
   error of approximation (RMSEA) below .10. Thus, the two-factor solution
   of the questionnaire was Supported. In the total sample, the two scales
   showed good internal consistency, with Cronbach alpha values of .92 for
   the Ego factor and .83 for the Task factor. The Ego factor accounted for
   34.1\% of variance and the Task factor accounted for 21.0\% of variance.}},

Abstract = {{The break-up of Pangea began during the Triassic and was preceded by a
   generalized Permo-Triassic formation of continental rifts along the
   future margins between Africa and Europe, between Africa and North
   America, and between North and South America. During the Middle-Late
   Triassic, an ocean basin cutting the eastern equatorial portion of the
   Pangea opened as a prograding branch of the Paleotethys or as a new
   ocean ( the Eastern Tethys); westwards, continental rift basins
   developed. The Western Tethys and Central Atlantic began to open only
   during the Middle Jurassic. The timing of the break-up can be
   hypothesized from data from the oceanic remnants of the
   peri-Mediterranean and peri-Caribbean regions ( the Mesozoic ophiolites)
   and from the Atlantic ocean crust. In the Eastern Tethys, Middle-Late
   Triassic mid-oceanic ridge basalt ( MORB) ophiolites, Middle-Upper
   Jurassic MORB, island arc tholeiite (IAT) supra-subduction ophiolites
   and Middle-Upper Jurassic metamorphic soles occur, suggesting that the
   ocean drifting was active from the Triassic to the Middle Jurassic. The
   compressive phases, as early as during the Middle Jurassic, were when
   the drifting was still active and caused the ocean closure at the
   Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary and, successively, the formation of the
   orogenic belts. The present scattering of the ophiolites is a
   consequence of the orogenesis: once the tectonic disturbances are
   removed, the Eastern Tethys ophiolites constitute a single alignment. In
   the Western Tethys only Middle-Upper Jurassic MORB ophiolites are
   present-this was the drifting time. The closure began during the Late
   Cretaceous and was completed during the Eocene. Along the area linking
   the Western Tethys to the Central Atlantic, the break-up was realized
   through left lateral wrench movements. In the Central Atlantic - the
   link between the Western Tethys and the Caribbean Tethys - the drifting
   began at the same time and is still continuing. The Caribbean Tethys
   opened probably during the Late Jurassic - Early Cretaceous. The general
   picture rising from the previous data suggest a Pangea break-up
   rejuvenating from east to west, from the Middle-Late Triassic to the
   Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous.}},

Abstract = {{Hyaluronan (HA) has been implicated in breast cancer progression and
   metastasis to lymph nodes. Although breast cancer has a strong
   propensity for metastasis to the bone, the role of HA in the development
   of bone metastasis in breast cancer is not well delineated. In order to
   determine the role of HA in breast cancer induced osteolysis, we
   examined the effect of secretory products in the conditioned medium of
   breast cancer cell lines on the expression of hyaluronan synthases
   (HAS), accumulation of HA in pericellular matrix, secretion of HA in the
   culture media, and on expression of surface HA receptors, in a human
   immature osteoblast cell line (Hfob). Our results show that conditioned
   medium derived from breast cancer cells upregulate the expression of
   hyaluronan synthases, HAS1 and HAS2, followed by significant increase in
   pericellular and secreted HA in Hfob cells. Our results further
   demonstrate that both CD44 and receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility
   (RHAMM) are involved in binding cell surface associated HA on Hfob
   cells. Analysis of the growth factors in the conditioned medium
   implicates TGF-beta 1 in the modulation of HAS1 and HAS2, as well as in
   the increase in pericellular and secreted HA. This report is the first
   to show that soluble factors produced by breast cancer cells mediate
   increase in HA production in osteoblasts.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of particle shape on filtration processes was
   investigated. Two types of particles, including spherical polystyrene
   latex (PSL) and iron oxide, and perfect cubes of magnesium oxide, were
   examined. It was found that the removal efficiency of spherical
   particles on fibrous filters is very similar for corresponding sizes
   within the range of 50-300 nm, regardless of the fact that the densities
   of PSL and iron oxide differ by a factor of five. On the other hand, the
   removal efficiency of magnesium oxide cubic particles was measured, and
   found to be much lower than the removal efficiency for the
   aerodynamically similar spheres. Such disparity was ascribed to the
   different nature of the motion of the spherical and cubic particles
   along the fiber surface, following the initial collision. After touching
   the fiber surface and before coming to rest, the spherical particles
   could either slide or roll compared to the cubic ones, which could
   either slide or tumble. During tumbling, the area of contact between the
   particle and the fiber changes significantly, thus affecting the bounce
   probability, whilst for the spheres, the area of contact remains the
   same for any point of the particle trajectory. The extra probability of
   particle bounce by the cubes was derived fromthe experimental data. The
   particle kinetic energy was proposed to be responsible for the
   difference in removal efficiency of particles with alternative shapes,
   if all other process parameters remain the same. The increase in kinetic
   energy is shown to favor the increase of the bounce probability.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. A technique is presented that may prevent damage to the
   genitofemoral nerve during percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of renal
   cell carcinomas. The genitofemoral nerve originates from the upper part
   of the lumbar plexus and descends laterally along the psoas major
   muscle, which is anatomically close to the kidney. During radiofrequency
   ablation, nearby healthy nerve tissue could be damaged by heat
   conductance. In the described technique, the radiofrequency applicator
   within the renal tumor is used as a lever to displace the kidney away
   from the psoas muscle.
   CONCLUSION. Three clinical cases are presented in this study. In one
   case, the technique was not applied, leading to coagulation of the
   genitofemoral nerve. In the other two cases, hazard to the genitofemoral
   nerve was averted by using the mentioned technique.}},

Abstract = {{Specimens of Antennella sp. were collected by scuba diving during the
   austral summer on the outer slope of the fringing reefs located on the
   western coast of La Reunion (55 degrees 30'E, 21 degrees 50'S) where the
   species forms microscopic colonies on red algae. A fertile colony was
   kept alive in a closed system in the laboratory. Like other Antennella
   species, it exhibits hermaproditism and sexual dimorphism: gonangia of
   both sexes are on the same stern, with female gonothecae being clearly
   bigger than male. In both sexes we observed cryptomedusoids with a
   subumbrellar cavity, an eccentric spadix surrounded by the gametes and a
   ring of refringent corpuscles on top. Male gonothecae have a compact
   blue-grey homogeneous mass of spermatozoa while females contain circa
   five white-opaque oocytes with a clearly visible darker nucleus. When
   the gametes were mature, one day after collection, medusoid tissues slid
   towards the base of the gonotheca in both sexes. Female gametes remained
   free inside the gonotheca while spetmatozoa were liberated in the
   aquarium and fertilized oocytes. Several embryos at different stages of
   embryonic development (from morula to blastula) were incubated in a
   single gonotheca. The planula was not observed. This study revealed a
   previously undescribed pattern of sexual reproduction in the family
   Halopterididae involving unreleased cryptomedusoids instead of fixed
   sporosacs. This may be a more advanced regression stage of the medusa
   than free cryptomedusoids encountered in related families.}},

   learns to predict optimizable request patterns by observing the
   application's request stream during a training phase. We also describe
   the types of query pattern rewrites that Scalpel's cost-based optimizer
   considers. Finally, we present empirical results that show the costs and

Abstract = {{Primaquine- induced hemolytic anemia is known to result from premature
   sequestration of damaged ( but intact) erythrocytes by the spleen. We
   have shown previously that a phenolic metabolite, 5- hydroxyprimaquine (
   5- HPQ), is a direct- acting hemolytic agent in rats, suggesting that 5-
   HPQ is a mediator of the hemolytic response to primaquine. To
   investigate the fate of erythrocytes in vivo after in vitro exposure to
   5- HPQ, rat Cr-51-labeled erythrocytes were incubated with hemolytic
   concentrations of 5- HPQ and then readministered intravenously to rats.
   The time course of loss of radioactivity from blood and uptake into the
   spleen and liver was measured. In rats given 5- HPQ-treated
   erythrocytes, an increased rate of removal of radioactivity from the
   circulation was observed as compared with the vehicle control. The loss
   of blood radioactivity was accompanied by a corresponding increase in
   radioactivity appearing in the spleen but not in the liver. When rats
   were pretreated with clodronate- loaded liposomes to deplete splenic
   macrophages, there was a decreased rate of removal of radioactivity from
   the circulation and a markedly diminished uptake into the spleen. A role
   for phagocytic removal of 5- HPQ- treated red cells was confirmed in
   vitro using the J774A. 1 macrophage cell line. Furthermore, depletion of
   red cell GSH with diethyl maleate significantly enhanced in vitro
   phagocytosis of 5- HPQ- treated red cells. The data indicate that
   splenic macrophages are responsible for removing 5- HPQ- treated red
   cells and support the postulate that this metabolite is a contributor to
   the hemolytic anemia induced after administration of the parent
   compound.}},

Abstract = {{Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major cause of
   health care-associated infections. Multiple factors, including
   transmission from unrecognized reservoirs of MRSA, are responsible for
   failure to control the spread of MRSA. We conducted prospective
   surveillance to determine the frequency of gastrointestinal colonization
   with MRSA among patients and its possible impact on nosocomial
   transmission of MRSA. Stool specimens submitted for Clostridium
   difficile toxin A/B assays were routinely inoculated on
   colistin-naladixic acid agar plates, and S. aureus was identified by
   using standard methods. Methicillin resistance was confirmed by growth
   on oxacillin-salt screening agar. For patients whose stool yielded MRSA,
   information regarding any previous cultures positive for MRSA or other
   organisms that would require contact precautions was obtained from the
   laboratory's computer system. During a 1-year period, 151 (9.8\%) of
   1,543 patients who had one or more stool specimens screened had MRSA in
   their stool. Ninety-three (62\%) of the 151 patients had no previous
   history of MRSA colonization or infection. Of these 93, 75 were
   inpatients. Sixty (80\%) of the 75 inpatients with no previous history
   of MRSA were not under ``contact precautions.{''} The 60 patients would
   have spent an estimated total of 267 days without being placed under
   contact precautions if their positive stool cultures had not resulted in
   their being isolated. Placing patients under contact precautions based
   on their positive stool cultures prevented an estimated 35 episodes of
   MRSA transmission. We conclude that gastrointestinal colonization with
   MRSA may serve as an unrecognized reservoir from which transmission of
   MRSA may occur in health care facilities.}},

Abstract = {{The freestream composition is an important parameter in ground-based
   aerodynamic testing, and direct measurement of it is very important.
   This paper reports extensive composition measurements in the freestream
   of the T4 free-piston shock-tunnel, employing a recently improved
   time-of-flight mass spectrometer. A wide range of nozzle reservoir
   conditions were used. The results show good agreement between measured
   and theoretical values for nitric oxide over the entire enthalpy range
   reported (2.5-13 MJ/kg). This provides confidence that the chemistry
   model is correctly predicting sudden freezing of NO in the nozzle
   expansion. On the other hand, no monatomic species have been measured
   other than those produced by dissociative ionisation within the mass
   spectrometer, even at flow conditions where significant freestream
   dissociation is expected. Furthermore, excess diatomic oxygen is
   detected at high enthalpies. These observations are consistent with the
   possibility that oxygen recombination is not correctly predicted in the
   nozzle expansion, with sudden freezing occurring significantly later
   than predicted. However, the observations are also consistent with
   possible catalytic recombination in the skimmer system. The possibility
   for producing an empirical correlation between the freestream
   composition and the reservoir entropy has also been observed.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to assess whether the association with social
   class differed between allergic rhinitis and asthma and whether these
   associations have changed over time.
   The Swedish Military Service Conscription Register was linked to two
   other national registers for 1,247,038 male conscripts in successive
   cohorts born between 1952 and 1977.
   The percentage of asthma cases associated with allergic rhinitis was
   15\% in the oldest cohort and 44\% in the youngest cohort. Low
   socio-economic status (SES) was associated with an increased risk
   (assessed as odds ratio) of asthma without allergic rhinitis (1.14, 95\%
   confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.17) but a slightly reduced risk of
   asthma with allergic rhinitis (0.96, 95\% CI 0.93-1.00). The risk of
   allergic rhinitis was 0.84, 95\% CI 0.82-0.85. A positive interaction
   between SES and year of birth occurred in all three conditions. Low SES
   was related to a reduced risk of asthma with allergic rhinitis in the
   earliest cohort (0.72, 95\% CI 0.53-0.82) but a slightly increased risk
   in the most recent cohort (1.07, 95\% CI 1.01-1.14).
   In conclusion, the role of social class has changed over, time. The
   steepest increase in asthma and allergic rhinitis occurred in conscripts
   with a low socio-economic status.}},

Abstract = {{In accordance with the median voter theorem the median legislator is
   decisive in representative democracy. If the preferences of the median
   legislator differ from the preferences of the median voter in the
   polity, fiscal policy choices will predictably diverge from those
   favored by the median voter. This paper seeks to identify the median
   district (and therein the preferences driving the median legislator) in
   American State legislatures. Using economic characteristics of
   constituents, we find substantial differences between the median
   district and the statewide median. As the income of the median district
   rises above the median income of the polity, government expenditures
   increase. In addition, the degree to which income is skewed across
   legislative districts affects spending for redistribution programs.
   Finally, we find that direct democracy procedures, which allow the
   statewide median voter to check legislative decisions, limit the impact
   of differences between the district and polity medians.}},

Abstract = {{New imaging technologies are revealing ever- greater details of motor
   behavior in fetuses for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Understanding
   the form, mechanisms, and significance of fetal behavior will maximize
   imaging applications. The chick is readily available for experimentation
   throughout embryogenesis, making it an excellent model for this purpose.
   Yet in 40 yr since Hamburger and colleagues described chick embryonic
   behavior, we have not determined if motility belongs to a developmental
   continuum fundamental to posthatching behavior. This study examined
   kinematics and synchronized electromyography ( EMG) during spontaneous
   limb movements in chicks at four time points between embryonic days ( E)
   9 - 18. We report that coordinated kinematic and/ or EMG patterns were
   expressed at each time point. Variability observed in knee and ankle
   excursions at E15 - E18 sorted into distinct in- phase and out- of-
   phase patterns. EMG patterns did not directly account for out- of- phase
   patterns, indicating study of movement biomechanics will be critical to
   fully understand motor control in the embryo. We also provide the first
   descriptions of 2- to 10- Hz limb movements emerging E15 - E18 and a
   shift from in- phase to out- of- phase interlimb coordination E9 - E18.
   Our findings revealed that coordinated limb movements persist across
   development and suggest they belong to a developmental continuum for
   locomotion. Limb patterns were consistent with the half center model for
   a locomotor pattern generator. Achievement of these patterns by E9 may
   thus indicate the embryo has completed a critical phase beyond which
   developmental progression may be less vulnerable to experimental
   perturbations or prenatal events.}},

Journal = {{BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{392}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{363-373}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{The mechanisms of the mitochondrial toxicity of AZT (azidothymidine;
   zidovudine) are not clear. The two main contenders are the incorporation
   of phosphorylated AZT into the mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) and the
   competitive inhibition of natural deoxynucleotide metabolism, We have
   built a computational model of AZT metabolism in mitochondria in order
   to better understand these toxicity mechanisms. The model includes the
   transport of non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of AZT into
   mitochondria, phosphorylation, and incorporation into mtDNA. The model
   also includes the mitochondrial metabolism of the natural
   deoxynucleotides. We define three simulated cell types, i.e. rapidly
   dividing, slowly dividing and postmitotic cells. Our standard simulation
   indicates that incorporation of AZT into mtDNA is highest in rapidly
   dividing cells because of the higher mitochondrial AZTTP
   (3'-azidothymidine-5'-triphosphate)/dTTP ratio in this cell type.
   However, under these standard conditions the rate of incorporation into
   mtDNA is too low to be a major cause of toxicity. These simulations
   relied on the assumption that phosphorylated AZT is transported with the
   same kinetics as phosphorylated thymidine. In simulations with
   mitochondria set to have a limited ability to transport phosphorylated
   AZT, AZTTP accumulates to toxic levels in the mitochondria of
   postmitotic cells, while low levels are maintained in mitochondria from
   rapidly dividing cells. This result is more consistent with the tissue
   toxicities observed in patients. Our model also predicts that inhibition
   by AZT of mitochondrial deoxycytidine phosphorylation by thymidine
   kinase 2 may contribute to the mitochondrial toxicity, since in
   simulations using a typical peak plasma AZT level the mtDNA replication
   rate is decreased by 30\% in postmitotic cell simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Infective hookworm L3 encounter a host specific signal during invasion
   that re-activates suspended developmental pathways. Response to this cue
   is critical for the successful infection and completion of the life
   cycle in the host. In the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans,
   recovery from the developmentally arrested dauer stage in response to
   environmental cues is analogous to the resumption of development in
   invading hookworm L3. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and
   insulin-like signalling pathways mediate dauer formation and recovery.
   An insulin-like signalling pathway mediates L3 activation in hookworms.
   To determine the role of TGF-beta signalling in hookworm infection, an
   ortholog of the C elegans TGF-beta signalling molecule daf-7 was cloned
   and characterised. Sequence from a hookworm expressed sequence tag was
   used to design specific primers for PCR amplification of Ac-daf-7 from
   Ancylostoma caninum infective L3 cDNA. Amplicons from the 5' and 3' ends
   were cloned, sequenced, and combined to create a full-length composite
   Ac-daf-7 cDNA sequence. The 1634 nucleotide cDNA encoded a 355 amino
   acid open reading frame with significant homology to Ce-DAF-7 and other
   TGF-beta signalling molecules. The deduced amino acid sequence contained
   seven conserved cysteines characteristic of TGF-beta family members, as
   well as two additional conserved cysteines found in members of the
   TGF-beta/activin subfamily. Ac-DAF-7 contains a characteristic
   C-terminal ligand domain that is predicted to be released from a
   propeptide by proteolytic cleavage at a tetrabasic cleavage site.
   Ac-daf-7 mRNA was strongly detected by reverse transcriptase PCR in L3
   and serum stimulated L3 cDNA, and weakly in cDNA from L1 and adult life
   cycle stages. Antiserum against Escherichia coli expressed recombinant
   Ac-DAF-7 detected the mature protein in L3 and adult soluble extracts,
   but not in excretory/secretory products from serum stimulated L3 or
   adults. Increased expression in arrested L3 stages suggests that
   Ac-daf-7 is important for developmental arrest. (c) 2005 Australian

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives. To compare prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and PSA density
   (PSAD) calculated by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) volume (TRUS PSAD),
   pathologic volume (Path PSAD), and weight (Weight PSAD) for their
   ability to predict pathologic characteristics and biochemical recurrence
   of prostate cancer. We also compared all PSAD derivatives to determine
   consistency.
   Methods. Between 1993 and 2002, 306 patients were retrospectively
   identified who had had PSAD determined preoperatively by TRUS and
   subsequently underwent radical prostatectomy with whole mounting and
   close step sectioning. The determination of stage, margin status, tumor
   number, individual tumor volume, and total tumor volume was obtained
   from the pathologic evaluation. Clinical follow-up was available for 265
   patients.
   Results. The mean patient age was 62 years, the median Gleason score was
   7, the median PSA level was 5.80 ng/mL, and the median TRUS PSAD was
   0.16. The percentages of concordance for PSA, TRUS PSAD, Path PSAD, and
   Weight PSAD were similar in predicting margin status and extracapsular
   extension. Using linear regression analysis, PSA was more efficacious
   than TRUS PSAD, Path PSAD, or Weight PSAD in predicting the total tumor
   volume (R-2 0.11, 0.08, 0.04, and 0.06, respectively). A significant
   positive correlation was found among TRUS PSAD, Path PSAD, and Weight
   PSAD. PSA was significantly better in predicting biochemical recurrence
   than TRUS, Path, or Weight PSAD (concordance 75.5\%, 66.6\%, 66.5\%, and
   70.4\%, respectively).
   Conclusions. PSA and TRUS PSAD are significant and equivalent predictors
   of margin status and extracapsular extension. A marked difference may
   exist between PSA and TRUS PSAD in predicting the total tumor volume and
   biochemical recurrence.}},

   VRX494-transduced CEMx174 cells resulted in potent inhibition of HIV-1
   and several SHIV strains. To evaluate the potential efficacy of the
   VRX494 vector for stem cell gene therapy, rhesus CD34(+) bone marrow
   cells were transduced with VRX494 and then cultured on thymus stroma to
   induce T cell differentiation. Transduction conditions for CD34(+) cells
   were optimized to yield high transduction efficiency with minimal
   effective multiplicity of infection. Purified CD4(+) GFP(+) T cells
   derived from VRX494-transduced CD34(+) cells strongly inhibited SHIV

   antisense inhibitor in VRX494-transduced cells was upregulated by Tat.
   Analysis of HIV-1 envelope sequences in VRX494-transduced cells revealed
   modifications consistent with those mediated by double-stranded

Abstract = {{Ground-based measurements on 15 Minnesota lakes with wide ranges of
   optical properties and Landsat TM data from the same lakes were used to
   evaluate the effect of humic color on satellite-inferred water quality
   conditions. Color (C-440), as measured by absorbance at 440 nm, causes
   only small biases in estimates of Secchi disk transparency (SDT) from
   Landsat TM data, except at very high values (> similar to 300
   chloroplatinate units, CPU). Similarly, when chlorophyll a (chl a)
   levels are moderate or high (> 10 pg/L), low-to-moderate levels of humic
   color have only a small influence on the relationship between SDT and
   chl a concentration, but it has a pronounced influence at high levels of
   C-440 (e.g., > similar to 200 CPU). However, deviations from the general
   chi a-SDT relationship occur at much lower C. values (similar to 60 CPU)
   when chi a levels are low. Good statistical relationships were found
   between optical properties of lake water generally associated with algal
   abundance (SDT, chi a, turbidity) and measured brightness of various
   Landsat TM bands. The best relationships for chi a (based on R 2 and
   absence of statistical outliers or lakes with large leverage) were
   combinations of bands 1, 2, or 4 with the band ratio 1:3 (R-2 = 0.88).
   Although TM bands 14 individually or as simple ratios were poor
   predictors of C., multiple regression analyses between ln(C-440) and
   combinations of bands 1-4 and band ratios yielded several relationships
   with R-2 > 0.70, suggesting that C-440 can be estimated with fair
   reliability from Landsat TM data.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Positron emission tomography is the most advanced scintigraphic
   imaging technology and can be employed in the planning of radiation
   therapy (RT). The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible role of
   fused images (anatomical CT and functional FDG-PET), acquired with a
   dedicated PET/CT scanner, in delineating gross tumour volume (GTV) and
   clinical target volume (CTV) in selected patients and thus in
   facilitating RT planning.
   Methods: Twenty-eight patients were examined, 24 with lung cancer (17
   non-small cell and seven small cell) and four with non-Hodgkin's
   lymphoma in the head and neck region. All patients underwent a
   whole-body PET scan after a CT scan. The CT images provided
   morphological volumetric information, and in a second step, the
   corresponding PET images were overlaid to define the effective target
   volume. The images were exported off-line via an internal network to an
   RT simulator.
   Results: Three patient were excluded from the study owing to change in
   the disease stage subsequent to the PET/CT study. Among the remaining 25
   patients, PET significantly altered the GTV or CTV in 11 (44\%) . In
   five of these 11 cases there was a reduction in GTV or CTV, while in six
   there was an increase in GTV or CTV.
   Conclusion: FDG-PET is a highly sensitive imaging modality that offers
   better visualisation of local and locoregional tumour extension. This
   study confirmed that co-registration of CT data and FDG-PET images may
   lead to significant modifications of RT planning and patient management.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new station for full-scale measurement of wave
   overtopping at the Rome yacht harbour rubble mound breakwater in Ostia
   (Italy) and the results of the successful first measurement campaign
   carried out during the winter season 2003-2004. The equipment and the
   research activities were supported by the EU project CLASH, focusing on
   scale effects for wave overtopping at coastal structures. The site is
   characterized by a very small tidal range, a long shallow foreshore and
   depth-limited breaking waves which interact with a shallow sloping
   porous rock structure. Overtopping water is collected by a steel tank
   installed on the crown slab behind the parapet wall. The measurement of
   water level variation inside the tank by means of two pressure
   transducers allows the calculation of individual overtopping volumes.
   Incident waves, sea levels and wind are also measured. During seven
   independent storms, more than 400 individual overtopping events were
   recorded and about 86 h of valid data are available. This extensive
   dataset is presented, discussed and then used for comparison with two
   commonly used overtopping prediction formulae based on small-scale model
   tests showing their tendency to underestimate the prototype results. A
   strong correlation between the hourly mean overtopping discharge and
   corresponding maximum volume is also presented. The paper generally
   confirms the validity of the approach used in Troch et al. (2004)

Abstract = {{This study views each protein structure as a network of noncovalent
   connections between amino acid side chains. Each amino acid in a protein
   structure is a node, and the strength of the noncovalent interactions
   between two amino acids is evaluated for edge determination. The protein
   structure graphs (PSGs) for 232 proteins have been constructed as a
   function of the cutoff of the amino acid interaction strength at a few
   carefully chosen values. Analysis of such PSGs constructed on the basis
   of edge weights has shown the following: 1), The PSGs exhibit a complex
   topological network behavior, which is dependent on the interaction
   cutoff chosen for PSG construction. 2), A transition is observed at a
   critical interaction cutoff, in all the proteins, as monitored by the
   size of the largest cluster (giant component) in the graph. Amazingly,
   this transition occurs within a narrow range of interaction cutoff for
   all the proteins, irrespective of the size or the fold topology. And 3),
   the amino acid preferences to be highly connected (hub frequency) have
   been evaluated as a function of the interaction cutoff. We observe that
   the aromatic residues along with arginine, histidine, and methionine act
   as strong hubs at high interaction cutoffs, whereas the hydrophobic
   leucine and isoleucine residues get added to these hubs at low
   interaction cutoffs, forming weak hubs. The hubs identified are found to
   play a role in bringing together different secondary structural elements
   in the tertiary structure of the proteins. They are also found to
   contribute to the additional stability of the thermophilic proteins when
   compared to their mesophilic counterparts and hence could be crucial for
   the folding and stability of the unique three-dimensional structure of
   proteins. Based on these results, we also predict a few residues in the
   thermophilic and mesophilic proteins that can be mutated to alter their
   thermal stability.}},

   quality of the resulting image is not acceptable. A new type of coding
   structure is proposed, which maintains a high capacity but lowers the
   level of noise. Secondly, an adaptive algorithm is used to identify
   pixel values that have a high capacity to distortion ratio. Also the
   maximum size of the coding structures is limited to improve the
   capacity/distortion tradeoff. For the tested images, an average capacity
   of nearly 6 bits/pixel was achieved with a peak signal to noise ratio of

Abstract = {{Teenagers may engage in consumption behaviors that their parents may not
   approve of as one way of asserting independence. Such behaviors may lead
   teens to attempt to deceive their parents about purchases. This research
   examined teens' tendency toward such deception. The authors
   conceptualize deception as being related to the family communication
   environment and the shopping context in which it takes place. Some
   family communication environments may stifle open discussion of products
   and put-chases, thereby encouraging teen deception. Moreover certain
   patterns of family communication may socialize teens to focus on
   standards exogenous to the family that, in turn, lead to a greater
   propensity to deceive. Susceptibility to normative peer influence, the
   extent of television viewing, and teen materialism may partially mediate
   the effects of the family communication environment. Except for
   television viewing, the authors' predictions are generally supported by
   the data collected from a sample of high school students.}},

Abstract = {{The ancestral karyotype of the house mouse (Mus musculus) consists of 40
   acrocentric chromosomes, but numerous races exist within the domesticus
   subspecies characterized by different metacentric chromosomes formed by
   the joining at the centromere of two acrocentrics. An exemplary case is
   present on the island of Madeira where six highly divergent chromosomal
   races have accumulated different combinations of 20 metacentrics in
   500-1000 years. Chromosomal cladistic phylogenies were performed to test
   the relative performance of Robertsonian (Rb) fusions, Rb fissions and
   whole-arm reciprocal translocations (WARTs) in resolving relationships
   between the chromosomal races. The different trees yielded roughly
   similar topologies, but varied in the number of steps and branch
   support. The analyses using Rb fusions/fissions as characters resulted
   in poorly supported trees requiring six to eight homoplasious events.
   Allowance for WARTs considerably increased nodal support and yielded the
   most parsimonious trees since homoplasy was reduced to a single event.
   The WART-based trees required five to nine WARTs and 12 to 16 Rb
   fusions. These analyses provide support for the role of WARTs in
   generating the extensive chromosomal diversification observed in house
   mice. The repeated occurrence of Rb fusions and WARTs highlights the
   contribution of centromere-related rearrangements to accelerated rates
   of chromosomal change in the house mouse.}},

Abstract = {{Pharmacokinetic (PK) models simplify biological complexity by dividing
   the body into interconnected compartments. The time course of the
   chemical's amount (or concentration) in each compartment is then
   expressed as a system of ordinary differential equations. The complexity
   of the resulting system of equations can rapidly increase if a precise
   description of the organism is needed. However, difficulties arise when
   the PK model contains more variables and parameters than comfortable for
   mathematical and computational treatment. To overcome such difficulties,
   mathematical lumping methods are new and powerful tools. Such methods
   aim at reducing a differential system by aggregating several variables
   into one. Typically, the lumped model is still a differential equation
   system, whose variables are interpretable in terms of variables of the
   original system. In practice, the reduced model is usually required to
   satisfy some constraints. For example, it may be necessary to keep state
   variables of interest for prediction unlumped. To accommodate such
   constraints, constrained lumping methods have are also available. After
   presenting the theory, we study, here, through practical examples, the
   potential of such methods in toxico/pharmacokinetics. As a tutorial, we
   first simplify a 2-compartment pharmacokinetic model by symbolic
   lumping. We then explore the reduction of a 6-compartment
   physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for 1,3-butadiene with
   numerical constrained lumping. The lumping methods presented here can be
   easily automated, and are applicable to first-order ordinary
   differential equation systems}},

Abstract = {{We examined the prioritization of abruptly appearing and disappearing
   objects in real-world scenes. These scene changes occurred either during
   a fixation (transient appearance/disappearance) or during a saccade
   (nontransient appearance/disappearance). Prioritization was measured by
   the eyes' propensity to be directed to the region of the scene change.
   Object additions and deletions were fixated at rates greater than
   chance, suggesting that both types of scene change are cues used by the
   visual system to guide attention during scene exploration, although
   appearances were fixated twice as often as disappearances, indicating
   that new objects are more salient than deleted objects. New and deleted
   objects were prioritized sooner and more frequently if they occurred
   during a fixation, as compared with during a saccade, indicating an
   important role of the transient signal that often accompanies sudden
   changes in scenes. New objects were prioritized regardless of whether
   they appeared during a fixation or a saccade, whereas prioritization of
   a deleted object occurred only if (1) a transient signal was present or
   (2) the removal of the object revealed previously occluded objects.}},

Journal = {{AGING CELL}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{309-317}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Dietary restriction (DR) is a valuable experimental tool for studying
   the aging process. Primary advancement of research in this area has
   relied on rodent models, but attention has recently turned toward
   Drosophila melanogaster. However, little is known about the baseline
   effects of DR on wild-type Drosophila and continued experimentation
   requires such information. The findings described here survey the
   effects of DR on inbred, wild-type populations of Canton-S fruit flies
   and demonstrate a robust effect of diet on longevity. Over a
   circumscribed range of dietary conditions, healthy lifespan varies by as
   much as 121\% for wild-type Drosophila females. Significant differences
   are also observed for male flies, but the magnitude of the DR effect is
   less robust. Mortality analyses of the survivorship data reveal that
   this variation in lifespan can be attributed to a modulation of the rate
   parameter for the mortality function - a change in the demographic rate
   of aging. Since the feeding of fruit flies is less easily controlled
   than that of rodents, this research also addresses the validity of
   applying a DR model to Drosophila populations. Feeding and body weight
   data for flies given the various dietary conditions surveyed indicate
   that Drosophila on higher-calorie diets consume a similar volume of food
   to those on a low-calorie diet, resulting in different levels of calorie
   intake. Fertility and activity levels demonstrate that the diets
   surveyed are comparable, and that increasing the calorie content of
   laboratory food up to twice the normal concentration is not pathologic
   for experimental fly populations.}},

Abstract = {{The bidirectional nature of late endosome/lysosome movement suggests
   involvement of at least two distinct motors, one minus-end directed and
   one plus-end directed. Previous work has identified dynein as the
   minus-end-directed motor for late endosome/lysosome localization and
   dynamics. Conventional kinesin (kinesin-1) has been implicated in
   plus-end-directed late endosome/lysosome movement, but other kinesin
   family members may also be involved. Kinesin-2 is known to drive the
   movement of pigment granules, a type of lysosomally derived organelle,
   and was recently found to be associated with purified late endosomes. To
   determine whether kinesin-2 might also power endosome movement in
   non-pigmented cells, we overexpressed dominant negative forms of the
   KIF3A motor subunit and KAP3 accessory subunit and knocked down KAP3
   levels using RNAi. We found kinesin-2 to be required for the normal
   steady-state localization of late endosomes/lysosomes but not early
   endosomes or recycling endosomes. Despite the abnormal subcellular
   distribution of late endosomes/lysosomes, the uptake and trafficking of
   molecules through the conventional endocytic pathway appeared to be
   unaffected. The slow time-course of inhibition suggests that both
   kinesin-2 itself and its attachment to membranes do not turn over
   quickly.}},

Abstract = {{Establishing the roles of conserved gene products in bacteria is of
   fundamental importance to our understanding of the core protein
   complement necessary to sustain cellular life. P-loop GTPases and
   related ATPases represent an abundant and remarkable group of proteins
   in bacteria that, in many cases, have evaded characterization. Here,
   efforts aimed at understanding the cellular function of a group of 8
   conserved, poorly characterized genes encoding P-loop GTPases, era, obg,
   trmE, yjeQ, engA, yihA, hflX, ychF, and a related ATPase, yjeE, are
   reviewed in considerable detail. While concrete cellular roles remain
   elusive for all of these genes and considerable pleiotropy has plagued
   their study, experiments to date have frequently implicated the
   ribosome. In the case of era, obg, yjeQ, and engA, the evidence is most
   consistent with roles in ribosome biogenesis, though the prediction is
   necessarily putative. While the protein encoded in trmE clearly has a
   catalytic function in tRNA modification, the participation of its GTPase
   domain remains obscure, as do the functions of the remaining proteins. A
   full understanding of the cellular functions of all of these important
   proteins remains the goal of ongoing studies of cellular phenotype and

Abstract = {{Previous ablation studies in monkeys suggest that prefrontal cortex is
   involved in a wide range of learning and memory tasks. However, monkeys
   with crossed unilateral lesions of frontal and temporal cortex are
   unimpaired at concurrent object-reward association learning but are
   impaired at conditional learning and the implementation of memory-based
   performance rules. We trained seven monkeys preoperatively on an
   associative learning task that required them to associate objects
   embedded in unique complex scenes with reward. Three monkeys then had
   crossed unilateral lesions of frontal and inferior temporal cortex and
   the remaining monkeys had bilateral prefrontal cortex ablation. Both
   groups were severely impaired postoperatively. These results show that
   both bilateral prefrontal cortex ablation and frontal-temporal
   disconnection impair associative learning for objects embedded in
   scenes. The results provide evidence that the function of
   frontal-temporal interactions in memory is not limited to conditional
   learning tasks and memory-dependent performance rules. We propose that
   rapid object-in-place learning requires the interaction of frontal
   cortex with inferotemporal cortex because visual object and contextual
   information which is captured over multiple saccades must be processed
   as a unique complex event that is extended in time. The present results
   suggest a role for frontal-temporal interaction in the integration of
   visual information over time.}},

Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{The Central Graben in the Danish North Sea sector consists of a series
   of N-S to NW-SE trending, eastward-tilted half-grabens, bound to the
   east by the Coffee Soil Fault zone. This fault zone has a complex
   Jurassic history that encompasses at least two fault populations; N-S to
   NNW-SSE striking faults active in the Late Aalenian-Early Oxfordian, and
   NNW-SSE to WNW-ESE striking faults forming in Late Kimmeridgian time
   (sensu gallico), following a short period of tectonic quiescence.
   Sediment transport across the Coffee Soil Fault zone was controlled by
   fault array evolution, and in particular the development of relay ramps
   that formed potential entry points for antecedent drainage systems from
   the Ringkobing-Fyn High east of the rift. Fault and isochore trends of
   the Upper Kimmeridgian-Lower Volgian succession in the northeast Danish
   Central Graben show that accommodation space was initially generated
   close to several minor, isolated or overlapping faults. Subsidence
   became focused along a few master faults in the Early Volgian through
   progressive linkage of selected faults. Seismic time isochore
   geometries, seismic facies, amplitude trends and well ties indicate the
   presence of coarse clastic lithologies locally along the fault zone. The
   deposits probably represent submarine mass flow deposits supplied from
   footwall degradation and possibly also from the graben hinterland via a
   relay ramp. The latter source appears to have been cut off as the relay
   ramp was breached and the footwall block are uplifted. Fault growth and
   linkage processes thus controlled the spatial and temporal trends of
   accommodation space generation and sediment supply to the rift basin.}},

Abstract = {{A 3-year study was done to determine the effects of furrow, microspray,
   surface drip, and subsurface drip irrigation on production and fruit
   quality in mature `Crimson Lady'peach {[}Prunus persica (L.) Batsch]
   trees. Furrow and microspray irrigations were scheduled weekly or
   biweekly, which is common practice in central California, while surface
   and subsurface drip irrigations were scheduled daily. Trees were
   maintained at similar water potentials following irrigation by adjusting
   water applications as needed. Tree size and fruit number were normalized
   among treatments by pruning and thinning each season. Surface and
   subsurface drip produced the largest fruit on average and the highest
   marketable yields among treatments. Drip benefits appeared most related
   to the ability to apply frequent irrigations. Whether water was applied
   above or below ground, daily irrigations by drip maintained higher soil
   water content within the root zone and prevented cycles of water stress
   found between less-frequent furrow and microspray irrigations. With
   furrow and microsprays, midday tree water potentials reached as low as
   -1.4 MPa between weekly irrigations and -1.8 MPa between biweekly
   irrigations, which likely accounted for smaller fruit and lower yields
   in these treatments. To reduce water stress, more frequent irrigation is
   probably impractical with furrow systems but is recommended when
   irrigating during peak water demands by microspray.}},

Abstract = {{Cyclosporine A (CsA) use is associated with several side effects, the
   most important of which is nephrotoxicity that includes, as we
   previously showed, tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis. Recently,
   many researchers have been interested in minimizing these effects by
   pharmacological interventions. To do this, we tested whether the
   administration of a red wine polyphenol, Provinol (PV), prevents the
   development of CsA-induced nephrotoxicity. Rats were treated for 21 days
   and divided into four groups: control; group treated with PV (40
   mg/kg/day by oral administration in tap water); group treated with CsA
   (15 mg/kg/day by subcutaneous injection); group treated with CsA plus
   PV. CsA produced a significant increase of systolic blood pressure; it
   did not affect urinary output, but caused a significant decrease in
   creatinine clearance. These side effects were associated with an
   increase in conjugated dienes, which are lipid peroxidation products,
   inducible NO-synthase (iNOS), and nuclear factor (NF)-kB, which are
   involved in antioxidant damage. However, PV prevented these negative
   effects through a protective mechanism that involved reduction of both
   oxidative stress and increased iNOS and NF-kB expression induced by CsA.
   These results provide a pharmacological basis for the beneficial effects
   of plant-derived polyphenols against CsA-induced renal damage associated
   with CsA.}},

   species is critical to our understanding of how species evolve. As many
   species inhabit large and complex ranges, it is important that
   phylogeographical research take into account the entire range of
   widespread species to clarify how myriad extrinsic variables have
   affected their evolutionary history. Using phylogenetic, nested clade,
   and mismatch distribution analyses on a portion of the mitochondrial COI
   gene, I demonstrate that the wide-ranging freshwater snail Theodoxus
   fluviatilis possesses in parallel many of the phylogeographical patterns
   seen in less widespread freshwater species of Europe. Fragmentary forces
   play a major part in structuring the range of this species, with 12 of
   14 geographically structured nested clades displaying a distribution
   consistent with fragmentation or restricted dispersal. Certain regions
   of southern Europe harbour the majority of genetic diversity (total
   haplotype diversity, H = 0.87), particularly Italy (H = 0.87) and areas
   surrounding the Black Sea (H = 0.81). Post-Pleistocene range expansion
   is pronounced, with the majority of northern European populations (95\%
   of sample sites) having arisen from northern Italian individuals that
   initially colonized northern Germany. Additionally, two highly divergent
   haplotype lineages present in northern Germany imply that there were at
   least two postglacial recolonization routes. Estuaries may also provide
   a means of dispersal given that no genetic differentiation was found
   between estuarine populations and neighbouring freshwater populations.
   Taken together, these data reveal a species with a complex genetic
   history resulting from the fragmentary effects of European geology as
   well as continuous and discrete range expansion related to their aquatic
   biology.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the variety of measuring systems and evaluation routines used by
   international researchers no uniform standards for HRV analysis have
   been achieved so far. The purpose of this study was the cross validation
   of common procedures used for short-time HRV analysis.
   Time (RRinter, SDNN, RMSSD) and frequency (LF, HF, TP, LF/HF-Ratio)
   domain parameters were calculated from simultaneous HRV measurements by
   VarCor PF5 (c) und S810 Polar (R) before and after a standardized
   endurance test in 17 healthy subjects (19-41 years). The calculated
   power spectrums were compared against the results of a customized
   software application (HRV Analysis 1.1, Kuopio, Firmland) developed
   following the Task Force (6) guidelines.
   The results demonstrate high linear relationships between VarCor (c) and
   Polar (R) for the time domain parameters before and after exercise
   (r=0.822-0.998, p < 0.01). In comparison with the HRV Analysis Software
   1. 1, the spectral values of VarCor (c) and Polar (R), revealed low to
   high correlations, depending on the applied detrending method. Using a
   recent trend removal approach, high linear relationships were evaluated
   for VarCor (c) before and after exercise (r=0.888-0.945, p < 0.01). The
   procedure recommended by Bland \& Altman (37) demonstrated systematic
   differences between the examined methods.
   The results demonstrate a sufficient level of agreement between time
   domain measures obtained by short-term HRV analysis. For frequency
   domain parameters, systemic differences are obvious. Further research
   should focus on the standardization of HRV analysis procedures by
   multidisciplinary approaches.}},

Abstract = {{The structure of an AKAP docked to the dimerization/docking (D/D) domain
   of the type II (RII alpha) isoform of protein kinase A (PKA) has been
   well characterized, but there currently is no detailed structural
   information of an AKAP docked to the type I (RI alpha) isoform.
   Dual-specific AKAP2 (D-AKAP2) binds in the nanomolar range to both
   isoforms and provided us with an opportunity to characterize the
   isoform-selective nature of AKAP binding using a common docked ligand.
   Hydrogen/ deuterium (H/D) exchange combined with mass spectrometry
   (DXMS) was used to probe backbone structural changes of an alpha-helical
   A-kinase binding (AKB) motif from D-AKAP2 docked to both RI alpha and
   RII alpha D/D domains. The region of protection upon complex formation
   and the magnitude of protection from H/D exchange were determined for
   both interacting partners in each complex. The backbone of the AKB
   ligand was more protected when bound to RI alpha compared to RII alpha,
   suggesting an increased helical stabilization of the docked AKB ligand.
   This combined with a broader region of backbone protection induced by
   the AKAP on the docking surface of RI alpha indicated that there were
   more binding constraints for the AKB ligand when bound to RI alpha. This
   was in contrast to RII alpha, which has a preformed, localized binding
   surface. These distinct modes of AKAP binding may contribute to the more
   discriminating nature of the RI alpha AKAP-docking surface. DXMS
   provides valuable structural information for understanding binding
   specificity in the absence of a high-resolution structure, and can
   readily be applied to other protein-ligand and protein-protein
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The development of prophylaxes and treatments of bone diseases that can
   effectively increase the strength of bone as a structure necessitates a
   better understanding of the time course by which chemical properties
   define the stiffness of the material during primary and secondary
   mineralization. It was hypothesized that these processes would be
   relatively slow in the actively growing skeleton. Seven-week-old
   Sprague-Dawley female rats (n = 8) were injected with multiple
   fluorochrome labels over a time span of 3 weeks and killed. Chemical and
   mechanical properties of the tibial mid-diaphysis were spatially
   characterized between the endocortical and periosteal surface by in situ
   infrared microspectroscopy and nanoindentation. The phosphate-to-protein
   ratio of bone 2-6 days old was 20\% smaller at the periosteal surface
   and 22\% smaller at the endocortical surface (P < 0.05 each) compared to
   older intracortical regions. The ratios of carbonate to protein,
   crystallinity, type A/type B carbonate, collagen cross-linking, and bone
   elastic modulus did not differ significantly between bone 2-6, 10-14,
   and 8-22 days old and intracortical regions. Intracortical properties of
   10-week-old rats, except for the carbonate-to-protein ratio which was
   23\% smaller (P < 0.01), were not significantly different from
   intracortical matrix properties of young adult rats (5 months, n = 4).
   Spatially, the phosphate-to-protein ratio (R-2 = 0.33) and the
   phosphate-to-carbonate ratio (R-2 = 0.55) were significantly correlated
   with bone material stiffness, while the combination of all chemical
   parameters raised the R-2 value to 0.83. These data indicate that
   lamellar bone has the ability to quickly establish its mechanical and
   chemical tissue properties during primary and secondary mineralization
   even when the skeleton experiences rapid growth.}},

Abstract = {{In summer 2003, a study was performed in thirty Swiss petting zoos with
   the objective to determine the prevalence of zoonotic agents, and to
   describe hygiene measures implemented to reduce the risk of human
   infection. Fecal samples from different animal species were collected
   from the floor of pens to determine the prevalence of Salmonella spp.,
   Campylobacter spp., verocytotoxin producing E. coli/VTEC and Francisella
   tularensis. A questionnaire on hygiene measures, number of animals per
   species, housing system, care procedures and feeding was. administered
   to every petting zoo to estimate exposure of visitors to zoonotic
   microorganisms. In total, 423 fecal samples were examined. Of these
   samples, 41 were positive for Campylobacter spp., which were mainly
   isolates from pigs and poultry (35\% positive samples from each
   species). In pigs, 50\% of the positive samples (6 samples) were typed
   as C. jejuni. The others were typed as C. coli (3) and C. lari (3),
   respectively. Five poultry isolates were typed as C. jejuni, and two as
   C. coli. Two samples were positive for Salmonella spp. Salmonella
   typhimurium was isolated from a goat, the other isolate could not be
   identified by serotyping. Neither Francisella tularensis nor
   verocytotoxin producing E. coli/VTEC were found. The low prevalence of
   zoonotic microorganisms in Swiss petting zoos could be attributed to the
   cleanness of enclosures and animals, low stocking rates and good animal
   care. However, there is room for improvement concerning visitors'
   information on hygiene and hand washing. Furthermore, a strict
   separation between picnic - areas and animals should be enforced.}},

Abstract = {{In order to evaluate the influence of management decisions on the
   nutrient balance of dairy farms a simulation model was developed. Three
   farm systems have been simulated: zero grazing, winter milk and summer
   milk. From the simulated farm systems the zero grazing farm has in all
   scenarios the lowest N-surplus. The winter milk farm system has a higher
   N-surplus than zero grazing but lower than the summer milk farm system.
   The results further indicate the positive effects of maize feeding in
   addition to grazing. More maize in the ration is especially good to
   lower the N-surplus during the grazing period in the summer. The
   benefits of more maize in the ration decrease when the fertilizer
   application rates decrease. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review. The neurocognitive sequelae of anticancer treatment
   have received increasing attention especially among individuals with
   low-grade gliomas, primary central nervous system lymphoma and those
   undergoing prophylactic cranial irradiation for systemic malignancies.
   These groups are especially vulnerable because they often experience
   extended survival during which neurocognitive complications of therapy
   may cause more impairment than the tumor itself. The purpose of this
   review is to highlight recent clinical-reports of neurocognitive
   sequelae among patients without significant central nervous system tumor
   burden and to describe the experimental studies which may explain the
   pathogenesis of the disorder.
   Recent findings. The neurocognitive deficits among survivors of primary
   central nervous system lymphoma without residual tumor and pituitary
   tumors were reported recently. Both provide an opportunity to
   distinguish the effects of treatment from the effects of tumor.
   Moreover, animal studies demonstrate the negative consequences of
   radiation on hippocampal neurogenesis, learning and memory. The
   mechanism of impaired neurogenesis may be due to inflammation, which can
   be aborted with restoration of neurogenesis through the administration
   of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents.
   Summary. If inhibition of neurogenesis is the basis of neurocognitive
   sequelae from irradiation and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents can
   restore neurogenesis then a clinical trial may be worthwhile to confirm
   this benefit in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Non-specific bronchial hyper-responsiveness has been reported in most of
   the eczematous children even in the absence of asthmatic symptoms. We
   therefore investigated the occurrence of exercise-induced
   broncho-constriction (EIB) in children with atopic eczema (AE) and the
   predictors of EIB. Fifty-five children referred to the paediatric clinic
   for AE and a control group of 17 healthy children were recruited. They
   all carried out a physical examination and skin prick test (SPT) both to
   inhalant and food allergens, prior to the exercise challenge test. Their
   parents filled a questionnaire on atopic diseases. They underwent
   exercise challenge test that consisted in free running for 6 min.
   Spirometric measurements were carried out before running and till 11 min
   after. Exercise challenge test was positive in 13 (23\%) children with
   AE. None of the children in the control group had a positive exercise
   challenge test {[}OR (95\% CI) = 1.31 (1.13-1.51); p = 0.030]. Sixteen
   (29\%) eczematous children had a history of EIB. Such history was not
   reliable for identifying children who had a positive exercise test.
   Twenty-nine (52\%) children with AE had asthma. Allergic rhinitis
   affected 33 (60\%) of eczematous children and allergic conjunctivitis 28
   (50\%). EIB was not related to any history of asthma, allergic rhinitis,
   allergic conjunctivitis, severity of eczema or SPT results. Our study
   shows that EIB is common in children with AE. Our data also indicate
   that screening by medical history and physical examination is not a
   sensitive marker of EIB. This may explain why EIB is often ignored in
   eczematous children.}},

Title = {{A new stand-alone anterior lumbar interbody fusion device: Biomechanical
   comparison with established fixation techniques}},
Journal = {{SPINE}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{23}},
Pages = {{2631-2636}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Study Design. Established lumbar fixation methods were assessed
   biomechanically, and a comparison was made with a new stand-alone
   anterior lumbar interbody cage device incorporating integrated anterior
   fixation.
   Objectives. To compare the stability of a new stand-alone anterior
   implant (Test-device) with established fixation methods to assess its
   suitability for clinical use. Our hypothesis being that the Test-device
   would provide stability comparable to that provided by an anterior cage
   when supplemented with posterior pedicle screw fixation.
   Summary of Background Data. It is accepted that the use of rigid pedicle
   screw instrumentation increases the chance of achieving a solid fusion,
   but its use may be associated with a significant increase in
   postoperative morbidity caused by disruption of the posterior
   musculature. It is also evident that this increased fusion rate is
   generally not associated with increased clinical success. This dilemma
   has led to a search for a solution and to the development of the
   Test-device anterior lumbar interbody device.
   Methods. The kinematic properties of either the L3 - L4 or L4 - L5
   lumbar motion segment of 8 cadaveric lumbar spines have been tested
   using the following sequence of fixation: intact, Test-device,
   Test-device and translaminar facet screws (TS), Cage and TS, Cage and
   Universal Spine System (USS), and Cage and small stature USS.
   Results. All fixation techniques except the cage and TS decreased (P <
   0.05) range of motion (ROM), neutral zone (NZ), and elastic zone (EZ),
   and increased (P < 0.05) stiffness in comparison to the intact motion
   segment in all test modes. There was a significant increase (P < 0.01)
   in the ROM, NZ, and EZ, and decrease in the stiffness of the cage and TS
   group in comparison to all other stabilization techniques in flexion and
   rotation. There was no significant difference in the ROM, NZ, EZ, and
   stiffness between the Test-device and cage and USS groups in flexion,
   extension, and bending. The Test-device resulted in a significantly
   lower EZ (P < 0.05) and a significantly higher stiffness (P < 0.05) in
   rotation than all other fixation methods.
   Conclusions. The Test-device alone provided similar and the Test-device
   and TS higher stability than the pedicle screw constructs evaluated.
   These results support progression to clinical trials using the
   Test-device as a stand-alone implant.}},

Abstract = {{The desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana) population in the
   Santa Catalina Mountains, Arizona, has declined since the 1920s and was
   virtually extirpated in the late 1990s. Urban development, human
   recreation, and changes in habitat conditions due to wildfire
   suppression have contributed to the decline. Wildfires in 2002 and 2003
   burned approximately 46,701 ha in the Santa Catalina Mountains,
   including areas previously inhabited by desert bighorn sheep. Our
   objectives were to estimate the amount of potential and historical
   bighorn sheep habitat in the Santa Catalina Mountains and to determine
   if the fires improved habitat quality for bighorn sheep. We created a
   spatial habitat suitability model to estimate the amount of potential
   and historical habitat. available for bighorn sheep in the Santa
   Catalina Mountains. We then used Burn Severity maps and the Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index to examine the impact of recent wildfires on
   bighorn sheep habitaL. We calculated 39,201 and 9,017 ha of potential
   and historical habitat of desert bighorn sheep, respectively. Historical
   bighorn sheep habitat in the western Santa Catalina Mountains declined
   64\% since 1989. Approximately 21\% of potential habitat and 24\% of
   historical bighorn sheep habitat were burned during the fires, most of
   which experienced low burn severity that was not high enough to remove
   vegetation that decreases habitat. quality for desert. bighorn sheep.
   Any consideration of translocation of desert bighorn Sheep to the Santa
   Catalina Mountains should further assess the suitability of the areas
   identified as potential habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Although transmission and engraftment of donor-derived malignancies is
   rare in recipients of solid organ transplants, it is associated with
   unfavorable allograft and patient survival. Therefore, a recent history

   Although atrial myxomas are benign cardiac tumors of stromal origin,
   they can lead to systemic embolization with ectopic myxoma formation. We
   report successful liver, kidney, and pancreas transplantation into 3
   recipients from a donor with cerebral emboli from a left atrial myxoma.
   Eighteen months after transplantation, all 3 patients enjoy good
   allograft function and are free of donor-derived atrial myxoma. Although
   the duration of follow-up in this report is limited, we suggest that the
   presence of atrial myxoma should not be viewed as an absolute
   contraindication to organ recovery, particularly in view of the shortage
   of organ donors and the attendant morbidity and mortality for patients

Abstract = {{Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are persistent and ubiquitous
   chemicals in the environment, and they are found at increasing levels in
   tissues of wildlife and humans. Previous in vitro studies with the BFR
   class of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (BDEs) have shown
   endocrine-disrupting properties. Our study assessed the potential
   effects of nineteen BDEs, five hydroxylated BDEs (OH-BDEs), one
   methoxylated BDE (CH3O-BDE), tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA), its
   dibromopropane ether derivative (TBBPA-DBPE), and the brominated
   phenols/anisols 2,4,6-tribromophenol (TBP), 4-bromophenol (4BP) and
   2,4,6-tribromoanisole (TBA) on the catalytic activity of the
   steroidogenic enzyme aromatase (CYP19) in H295R human adrenocortical
   carcinoma cells. Effects were studied in the concentration range from
   0.5 to 7.5 mu M; exposures were for 24 h. Both 6-OH-BDE47 and 6-OH-BDE99
   showed an inhibitory effect on aromatase activity at concentrations >2.5
   mu M and >5 mu M, respectively. However, 6-OH-BDE47 also caused a
   statistically significant increase in cytotoxicity (based on
   mitochondrial MTT reduction and lactate dehydrogenase-leakage {[}LDH])
   at concentrations >2.5 mu M that could explain in part the apparent
   inhibitory effect on aromatase activity. Compared to 6-OH-BDE47, the
   methoxy analog (6-CH3O-BDE47) did not elicit a cytotoxic effect, whereas
   significant inhibition of aromatase remained. TBP caused a
   concentration-dependent induction of aromatase activity between 0.5 and
   7.5 mu M (with a maximum of 3.8-fold induction at 7.5 mu M). This
   induction was not observed when a OH- group replaced the CH3O- group or
   when bromine atoms adjacent to this OH- group were absent. These in
   vitro results provide a basis for studies of more detailed
   structure-activity relationships between these brominated compounds and
   the modulation of aromatase activity.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To compare the cytological findings of hypoechoic thyroid
   nodules with intranodular vascular pattern (pattern II) obtained by two
   different needles (Neolus 25 gauge, Chemil, Wenzhou, China vs Yale
   Spinal 25 gauge, Becton Dickinson, Madrid, Spain) in euthyroid patients
   and to evaluate their cost-effectiveness.
   Methods: From January 2001 to December 2003, 480 euthyroid patients with
   a hypoechoic thyroid nodule pattern 11 were referred for LIS-FNAC. The
   nodules were alternatively evaluated by Neolus or by Yale Spinal with
   the stylet (YS+) or without the stylet (YS-), in order to evaluate if
   the cytological results could be due to the presence of the stylet or to
   the different length of the two needles. For each nodule two passes were
   performed and the material was obtained by capillary action. Material
   was smeared on slides, fixed, and stained by Papanicolaou techniques.
   Cytological specimens were evaluated in blind by the same experienced
   cytopathologist.
   Results: Inadequate cytological specimens because of blood contamination
   were present in 30 (18.7\%) samples by Neolus needle and in 22 (13.8\%)
   by YS- compared to only 5 (3.1\%) by YS+. In 6 (20\%) cases of the 30
   repeated LIS-FNAC by Neolus and in 4 (18\%) of the 22 LIS-FNAC by YS-,
   material remained inadequate for diagnosis because of blood
   contamination. All the five repeated samples obtained by YS+ became
   adequate for diagnosis and resulted benign nodules. Direct costs of
   US-FNAC procedure are currently (sic) 72.30 including cytological
   examination. The cost of Neolus and Yale needles is (sic) 0.19 and C
   3.0, respectively. The estimated total cost to obtain a cytological
   diagnosis by a Neolus needle (160 + 30 repeated US-FNAC) was (sic)
   13809.2 vs (sic) 12919.5 by Yale Spinal needle (160 + 5 repeated
   US-FNAC).
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the use of Yale Spinal needles
   greatly reduces inadequate cytological specimens, and therefore limits
   both direct and indirect costs.}},

Abstract = {{The simultaneous biaxial stretching behavior of three

   properties was associated with the effect of isotacticity on the thermal
   properties of the resin. The results showed that the degree of
   undermelting, Delta T-um = T-m-T, determines the phase composition of
   the polymer before stretching and the morphology and orientation of the
   stretched films. The size and orientation of the crystallites in the
   stretching plane is mostly determined by the degree of undermelting. The
   elongation at break was correlated with the residual crystallinity of
   the film before stretching, and the elastic modulus was correlated with
   the final degree of crystallinity and the density of tie chains.}},

Abstract = {{We examined Helix pomatia L., 1758 snails to answer two questions.
   First, is their winter dormancy facilitated by cold-seeking behaviour,
   or is it rather a passive phenomenon imposed by cold weather? Second,
   what thermal conditions are necessary to arouse these snails out of
   torpor in midwinter and in spring? Snails, collected from natural
   habitats, were placed in a temperature-gradient apparatus. Their thermal
   preference was recorded for 48 h under natural photoperiod in early
   spring, midsummer, and autumn. The autumn recording was continued until
   the end of November on non-starved and starved snails. Two additional
   sessions were performed on torpid snails in January (latencies of
   arousals from torpor at various temperatures and immediate thermal
   preferences were recorded) and in February (they were kept permanently
   in darkness at 5 degrees C and their spontaneous arousals were
   examined). Temperature selected in spring (23.60 +/- 0.15 degrees C) was
   significantly lower than that in summer (26.90 +/- 0.05; P < 0.05) and
   in autumn (27.50 +/- 0.10 degrees C; P < 0.01). The prolonged autumn
   recording did not show cold-seeking behaviour either in non-starved or
   in starved snails. Threshold temperature inducing midwinter arousals was
   10 degrees C and the aroused snails immediately selected temperatures
   indistinguishable from those in summer and autumn. Spontaneous arousals
   from torpor in the snails continuously exposed to cold occurred within a
   period of arousals in the field. In conclusion, winter torpor of the
   snails displays unique properties, i.e., its start and maintenance are
   passive phenomena, while its spring interruption is a precisely
   controlled, endogenous mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{The ultrastructure of the camallanid nematode Procamallanus
   (Spirocamallanus) halitrophus, a parasite of flounder, is described for
   the first time by the use of transmission electron microscopy. The body
   wall is composed of an outer cuticle, a hypodermis, and a muscular
   layer. The cuticle comprises the epicuticle, the cortical, median,
   fibrous, and basal layers. The cortical layer is subdivided into an
   outer zone and an inner zone; the median layer is subdivided into an
   outer layer, rich in electrondense fibrils, and an inner layer, which
   does not contain these fibrils; the fibrous layer is subdivided into
   three regions delimited by electrondense lines; the basal layer presents
   electrondense sustaining structures. Underlying the basal layer is the
   hypodermis where many organelles are observed. The musculature is
   striated, and each muscle cell consists of individualized contractile
   and noncontractile regions. Inclusion bodies are present in the muscle
   fibers, hypodermis, hypodermal chord, and in the intestine.}},

Abstract = {{Gene expression patterns in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive
   and metastatic breast tumors have been determined using serial analysis
   of gene expression (SAGE). The purpose of this approach was to identify
   biologically and clinically meaningful subgroups of DCIS with a high
   risk of progression to invasive disease. The analyses have led to the
   identification of several differentially expressed genes, such as HIN-1,
   dermcidin and S100A7 (psoriasin). The aim of the present study was
   further to delineate the expression profile of S100 genes using
   information from 22 breast epithelial SAGE libraries. We demonstrated
   the down-regulation of S100A6 and S100A10 in breast cancer, irrespective
   of pathological stage. S100P and S100Z were both up-regulated in cancer;
   whereas S100A7,S100A8 and S100A9 were strongly up-regulated only in
   DCIS. The hierarchical clustering of S 100 gene expression in these 22
   libraries revealed two major groups with distinguishable S 100 gene
   expression profiles. One of them was characterized by the high
   concomitant expression of S100A7, S100A8 and S100A9. Using SAGE
   informatics, we found 21 genes with a high positive correlation to
   S100A7 expression in libraries representing different categories of
   tissues archived at SAGE Genie, suggesting a function of psoriasin that
   is not tissue specific. Like S100A7, several of these genes displayed
   cation-binding properties. We also report the strong correlation in the
   breast epithelial SAGE libraries between the expression of S100A7 and
   genes reported as being up-regulated in DCIS, as well as in the
   inflammatory skin disorder, psoriasis; including RGS5, UPK1A, TMPRSS3,
   S100A9, p53, SCCA1, SCCA2 and KRT17.}},

Abstract = {{A new forage sorghum entitled Pnina was developed in Israel. Pnina,
   harvested at early milk (EM) and hard dough (HD) stages of maturity, was
   compared with commercial sorghum variety FS-5 and a sorghum BMR/Sudan
   hybrid Nutriplus. Plants grew during summer and were irrigated with 190
   mm water. Pnina was semi-dwarf (1.35 m height) and absolutely resistant
   to lodging. The tall varieties FS-5 and Nutriplus suffered at HD from
   high lodging. Pnina was more leafy than Nutriplus and FS-5. The dry
   matter (DM) content of FS-5 and Nutriplus were at EM below the level
   recommended for ensilage and elevated slightly at HD, whereas DM content
   of Pnina was higher. Crop yields of all varieties at HD were similar and
   ranged between 13.3 and 14.7 tha(-1) DM. Dry matter losses during
   ensilage and silage pH were similar in the three varieties at HD. In
   vitro DM digestibility of HD silages ranged between 62.5 and 67.1\%.
   Neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content was higher in Pnina silages.
   Yields of digestible silage per hectare, were similar in the three
   varieties harvested at HD (8.4 to 8.8 tha(-1) DM); however, yield of
   digestible NDF per hectare was higher in Pnina. Data suggest that the
   new variety Pnina may have field advantage over the other varieties of
   this study. (c) 2005 Society of Chemical Industry.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To determine whether receptors for B lymphocyte stimulator
   (BLyS) are altered on B cells of patients with systemic lupus
   erythematosus (SLE).
   Methods. Total available receptors for BLyS were measured by analysis of
   binding of recombinant soluble BLyS to peripheral blood B cells in 36
   SLE patients, 29 healthy controls, and 10 disease controls. Antibodies
   to the receptors BAFF-R, BCMA, and TACI were used to define expression
   of the individual BLyS receptors on subsets of B cells in blood, spleen,
   and tonsils. Two different antibodies to BAFF-R, which were
   differentially sensitive to BAFF-R occupancy, were used to compare
   BAFF-R on B cells in an additional 20 healthy subjects and 25 SLE
   patients. Assays of B cell survival after stimulation in vitro were used
   to determine the sensitivity of B cells to exogenous BLyS.
   Results. Total available receptors for BLyS were decreased in patients
   with SLE, independent of changes of subsets in the blood in these
   patients. The decrease correlated with changes in disease activity.
   Although total surface BAFF-R was not significantly different between
   healthy controls and SLE patients, BAFF-R was occupied in SLE patients.
   B cells from these patients were less responsive to exogenous BLyS.
   Conclusion. BAFF-R is consistently occupied on blood B cells in SLE.
   Occupancy of BAFF-R on blood B cells is likely to contribute to disease
   mechanisms in SLE and could serve as a biomarker of disease activity.
   Targeting BLyS as a therapeutic strategy will require overcoming the
   persistent binding of BLyS to BAFF-R.}},

Abstract = {{The lifespan of the bovine corpus luteum (CL) is an important factor in
   the control of normal ovarian cyclicity and the establishment and
   maintenance of pregnancy. There is increasing evidence that CL lifespan
   is regulated by alternative expression of genes that promote or inhibit
   lutcolysis. To gain further insights into these events a 434 character
   ovarian cDNA array comprising genes attributed to key aspects of CL
   function including more than 100 anonymous expressed sequence tags
   (ESTs) was constructed and screened with alpha P-33 dATP labeled RNA
   isolated from non-regressed (n = 6) and regressed (n = 6) CL tissue.
   Significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) identified 15 genes that
   changed expression 1.7-fold or more with a false discovery rate of <
   5\%. The differentially expressed genes encoded enzymes involved in
   steroid biosynthesis and oxygen radical metabolism and proteins involved
   in extracellular matrix remodeling, apoptosis and cell structure.
   Results for five of the differentially expressed genes including matrix
   gla protein and collagen alpha 1(I) (extracellular matrix),
   glutathione-S-transferase alpha I (oxygen metabolism), clusterin
   (apoptosis) and scavenger receptor BI (steroid biosynthesis) were
   confirmed by Northern blot analysis and found to be significantly
   different (P < 0.01) between non-regressed and regressed CL tissue.
   Collectively this study identified genes with recognized roles in CL
   regression, genes with potential roles in this process and genes whose
   function have yet to be defined in this event. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

   interesting activity profile (IC50/alpha(V)beta(3) = 1.5 nM;
   IC50/alpha(V)beta(5) = 0.59 nM), comparable to that of reference
   compounds EMD121974 and ST1646. Closely related congeners 6, 8, and 9
   also proved to be excellent dual binders with activity levels in the low
   nanomolar range. The three-dimensional (M) NMR solution structures were
   determined, and docking studies to X-ray crystal structure of the
   extracellular segment of integrin alpha(V)beta(3) in complex with the
   reference compound EMD121974 were performed on selected analogues to
   elucidate the interplay between structure and function in these systems
   and to evidence the subtle bases for receptorial recognition. The
   results prove that the principle of isosteric dipeptide replacement for
   peptidomimetics design and synthesis can be violated, without detriment
   to the development of highly effective integrin binders.}},

   fine-tuned orchestra, even more silent and may be seen as prefiguring
   our contemporary notion of consensus and our version of globalisation?
   Athens talks, debates, and retains the notion of the political as
   continuous creation of dissent. Hence Athens - or rhetoric - is

Abstract = {{The aim of this randomized crossover study was to evaluate the impact of
   environmental and behavioral interventions (EBI) on behavioral,
   physiologic, and biologic stress response during a weighing procedure in
   neonates. Three groups of 15 neonates included (A) gestational age (GA),
   :532 weeks; (B) GA, 32 weeks, 1 day to 36 weeks, 6 days; and (C) GA, >=
   37 weeks. Each neonate experienced 2 weighing procedures with and
   without EBI. Pain was evaluated by using the Neonatal infant Pain Scale
   (NIPS) and the Neonatal Pain and Discomfort Scale (EDIN). Heart rate and
   oxygen saturation were recorded. Salivary samples were obtained for
   cortisol assay. Cerebral tissue oxygenation index (TOI) was recorded
   with near-infrared spectroscopy. A significant decrease of NIPS and EDIN
   was observed with EBI versus control. Mean heart rate was lower with
   EBI. No difference in cortisol level changes was observed. For groups A
   and B, a trend of increased TOI was observed with EBI. We concluded that
   EBI during a nursing procedure provides a decrease in pain scores in
   preterm and term neonates with changes in heart rate.
   Perspespective: This study evaluates the impact of combined
   environmental and behavioral interventions on pain responses in neonates
   during a weighing procedure. The results indicate a decrease in
   behavioral pain scores and in heart rate for preterm and term neonates
   and a trend in increased brain oxygenation depending on gestational age.

   deposition of the molecular semiconductors from a solution. As the
   solvent evaporates, the capillary forces drive the solution to form
   menisci under the stamp protrusions. The solute precipitates only in the
   regions where the solution is confined by the menisci once the critical
   concentration is reached and self-organizes into molecularly ordered
   stripes 100-200 nm wide and a few monolayers high. The charge mobility
   measured along the stripes is 2 orders of magnitude larger than the
   values measured for spin-coated thin films.}},

Abstract = {{The development of virtual reality (VR) art installations is faced with
   considerable difficulties, especially when one wishes to explore complex
   notions related to user interaction. We describe the development of a VR
   platform, which supports the development of such installations, from an
   art + science perspective. The system is based on a CAVE(TM) like
   immersive display using a game engine to support visualisation and
   interaction, which has been adapted for stereoscopic visualisation and
   real-time tracking. In addition, some architectural elements of game
   engines, such as their reliance on event-based systems have been used to
   support the principled definition of alternative laws of Physics. We
   illustrate this research through the development of a fully implemented
   artistic brief that explores the notion of causality in a virtual
   environment. After describing the hardware architecture supporting
   immersive visualisation we show how causality can be redefined using
   artificial intelligence technologies inspired from action representation
   in planning and how this symbolic definition of behaviour can support
   new forms of user experience in VR. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In addition to causing large losses to the cattle industry,
   Mycobacterium bovis, the causative agent for bovine tuberculosis, is a
   serious public health issue because it can potentially infect humans.
   Diagnosis based on isolation and identification of the bacillus is

   chain reaction (PCR), using species-specific primers, is fast, highly
   sensitive and of great value in epidemiological studies. In this study,
   deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from 60 nasal mucus samples
   collected from three different farms, all located in an area where M.
   bovis is endemic. Two farms tested negative for an antibody response to
   the M. tuberculosis purified protein derivative (PPD) antigen, whereas
   the other farm gave a positive result.
   The amplified fragment of DNA was 460 base pairs with a sequence similar
   to that previously reported. Only 5\% of the samples from the third farm
   tested positive for the presence of antibodies against PPD, whereas 65\%
   of samples (from all three farms) gave a positive result when PCR was
   used. Thus, the authors suggest the use of the PCR species-specific
   primers test to support the programme against bovine tuberculosis in

Abstract = {{Aim. Physical activity is practiced more and more by middle-aged people.
   We studied the behavior of the coagulation system before and after
   near-maximum, specific and standardized exercise tests in 2 groups of
   senior athletes.
   Methods. The subjects of the study were 2 groups of athletes over 40
   years of age (ranging 41 to 60 years): 10 rowers and 10 marathon
   runners. The data were compared with 10 controls (ranging in age from 40
   to 71 years) tested on the cycle ergometer. The first group (rowers) was
   tested on a rowing machine; the second group (marathon runners)
   performed a maximal exercise on the treadmill. All subjects were tested
   to a maximal level of cardiovascular and muscular exertion and cardiac
   and respiratory parameters were monitored. The following coagulation
   tests were performed before and after maximal exercise: prothrombin time
   (PT), partial activated thromboplastin time (PTT), fibrinogen (FBG),
   antithrombin III (ATIII), protein C (PC), protein S (PS), prothrombin
   fragment 1+2 (F1+2), tissue activator of plasminogen (t-PA) and its
   inhibitor (PAI). All subjects performed a complete maximal specific
   test.
   Results. The results showed all individuals produced a significant
   increase of FBG, PT and PTT activities and a lowering trend for PC and
   PS inhibitors after maximal exercise testing. ATIII levels increased
   significantly in trained subjects. After the test, data regarding
   fibrinolysis showed higher t-PA levels in athletes as compared with
   controls. PAI levels indicated a more marked decrease in athletes. The
   F1+2 showed a moderate but significant increase in the control group.
   Conclusion. Coagulative tests showed an increase in procoagulant and
   fibrinolysis parameters in all the groups but the increased fibrinolytic
   activity in trained athletes indicates a protective factor and greater
   vascular efficiency. The results demonstrate that sporting activity
   practiced by middle-aged people accelerates fibrinolytic activity in
   conditioned subjects. In conclusion, physical activity benefits the
   coagulation system particularly as regards fibrinolysis.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of chronic renal failure on the stereoselective metabolism
   of rac-metoprolol was investigated in 15 hypertensive patients, 7 of
   them with chronic renal failure and 8 with normal renal function. They
   were treated with rac-metoprolol (200 mg) for 7 days. The patients of
   both groups presented stereoselectivity in metoprolol metabolism,
   favoring the formation of 1'R-alpha-hydroxymetoprolol
   (AUC(1.R/1'S)(0-24) approximate to 2.5) and (R)-metoprolol acidic
   metabolite (AUC((S)/(R))(0-24) approximate to 0.8), the latter resulting
   in the plasma accumulation of (S)-metoprolol (AUC((S)/(R))(0-24)
   approximate to 1.2). Patients with chronic renal failure presented
   plasma accumulation of the 4 alpha-hydroxymetoprolol isomers and of both
   metoprolol acidic metabolite enantiomers. A 50\% reduction in CIR does
   not explain the 3- to 4-fold plasma accumulation of metoprolol acidic
   metabolite in this group, suggesting that other pathways of metoprolol
   elimination are affected in chronic renal failure in addition to renal
   excretion. Chronic renal failure does not change the stereoselective
   kinetic disposition of metoprolol but modifies its stereoselective
   metabolism, inducing some of the CYP enzymes involved in the formation
   of the metoprolol acid metabolite.}},

Abstract = {{The Llobregat basin is a Mediterranean fluvial system with major
   agricultural, urban and industrial impacts. We combined chemical
   quantification by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with
   electrospray interface (LC-ESI-MS) and the recombinant yeast assay (RYA)
   assays to estimate the loads of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs)
   along the basin. Chemical analysis revealed maximum concentrations (at
   mu g l(-1) level) of alkylphenols at the lower course of the Llobregat
   River, which correlated with high levels of estrogenic activity detected
   by RYA. Analysis by RYA and LC-ESI-MS of influent and effluent waters
   from four sewage treatment plants (STP) discharging into the basin
   showed the removal of 80-95\% of EDCs by STP treatment. Chemical
   analysis data and RYA data showed a quasi-linear correlation,
   demonstrating the complementariness of both methods. Our data suggest
   that the concentrations of the analysed compounds were enough to explain
   the total estrogenicity of water and STP samples from the Llobregat

Abstract = {{An investigation was carried out on the bioavailability of kaolinite and
   the role it plays in remediating oil-polluted seawater, since kaolinite
   is known to enable hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria to grow well.
   Experimental results revealed that significant amounts of Al and Si
   dissolved from kaolinite were not observed ((P > 0.05) in comparison
   with a control sample which contained no kaolinite) in the aqueous phase
   during the similar to 24 day experimental period. Transmission electron
   microscope observations and energy-dispersive spectroscope data revealed
   that some altered kaolinite particles appeared, connected to intact
   kaolinite and bacterial cells. Bacterial cells were associated and
   encrusted with intact and/or altered kaolinite clay particles, where
   mixed (C, O, Na and Si)-precipitates of kaolinite clays were formed on
   the surface of hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial cells. However, the
   uptake of Si (from kaolinite) by bacterial cells appeared to be more
   prevalent than Al, and there were no significant changes in basal
   spacings of kaolinite due to these altered kaolinite particles. Separate
   studies showed that hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria have a high
   resistance to Si. Thus, the present data suggest that Si from kaolinite
   may facilitate hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial growth as shown in our
   previous study (Chaerun et al., 2005), and the C-O-Na-Si complexes on
   the surfaces of bacterial cell walls may be the stimulator for
   hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial growth in seawater contaminated with oil
   spill.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed facics analysis in late Proterozoic Rewa Shale reveals three
   physically distinctive facies that differ in their paleogeography.
   Between shoreface and outer shelf the facies types are distributed as:
   (i) shale with thin siltstone/fine sandstone interbeds of outer shelf,
   00 shale interbedded with HCS bearing sheet sandstone of inner shelf
   within storm wave base and (iii) sandstone interbedded with silty shale
   of distal shoreface paleogeography. High-resolution facies succession
   analysis reveals three different orders of depositional cyclicity, the
   lowest of which may be correlated with third-order depositional
   `sequence'. Thin (av. 3.5 cm) discrete levels of emergence with their
   invariable associations and sharp transitions from inner shelf to
   shoreface facies mark the subaerial discontinuities, which punctuate the
   apparently monotonous Rewa Shale succession. Far from the coastline on a
   siliciclastic ramp that lacks shelf-slope break, these features, even
   though cryptic, can provide important clues for sea level falls in shale

Title = {{Design considerations of volute geometry of a centrifugal blood pump}},
Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL ORGANS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{937-948}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This article compares two different design techniques that are
   conventionally used in the design of volutes for centrifugal pumps. The
   imbalanced forces due to the geometry of the volute need to be taken
   into consideration especially in centrifugal blood pumps with
   magnetically suspended impeller. A reduction of these forces can reduce
   the instability of the impeller motion as well as the power needed to
   counteract its influence. Volutes using the constant angular momentum
   (CAM) and the constant mean velocity (CMV) methods were developed and
   modeled numerically. The computational results on the effect of volute
   geometry on the performance of a centrifugal blood pump impeller for six
   different volutes are presented here. For volutes designed using the CAM
   method, model B (volute expansion angle of 3 degrees) had the lowest
   radial force of 0.26 N while the pressure head generated was 12 900 Pa.
   For volutes designed using the CMV method, model F (1.6 m/s) had the
   lowest imbalanced force of 0.45 N. However, the pressure developed by
   this pump was also one of the lowest at 10 652 Pa. Furthermore, when the
   peak scalar stresses and the mean exposure time of particles for all
   designs were determined using Lagrangian particle tracking method, it
   was observed that in general, the peak scalar stresses in CAM designed
   volutes are lower than those designed using CMV method. The mean
   exposure time of particles in the pump ranged from 400 to 500 ms. The
   simulation results showed that the volute designed using CAM method was
   superior to that of a CMV volute in terms of the magnitude of the radial
   force and the peak scalar stresses for the same pressure head generated.
   Results show that the design of volutes for blood pumps should go beyond
   conventional empirical methods to obtain optimal results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper employs the molecular-dynamics method to generate random-dot
   patterns for light guides designed for backlight systems. The proposed
   approach combines various numerical techniques and is designed to
   optimize the dot-density distribution in order to satisfy the uniform
   luminance requirements demanded by liquid-crystal displays. In the
   proposed algorithm, the total domain is divided into a prescribed number
   of cells whose dot densities can be individually adjusted in order to
   fine tune the luminance conditions in accordance with the light source
   position and type. In addition, a variable truncation distance is
   implemented in each cell according to the dot density of that cell. This
   variable r-cut technique localizes the repulsive force effects acting
   within each cell in order that a high-dot-density gradient can be
   achieved in the overall dot distribution. Finally, an average force
   control technique is developed to ensure the uniformity of the dot
   distribution as it passes across the cell boundaries. Several
   illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the robustness of the
   proposed molecular-dynamics dot-generation algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To describe patterns of abnormal development of the metopic
   suture in association with fetal malformations during the second and
   third trimesters of pregnancy.
   Methods This was a cross-sectional study of the frontal bones and
   metopic suture in 11 fetuses at 17-32 weeks of gestation. Cases were
   selected because there were obvious abnormalities in the metopic
   sutures. In each case, a malformation was detected by two-dimensional
   (2D) ultrasound and the abnormality of the metopic suture was detected
   and evaluated on three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound, using transparent
   maximum mode.
   Results There were essentially four patterns of abnormality in the
   metopic suture: firstly, delayed development with a V- or Y-shaped open
   suture, which is found in normal fetuses at 12-16 weeks; secondly, a
   U-shaped open suture, presumably due to upward growth of the frontal
   bones with delayed closure; thirdly, Premature closure of the suture,
   which is normally observed after 32 weeks; fourtbly5 the presence of
   additional bone between the frontal bones. Premature closure of the
   suture or additional bone between the frontal bones was observed in
   fetuses with holoprosencephaly and abnormalities of the corpus callosum,
   whereas the V-, Y- and U-shaped metopic sutures were observed in fetuses
   with facial defects involving the orbits, nasal bones, lip, palate and
   mandible, in the absence of holoprosencephaly and abnormal corpus
   callosum.
   Conclusions This preliminary study describes the pattern of possible
   abnormalities of the metopic suture and should stimulate further
   investigation to establish the prevalence and evolution of abnormal
   sutures as well as the incidence and pattern of other associated
   defects. Copyright (c) 2005 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate whether the tumor response after an initial course
   of irradiation predicts for colostomy-free survival and overall survival
   in patients with anal canal cancer.
   Methods and Materials: Between 1980 and 1998, 252 patients were treated
   by pelvic external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) followed by a brachytherapy
   boost in 218 or EBRT in 34. EBRT was combined with chemotherapy in 168
   patients. An evaluation of tumor regression, before the boost, was
   available for 221 patients. They were divided into four groups according
   to the tumor response: < 70\%, 70-80\%, > 80\% but < 100\%, and 100\%.
   Results: The median follow-up time was 58 months. The overall survival
   rate was 72.6\% 3.1\% and 57.3\% 4.2\% at 5 and 10 years, respectively.
   The disease-free survival rate was 60.0\% 3.3\% and 49.4\% +/- 3.9\% at
   5 and 10 years, respectively. The colostomy-free survival rate was 61\%
   at 5 years and 47\% at 10 years. Two groups could be differentiated
   according to the percentage of tumor regression before the boost: > 80\%
   vs. <= 80\%. The group with a T3-T4 lesion and tumor regression :580\%
   had the poorest overall (52.8\% +/- 12.3\%), disease-free (19.9\% +/-
   9.9\%), and colostomy-free survival (24.8\% +/- 11.2\%) rates.
   Conclusion: The amount of tumor regression before EBRT or brachytherapy
   boost is a strong prognostic factor of disease control without
   colostomy. When regression is :580\% in patients with an initial T3-T4
   lesion, the use of conservative RT should be carefully evaluated because
   of the very poor disease-free and colostomy-free survival. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Size sexual dimorphism occurs in almost all mammals. In Portuguese Water
   Dogs, much of the difference in skeletal size between females and males
   is due to the interaction between a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) on
   the X-chromosome and a QTL linked to Insulin-like Growth Factor 1
   (IGF-1) on the CFA 15 autosome. In females, the haplotype of CFA 15
   resulting in small size is dominant. In males, the haplotype for large
   size is dominant. Females homozygous at the CHM marker on the X
   chromosome and homozygous for the large size CFA 15 haplotype are, on
   average, as large as large males. However, all females that are
   heterozygous at the CHM marker are small, regardless of their CFA 15
   genotype. This interaction suggests a genetic mechanism that in turn
   leads to a scenario for the evolution of size sexual dimorphism
   consistent with a proposal of Lande that sexual dimorphism can evolve
   because females secondarily become smaller than males as a consequence
   of natural selection for optimal size. Our results also can explain
   Rensch's Rule, which states that size is often positively correlated
   with the level of size sexual dimorphism.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Population ageing and longer duration of the working career
   could increase the prevalence of impairments and disabilities whereas
   there have been few data to help prevention and care. This study aimed
   at describing the prevalence of various types of impairments and
   assessing their social inequalities in the Lorraine population
   (north-eastern France).
   Methods: The sample included 6.214 subjects aged 15 or more from 8.000
   households randomly selected in the Lorraine population. A mailed
   questionnaire including socio-demographical characteristics, job, and
   various types of impairments was used. The data were analysed with the,2
   independence test, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) and the Mantel-Haenszel
   test.
   Results: The prevalence of at least one impairment was 30\% in both
   sexes. It varied from about 20\% for subjects aged less than 40 years to
   about 60\% for the subjects aged 70 years or more. It was higher in men
   than in women among the individuals aged more than 50 years (OR adjusted
   on age: 1.22, 95\% CI: 1.04-1.44). The impairments were generally
   multiple for the subjects aged over 50. The prevalence of at least one
   impairment was higher for workmen (OR adjusted on age: 2.11, 95\% CI.:
   1.68-2.66), farmers, craftsmen, traders and heads of firms (OR adjusted
   on age: 1.60, 95\% Cl: 1.17-2.18) and for employees (OR adjusted on age:
   1.62, 95\% CI: 1.29-2.03) in comparison with executives, intellectual
   professionals and teachers. For workmen a higher prevalence was observed
   for all types of impairments: intellectual and psychological functions,
   language, hearing, vision, visceral functions, and skeleton and posture.
   Farmers, craftsmen, traders, heads of firms and employees showed an
   excess for most types of impairments. Social inequalities were
   significant for various age groups during their period of occupational
   activity, but not after retirement. Unemployed people also had an excess
   of impairments.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of impairments strongly increased with
   advancing age. Marked inequalities were observed between various
   socio-occupational categories. Men were more affected than the women
   over 50 years of age. Impairments represent a health index which is
   useful for prevention to reduce their causes and consequences.}},

Abstract = {{In-situ bio-optical measurements were collected during six ship
   campaigns in the north eastern Arabian Sea using SeaWiFS Multi-channel
   Profiling Radiometer (SPMR). An artificial neural network (ANN) based

   systematic variations of architecture of input and hidden layer nodes
   for the Arabian Sea training data set. The performance of individual
   ANN-based pigment estimation algorithm was evaluated by applying it to
   the remote sensing reflectance data contained in validation data set.
   The performance of the most successful ANN was compared with commonly
   used empirical pigment algorithms. Compared to e.g. the SeaWiFS
   algorithms Ocean Chlorophyll-2 (OC2) and Ocean Chlorophyll-4 (OC4), the
   square of the correlation coefficient r(2) is increased from 0.69 for
   OC4, respectively 0.70 for OC2 to 0.96 for ANN algorithm. The RMS error

Abstract = {{This pilot study evaluated the safety and efficacy of an intensified
   oral sirolimus regimen (15-mg loading dose 24 hr before PCI, followed by
   a daily dose of 5 mg for 4 weeks) in 15 patients subjected to elective
   bare metal coronary stent implantation for de novo lesions. Mean patient
   age was 59 +/- 9; 73\% were male, and 13\% were diabetic patients. The
   reference diameter was 3.04 +/- 0.38 mm, and the lesion length was 14
   +/- 2 mm. Angiographic and volumetric intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)
   analyses were performed in all patients at 6.0 +/- 0.2 months. Two
   patients (13\%) met the definition of in-segment binary restenosis;
   in-stent and in-segment angiographic late loss was 0.61 +/- 0.31 mm and
   0.67 +/- 0.45 mm, respectively, and the percent neointimal volume was
   28.5 +/- 15.8\%. At adjacent reference segments, there was neither
   significant plaque increase nor constrictive vascular remodeling. At
   24-month follow-up no deaths, myocardial infarctions, or target lesion
   revascularizations were detected. Mean sirolimus blood level was 13 +/-
   7 ng/ml. No correlations were found between drug levels and late loss (r
   = 0.15, P = 0.59) or IVUS percent neointimal volume (r = 0.23, P =
   0.47). Side effects were frequent (80\%), leading to dose reductions in
   four and drug discontinuation in one patient. The results of this pilot
   study suggest that an intensified 5-mg oral sirolimus regimen resulted
   in no relevant improvements in the angiographic and IVUS parameters of
   restenosis after stent implantation in de novo lesions when compared
   with historic controls. Considering the efficacy/safety balance, our
   results do not encourage further trials evaluating the current protocol
   for the prevention of in-stent restenosis. +/- 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The issue of long-lived high bandwidth flow detection and control with
   partial flow state is addressed in this paper. The starting point of
   this work is the least recently used cache proposal, which is generally
   effective in detecting long-term fast (LTF) flows. However, its
   performance can be impaired by the following two factors. The first one
   is the existence of a large amount of short-lived or slow (SLS) flows.
   Because randomly sampled SLS flows take up quite a lot cache spaces,
   long-lived high bandwidth flows are often expelled from the cache
   mistakenly, which leads to degraded performance. The second is the
   attack from malicious high-bandwidth on/off flows, which can avoid
   detection by injecting packets on and off alternatively. This paper
   proposes a novel cache update scheme, Landmark LRU scheme, to improve
   the performance of the LRU cache in the detection and control of
   long-lived high bandwidth flows. Firstly, the superiority of the
   Landmark LRU scheme over the original LRU cache is demonstrated by
   Markovian analysis. Then simulations driven by real Internet traces
   prove that the Landmark LRU scheme achieves higher accuracy in
   long-lived high bandwidth flow detection than the original LRU scheme.
   Finally, the Landmark LRU cache is incorporated into a well-known active
   queue management scheme, Random Early Detection, to show its
   effectiveness in the control of malicious on/off LTF applications. NS-2
   simulation shows that the L-LRU-RED scheme outperforms the LRU-RED
   stably in regulating on/off flows. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Objective: A clinical study of ramosetron was carried out to evaluate
   its efficacy in preventing both acute and delayed emesis in
   cisplatin-based chemotherapy by using a double-blind method with
   granisetron as the comparative drug.
   Methods: Cisplatin at a dose of >= 70 mg/m(2) was administered as a
   single intravenous (i.v.) infusion over 4 h. Patients were randomly
   assigned to receive either ramosetron (0.3 mg i.v. bolus 30 min before
   cisplatin on Day 1 and a 0.1 mg tablet in the morning for Days 2 to 5
   after completion of chemotherapy; n = 36) or granisetron (3 mg i.v.
   infusion 30 min before cisplatin on Day 1 and a 1 mg tablet in the
   morning for Days 2 to 5 after completion of chemotherapy; n = 37). The
   observation period started with the initiation of chemotherapy (0 h) and
   continued for 24 h after completion of the chemotherapy for acute
   emesis, and on Days 2 to 5 for delayed nausea and vomiting.
   Results: A total of 73 patients were eligible for evaluation, with 36
   patients in the ramosetron group and 37 in the granisetron group. The
   efficacy of both drugs was analyzed in terms of the degree of
   achievement in each day of treatment. Ramosetron was as effective as
   granisetron in preventing nausea and vomiting (both acute and delayed
   emesis). The two drugs had a similar safety profile and adverse events
   were generally mild and transient.
   Conclusions: Ramosetron is effective and safe for the control of acute
   and delayed emesis induced by cisplatin.}},

   SD 18.2)]. The geometric mean, i. e., the square root of the product of
   SAP and DAP, furnished a reliable estimate of MAP {[} mean bias = 0.3
   mmHg ( SD 2.7)]. The harmonic mean was inaccurate. The following MAP
   formulas were also tested: DAP + 0.412 PP ( Meaney E, Alva F, Meaney A,
   Alva J, and Webel R. Heart 84: 64, 2000), DAP + 0.33 PP + 5 mmHg {[}

   G, Nitenberg A, and Lecarpentier Y. Clin Sci ( Lond) 103: 7 - 13, 2002],
   and DAP + {[} 0.33 + ( heart rate x 0.0012)] PP ( Razminia M, Trivedi A,
   Molnar J, Elbzour M, Guerrero M, Salem Y, Ahmed A, Khosla S, Lubell DL.
   Catheter Cardiovasc Interv 63: 419 - 425, 2004). They all provided
   accurate and precise estimates of MAP {[} mean bias = - 0.2 ( SD 2.9), -
   0.3 ( SD 2.7), and 0.1 mmHg ( SD 2.9), respectively]. The implications
   of the geometric mean pressure strictly pertained to the central ( not
   peripheral) level. It was demonstrated that the fractional systolic (
   SAP/ MAP) and diastolic ( DAP/ MAP) pressures were reciprocal estimates
   of aortic pulsatility and that the SAP times DAP product matched the
   total peripheral resistance times cardiac power product. In conclusion,
   although the previously described thumb- rules applied, the `` geometric
   MAP{''} appears more valuable as it established a simple mathematical
   link between the steady and pulsatile component of aortic pressure.}},

Abstract = {{HSP90 proteins are important molecular chaperones. Transcriptome and
   genome analyses revealed that the human HSP90 family includes 17 genes
   that fall into four classes. A standardized nomenclature for each of
   these genes is presented here. Classes HSP90AA, HSP90AB, HSP90B, and
   TRAP contain 7, 6 3, and I genes, respectively. HSP90AA genes mapped
   onto chromosomes 1, 3, 4, and 11; HSP90AB genes mapped onto 3. 4, 6. 13
   and 15; HSP90B genes mapped onto 1, 12, and 15; and the TRAP1 gene
   mapped onto 16. Six genes, HSP90AA1, HSP90AA2, HSP90N. HSP90AB1, HSP90B1
   and TRAP1, were recognized as functional, and the remaining I I genes
   were considered putative pseudogenes. Amino acid polymorphic variants
   were detected for genes HSP90AA1, HSP90AA2, HSP90AB1, HSP90B1, and
   TRAP1. The structures of these genes and the functional motifs and
   polymorphic variants of their proteins were documented and the features
   and functions of their proteins were discussed. Phylogenetic analyses
   based on both nucleotide and protein data demonstrated that HSP90(AA +
   AB + B) formed a monophyletic clade, whereas TRAP is a relatively
   distant paralogue of this clade. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The exergy method, based on the maximum exergetic efficiency criterion,
   has been applied to an irreversible inter-cooled refrigeration cycle.
   The exergetic efficiency defined as the ratio of the rate of exergy
   output to the rate of exergy input is taken as the objective function to
   be maximized. Multi-irreversibilities include finite-rate heat transfer,
   internal dissipation of the working fluid, and heat leaks between heat
   reservoirs. The maximum exergetic efficiency can be determined
   analytically by introducing the internal irreversibility parameter,
   which represents the degree of internal irreversibility. The
   corresponding performances of the irreversible refrigeration system are
   obtained simultaneously. The results show that the exergy method can be
   used as an effective criterion in designing an irreversible inter-cooled

Abstract = {{We have previously demonstrated that the PPAR gamma ligand, ciglitazone,
   increases p27kipI protein levels in HT-29 colon cancer cells through
   both inhibition of proteasome associated degradation and activation of
   transcriptional activity. {[}F. Chen, L.E. Harrison, Cell Signal. 17
   (2005) 809] The purpose of this investigation was to further elucidate
   the mechanism of eiglitazone-induced activation of p27 gene
   transcription. We observed that the region -774/-462 of the p27 promoter
   plays a key role in ciglitazone-induced gene transcriptional activity
   and this region contains two SpI binding sites. When the p27PF-luc
   reporter was co-transfected with SpI expression plasmids,
   ciglitazone-induced p27PF-luc activity significantly increased, while
   mithramycin A, a SpI inhibitor, was able to abrogate its effects.
   Ciglitazone exposure increased both Sp1 protein expression and Sp1-DNA
   binding, which was also associated with a decrease of Erk1/2
   phosphorylation. A similar increase of Sp1-DNA binding was observed when
   phosphorylation of Erk1/2 was inhibited by pretreatment with the MAP
   kinase inhibitor, U0126. In addition, a significant increase of
   p27PF-luc reporter luciferase activity was noted after MAP kinase
   inhibition, which could be abolished with co-treatment with mithramycin
   A. Based on these data, we postulate that ciglitazone induces p27 gene
   transcription through increased Sp1 binding to its promoter region,
   which in turn is mediated through increased SpI protein levels and
   decreased inhibitory regulation by the MAP kinase pathway. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{A mixed state may be represented in many different ways as a mixture of

Volume = {{29}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Minorities have worse health outcomes compared to whites,
   which are partially explained by racial/ethnic disparities in use of
   health services. Less well known, however, are whether these disparities
   persist among the elderly, the only group that possesses near universal
   health insurance coverage by Medicare, and how variation in Medicare
   coverage affects the receipt of preventive services. The scope of
   racial/ethnic disparities in the use of preventive services in the
   elderly was assessed, and the impact of the type of health insurance
   coverage on the use of preventive services was measured.
   Methods: Data were derived from the 2001 California Health Interview
   Survey, a random-digit-dial population-based survey, collected between
   November 2000 and October 2001. Analysis for this project was conducted
   in 2004. The association of race/ethnicity and type of health insurance
   with receipt of preventive services was assessed using bivariate and
   multivariate logistic regression models.
   Results: African Americans and Latinos were significantly less likely to
   be vaccinated for influenza, and Asian Americans were significantly less
   likely to obtain a mammogram compared to whites, while controlling for
   other explanatory factors. Moreover, those with Medicare plus Medicaid
   coverage were significantly less likely to use all four preventive
   services compared to those with Medicare plus private supplemental
   insurance.
   Conclusions: Despite near-universal coverage by Medicare, racial/ethnic
   disparities in the use of some preventive services among the elderly
   persist. Further research should focus on identifying potential cultural
   and structural barriers to receipt of preventive services aimed at
   designing effective intervention among high-risk groups.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of laser-assisted
   subepithelial keratectomy (LASEK) in myopic patients with preoperative
   dry eye associated with extended soft contact lens use.
   SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital,
   Taipei, Taiwan.
   METHODS: This nonrandomized prospective interventional case series study
   comprised 9 patients (18 eyes) with dry eye and keratoconjunctivitis
   associated with long-term complicated soft contact lens use. Prior to
   LASEK surgery and for 1 year following surgery, measurements and
   comparisons were made of uncorrected visual acuity, best corrected
   visual acuity (BCVA), manifest refraction, symptoms, tear function,
   ocular surface abnormality, and corneal sensitivity.
   RESULTS: No significant differences (P>.05) in the mean results of the
   Schirmer test with anesthesia and tear breakup times before and after
   LASEK were evident. Corneal sensitivity recovered within I month after
   LASEK. No complications occurred during or after LASEK. Subepithelial
   haze and superficial punctate epithelial defects occurred in 1 eye,
   representing a loss of I Snellen line of BCVA.
   CONCLUSION: Laser-assisted subepithelial keratomileusis in dry eyes and

Abstract = {{Chen, L. Longtang and Mark M. G. Walton. Head movement evoked by
   electrical stimulation in the supplementary eye field of the rhesus
   monkey. J Neurophysiol 94:4502-4519,2005. First published September
   7,2005;doi:10.1152/jn.00510.2005. Although the supplementary eye field
   (SEF) has been implicated in the control of head movements associated
   with gaze shifts, there is no direct evidence that SEF plays a role in
   the generation of head movements independent of gaze. If the SEF does,
   varying the duration of stimulation should selectively alter the
   head-movement kinematics during the postgazeshift period. The duration
   of the stimulation was manipulated while head-unrestrained monkeys
   maintained stable head forward postures. The initial positions of the
   eyes in the orbits were systematically varied. Although combined
   movements of the eyes and head were produced in the majority of the
   trials, head movements were sometimes evoked in the absence of gaze
   shifts. These head-alone movements were most frequent when the initial
   eye position was contralateral to the stimulated side. When the
   stimulation produced eye and head movements, gaze onset was sometimes
   preceded by a relatively low-velocity phase of the head movement. Evoked
   head movements were primarily horizontal, unlike the gaze shifts, which
   typically had vertical components that varied according to the initial
   positions of the eyes in the orbits. The postgaze-shift head movements
   tended to be of low velocity and in many cases persisted until
   stimulation offset. In general, prolonging the stimulation resulted in
   improved centering of the eyes in the orbits. These findings suggest
   that, in addition to its previously described role in the generation of
   coordinated eye-head gaze shifts, the SEF is also involved in the
   control of head movements in the absence of a change of gaze.}},

Abstract = {{Intracranial embolization usually arises from heart, precerebral artery
   or aorta but rarely the peripheral artery as retrograde upstream of
   embolus should be overcome. We encountered a woman who experienced a
   transient right acronumbness followed by a sudden onset of left
   hemiplegia and conscious change concurrently. Cranial computerized
   tomography revealed a hemorrhagic infarct at right lentiform nucleus.
   Angiography disclosed right axillary artery occlusion at the proximal
   portion without collateral circulation. Cardioaortic survey and
   coagulation profile were normal. Thrombectomy was done and radial flow
   was corrected rapidly. Post-thrombectomic heparinization did not bring
   complication. Therefore, a distant embolism from peripheral artery at
   the upper limb should be alerted for cerebral ischemia. A lower density
   of embolus and no-flow condition in her occluded axillary artery may
   facilitate the upstreamed embolization. Heparinization, under closed
   monitor, is not contraindicated for preventing restenosis after
   thrombectomy in case of hemorrhagic transformation in brain. (c) 2004

Abstract = {{Well-exposed Oligocene strata of the Hsuehshan Range in Taiwan were
   deposited in the Hsuehshan Trough along the eastern Eurasia continental
   margin. The Hsuehshan Trough was a restricted epeiric basin confined by
   a series of horsts. The Oligocene succession records a deepening-upward
   to shallowing-upward sequence of deltaic deposystems associated with
   fluvial and shallow marine environments. These environments ranged from
   wave-dominated delta-plain through storm-dominated delta-slope to
   regressive tide-dominated delta-front environments. The fining-upward to
   coarsening-upward sequence can be divided into five lithofacies and five
   ichnocoenoses. Ichnocoenoses characterized by Ophiomorpha,
   Cylindrichnus, Teichichnus, Scolicia, and Zoophycos were defined on the
   basis off assemblages, degree of bioturbation, diversity, and abundance.
   The Lower Oligocene deposits exhibit a fining-upward trend and upward
   increases trend in bioturbation and abundance of deposit-feeding
   structures. Accompanying these changes is a transition from Ophiomorpha,
   Cylindrichnus, Teichichnus, Scolicia to Zoophycos ichnocoenoses, which
   also suggests a transgressive system from delta-plain to prodelta-slope
   environment. The sequential variation in lithofacies and ichnofossil
   assemblages coincides with changes in Early Oligocene sea level. The
   Upper Oligocene deposits show a shallowing-upward succession that
   suggests an evolution from a storm-dominated prodelta slope to a
   tide-dominated delta plain. The ichnofossil assemblages show a
   transition from Scolicia, Teichichnus to Ophiomorpha ichnocoenoses that
   are suggestive of regressive systems. The sequential trends documented
   in the Late Oligocene deposits of northeastern Taiwan are not consistent
   with global sea-level fluctuations and therefore, tectonic processes
   acre invoked to have controlled local basin conditions. In general, the
   sequential variations documented in the Oligocene strata probably were
   controlled by paleoceanographic conditions that were closely linked to
   tectonic processes and longer-term, first-order sea-level fluctuations.}},

   allergens}},
Journal = {{ALLERGY}},
Year = {{2005}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Forcipomyia taiwana is a tiny, blood-sucking midge that
   cause intense pruritis and swelling in sensitive individuals. It is
   distributed island-wide in rural Taiwan and Southern China.
   Objective: This study aimed to study the allergic immune responses and
   identify F. taiwana allergens.
   Methods: Crude whole body F. taiwana extracts were prepared with
   phosphate-buffered saline. The specific IgE antibody was determined by
   enzyme-linked immunoassay and immunoblotting. Protein was analyzed by
   electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.
   Results: Among the 372 subjects that were exposed to F. taiwana bites,
   179 (48\%) reported an immediate skin reaction with/without delay
   reaction and 41(11.1\%) reported a solely delay reaction. The skin of 21
   subjects was tested with F. taiwana extract. Of these 21 subjects, 12
   (57.1\%) produced immediate skin reactions and contained high levels of
   specific IgE antibody against F. taiwana. Immunoblotting revealed that
   11 allergenic components are able to bind specific IgE. Allergens of 22,
   24, 35, 36, and 64 kDa bound 50, 50, 75, 66.7, and 75\% of
   IgE-containing sera tested, respectively. Tryptic fragments of the 24,
   35, 36, and 64 kDa allergens were analyzed by ESI-MS/MS. Selected
   tryptic peptides of 24, 35, and 36, and 64 kDa allergens exhibited
   significant sequence identity with triosephosphate isomerase of
   Anopheles merus,Tenebrio molitor,Ochlerotatus togoi, and Chrysops
   vittatus, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase of Antheraea yamamai and
   Homalodisca coagulata, and a slow muscle myosin S-1 heavy chain of
   Homarusamericanus and a protein with unknown function from A. gambiae,
   respectively. The 35 and 36 kDa proteins may represent different
   isoforms of the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase.
   Conclusion: We conclude that immediate reaction to F. taiwana bites is
   IgE mediated and the 24 (For t 1), 35 (For t 2), and 64 kDa (For t 3)
   proteins are candidates for major F. taiwana allergens. Further studies
   are needed to confirm these allergens.}},

Abstract = {{Background: There is no plasma marker for detecting oral cancer, one of
   the most frequent cancers worldwide. We developed a bead-based
   affinity-fractionated proteomic method to discover a novel plasma marker
   for oral cancer.
   Methods: Affinity purification of heparinized plasma with magnetic beads
   and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass
   spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis were used to screen potential oral
   cancer markers. We compiled MS protein profiles for 57 patients with
   oral cancer and compared them with profiles from 29 healthy controls.
   The spectra were analyzed statistically using flexAnalySiSTm and
   ClinProtTm bioinformatic software. In each MS analysis, the peak
   intensities of interest were normalized with an internal standard
   (adrenocorticotropic hormone 18-39). For identification, affinity
   bead-purified plasma protein was subjected to MALDI TOF/TOF analysis
   followed by Mascot identification of the peptide sequences and a search
   of the National Center for Biotechnology Information protein database.
   Results: To optimize MALDI-TOF analysis based on the best discriminator
   of the cancer and control spectra, copper-chelated beads were used for
   plasma protein profiling. The within- and between-run CVs for assays
   were <4\% and 7\%, respectively. Six markers that differentiated between
   cancer and control spectra were found, with mean (SD) molecular masses
   of 2664 (1), 2850 (1), 3250 (1), 7735 (2), 7927 (2), and 9240 (2) Da.
   The 2664-Da marker, identified as a fragment of the fibrinogen
   alpha-chain, had the highest sensitivity (100\%) and specificity (97\%)
   for cancer.
   Conclusion: The high specificity and sensitivity of the fibrinogen
   alpha-chain fragment suggest that it may be a clinical useful tumor
   marker. (c) 2005 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.}},

Abstract = {{The demand for thermoelectric coolers (TEC) has grown significantly
   because of the need for a steady, low-temperature operating environment
   for various electronic devices such as laser diodes, semiconductor
   equipment, infrared detectors and others. The cooling capacity and its
   coefficient of performance (COP) are both extremely important in
   considering applications. Optimizing the dimensions of the TEC legs
   provides the advantage of increasing the cooling capacity, while
   simultaneously considering its minimum COP. This study proposed a method
   of optimizing the dimensions of the TEC legs using genetic algorithms
   (GAs), to maximize the cooling capacity. A confined volume in which the
   TEC can be placed and the technological limitation in manufacturing a
   TEC leg were considered, and three parameters-leg length, leg area and
   the number of legs-were taken as the variables to be optimized. The
   constraints of minimum COP and maximum cost of the material were set,
   and a genetic search was performed to determine the optimal dimensions
   of the TEC legs. This work reveals that optimizing the dimensions of the
   TEC can increase its cooling capacity. The results also show that GAs
   can determine the optimal dimensions according to various input currents
   and various cold-side operating temperatures. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Objectives: We used intravenous midazolam and ketamine for children
   undergoing minor operative procedures with satisfactory results. We
   aimed to further evaluate its efficacy and adverse effects in pediatric
   ward setting. Methods: This was a prospective study of all children
   undergoing minor operations with sedation in our pediatric general and
   oncology wards from July 1998 to June 1999. The procedures included
   lumber puncture +/- intrathecal chemotherapy, bone marrow aspiration +/-
   trephine biopsy, central venous catheter removal, skin biopsy, or their
   combination. All sedation procedures were started with midazolam 0.1
   mg/kg and ketamine 1 mg/kg; they were increased gradually to 0.4 and 4
   mg/kg, respectively, if necessary. Heart rate and SaO(2) were
   continuously monitored. Results: Altogether, 369 minor operations were
   performed in 112 patients (male:female=2:1, median age 6 years, range 5
   months-17 years). All achieved adequate sedation, with 96\% within 30 s
   and 75\% required just the starting dose. Younger children required a
   higher dosage (p=0.003 for midazolam, p < 0.001 for ketamine). The
   median recovery time was 87 min, with no association with age, sex, or
   dosage of sedation, but was longer in patients having hallucination
   (p=0.001). Adverse effects included tachycardia (27.9\%), increased
   secretion (17.6\%), agitation (13.6\%), nausea and vomiting (9.2\%),
   hallucination (8.7\%), desaturation (8.4\%), and cataleptic reaction
   (0.8\%). All desaturation episodes were transient and responded to
   oxygen supplement alone. None developed bronchospasm or convulsion. Some
   adverse effects were dose-related. Half of the children who received 0.3
   mg/kg midazolam developed desaturation. Conclusions: Intravenous
   midazolam-ketamine can provide rapid, effective, and safe sedation for
   children undergoing minor operations in ward setting. Adverse effects
   are mild. Midazolam above 0.3 mg/kg should be used with caution.}},

Abstract = {{Epidermoid cysts of the biliary tree have not previously been described.
   A baby boy presented with a prenatally diagnosed echolucent intrahepatic
   cyst. Postnatal radioisotope study of the liver demonstrated that the
   cyst communicated with the biliary tree. Follow-up ultrasound at 6
   months demonstrated that the cyst was filled with echogenic material
   consistent with either blood or biliary debris. Due to the potential for
   obstruction and cholangitis, surgery was planned. The cyst was located
   at the confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts and involved all
   of the common hepatic duct. The entire cyst was resected except for the
   patch containing 3 duct orifices: the opening of both hepatic ducts as
   well as the orifice leading to the common bile duct. A Roux-en-Y cyst
   jejunostomy was created to allow drainage of both left and right hepatic
   ducts. The connection also provided access to the cyst remnant through
   the common duct for future endoscopic monitoring of potential malignant
   transformation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A rapid and simple high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method
   was developed and validated for the quantification of clindamycin in
   human plasma. After precipitation with 50\% trichloroacetic acid (TCA)
   containing the internal standard, propranolol, the analysis of the
   clindamycin level in the plasma samples was carried out using a
   reverse-phase cyano (CN) column with ultraviolet detection (204 nm). The
   chromatographic separation was accomplished with an isocratic mobile
   phase consisting of acetonitrile-distilled water-7.6 mm
   tetramethylammonium chloride (TMA) (60:40:0.075, v/v/v), adjusted to pH
   3.2. The proposed method was specific and sensitive with a lower limit
   of quantitation (LLOQ) of 0.2 mu g/mL. This HPLC method was validated by
   examining the precision and accuracy for inter- and intraday analysis in
   the concentration range 0.2-20.0 mu g/mL. The relative standard
   deviations (RSD) in the inter- and intraday validation were 6.1-14.9 and
   6.0-16.1\%, respectively. In the stability test, clindamycin was found
   to be stable in human plasma during the storage and assay procedure. The
   present HPLC method was applied to the analysis of samples taken up to
   12 h after a single oral administration of clindamycin in healthy
   volunteers. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Although protein-protein interactions are involved in nearly all

   of affinity maturation for a protein-protein interaction system that we
   had previously characterized energetically. This model system exhibits a
   1500-fold affinity increase. Also, its affinity maturation is restricted
   by negative intramolecular cooperativity. With three complex and six
   unliganded variant X-ray crystal structures, we provide molecular
   snapshots of protein interface remodeling events that span the breadth
   of the affinity maturation process and present a comprehensive
   structural view of affinity maturation. Correlating crystallographically
   observed structural changes with measured energetic changes reveals
   molecular bases for affinity maturation, intramolecular cooperativity,

Abstract = {{Bulk amorphous NiTiZrSiSn feedstock was sprayed using a high velocity
   oxy-fuel spraying process. In order to evaluate the amorphous
   formability in view of chemical instability, the oxygen to hydrogen gas
   flow rate ratio was changed at the constant total gas flow rate. Flame
   gas enthalpy was increased with the O-2/H-2 gas ratio. In-flight
   particle melting state was improved with the increase of oxidizer flow
   rate. Accordingly, porosity as well as unmelted particle size and
   density were decreased. For the amorphous phase fraction within an
   as-sprayed coating, it was decreased with the oxygen flow rate. From the
   thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction, the effects of O-2/H-2 gas ratio
   on the crystallization of HVOF sprayed bulk amorphous NiTiZrSiSn could
   be divided into two categories. One is due to the solid-state
   crystallization during flight along the low gas enthalpy flame. The
   other results from the destabilization of bulk amorphous feedstock due
   to the chemical composition change resulting from in-flight particle
   oxidation at the higher oxygen gas flow rate. Oxidation degree was
   different from the O2/H2 gas ratio and it had influences on the glass
   formability {[}Delta Tx] and crystalline phase. Increase of oxide phase
   fraction was parallel to that of gamma-Ni solid solution. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Advances in spaceborne vehicular technology have made possible the
   long-life duration of the mission in harsh cosmic environments.
   Reliability and data integrity are the commonly emphasized requirements
   of spaceborne solid-state mass storage systems, because faults due to
   the harsh cosmic environments, such as extreme radiation, can be
   experienced throughout the mission. Acceptable dependability for these
   instruments has been achieved by using redundancy and repair.
   Reconfiguration (repair) of memory arrays using spare memory lines is
   the most common technique for reliability enhancement of memories with
   faults. Faulty cells in memory arrays are known to show spatial
   locality. This physical phenomenon is referred to as fault clustering.
   This paper initially investigates a quadrat-based fault model for memory
   arrays under clustered faults to establish a reliable foundation of
   measurement. Then, lifelong dependability of a fault-tolerant spaceborne
   memory system with hierarchical active redundancy, which consists of
   spare columns in each memory module ana-redundant memory modules, is
   measured in terms of the reliability (i.e., the conditional probability
   that the system performs correctly throughout the mission) and
   mean-time-to-failure (i.e., the expected time that a system will operate
   before it fails). Finally, minimal column redundancy search technique
   for the fault-tolerant memory system is proposed and verified through a
   series of parametric simulations. Thereby, design and fabrication of
   cost-effective and highly reliable fault-tolerant onboard mass storage
   system can be realized for dependable instrumentation.}},

Title = {{Extremely Pb-rich rock-forming silicates including a beryllian scapolite
   and associated minerals in a skarn from Langban, Varmland, Sweden}},

Abstract = {{We report preliminary petrographic and mineral chemical data for a rock
   hosting an unusual mineral assemblage from Langban, Varmland, Sweden.
   The rock is a two feldspar-scapolite-spessartine-romeite skarn. The bulk
   composition and high degree of enrichment in Pb, Sb and As suggest that
   the rock was formed by reaction between a pre-existing Mn skarn
   containing the chalcophiles and a potassic granite, with loss of silica,
   alkalis and CO2. The alkali feldspar is a Pb-rich hyalophane, averaging
   Or(63)Ab(19)Cs(15)Pb(03), the plagioclase feldspar a Pb-rich
   labradorite, An(48)Ab(48)Or(02)Pb(02), and the scapolite a `mizzonite'
   (Ca/(Na+Ca) = 0.66-0.70). These minerals show their highest Pb contents
   recorded in nature to date: up to a maximum of 5.7 wt.\% PbO in the
   hyalophane, 2.1\% PbO in the plagioclase, and 5.3\% PbO in the
   scapolite. Laser ablation ICP-MS of a scapolite grain detected
   substantial Be up to 1.7 wt.\% BeO (0.6 Be per 12 tetrahedral cations),
   as well as Pb up to 7.05 wt.\% PbO. The Be is incorporated into
   scapolite via the coupled exchange {[}Be(OH)]{[}Al(CO3,SO4)](-1). This
   is the first documentation of scapolite as the major repository for Be
   in a rock.
   The romeite also contains substantial Pb, and shows extensive solid
   solution towards end-members containing Fe3+, Ti and Sb3+. In some
   analyses, the dominant end-members are Ca-2(Fe0.53+Sb1.55+)O-6(OH) and
   its Pb analogue rather than (Ca,Pb)(2)Sb2O7. Complex exsolution textures
   are displayed in the hyalophane, by hancockite-epidote,
   romeite-bindheimite and hedyphane-johnbaumite. Ca-rich scapolite and
   hancockite appear to be new minerals for the Langban deposit.
   The mineralogy appears consistent with the regional peak conditions of P
   = 3 kbar, T > 600 degrees C. Several potential thermobarometers for
   Mn-rich skarns are identified in this rock.}},

   acceptor while oxidizing ammonium (NH4+) to NO2- for energy production.
   This NH4+ oxidation under iron reducing anaerobic conditions is

   analysis suggests that enforcement decisions are best predicted with the
   Herfindahl index when the relevant theory is collusion and the number of
   significant rivals when the relevant theory is unilateral effects.
   Evidence such as ``hot{''} documents, customer complaints, and
   historical events suggestive of past competitive problems also increase
   the chance of a challenge. Mirror image considerations suggestive of
   continued post-merger competition ({''}cold{''} documents, customer
   support, and procompetitive events) reduce the probability of challenge
   in one specification.}},

Abstract = {{Although the regulation of arterial blood flow has been a subject of
   intensive medical research, the precise circulatory mechanisms involved
   are still not fully understood. It has been increasingly recognized that
   the endothelium plays a vital role in regulating vascular tone,
   structure, and function. A seminal discovery was made with the
   identification of endothelium-derived relaxing factor, a key mediator of
   vasodilation, which was later identified as nitric oxide (NO). Nitric
   oxide is synthesized from the amino acid L-arginine in the endothelium.
   Decreased bioavailability of NO is associated with arterial stiffness,
   hypertension, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
   Nebivolol is a novel beta-blocker that is highly selective for
   beta(1)-adrenergic receptors. Nebivolol also causes vasodilation through
   a mechanism involving endothelium-derived NO. In clinical studies in
   hypertensive subjects, nebivolol significantly improves vasodilator
   responses to endothelium-dependent agonists such as acetylcholine. In
   addition, nebivolol significantly reduces pulse wave velocity (PWV), a
   measure of arterial stiffness, whereas the beta-blocker atenolol has no
   effect on PWV. Because endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness
   play an integral part in the early atherosclerotic process and are
   associated with poor outcomes and increased mortality, independent of
   blood pressure, the ability of nebivolol to enhance release of
   endothelium-derived NO may have significant clinical implications for
   the use of this agent in the treatment of hypertension and CVD.}},

Abstract = {{Asteroid and cornet impacts can have a profound influence on the
   habitats available for lithophytic microorganisms. Using evidence from
   the Haughton impact structure, Nunavut, Canadian High Arctic, we
   describe the role of impacts in influencing, the nature of the
   lithophytic ecological niche. Impact-induced increases in rock porosity
   and fracturing can result in the formation of cryptoendolithic habitats.
   In some cases and depending upon the target material, an increase in
   rock translucence can yield new habitats for photosynthetic
   cryptoendoliths. Chasmoendolithic habitats are associated with cracks
   and cavities connected to the surface of the rock and are commonly
   increased in abundance as a result of impact bulking. Chasmoendolithic
   habitats require less specific geological conditions than are required
   for cryptoendolithic habitats, and their formation is likely to be
   common to most impact events. Impact events are unlikely to have all
   influence on epilithic and hypolithic habitats except in rare cases,
   where, for example, the formation of impact glasses might yield new
   hypolithic habitats. We present a synthetic understanding of the
   influence of asteroid and comet impacts on the availability and
   characteristics of rocky habitats for microorganisms.}},

   responses to violence against women: the use of language in the social
   work discourse and the reluctance to use research to guide social work
   knowledge and practice. The ways in which these two factors guide social
   work's ideology about violence against women and, in turn, its focus on

Abstract = {{One area of ecological benefit not yet fully evaluated in European
   waters is the utilisation of restored saltmarsh habitats by fish
   species. This study examines the utilisation of managed realignments and
   relic saltmarsh by fish species. Factors affecting habitat heterogeneity
   and fish populations are discussed, and recommendations are made with
   respect to scheme design and management that will maximise the
   biological and socio-economic values. Fish populations in the high
   intertidal areas were assessed using a suite of techniques, including
   observations on feeding behaviour. Each microhabitat was discussed as a
   function of the extent of fish colonisation. A positive relationship
   between the degree of fish utilisation and habitat heterogeneity was
   ascertained using species richness, abundance and behavioural
   observations. This study will aid habitat valuation for economic
   justification of managed realignments, over and above existing drivers,
   such as compensatory habitat for encroachment, flood defence and the
   European Union Habitats Directive. The work now forms part of a wider
   European Interreg IIIb project, COMCOAST.}},

Abstract = {{We used 49 epidemiologic studies based on 84 papers published since 1950

   control of smoking or economic status if they related to lung or stomach
   cancer. There was no excess mortality from all causes combined among
   chrome-exposed persons. A minimal excess of cancer (SMR = 112), overall,
   was due primarily to an excess of lung cancer (SMR = 141) but the SMR
   was 112 among the better-quality, smoking-controlled studies. The
   overall SMR for stomach cancer was 113 but it was 82 among the studies
   that were controlled for economic status. Findings were unremarkable for
   the six. other cancers evaluated: prostate, kidney, and central nervous
   system cancer and leukemia, Hodgkin's disease and other
   lymphatoh-ematopoietic cancer. This series of meta-analyses indicates
   that chrome-six is a weak cause of lung cancer and is not a cause of any
   of the other seven forms of cancer evaluated. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Although buprenorphine is used worldwide as a safe and effective
   maintenance medication for opioid dependence, some countries have
   reported a growing incidence of abuse of this medication. Buprenorphine
   is considered to have lower abuse potential because of its partial
   agonist profile, but no studies have directly compared the reinforcing
   effects of buprenorphine with those of full mu opioid agonists in
   humans. The present double-blind, placebo-controlled inpatient study
   compared the reinforcing and subjective effects of intravenously
   administered buprenorphine (0.5, 2, and 8 mg) and methadone (5, 10, and
   20 mg). Participants (n = 6) were detoxified from heroin during the
   first 1 to 2 weeks after admission. During subsequent weeks,
   participants received a sample drug dose and \$20 on Monday, and they
   could self-administer either the sampled dose or \$20 during one choice
   session per day on Thursday and Friday. Participants responded under a
   modified progressive ratio schedule during each choice session. All
   active doses maintained higher progressive ratio break points ( largest
   completed ratio) than placebo. There were no significant differences in
   break point values between buprenorphine and methadone or among the
   different doses of drug. However, several subjective ratings, including
   ``good drug effect{''}, ``high{''}, and ``liking{''} dose-dependently
   increased after administration of buprenorphine and methadone. The peak
   ratings for these effects did not significantly differ for the two
   drugs. These results demonstrate that under these experimental
   conditions, buprenorphine and methadone were equally effective in
   producing reinforcing and subjective effects.}},

Volume = {{17}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   This review discusses various aspects of the management of women with
   pregnancies of unknown location.
   Recent findings
   The prevalence of pregnancies of unknown location is dependent on the
   quality of scanning for a given early-pregnancy unit. The higher the
   quality of scanning, the better the detection of ectopic pregnancy using
   ultrasound as a single diagnostic test, which in turn results in fewer
   women being classified with a pregnancy of unknown location. Varying the
   discriminatory zone does not significantly improve the detection of
   ectopic pregnancies in a pregnancy of unknown location population. A
   single serum human chorionic gonadotrophin, when used in a specialized
   transvaginal scanning unit, is not only potentially falsely reassuring
   but also unhelpful in excluding the presence of an ectopic pregnancy. A
   single-visit approach has also been shown to be ineffective. The vast
   majority of women with a pregnancy of unknown location are at low-risk
   for ectopic pregnancy. Traditional strategies are capable of detecting
   the failing pregnancies of unknown location and intra-uterine
   pregnancies within a pregnancy of unknown location population, but they
   lack sensitivity for detecting ectopic pregnancies. This justifies the
   recent development and use of mathematical modelling techniques to
   predict ectopic pregnancies in the pregnancies of unknown location
   population.
   Summary
   New mathematical models have been developed to predict the outcome of
   pregnancies of unknown location; however, prospective studies are needed
   to assess the reproducibility of these models in different centres on
   different populations. Hopefully such models will enable the clinician
   to correctly classify pregnancies of unknown location earlier, in turn
   reducing the number of follow-up visits.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives Various serum human chorionic gonadotropin (bCG)
   discriminatory zones are currently used for evaluating the likelihood of
   an ectopic pregnancy in women classified as having a pregnancy of
   unknown location (PUL) following a transvaginal ultrasound examination.
   We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of discriminatory zones for serum
   hCG levels of > 1000 IU/L, 1500 IU/L and 2000 IU/L for the detection of
   ectopic pregnancy in such women.
   Methods This was a prospective observational study of women who were
   assessed in a specialized transvaginal scanning unit. All women with a
   PUL had serum hCG measured at presentation. Expectant management of PULs
   was adopted. These women were followed up with transvaginal ultrasound,
   monitoring of serum hormone levels and laparoscopy until a final
   diagnosis was established: a failing PUL, an intrauterine pregnancy
   (IUP), an ectopic pregnancy or a persisting PUL. The persisting PULs
   probably represented ectopic pregnancies which had been missed on
   ultrasound and these were incorporated into the ectopic pregnancy group.
   Three different discriminatory zones (1000 IU/L, 1500 IU/L and 2000
   IU/L) were evaluated for predicting ectopic pregnancy in this PUL
   population.
   Results A total of 5544 consecutive women presented to the early
   pregnancy unit between 25 June 2001 and 14 April 2003. Of these, 569
   (10.3\%) women were classified as having a PUL, 42 of which were lost to
   follow up. Of the 527 (9.5\%) cases with PUL analyzed, there were 300
   (56.9\%) failing PULs, 181 (34.3\%) IUPs and 46 (8.7\%) ectopic
   pregnancies. Overall, 74.6\% were symptomatic and 25.4\% were
   asymptomatic (P = 8.825E-07). The sensitivity and specificity of an hCG
   level of > 1000 IU/L to detect ectopic pregnancy were 21.7\% (10/46) and
   87.3\% (420/481), respectively; for an bCG level of > 1500 IU/L these
   values were 15.2\% (7146) and 93.4\% (449/481), respectively, and for an
   hCG level of > 2000 IU/L they were 10.9\% (5/46) and 95.2\% (4581481),
   respectively.
   Conclusions Varying the discriminatory zone does not significantly
   improve the detection of ectopic pregnancy in a PUL population. A single
   measurement of serum bCG is not only potentially falsely reassuring but
   also unhelpful in excluding the presence of an ectopic pregnancy.

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the inflation dynamics of several countries
   belonging to the European Monetary Union and of the UK. We estimate the
   two main parameters driving the degree of persistence in inflation and
   its uncertainty using a dual long memory process. We also investigate
   the possible existence of heterogeneity in inflation dynamics across
   Euro area countries and examine the link between nominal uncertainty and
   macroeconomic performance measured by the inflation and output growth
   rates. Strong evidence is provided for the hypothesis that increased
   inflation raises nominal uncertainty in all countries. However, we find
   that uncertainty surrounding future inflation has a mixed impact on
   output growth. This result brings out an important asymmetry in the
   transmission mechanism of monetary policy in Europe in addition to the
   difference in the economic sizes of the countries. We also investigate
   whether one can find a correlation between central bank independence and
   inflation policy. Our conclusion is that the most independent central
   banks are in countries where inflation falls in response to increased

Abstract = {{Species richness and spatial and temporal distributions of the anuran
   (Amphibla, Anura) community in a locality of Tijucas do Sul, Parana,
   Brazil. In this study we have improved ecological data on the anuran
   fauna of Lagoa (25 degrees 55'S, 49 degrees 11'W), located in the
   Municipality of Tijucas do Sul, State of Pirana, Brazil. The local
   vegetation is composed by pieces of disturbed Araucaria forest,
   anthropic managed pine forest, and few areas with agricultural
   occupations. During 13 months, from March 2000 to March 2001, spatial
   and temporal distributions data of anurans species were collected;
   informations about the microhabitat use and vocalization site were also
   obtained. Twenty-three species were registered. No anuran called during
   the most dry months (April and May), but in the statistical analysis
   this activity was more correlated to temperature than to the rainfall.
   Few spatial overlap among the species on the vocalization sites was
   observed, as these species use different call sites.}},

Abstract = {{Manually editing intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) fluence
   maps effectively controls hot and cold spots that the IMRT optimization
   cannot control. Many times, re-optimizing does not reduce the hot spots
   or increase the cold spots. In fact, re-optimizing only places the hot
   and cold spots in different locations. Fluence-map editing provides
   manual control of dose delivery and provides the best treatment plan
   possible. Several IMRT treatments were planned using the Varian Eclipse
   planning system. We compare the effects on dose distributions between
   fluence-map editing and re-optimization, discuss techniques for
   fluence-map editing, and analyze differences between fluence editing on
   one beam vs. multiple beams. When editing a beam's fluence map, it is
   essential to choose a beam that least affects dose to the tumor and
   critical structures. Editing fluence maps gives an advantage in
   treatment planning and provides controlled delivery of IMRT dose. (c)

Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{181}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{255-267}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Machair grassland uniquely occurs over sandy, calcareous soils of
   coastal sand-plains in dune systems of north-western Scotland and
   Ireland. This study assesses the plant species composition of Irish
   machair grassland at a landscape-scale. Machair sites were sampled with
   quadrats and multivariate analysis was used to assess relationships
   between species abundance, soil physical variables, livestock grazing
   and recreation activity. Grazing by cattle and sheep was recorded at
   most sites, with recreation activities at nearly half the sites.
   Detrended and Canonical Correspondence Analysis ordinations showed that
   the main gradients of community composition were related to the key
   variables of soil calcium carbonate content, soil organic matter
   content, livestock grazing intensity and recreation pressure. Partial
   Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed that livestock grazing
   intensity and recreation pressure explained about twice as much
   variation as the key soil variables and that rabbit grazing had a much
   smaller but significant effect. Livestock grazing and recreation
   activities were shown to be ecologically damaging in terms of having a
   larger area of bare sand and a lower species diversity. Bare sand can
   increase the risk of storm damage and reduce habitat heterogeneity by
   sand-plain deflation. Controls on livestock density, the length of the
   grazing season and recreation activities are proposed, which we suggest
   would facilitate vegetation recovery. We highlight the need for local
   planning authorities, who control coastal development in Ireland, to
   include agricultural management prescriptions in their machair site
   management plans.}},

Pages = {{1067-1076}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Authors investigated, cross-nationally, the factors,
   including demographic, psychiatric ( including cognitive), physical, and
   behavioral, determining whether older people take their prescribed
   medication. Older adults are prescribed more medication than any other
   group, and poor adherence is a common reason for nonresponse to
   medication.
   Methods: Researchers interviewed 3,881 people over age 65 who receive
   home care services in 11 countries, administering a structured interview
   in participants' homes. The main outcome measure was the percentage of
   participants not adherent to medication.
   Results: In all, 12.5\% of people (N = 456) reported that they were not
   fully adherent to medication. Non-adherence was predicted by problem
   drinking (OR = 3.6), not having a doctor review their medication (OR =
   3.3), greater cognitive impairment (OR = 1.4 for every one-point
   increase in impairment), good physical health (OR = 1.2), resisting care
   (OR = 2.1), being unmarried (OR = 2.3), and living in the Czech Republic
   (OR = 4.7) or Germany (OR = 1.4).
   Conclusion: People who screen positive for problem drinking and who have
   dementia (often undiagnosed) are less likely to adhere to medication.
   Therefore, doctors should consider dementia and problem drinking when
   prescribing for older adults. Interventions to improve adherence in
   older adults might be more effective if targeted at these groups. It is
   possible that medication-review enhances adherence by improving the
   doctor patient relationship or by emphasizing the need for medications.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1112-1122}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To examine the influence of corneal allograft rejection on the
   survival of penetrating corneal transplantation, to review the status of
   conventional therapies to improve graft survival, and to consider
   prospects for alternative approaches to reduce the impact of rejection.
   DESIGN: Perspective, including prospective, observational cohort study.
   METHODS: An examination of the literature on human corneal graft
   rejection and data from the Australian Corneal Graft Registry, reviewed
   in the context of clinical experience.
   RESULTS: Corneal graft outcome is not improving with era. The sequelae
   of inflammation, whether occurring before corneal transplantation or
   subsequently, exert a profound influence by predisposing the graft to
   rejection. Of the developments that have been instrumental in reducing
   rejection in vascularized organ transplantation, living-related donation
   is not an option for corneal transplantation. However, HLA matching may
   be beneficial and requires reassessment. The evidence base to support
   the use of systemic immunosuppressive agents in corneal transplantation
   is thin, and topical glucocorticosteroids remain the drugs of choice to
   prevent or reverse rejection episodes. Experimental approaches to local
   allospecific immunosuppression, including the use of anti, body,based
   reagents and gene therapy, are being developed but may be difficult to
   translate from the laboratory bench to the clinic.
   CONCLUSIONS: Corneal allograft rejection remains a major cause of graft
   failure. High-level evidence to vindicate the use of a particular
   approach or treatment to prevent or treat corneal graft rejection is
   lacking. In the absence of extensive data from randomized, controlled
   clinical trials, corneal graft registers and extrapolation from
   experimental models provide some clinically useful information.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) is a relatively common skeletal

   we expressed both normal and mutant matrilin-3 in mammalian cells.
   Wild,type (wt) matrilin-3 was efficiently secreted into conditioned
   medium, whereas mutant matrilin-3 was retained and accumulated within
   the cell. Furthermore, when the mutant A-domains were examined
   individually, they existed primarily in an unfolded conformation.
   Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the mutant
   A,domains were specifically associated with ERp72, a chaperone protein
   known to be involved in mediating disulfide bond formation. Light
   microscopy of cartilage from an MED patient with a MATN3 mutation showed
   the presence of intracellular material within the chondrocytes, whilst
   the overall matrix appeared normal. On electron micrographs, the
   inclusions noted at the light microscopy level appeared to be dilated
   cisternae of rough endoplasmic reticulum and immunohistochemical
   analysis confirmed that the retained protein was matrilin-3. In summary,
   the data presented in this paper suggest that MED caused by MATN3
   mutations is the result of an intracellular retention of the mutant
   protein. Hum Mutat 26(6), 557-565, 2005. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

   Case. We report on two patients who developed unexpected subacute

Abstract = {{Study Objectives. To examine electrocardiographic findings after short-
   and long-term tiotropium therapy in patients with chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease (COPD), and to establish previously reported
   symptomatic efficacy.
   Design. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
   study.
   Setting. Twelve outpatient investigational centers in the United States.
   Patients. One hundred ninety-six patients with COPD.
   Intervention. Patients received either tiotropium 18 mu g once/day or
   placebo, delivered by the HandiHaler device.
   Measurements and Main Results. Electrocardiography (predose and 5 min
   postdose) and 24-hour Holter monitoring were performed at baseline and
   after 8 and 12 weeks of treatment with tiotropium 18 pg once/day or
   placebo. Efficacy measures (spirometry, global COPD ratings, scores on
   the EuroQol Health Questionnaire {[}EQ-5D], albuterol inhaler as needed)
   were included to demonstrate that the study population exhibited the
   characteristic improvements observed in previous tiotropium studies.
   Mean baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was 1.03 L.
   Mean changes in heart rate from baseline were similar in both groups. No
   differences were noted in the percentage of patients developing rhythm
   or conduction abnormalities detected with electrocardiography or Holter
   monitoring. Frequency of premature beats and mean maximal changes in PR,
   QRS, QT, QTcB, and QTcF intervals were similar in both groups. No
   patients developed new-onset QT or QTc intervals greater than 500 msec,
   and no differences were noted in the percentage of patients developing
   new QT prolongation less than 30 msec, 30-60 msec, or greater than 60
   msec. At 12 weeks, predose and postdose improvements in FEV1 were 184
   and 265 ml, respectively, with tiotropium versus placebo (p<0.001).
   Physician and patient global COPD ratings and the EQ-5D visual analog
   scale scores were improved with tiotropium (p<0.05); as-needed albuterol
   was reduced by 25\% relative to placebo (p<0.05).
   Conclusion. Tiotropium provided spirometric and symptomatic benefits in
   patients with COPD and was not associated with evidence of electro-
   cardiographic changes in heart rate, rhythm, QT intervals, or
   conduction.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to evaluate the safety and
   efficacy of transhepatic lobar portal vein embolization (PVE) using
   polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles to induce contralateral lobar
   hypertrophy in patients with liver-only metastases and normal underlying
   liver function.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS. Fifty-eight consecutive patients with small
   predicted future liver remnants (FLRs) underwent PVE with PVA particles
   to induce hypertrophy of the contralateral hemi-liver before surgical
   resection of liver metastases. Total liver, right hemi-liver, and left
   hemi-liver volumes were calculated before and after embolization using a
   3D workstation.
   RESULTS. Eight patients underwent left PVE; 47, right PVE; and three,
   right and segment IV PVE. There were no major complications of the
   procedure. The mean increases in the ratio of the FLR to the total
   estimated liver volume after right, right and segment IV, and left PVE
   were 9\%, 10\%, and 3\%, respectively; the corresponding mean
   hypertrophy ratios were 24.3\%, 31.9\%, and 1.5\%, respectively.
   CONCLUSION. Right PVE using PVA particles alone as the embolic agent is
   safe and effective in achieving left hemi-liver hypertrophy. In
   contrast, left PVE did not induce significant right hemi-liver
   hypertrophy in this patient population.}},

Abstract = {{For elk (Cervus elaphus) in the Gallatin drainage of the Greater
   Yellowstone Ecosystem, Montana, USA, wolf movements caused local
   predation risk to vary substantially on a time scale of days. Spatially
   and temporally fine-scaled data from GPS radio collars show that elk
   moved into the protective cover of wooded areas when wolves were
   present, reducing their use of preferred grassland foraging habitats
   that had high predation risk. By constraining habitat selection, wolves
   may have greater effects oil elk dynamics than would be predicted oil
   the basis of direct predation alone. Based on changes in the woody
   vegetation following the reintroduction of wolves, it has been suggested
   that antipredator responses by elk may be driving a trophic cascade in
   the Yellowstone ecosystem. However, Studies to date have been hampered
   by a lack of direct data on spatial variation in predation risk, and the
   ways in which elk respond to variation in risk. Our data Support a
   central portion of the hypothesis that elk antipredator behavior could
   drive a trophic cascade, but changes in elk numbers are also likely to
   have affected elk-plant interactions.}},

Title = {{Simultaneous intra-accumbens remifentanil and dopamine kinetics suggest
   that neither determines within-session operant responding}},
Journal = {{PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{183}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{201-209}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Rationale: The ultra-short-acting mu opioid agonist analgesic/anesthetic
   remifentanil (RMF) is extremely rapidly eliminated from blood (half-life
   in rats, 0.3-0.7 min). This extremely fast elimination is thought to be
   the main reason why RMF maintains such high rates of responding in
   animal operant-conditioning models of drug addiction. Objective: The
   present study investigated if such a fast elimination of RMF also occurs
   in the extracellular space of the brain, i.e., in the pharmacokinetic
   compartment that is thought to be ultimately mediating the reinforcing
   effect, and hence, the abuse liability of drugs. Methods: Nucleus
   accumbens (NAC) RMF and dopamine (DA) were simultaneously quantified by
   in vivo microdialysis followed by tandem mass spectrometry both in rats
   that traversed an alley to receive intravenous injections of 0.032 mg
   kg(-1) RMF in an operant runway procedure (contingent RMF) and in rats
   that passively received RMF in the runway (noncontingent RMF). Results:
   Regardless of the mode of administration (i.e., contingent or
   noncontingent), intra-accumbens RMF peaked in the first 10-min sample
   and decreased exponentially with a t(1/2) of 10.0 +/- 1.2 min (N=31).
   RMF-stimulated DA peaked in the 10-min sample immediately after the RMF
   peak and decreased with a time course very similar to that of RMF.
   Crosscorrelation of the NAC RMF and NAC DA curves showed them to be
   tightly synchronized. Noncontingent single-dose RMF was eliminated from
   the whole brain with a half-life of 1.1 +/- 0.2 min and from blood with
   a half-life of 0.3 min or less. The comparison of blood-vs-brain RMF
   pharmacokinetics with rat RMF self-administration behavior, either in
   operant runway (present study) or in lever-press-based
   operant-conditioning procedures, suggests that titration of blood RMF,
   whole-brain RMF, intra-accumbens RMF, or accumbal DA levels (assessed
   with the limited temporal resolution of in vivo microdialysis) does not
   determine a rat's decision to reemit a response during a
   multiple-injection drug self-administration session.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal behaviour of the milk alkaline proteinase, plasmin, was
   studied in acid and sweet (rennet) whey; indigenous (bovine) plasmin was
   studied in the former system, but endogenous porcine plasmin was added
   in the latter, due to the very low levels of residual plasmin. The
   inactivation of plasmin in both systems followed first-order
   inactivation kinetics, which was consistent with previous observations
   of plasmin inactivation in milk and model milk systems. The thermal
   inactivation of plasmin in acid whey (D-90 (C) = 108 + 29 min, z = 24.5
   + 1.2 degrees C) was much slower than in the sweet whey system (D-90 (C)
   = 0.021 + 0.006 min, z = 7.3 +/- 0.3 degrees C). Similarly, denaturation
   of beta-lactoglobulin (beta-lg) followed a first-order inactivation
   profile and this protein was also more heat stable in acid whey (D-90

   (C) = 0.81 +/- 0.29 min, z = 9.1 +/- 0.5 degrees C). While it is
   possible that the increased heat stability of plasmin in acid whey is
   due to reduced sulphydryl/ disulphide interchange reactions between
   plasmin and beta-lg, it also appears that structural changes in the
   plasmin molecule were a significant contributory effect on the thermal
   stability of plasmin in this system. Increasing the pH of acid whey
   decreased the heat stability of plasmin. However, adjusting the pH of
   sweet whey had little effect on the heat stability of plasmin. Overall,
   severe heat treatments may be required to ensure inactivation of the
   enzyme in acid whey, but a balance is required between reducing the
   activity of plasmin and maintaining the functionality of whey proteins
   as food ingredients. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the
   progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and a
   marked reduction of dopamine (DA) levels in the striatum. Binding to its
   specific receptors, DA switches on a complex program of intracellular
   signaling that regulates gene expression. We evaluated the changes in
   striatal gene expression in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease, using
   differential display analysis. The mRNA for the cytoskeleton family
   proteins, radixin, cofilin and centractin/ARP-1, was abnormally
   expressed in the striatum of these MPTP-treated mice. Moreover, we also
   found that radixin mRNA and its protein levels are under DA control
   through specific D1-dopaminergic receptors in a dose- and time-dependent
   manner in the GT1-7 neural cell line. These findings suggest a role for
   DA for regulation of cytoskeletal proteins involved in the integrity and
   function of synapsis. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the study was to determine effect of high sodium intake
   on fluid and electrolyte turnover and heart remodeling in the cardiac
   failure elicited by myocardial infarction (MI). The experiments were
   performed on four groups of Sprague Dawley rats maintained on food
   containing 0.45\% NaCl and drinking either water (groups 1, 2) or 1\%
   NaCl (groups 3, 4). Groups I and 3 were sham-operated while in groups 2
   and 4 MI was produced by the coronary artery ligation. In each group
   food and fluid as well as sodium intake, urine (V-u), sodium (UNaV),
   potassium (UKV) and solutes (UosmV) excretion were determined before and
   four weeks after the surgery. Size of the infarct, left ventricle (LV)
   weight and diameter of LV and right ventricle (RV) myocytes were
   determined during post-mortem examination. Before the surgery groups 3
   and 4 ingested significantly more fluid and sodium, had higher V-u,
   U-Na, UKV and UosmV than the respective groups 1 and 2. In groups 2 and
   4 MI resulted in significant decrease in V-u, UNaV and UosmV in
   comparison to the presurgical level. In Group 4 MI resulted also in a
   significant decrease of food and sodium intake. The MI size did not
   differ in groups 2 and 4 while diameter of LV myocytes was significantly
   greater in groups 2 and 4 than in groups I and 3, and in group 4 than in
   group 2. The study reveals that prolonged high sodium consumption
   increases fluid and electrolyte turnover both in the sham and in the MI
   rats and that the MI causes decrease in food and sodium intake in rats
   on high but not on regular sodium intake. In addition high sodium diet
   promotes development of greater post-MI hypertrophy of the LV myocytes.}},

Abstract = {{Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we examined the relative
   contributions of familiarity and recollection to recognition memory for
   items and their study contexts in school-aged children and adults.
   Whereas adults were able to selectively accept target items and to
   reject familiar nontarget items in ail exclusion task, this
   discrimination was more difficult for children, as was evident in the
   high false alarm rates to nontargets even when item memory was
   controlled for. The analysis of the adults' ERPs revealed more flexible
   and task-appropriate retrieval mechanisms, as was evident in the
   correlates of familiarity, recollection, mid nontarget retrieval, as
   well as in postretrieval evaluation. In contrast, children's ERPs
   revealed a parietal old/new effect for targets taken as a putative
   correlate of recollection. These findings suggest that children rely
   predominantly oil recollection during recognition judgments, even in the
   absence of efficient memory control processes. The latter processes
   enable adults to monitor and verify the retrieved information and to
   control nontarget retrieval in the service of adequate source memory
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{The clinical spectrum of mixed cryoglobulinemia embraces several
   manifestations: recurrent vascular purpura, weakness,
   arthralgia/arthritis, glomerulonephritis, peripheral neuropathies, and
   Raynaud's phenomenon. Mixed cryoglobulinemia is currently treated with
   steroids, low-antigen content diet, immunosuppressors, plasma exchange,
   and antiviral therapy, namely, a-interferon alone or, more recently, in
   association with ribavirin. In the present research, we verified the
   effectiveness of combined therapy with interferon and ribavirin on
   asymptomatic mixed cryoglobulinemia in naive (never treated before)
   patients with chronic hepatitis C. We enrolled 50 consecutive patients,
   31 males and 19 females, with chronic hepatitis C who showed a sustained
   response to combined antiviral therapy (interferon and ribavirin).
   Before treatment, cryoglobulins were detected in 25 subjects (50\%).
   Only 1 of the 25 patients with asymptomatic mixed cryoglobulinemia had
   persistence of cryoglobulins at the end of the follow-up period.
   Unexpectedly, in 7 of 25 subjects without mixed cryoglobulinemia before
   treatment, cryoglobulins became detectable after antiviral therapy. Our
   present study first reports the onset of asymptomatic mixed
   cryoglobulinemia in hepatitis C virus patients after clearance of the
   virus from blood obtained with a combined antiviral treatment. Possible
   explanations are discussed. Our data also suggest that the appearance of
   a clinically evident mixed cryoglobulinemia cannot be excluded in this
   kind of subject.}},

Abstract = {{We examined whether encasing the alumina ceramic total hip arthroplasty
   insert in a thin titanium sleeve would reduce significantly or eliminate
   insert chipping on impaction of the insert into the shell. We also
   compared results, including observations of osteolysis, of the Trident
   (R) study group with those of the predecessor alumina bearing couple
   design to determine clinical improvement and radiographic stability.
   Beginning in October 1996, 328 alumina ceramic bearings were implanted
   by six surgeons in 316 patients as a part of a prospective, randomized
   United States Investigational Device Exemption three-arm study comparing
   an alumina ceramic bearing with a control bearing of cobalt-chromium on
   polyethylene. In September 1999, a fourth arm of the study (Trident (R))
   was added. The Trident (R) insert was recessed within a thin titanium
   sleeve. At three to five years followup, osteolysis was found in 0\% of
   the patients with the Trident (R) insert and in 0.5\% of the patients
   with an alumina bearing couple. At a mean followup of 4.2 years (range,
   3-5 years) no ceramic chips, fractures, or ceramic bearing failures have
   occurred. Encasing the alumina ceramic insert in a titanium sleeve seems
   to have resolved the issue of insert chipping on impaction and supports
   the continued use of Trident (R) bearings in relatively young patients.

Abstract = {{Excessive leukocyte proliferation and proinflammatory mediators release
   represent common phenomena in several chronic inflammatory diseases.
   Multiple evidences identify lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a small lipid
   endowed with pleiotropic activities, as an important modulator of both
   proliferation and activation of different cell types involved in several
   inflammation-associated pathologies. However, its possible role on
   monocyte proinflammatory activation is not fully understood yet. Aim of
   the present study was to investigate LPA effects on THP-1 cells in terms
   of proliferation, reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) production and
   release of arachidonic acid-derived inflammatory mediators. Actually,
   LPA significantly increased both DNA synthesis and ROI production as
   well as prostaglandin E-2 release and the upregulation of LPA(3)
   receptor expression. These findings identified LPA as both a growth
   factor and a triggering mediator of proinflammatory response in THP-1
   cells.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of fluvoxamine on plasma concentrations of risperidone and
   its active metabolite 9-hydroxyrisperidone (9-OH-risperidone) was
   investigated in 11 schizophrenic patients with prevailingly negative or
   depressive symptoms. Additional fluvoxamine, at the dose of 100 mg/day,
   was administered for 4 weeks to patients stabilized on risperidone (3-6
   mg/day). Mean plasma concentrations of risperidone, 9-OH-risperidone and
   the active moiety (sum of the concentrations of risperidone and
   9-OH-risperidone) were not significantly modified following
   co-administration with fluvoxamine. After 4 weeks, fluvoxamine dosage
   was increased to 200 mg/day in five patients and then maintained until
   the end of week 8. At final evaluation, mean plasma levels of
   risperidone active moiety were not modified in the six patients who were
   still receiving the initial fluvoxamine dose, while concentrations
   increased slightly but significantly (by a mean 26\% over pretreatment;
   P < 0.05) in the subgroup of five subjects treated with a final dose of
   200 mg/day. Fluvoxamine co-administration with risperidone was well
   tolerated and no patient developed extrapyramidal side effects. These
   findings indicate that fluvoxamine at dosages up to 100 mg/day is not
   associated with clinically significant changes in plasma risperidone
   concentrations. However, higher doses of fluvoxamine may elevate plasma
   risperidone levels, presumably as a result of a dose-dependent
   inhibitory effect of fluvoxamine on CYP2D6-and/or CYP3A4-mediated
   9-hydroxylation of risperidone. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   CPDA-1 RBC stored for up to 3 days. Demographic and transfusion-related
   data were collected. Neonates from both groups showed similar
   demographics and clinical characteristics. The number of transfusions

   containing 29.7 +/- 18.3 mmol L-1 of potassium (RBC stored for up to 28
   days) did not cause clinical or biochemical changes and reduced donor
   exposures by 70.2\%, compared to transfusions containing 19.8 +/- 12.3
   mmol L-1 of potassium (RBC stored for up to 3 days), P < 0.001. In
   conclusion, RBC stored for up to 28 days safely reduced donor exposures

Abstract = {{We have isolated a new phospholipase A(2) (MiDCA1) from the venom of the
   coral snake Micrurus dumerilii carinicauda. This toxin, which had a
   molecular mass of 15,552 Da, shared high sequence homology with the
   PLA(2) toxins MICNI A and B from Micrurus nigrocinctus venom (77.7\% and
   73.1\%, respectively). In chick biventer cervicis preparations, MiDCA1
   produced concentration- and time-dependent neuromuscular blockade that
   reached 100\% after 120 min (2.4 mu M, n = 6); contractures to
   exogenously applied carbachol (8 mu M) and KCl (13 mM) were still seen
   after complete blockade. In mouse phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparations,
   MiDCA1 (2.4 mu M; n = 6) caused triphasic changes followed by partial
   neuromuscular blockade. Intracellular recordings of end-plate potentials
   (EPPs) and miniature end-plate potentials (MEPPs) from mouse diaphragm
   preparations showed that MiDCA1 increased the quantal content by 386 +/-
   12\% after 10 min (n = 14; p < 0.05) and caused a triphasic change in
   the frequency of MEPPs. MiDCA1 also decreased the resting membrane
   potential, an effect that was prevented by tetrodotoxin and/or low
   extracellular calcium, but not by d-tubocurarine. The toxin increased
   the amplitude of mouse sciatic-nerve compound action potentials by 30
   +/- 9\% (0.6 M; p < 0.05). Potassium currents elicited in freshly
   dissociated dorsal root ganglia neurones were blocked by 31 +/- 1\% (n =
   4;p < 0.05) in the presence of 2.4 M MiDCA1. These results show that
   MiDCA1 is a new presynaptic phospholipase A(2) that produces
   neuromuscular blockade in vertebrate nerve-muscle preparations. The
   triphasic effects seen in mammalian preparations and the facilitatory
   response were probably caused mainly by the activation of sodium
   channels, complemented by the blockade of nerve terminal potassium
   channels. The inability of d-turocurarine to prevent the depolarization
   by MiDCA1 indicated that cholinergic nicotinic receptors were not
   involved in this phenomenon. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of
   total vascular exclusion (TVE) on the liver during the early period of
   reperfusion.
   Materials and methods. Forty Wistar-Albino rats were divided into four
   groups. Portal pedicle clamping (groups 1 and 2) or TVE (groups 3 and 4)
   were applied for 10 minutes. Samples were collected at the time of clamp
   release (groups 1 and 3) and at 30 minutes of reperfusion (groups 2 and
   4). We examined oxidative injury to and histopathology of the liver.
   Results. Oxidative stress was more prominent with TVE application.
   Significant alterations were shown in hepatic superoxide dismutase,
   catalase, glutathione, and glutathione S-transferase levels. The levels
   of malondialdehyde and myeloperoxidase were not altered significantly.
   Conclusion. Inflow-outflow occlusion of the liver causes more oxidative
   stress compared with inflow occlusion.}},

Abstract = {{Nutrient concentrations in plant and soil and their rates of cycling in
   poplar (Populus deltoides)-based agroforestry systems were studied at
   Pusa, Bihar, India. The nutrient concentrations in the standing biomass
   of the crop were more than those in tree, whereas the nutrient contents
   showed the reverse trend. Soil, litter and vegetation accounted for
   80.3-99.5, 0.1-5.0 and 0.4-14.7\%, respectively, of the total nutrients
   in the system. Considerable reduction (40-54\%) in concentration of
   nutrients in leaves occurred during senescence. The uptake of nutrients
   by vegetation, and also by different components with and without
   adjustment for internal recycling, were calculated separately. Annual
   transfer of litter nutrient to the soil by vegetation was 37.3-146.2 N,
   5.6-17.9 P and 25.0-66.3 K kg ha(-1) year(-1) in young (3-year-old) and
   mature (9-year-old) plantations. Turnover rate and time for different
   nutrients ranged between 0.86-0.99 year(-1) and 1.01-1.16 years,
   respectively. Compartmental models for nutrient dynamics have been
   developed to represent the distribution of nutrient contents and net
   annual fluxes within the system. This study shows that the poplar-based
   agroforestry system can be sustainable in terms of soil nutrient status.}},

Abstract = {{Dust explosions are a serious hazard in the process industries. They
   have resulted in the destruction of process plants and equipment, injury
   to workers, and loss of production. The five factors required for a dust
   explosion are: (1)fuel. (2) oxidant, (3) confinement, (4) dispersion,
   and (5) ignition source. These factors are often embodied in an
   ``explosion pentagon.{''} Disruption of any one of these factors can
   prevent a dust explosion from occurring. Before mitigation of a dust
   explosion can take place, one has to realize The full extent of the
   explosion potential of the dust/powder material in the intended process
   environment, This can be achieved by focusing, on the many ways that
   these five components can come together in a specific process condition
   to form a pentagon.
   This risk constitutes two components: the probability of the explosion
   and the severity of the consequences. Both factors have to be fully
   realized to evaluate the dust explosion risk. Currently, standard test
   protocols; are followed to establish a relative measure of these two
   factors. However, these standard lest methods may not reflect the true
   process environment and interpretation of the results are required.
   The purpose of this work is to review lest methodologies for assessing
   the magnitude of an explosion. in a process environment and the ease at
   which the dust explosion can be initiated. This article will also
   critique how they may be applied to ``real-world{''} process
   environments and potential mitigation steps to break the ``explosion

Abstract = {{In this article we review evidence for a variety of long-distance

   functioning, growth, and development of plants in drying soil. We also
   stress the importance of changes in the pH of the leaf cell apoplast as
   influenced both by edaphic and climatic variation, as a regulator of
   shoot growth and functioning, and we show how changes in xylem and
   apoplastic pH can affect the way in which ABA regulates stomatal
   behavior and growth. The sensitivity to drought of the pH/ABA sensing
   and signaling mechanism is emphasized. This allows regulation of plant
   growth, development and functioning, and particularly shoot water
   status, as distinct from stress lesions in growth and other processes as

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Efficient guiding and propagation of multi-keV x-rays in plasmas can be
   achieved by dynamically modifying the media through plasma channel
   formation. The dynamics of plasma channel formation is studied in
   preformed underdense plasma irradiated by a high intensity laser. This
   is done by a two-dimensional model coupling laser propagation to a
   relativistic particle-in-cell model. For laser intensity of 10(20)
   W/cm(2) and a laser beam width of 5 mu m the channel formation proceeds
   on a time scale of 60-70 fs in uniform plasma with density 10(18)
   cm(-3). The channel closes shortly after the rear of the laser pulse has
   passed due to Coulomb attraction from the ion core. Electron cavitation
   occurs only if the laser intensity is above a certain threshold
   intensity and the laser pulse duration exceeds 100 fs. X-ray generation
   and propagation is feasible for ultrarelativistic laser pulses with
   small beam width, less than similar to 20 mu m, and duration of more

   We performed RNA interference knockdown experiments of the two genes

   produced slow growth and paralysis of the flagellum with consequent
   effects on organelle segregation. Moreover, using transmission electron
   microscopy, structural defects were seen in the axoneme, with
   microtubule doublets missing from the canonical 9+2 formation. The
   occurrence of missing doublets increased toward the distal end of the
   flagellum and sequential loss of doublets was observed along individual

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{19}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Birds use increasing photoperiod during spring as the major cue to
   time gonadal maturation and breeding so that nestlings are growing
   during peak food (normally invertebrate) abundance. Climate warming will
   advance invertebrate abundance, so birds relying entirely on photoperiod
   will breed too late. Can temperature modulate responses to photoperiod?
   2. Common Starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, were kept in two indoor aviaries,
   in which photoperiod tracked natural changes, but temperature was held
   at either 20 degrees C or 5 degrees C (year 1), or at 18 degrees C or 8
   degrees C (year 2).
   3. Despite the large differences in temperature (15 degrees C and 10
   degrees C), this had no effect on the rate or timing of testicular
   maturation.
   4. However, unexpectedly, testicular regression occurred significantly
   earlier at the higher temperatures. Post-nuptial moult also started
   significantly earlier in both males and females.
   5. Therefore, the degree to which birds can advance the timing of
   egg-laying in response to increasing spring temperature may be
   constrained. At the same time, increasing spring temperature will
   advance the end of the breeding season (fewer breeding attempts). The
   reported advances in median egg-laying dates may, in part, be a
   consequence of this rather than an indication of successful adaptation.
   Adaptation to climate change may require evolutionary changes in the
   physiological responses to photoperiod.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analysis using computational and scaling methods
   of pulsatile capillary Poiseuille flow of a model anisotropic

   that pulsatile pressure drops applied to anisotropic materials can
   result in flow-rate enhancement or reduction, defined as the relative
   flow-rate change with respect to the steady-state flow rate, for a given
   average pressure drop, amplitude, and frequency. It is found that
   flow-rate modification in pulsatile flow is a direct result of
   orientation-dependent viscosity. The role of average pressure drop,
   oscillation amplitude, and frequency on flow enhancement is
   characterized and explained. The new mechanism of flow-enhancement in
   liquid crystals subjected to pulsatile pressure is expected to be useful
   to the fundamental understanding of pulsatile flows of anisotropic

Abstract = {{Background. To evaluate alexithymia and body image in women with
   Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder and test whether alexithymic traits
   influence severity of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder or body distress.
   Methods. Sixty-four consecutive women with a DSM-IV diagnosis of
   Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder and age range of 18-45 were recruited.
   Alexithymia was measured with the Italian version 20-items Toronto
   Alexithymia Scale. Severity of premenstrual mood symptoms was measured
   through the use of Visual Analogue Scales. Body concerns were assessed
   with the Body Uneasiness Test, Body Shape Questionnaire and Body
   Attitude Test. Additional measures were Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and
   Sheehan Disability Scale.
   Results. Prevalence of alexithymia in our sample was 31.3\% (n = 20).
   Alexithymics showed higher scores on all rating scales (p range 0.001-<
   0.001). Difficulty in Identifying Feelings and Difficulty in Describing
   Feelings subscales of Toronto Alexithymia Scale were predictors of
   severity of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder in the multiple linear
   regression analysis.
   Conclusions. Alexithymia was associated with more severe Premenstrual
   Dysphoric Disorder. Alexithymic women with Premenstrual Dysphoric
   Disorder exhibited significantly poorer appearance evaluation and body
   satisfaction than nonalexithymic women.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a generalization of the classical job shop scheduling

   We use a tabu search algorithm to search for the order in which the
   operations are processed on each machine. Given a sequence of operations
   on each machine, we determine optimal starting times by solving a
   maximum cost flow problem. This solution is used to determine the
   neighborhood for our tabu search algorithm. All sequences in our
   neighborhood are obtained by swapping certain pairs of adjacent
   operations. We show that only swaps that possess a certain property can
   improve the current solution; if no such swap is available in the
   neighborhood, then the current solution is globally optimal. In the
   computational results we compare our method with other procedures
   proposed in literature. Our tabu search algorithm seems to be effective
   both with respect to time and solution quality.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Studies of host-parasite dynamics usually consider one, or at most two,
   host species, neglecting the possible effects of other species on the
   focal hosts and vice versa. To explore the interaction of community
   structure with host-parasite dynamics, we model the invasion of stable
   communities of varying size by a parasite. The communities are generated
   with random interaction coefficients and connectance 0.5. Each community
   is invaded by parasites with different values of virulence
   (disease-induced host mortality rate), specificity and transmission
   rate. The result of each invasion is determined by numerically
   simulating the dynamics of the community. We classify the outcomes by
   whether the parasite successfully establishes in the focal host
   population(s), and, if so, by the proportion of host and non-host
   species that go extinct as a result of the parasite's introduction. We
   discuss how the structure of the community and the interaction between
   hosts and other species affect several important processes of disease
   ecology: the density threshold for parasite invasion, extinction
   cascades caused by the parasite, and the frequency of extinctions of
   hosts and non-hosts. In our simulated communities, non-host species went
   extinct more frequently than hosts, suggesting the importance of the
   community context of disease. In some cases, the parasite's invasion
   induced regular population cycles in the previously stable community.}},

Abstract = {{Primary objective: To determine a predictive model for cognitive
   functional outcome of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) at
   discharge from acute care.
   Methods and procedure: Three hundred and thirty-five patients were

   Experimental interventions: Functional Independence Measure (FIM).
   Main outcomes and results: Results of this analysis indicated better
   cognitive FIM at discharge from acute care settings for patients with
   TBI when PTA was less than 24 hours, when level of education was higher,
   when no parietal lesion was identified, when no neurosurgical

Abstract = {{Background Delirium is a common psychiatric disorder in general hospital
   elderly patients. Several delirium screening tests exist. Few nurse
   based delirium severity measures are available. The aim of this study
   was to evaluate the Delirium-O-Meter, a new nurses' behavioural rating
   scale that is an efficient and sensitive measure of delirium severity.
   Methods Analysis of cross sectional and repeated assessments data.
   Participants were 92 elderly general hospital patients; 56 with
   delirium, 24 with dementia or other cognitive disturbances (no delirium)
   and 12 with other psychiatric disorders or no mental disorder. Measures
   were the Delirium-O-Meter (DOM), Delirium Rating Scale-Revised version
   (DRS-R-98), Delirium Observation Scale (DOS), Behavioural observation
   scale for geriatric inpatients (GIP) and Mini Mental State Examination
   (MMSE).
   Results The majority of DOM items show a (near-) normal score
   distribution. Reliability of the DOM was high; Cronbach's alpha values
   ranged from 0.87-0.92; Intra Class Correlation (ICC) range was 0.84-0.91
   for total scores and 0.40-0.97 for item scores. Factor analysis produced
   a `Cognitive/Motivational' factor explaining almost half of variance and
   a smaller `Psychotic/Behavioural' factor. The two-factor model results
   support the conceptual distinction between hyperactive and hypoactive
   delirium. DOM observations differentiated delirium from non delirium
   patients. DOM total scores were highly related to the DRS-R-98, DOS,
   MMSE and GIP apathy and cognitive sub scales, but less so to the GIP
   affective disturbances subscale, indicating convergent and divergent
   validity. Temporal difference scores calculated for DRS-R-98 and DOM
   assessments on subsequent days were also highly related (rho=0.80-0.95).
   Conclusions The newly constructed DOM is a brief and valid nurses'
   behavioural rating scale that can be useful for measuring different
   aspects of delirium and for efficiently monitoring delirium severity in
   elderly patients. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A dedicated trawling experiment was performed at three sites on the Gulf
   of Lion continental shelf, with the aim of assessing the resuspension of
   particulate and dissolved matter triggered by different types of trawls
   on muddy sediments. The different configurations were: (i) bottom trawl,
   with bobbin for ground rope (Rockhopper): (ii) bottom trawl, without
   bobbin (Medits); and (iii) pelagic trawl, towed at 1 and 10m above the
   seabed.
   The plumes of resuspended sediment were measured using the acoustic
   backscattered intensity, from a towed ADCP. Concomitant profiles of
   particle size-distribution, light transmission and water samples were
   collected, outside and inside the plumes. The analysis of the data
   enabled derivation of the major physical and chemical characteristics of
   the plumes generated by the trawls; likewise, and to quantify the
   resuspension fluxes of sediment, particulate (PN, POC) and dissolved
   (nutrients) elements. The residence time and dispersal of the plumes
   were monitored and modelled, considering the settling velocity of the
   particulate matter and the near-bottom turbulence.
   The results indicate that the bottom trawls produce significant
   resuspension, whilst the near-bottom and mid-water pelagic trawls have
   no impact upon the sediment. The sediment clouds at several hundreds
   metres astern of the bottom trawls are 3-6m high and 70-200m, wide; they
   were generated both by the otter doors and the net. The average
   suspended sediment concentrations measured in the plumes reach 50 mg
   l(-1). Resuspension fluxes of sediment along the path of the trawls
   range from 190 g m(-2) s(-1), for the coarsest sediment (clayey silt) to
   800 g m(-2) s(-1) for the finest sediment (silty clay). Whilst the
   resuspended loads of dissolved elements (nutrients) within the plume
   segment suggest a release of porewater, present at least in the first
   few centimetres of sediment, the particulate matter load only resulted
   from the resuspension of less than 1 mm thickness of the sediment bed.
   This discrepancy shows that a very small fraction of the sediment
   ploughed by the trawl is effectively injected into the water column.
   The monitoring of the settling of the plumes indicates a rapid decay of
   the sediment load, during the first hour after its generation. Some of
   the sediment (about 10-15\% of the initial load) remains in suspension;
   this is due, probably, to the near-bottom turbulence that prevents the
   redeposition of the fine particles and aggregates. Lateral spreading of
   the plume is strongly dependent upon the variability of horizontal
   currents. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Protein flexibility and ligand rigidity: A thermodynamic and kinetic
   study of ITAM-based ligand binding to Syk tandem SH2}},
Journal = {{CHEMBIOCHEM}},

Abstract = {{The Syk tandem Src homology 2 domain (Syk tSH2) constitutes a flexible
   protein module involved in the regulation of Syk kinase activity. The
   Syk tSH2 domain is assumed to function by adapting the distance between
   its two SH2 domains upon bivalent binding to diphosphotyrosine ligands.
   A thermodynamic and kinetic analysis of ligand binding was performed by
   using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Furthermore, the effect of
   binding on the Syk tSH2 structural dynamics was probed by
   hydrogen/deuterium exchange and electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS).
   Two ligands were studied: 7, a flexible peptide derived from the tSH2
   recognition ITAM sequence at the gamma chain of the Fc epsilon
   RI-receptor, and 2, a ligand in which the amino acids between the two
   SH2 binding motifs in ligand 1 have been replaced by a rigid linker of
   comparable length. Both ligands display comparable affinity for Syk tSH2
   at 25 degrees C, yet a major difference in thermodynamics is observed.
   Upon binding of the rigid ligand, 2, the expected entropy advantage is
   not realized. On the contrary, 2 binds with a considerably higher
   entropy price of similar to 9 kcal mol(-1), which is attributed to a
   further decrease in protein flexibility upon binding to this rigid
   ligand. The significant reduction in deuterium incorporotion in the Syk
   tSH2 protein upon binding of either 1 or 2, as monitored by ESI-MS,
   indicates a major reduction in protein dynamics upon binding. The
   results are consistent with a two-step binding model: after an initial
   binding step, a rapid structural change of the protein occurs, followed
   by a second binding step. Such a bivalent binding model allows high
   affinity and fast dissociation kinetics, which are very important in
   transient signal-transduction processes.}},

Abstract = {{The present work evaluates the action of three different doses of
   Monascus dyes (24, 48 and 60 mg/Kg) on the metabolism of albumin, urea,
   creatinine and uric acid in male and female rabbits. New Zealand rabbits
   from the Department of Cuniculture of Universidade Federal de Vicosa
   (Brazil), were used: They were ca. 55 days old at the time of the
   experiment and they were divided by sex, into four groups of five
   animals each, receiving the Monascus dye in 24, 48 and 60 mg/Kg doses.
   Control group only received a ration. Daily, the animals received the
   Monascus dye in the different doses, during 28 days. Blood was collected
   twice, being the first collection at time zero and the second one at the
   end of the experiment. Blood was obtained from retro-orbital venous
   plexus and further centrifuged at 3,500 x gr. during 15 minutes.
   Albumin, creatinine, urea and uric acid were quantified by using
   multiparametric biochemical analysis from bioMerieux (Alize). The
   results showed that different doses of Monascus dye did not change the
   levels of albumin. Creatinine did not show too much variation and did
   not promote toxicity effects on rabbits, male or females. The same
   phenomenon was observed for urea and uric acid. Our results showed that,
   in the doses used, Monascus dye was innocuous for these animal's kidney
   and liver.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Hypocalcaemia is a common finding in horses with
   enterocolitis and severe gastrointestinal disorders. The aims of this
   study were to investigate in colic horses (1))the parameters related to
   hypocalcaemia, (2)) the influence of hypocalcaemia on outcome and
   (3))the possible beneficial effect of Ca2+ substitution.
   Design: Randomized controlled trial.
   Setting: Intensive care unit.
   Patients: One hundred forty-four horses that were admitted with an acute
   abdomen during a 1.5 year period were enrolled and daily evaluated for
   clinical criteria and whole blood ionized Ca2+ levels. Colic horses with
   hypocalcaemia were randomly assigned to receive Ca2+.
   Interventions: Analysis of heparinised whole blood samples. Horses that
   were assigned to be treated received 400 mEq Ca2+ diluted in 10L of
   Ringer's lactate solution every 24 h until low reference range limits
   were obtained or until death.
   Measurements and main results: 88\% of all colic patients showed blood
   ionized Ca2+ levels below the reference range at the time of admission.
   Multivariable analysis revealed that the presence of reflux, signs of
   endotoxaemia, increased Packed Cell Volume (PCV), alkalinization of pH
   and the interaction PCV/pH all predispose colic horses to low ionized
   Ca2+ levels at the time of admission. The Odds for developing ileus
   during hospitalization are +/- 11.94 times larger for horses in the
   ``very low{''} calcaemia interval, in comparison with normocalcaemic
   horses. The Odds for fatal outcome are respectively +/- 9.82 and 8.33
   times larger for horses in the ``very low{''} and ``low{''} calcaemia
   interval. Ca2+ substitution increased the probability of survival,
   provided that Ca2+ levels could be normalized. The lack of an upward
   calcaemia response, despite repetitive Ca2+ substitutions, can be
   guarded as a poor ominous sign.
   Conclusions: Hypocalcaemia in colic horses is of prognostic relevance
   both with regard to survival as to the probability of development of
   ileus during hospitalization. This study shows the importance of routine
   measurement of ionized calcium levels in colic horses. Moreover,
   correction of hypocalcaemia seems to improve clinical outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Cerebellar syndrome following classical heat stroke is rare. We report a
   case of a 39-year-old man who presented with a cerebellar syndrome
   including downbeat nystagmus. MRI taken after 3 days of admission was
   normal. The downbeat nystagmus lasted for 6 days and than gradually
   disappeared. The ataxia and dysmetria improved gradually over 2 months.
   A brain CT scan performed 3 months later revealed no cerebellar atrophy.
   This case is unique as there were no predisposing factors (e.g.
   hypomagnesemia) and follow-up revealed complete reversibility of the
   ophthalmological abnormality. It reveals that the vestibulocerebellum is
   particularly vulnerable to thermal injury. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Background: The study was conducted to evaluate the vascular effects of
   chlorthalidone, a distal tubule-acting natriuretic agent, in
   hypertensive patients with nondiabetic metabolic syndrome, an
   insulin-resistant condition characterized by endothelial dysfunction and
   high risk for diabetes mellitus development.
   Methods: Thirteen untreated hypertensive patients with Adult Treatment
   Panel-III-defined nondiabetic metabolic syndrome were assigned to
   3-month treatment with chlorthalidone. The end-points were baseline and
   post-treatment evaluation of (1) forearm blood flow (strain,gauge
   plethysmography) responses to graded intra-arterial acetylcholine
   infusion to test C endothelial-mediated vasomotor function, with sodium
   nitroprusside as a control for endothelium-independent vasodilatation;
   (2) minimum forearm vascular resistance, the ratio of mean blood
   pressure and maximal blood flow in response to 13-minute arterial
   occlusion, as a hemodynamic correlate of arteriolar structure; and (3)
   transcapillary albumin escape rate (the 1-hour decay rate of
   I-125-albumin, 6-8 mu C ev) as a measure of systemic capillary
   permeability. Additional measurements included baseline and
   posttreatment lipids, fasting, and postload glucose and insulin as well
   as the homeostasis model assessment, an index of insulin sensitivity.
   Results: Chlorthalidone reduced blood pressure, augmented
   acetylcholine-mediated vasodilatation, decreased minimum forearm
   resistance, and slowed the transcapillary albumin escape rate. Metabolic
   parameters did not change significantly except for an increase in
   low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.
   Conclusions: Chlorthalidone improved endothelial function, reversed
   abnormal arteriolar structure, and slowed albumin permeation in
   hypertensive patients with nondiabetic metabolic syndrome.}},

   agents' include various knowledge domains as legislation, codes,
   previous cases, expert domains. The `communication agents' that identify
   and match agents are based on the goals and agent's interest. The
   communication agents working over the Web use sketches as a
   collaboration medium in the conceptual phase of the design process. The
   results of the empirical study showed that the design domain and

Abstract = {{Accurate predictions of acid precipitation effects on water resources
   are important in order to allow a better understanding of various
   pollution control strategy outcomes. Dynamic geochemical models have
   been developed to address this need, but have to be tested under a
   variety of environmental conditions to provide confidence in their
   predictions. The most commonly used aquatic acidification model in North
   America and Europe is the model of acidification of groundwater in
   catchments (MAGIC). Though extensively used, MAGIC has never been tested
   in catchments with extremely low ionic strength water and high in
   natural organic acids (NOAs) from wetlands, two conditions which are
   common in large parts of Canada. We calibrated the model for two
   catchments located in Nova Scotia, Canada, which had some of the most
   dilute freshwaters reported in the literature and very high NOA. We also
   evaluated the variability inherent in calibration data sets by using
   five separate data sets collected over a 15-year period at the same
   sites. We show good model simulations for the main cations and anions in
   catchment waters. However, modeling pH is more difficult in the highly
   organic waters and requires modification to the acid dissociation
   constants. Calculated acid neutralization capacity can also be more
   difficult to model due to the low ion content making small errors more
   important. In theory, multiple calibrations of a model at a same site
   should produce identical hindcasts and predictions. In reality, the
   multiple calibrations produced a series of similar, but not identical
   outcomes which give a probable range of past values and future outcomes.
   We feel that this practical approach to validation is a useful addition
   to the arsenal of model testing tools.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose. Symphysis pubis pain is a significant problem
   for some pregnant women. The purpose of this study was to investigate
   the effects of exercise, advice, and pelvic support belts on the
   management of symphysis pubis dysfunction during pregnancy.
   Subjects. Ninety pregnant women with symphysis pubis dysfunction were
   randomly assigned to 3 treatment groups.
   Methods. A randomized masked prospective experimental clinical trial was
   conducted. Specific muscle strengthening exercises and advice concerning
   appropriate methods for performing activities of daily living were given
   to the 3 groups, and 2 of the groups were given either a rigid pelvic
   support belt or a nonrigid pelvic support belt. The dependent variables,
   which were measured before and after the intervention, were a
   Roland-Morris Questionnaire score, a Patient-Specific Functional Scale
   score, and a pain score (101-point numerical rating score).
   Results. After the intervention, there was a significant reduction in
   the Roland-Morris Questionnaire score, the Patient-Specific Functional
   Scale score, and the average and worst pain scores in all groups. With
   the exception of average pain, there were no significant differences
   between groups for the other measures.
   Discussion and Conclusion. The findings indicate that the use of either
   a rigid or a nonrigid pelvic support belt did not add to the effects
   provided by exercise and advice. {[}Depledge J, McNair PJ, Keal-Smith C,

   public education campaign was mounted to educate Singaporeans on SARS
   and adoption of appropriate behaviours to prevent the spread of the
   disease. A survey was conducted in late April 2003 to assess
   Singaporeans' knowledge about SARS and infection control measures, and
   their concerns and anxiety in relation to the outbreak. The survey also
   sought to assess their confidence in the ability of various institutions
   to deal with SARS and their opinion on the seemingly tough measures
   enforced. The study involved 853 adults selected from a
   telephone-sampling frame. Stratified sampling was used to ensure
   adequate representation from major ethnic groups and age groups. The
   study showed that the overall knowledge about SARS and control measures
   undertaken was low (mean per cent score of 24.5 +/- 8.9\%). While 82\%
   of respondents expressed confidence in measures undertaken by Tan Tock
   Seng Hospital (the hospital designated to manage SARS), only 36\% had
   confidence in nursing homes. However, > 80\% of the public agreed that
   the preventive and control measures instituted were appropriate. Despite
   the low knowledge score, the overall mean satisfaction score of the
   government's response to SARS was 4.47 (out of possible highest score of
   5.00), with > 93\% of adult Singaporeans indicating that they were
   satisfied or very satisfied with the government's response to SARS.
   Generally, Singaporeans had a high level of public trust (satisfaction
   with government, confidence in institutions, deeming government measures
   appropriate), scoring 11.4 out of possible maximum of 14. The disparity
   between low knowledge on the one hand and high confidence and trust in
   the actions of the government on the other suggests that Singaporeans do
   not require high knowledge sufficiency to be confident in measures
   undertaken by the government to control the SARS crisis.}},

Abstract = {{Expanded options for treatments directed against pathogens that can be
   used for bioterrorism are urgently needed. Treatment regimens directed
   against such pathogens can be identified only by using data derived from
   in vitro and animal studies. It is crucial that these studies reliably
   predict the efficacy of proposed treatments in humans. The objective of
   this study was to identify a levofloxacin treatment regimen that will
   serve as an effective therapy for Bacillus anthracis infections and
   postexposure prophylaxis. An in vitro hollow-fiber infection model that
   replicates the pharmacokinetic profile of levofloxacin observed in
   humans (half-life 16,211 7.5 h) or in animals, such as the mouse or the
   rhesus monkey (t(1/2), similar to 2 h), was used to evaluate a proposed
   indication for levofloxacin (500 mg once daily) for the treatment of
   Bacillus anthracis infections. The results obtained with the in vitro
   model served as the basis for the doses and the dose schedules that were
   evaluated in the mouse inhalational anthrax model. The effects of
   levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin treatment were compared to those of no
   treatment (untreated controls). The main outcome measure in the in vitro
   hollow-fiber infection model was a persistent reduction of culture
   density (>= 4 log(10) reduction) and prevention of the emergence of
   levofloxacin-resistant organisms. In the mouse inhalational anthrax
   model the main outcome measure was survival. The results indicated that
   levofloxacin given once daily with simulated human pharmacokinetics
   effectively sterilized Bacillus anthracis cultures. By using a simulated
   animal pharmacokinetic profile, a once-daily dosing regimen that
   provided a human-equivalent exposure failed to sterilize the cultures.
   Dosing regimens that ``partially humanized{''} levofloxacin exposures
   within the constraints of animal pharmacokinetics reproduced the
   antimicrobial efficacy seen with human pharmacokinetics. In a mouse
   inhalational anthrax model, once-daily dosing was significantly inferior
   (survival end point) to regimens of dosing every 12 h or every 6 h with
   identical total daily levofloxacin doses. These results demonstrate the
   predictive value of the in vitro hollow-fiber infection model with
   respect to the success or the failure of treatment regimens in animals.
   Furthermore, the model permits the evaluation of treatment regimens that
   ``humanize{''} antibiotic exposures in animal models, enhancing the
   confidence with which animal models may be used to reliably predict the
   efficacies of proposed antibiotic treatments in humans in situations
   (e.g., the release of pathogens as agents of bioterrorism or emerging
   infectious diseases) where human trials cannot be performed. A treatment
   regimen effective in rhesus monkeys was identified.}},

Abstract = {{Alpha melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) is an agonist at the
   melanocortin 3 (MC3-R) and melanocortin 4 (MC4-R) receptors. alpha-MSH
   stimulates corticosterone release from rat and human adrenal cells.
   Patients with Cushing's syndrome have elevated levels of serum
   alpha-MSH. Agouti related protein (AgRP) is an endogenous antagonist at
   the MC3-R and MC4-R and is expressed in the rat adrenal cortex. AgRP
   antagonises alpha-MSH-induced corticosterone release from rat and bovine
   adrenal cells. This suggests that AgRP may have an inhibitory paracrine
   role in the adrenal gland. We measured adrenal AgRP mRNA expression and
   circulating AgRP in 2 patients with Cushing's syndrome and controls.
   Adrenal AgRP mRNA expression and plasma AgRP were higher in the patients
   with Cushing's syndrome compared to controls. Plasma AgRP in the
   patients with Cushing's syndrome following bilateral adrenalectomy and
   hydrocortisone replacement were similar to the levels seen in controls.
   Our results suggest that AgRP may have a novel inhibitory paracrine role
   in the human adrenal gland.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1175-1189}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims Morphological descriptions of the extrafloral
   nectaries (EFNs) of certain plant species are common in the literature,
   but they rarely relate morphology with histology, gland distribution and
   secretory attributes. In this study a morphological/secretory
   characterization of EFNs occurring on several plant species in a
   tropical coastal community is made and the implications of gland
   attributes discussed from a functional perspective.
   Methods The morphology and nectar secretion of the EFNs of 20 plant
   species are characterized through scanning electron microscopy,
   histochemical detection of reducing sugars (Fehling's reagent) and
   nectar volume/concentration estimates.
   Key Results Sixty-five per cent of plant species in coastal communities
   had EFNs on vegetative structures and 35\% of species had glands on
   reproductive and vegetative organs. The Fabaceae is the plant family
   with the most species with EFNs and most diversity of gland
   morphologies. Four types of vascularized nectaries and four of glandular
   trichomes are described; sugar-secreting trichomes are characterized
   using Fehling's technique, and the first descriptions of unicellular and
   peltate trichomes functioning as EFNs are provided. Glands of ten plant
   species and six genera are described for the first time. Four plant
   species possess more than one morphological type of EFN. Eleven species
   have EFNs in more than one location or organ. More complex glands
   secrete more nectar, but are functionally homologous to the aggregations
   of numerous secretory trichomes on specific and valuable plant organs.
   Conclusion Important diversity of EFN morphology was foundin the coastal
   plant community studied. Both vascularized and non-vascularized EFNs are
   observed in plants and, for the latter, previously non-existent
   morpho-secretory characterizations are provided with a methodological
   approach to study them. It is recommended that studies relating EFN
   attributes (i.e. morphology, distribution) with their differential
   visitation by insects (i.e. ants) and the cost of maintenance to the
   plants are carried out to understand the evolution of these glands.}},

   a LED with GT (1125 mg tea catechins +225 mg caffeine/d) or placebo
   (PLAC) from day 4 to day 87. Caffeine intake was standardised to 300
   mg/d. Energy expenditure was measured on days 4 and 32. Reductions in
   weight (4 center dot 19 (sd 2 center dot 0) kg PLAC, 4 center dot 21 (sd
   2 center dot 7) kg GT), BMI, waist:hip ratio, fat mass and fat-free mass
   were not statistically different between treatments. REE as a function
   of fat-free mass and fat mass was significantly reduced over 32 d in the

   restraint increased over time (P < 0 center dot 001) in both groups,

   showed increased prospective food consumption compared with PLAC (P < 0
   center dot 05). Taken together, the ingestion of GT along with a LED had
   no additional benefit for any measures of body weight or body
   composition. Although the decrease in REE as a function of fat-free mass
   and fat mass was not significant with GT treatment, whereas it was with
   PLAC treatment, no significant effect of treatment over time was seen,
   suggesting that a robust limitation of REE reduction during a LED was
   not achieved by GT.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to assess empirically what impact
   introduction of the bonus-malus system (BMS) has had on road safety in
   Tunisia. The results of the Tunisian experiment are of particular
   importance since, during the last decade, many European countries
   decided to eliminate their mandatory bonus-malus scheme. These results
   indicate that the BMS reduced the probability of reported accidents for
   good risks but had no effect on bad risks. Moreover, the reform's
   overall effect on reported accident rates is not statistically
   significant, but the exit variable is positive in explaining the number
   of reported accidents. To avoid any potential selectivity bias, we also
   made a joint estimate of the reported accident and selection equations.
   The reform has a positive effect on the exit variable but still does not
   affect the accidents reported. This indicates that policyholders who
   switch companies are those attempting to skirt the imposed incentive
   effects of the new rating policy. Some of the control variables are
   statistically significant in explaining the number of reported
   accidents: the vehicle's horsepower, the policyholder's place of
   residence, and the coverages for which policyholders are underwritten.}},

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY}},

Abstract = {{In the adult mammalian central nervous system, reinnervation and
   recovery from trauma are limited. During development, however,
   post-lesion plasticity may generate alternate paths providing models to
   investigate reinnervation and repair. Sometimes, these paths are
   maladaptive, although the relationship between dysfunction and
   anatomical abnormality remains unknown. After unilateral transection of
   the neonatal rat olivocerebellar path (pedunculotomy), axons from the
   remaining inferior olive reinnervate Purkinje cells in the denervated
   hemicerebellum with appropriate topography and synaptic function.
   However, whether this new pathway confers beneficial behavioural effects
   remains unknown. We studied the behavioural sequelae in rats with and
   without transcommissural reinnervation using righting and
   vestibular-drop reflexes, simple locomotion (bridge), complex locomotion
   (wire) and motor coordination (rotarod) tests. In animals
   pedunculotomised on day 3 (Px3), which develop olivocerebellar
   reinnervation, dynamic postural adjustments and complex motor skills
   develop normally, whereas simple gait is broad-based and slightly
   delayed. In contrast, Px I I animals, which do not develop
   reinnervation, have delayed maturation of postural reflexes, gait and
   complex locomotor skills. In addition, when compared to control animals,
   their performance in locomotory tasks was slower and the complex task
   impaired. On the rotarod, control and Px3 animals learned to coordinate
   their gait and walked for longer at 10 and 20 rpm than Px 11 animals.
   These results show that transcommissural olivocerebellar reinnervation
   is associated with almost normal motor development and the ability to
   synchronise gait at slow and moderate speeds, i.e. this reinnervation
   confers significant behavioural function and is therefore truly
   compensatory. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Whole genome sequencing of the model white rot basidiomycete
   Phanerochaete chrysosporium has revealed the largest P450 contingent
   known to date in fungi, along with related phase I and phase II
   metabolic genes and signaling cascade genes. As a part of their
   functional characterization, genome-wide expression profiling under
   physiologically distinct conditions, nutrient-limited (ligninolytic) and
   nutrient-rich (non-ligninolytic), was investigated using a
   custom-designed 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray developed based on 190
   target genes and 23 control genes. All 150 P450 genes were found to be
   expressible under the test conditions, with 27 genes showing
   differential expression based on a > twofold arbitrary cut-off limit. Of
   these, 23 P450 genes were upregulated (twofold to ninefold) in defined
   high-nitrogen cultures whereas four genes were upregulated (twofold to
   twentyfold) in defined low-nitrogen cultures. Furthermore, tandem P450
   member genes in ten of the 16 P450 genomic clusters showed
   nonassortative regulation of expression reflecting their functional
   diversity. Full-length cDNAs for two of the high-nitrogen upregulated
   genes pc-hn1 (CYP5035A1) and pc-hn2 (CYP5036A1) and partial cDNA for a
   low-nitrogen upregulated gene pc-ln1 (CYP5037A1) were cloned and
   characterized. The study provided first molecular evidence for the
   presence of active components of the cAMP- and MAP kinase-signaling
   pathways in a white rot fungus; four of these components (cpka and
   ste-12 of cAMP pathway and two MAP kinases, mps1 and sps1) were
   significantly upregulated (fourfold to eightfold) under nutrient-limited
   conditions, implying their likely role in the regulation of gene
   expression involved in secondary metabolism and biodegradation processes
   under these conditions.}},

Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Aims: Whole-breast radiotherapy (WBRT) after conservative surgery for
   early breast cancer is a routine standard of care. Despite this, a
   number of uncertainties in management still exist. Over recent years, a
   number of new technologies have allowed the development of
   partial-breast irradiation, with the intention of improving the
   risk-benefit relationship of routine breast radiotherapy. We report the
   results of a trial comparing partial- with WBRT, with prolonged
   follow-up.
   Materials and methods: Between 1986 and 1990, 174 women were randomised
   to receive conventional whole-breast radiotherapy (WBRT) (40 Gy in 15
   fractions), with a tumour-bed boost or partial-breast irradiation by a
   variety of techniques. Recruitment was problematic, and the trial closed
   prematurely well before meeting its recruitment target.
   Results: A trend was observed towards higher local recurrence and a
   higher locoregional recurrence rate after irradiation of the tumour bed
   alone. Distant recurrence and survival were the same.
   Conclusions: Conclusions are limited in view of the failure to complete
   accrual of the target of 400 participants, and in the context of the
   techniques of partial-breast radiotherapy used during this study, which
   would not compare with those in current use. Tumour-bed irradiation
   alone cannot currently be recommended as routine treatment outside the
   context of clinical trial.}},

Abstract = {{The thyroid gland is an endocrine organ composed of stable cells. It is
   well known that regenerative capacity of the thyroid tissue is minimal.
   Various degrees of morphologic alterations do occur in chronic
   lymphocytic thyroiditis (CLT), including Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
   Eighty-five CLT cases were analyzed for these morphologic alterations.
   Small, irregular, atrophic or hyperplastic thyroid follicles were seen
   adjacent to the lymphocytic infiltration. There was nuclear enlargement,
   loss of nuclear polarity in thyrocytes and intrafollicular thyrocyte
   proliferation in these follicles. We thought that the morphologic
   alterations in involved follicles could be due to regenerative
   hyperplasia with increased proliferative activity and basement membrane
   abnormalities. To examine this hypothesis we investigated Ki-67 and
   laminin immunoreactivity in the involved follicles adjacent to
   lymphocytic infiltration areas. The uninvolved follicles were used as
   controls. Immunopositivity of Ki-67 in involved follicles was
   significantly higher than that in uninvolved follicles (2.97\% +/- 2.16
   versus 0.83\% +/- 1.63, P < 0.001). Laminin immunostaining indicated the
   destruction or irregular distribution of basement membrane in involved
   follicles. We conclude that the increased cell proliferation activity
   and basement membrane abnormalities in the follicles with morphologic
   changes adjacent to CLT occur in conjunction with regenerative
   hyperplasia.}},

Abstract = {{Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is frequently isolated from
   humans and animals. Phage typing is historically the first-line
   reference typing technique in Europe. It is rapid and convenient for
   laboratories with appropriate training and experience, and costs of
   consumables are low. Phage typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
   (PFGE) were performed on 503 isolates of serovar Typhimurium.
   Twenty-nine phage types and 53 PFGE patterns were observed. Most
   isolates of phage types DT104, DT104b, and U310 are not distinguishable
   from other members of their phage type by PFGE. By contrast, PFGE of
   isolates of phage types DT193 and U302 shows great heterogeneity.
   Analysis of experience with PFGE and phage typing can facilitate the
   selective application of PFGE to maximize the yield of epidemiologically
   relevant additional information while controlling costs.}},

Abstract = {{We present in this paper first results on broadband photometry (JHK
   filters) and low-dispersion infrared spectroscopy performed at ESO Very
   Large Telescope (VLT) for the trans-neptunian object (55565) 2002
   AW(197) and Centaurs (55576) 2002 GB(10) and (83982) 2002 GO(9). These
   observations were obtained in the framework of ESO's Large Program on
   `Physical Studies of TNOs and Centaurs'. All the spectra are
   characterized by a strong red visible-near infrared slope. There is no
   clear detection of water ice, except for the Centaur (83982) 2002 GO(9).
   Analysis of these visible-near infrared reflectance spectra with
   radiative transfer models are compatible with a surface composed of
   intimate mixtures of organics compounds (Triton tholins, amorphous
   carbon) and contaminated water ice, although other possibilities exist.

Abstract = {{Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitors have been demonstrated to
   have cardiovascular protective actions. This hydrolase enzyme converts
   fatty acid epoxides to their corresponding diols, and this conversion
   can alter the biologic activity of these metabolites. We hypothesized
   that 12-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)dodecanoic acid (AUDA), a sEH
   inhibitor, would protect stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats
   from cerebral ischemia. AUDA was administered to 6-week-old male rats
   for 6 weeks, during which blood pressure was measured by telemetry.
   Cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion, the
   size of the cerebral infarct was assessed after 6 hours of ischemia, and
   the results were expressed as a percentage of the hemisphere infarcted
   (\%HI). Vascular structure and function were assessed using a
   pressurized arteriograph. Plasma levels of AUDA at the end of the
   treatment period averaged 5.0 +/- 0.4 ng/mL, and the urinary excretion
   rate was 99 +/- 21 ng/d. AUDA-treated rats had significantly smaller
   cerebral infarcts than control rats (36 +/- 4\% vs 53 +/- 4\% HI,
   treated versus control, P < 0.05, n = 6). This difference occurred
   independently of changes in blood pressure. AUDA treatment increased the
   passive compliance of the cerebral vessels but had no effect on vascular
   structure. The results of this study provide novel evidence suggesting
   that the sEH inhibitor AUDA is a possible therapeutic agent for ischemic
   stroke.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is a cost effective technique able
   to detect and quantify stenoses, provide sub-millimeter resolution with
   full arterial coverage, and show true vessel delineation without
   artifacts.The quality of images obtained with gadoliniumenhanced MRA
   depends on the gradient system, coil, sequence design, and contrast
   agent (volume, dose and injection rate). MRA protocols are evolving from
   standard k-space sampling (linear from the periphery or the center) to
   elliptic centric view ordering and to time-resolved MRA.
   Finally, the gadolinium-based contrast agent Gd-BOPTA (gadobenate
   dimeglumine, MultiHance; Bracco Imaging, Milan, Italy) offers
   considerably greater imaging efficacy compared to conventional
   gadolinium chelates, because identical results can be obtained at lower
   doses.
   In conclusion, MRA of the peripheral vasculature is a simple and fast
   technique, which permits evaluation of a large field of view without
   risk of radiation exposure.}},

Abstract = {{The p53 tumor suppressor functions as a sequence-specific DNA-binding
   transcription factor that promotes antiproliferative responses,
   including cell cycle checkpoints, cellular senescence and apoptosis. The
   precise nature of the p53 transcriptional programs and the complex
   mechanisms that govern whether or not a cell dies in response to p53
   activation remain elusive. We have recently reported the identification
   of a new direct p53 target, Ptprv, encoding a transmembrane tyrosine
   phosphatase. Ptprv expression is dramatically and preferentially
   increased in cells undergoing p53-dependent cell cycle exit, but not in
   cells undergoing p53-mediated apoptosis. Importantly, while p53-induced
   apoptosis is intact in mice lacking Ptprv, Ptprv-null cells are
   defective in G(1) checkpoint control. In addition, we report herein that
   Ptprv is induced at high cell density and mediates contact inhibition of
   cell growth. Together, the data suggest that Ptprv is a potent inhibitor
   of cell proliferation and a critical mediator of p53-induced cell cycle
   exit.}},

Abstract = {{LY307161 is a 31 amino acid analog of glucagonlike peptide-1(7-37)OH
   susceptible to physical instability associated with pharmaceutical
   processing. Orthogonal biophysical studies were conducted to explore the
   origins of this physical instability and to distinguish pharmaceutically
   desirable states of this aggregating peptide from undesirable ones.
   Equilibrium sedimentation analysis established that LY307161 exists as a
   monomer at pH 3, and reversibly self-associates in the pH range
   7.5-10.5. Causative factors for physical instability related to
   lyophilization conditions were investigated. Solution pH, acetonitrile
   content, and concentration of the peptide prior to lyophilization each
   impacted physicochemical properties of the resultant powders. A
   comparative study of two powder samples exhibiting physicochemically
   disparate properties established that LY307161 forms soluble noncovalent
   aggregates. FT-IR analyses in the solid and solution states identified a
   prominent band at 1657-1659 cm(-1) attributed to alpha-helix structure.
   Noncovalent soluble aggregate exhibited characteristic bands at 1615 and
   1698 cm(-1) indicative of intermolecular beta-sheet structure. An
   agitation-induced, precipitated solid form of LY307161 exhibited a
   different FT-IR signature indicative of a conformationally distinct
   species. Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy, together with
   dynamic light scattering measurements and dye-aggregate complexation,
   provided additional insights into the distinctions between aggregated
   and native LY307161. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American

Title = {{Redistribution of mu-opioid receptors in C1 adrenergic neurons following

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{196}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{365-372}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) are involved in both
   tonic and reflex control of sympathetic outflow. Many of these neurons
   express the adrenaline-synthesizing enzyme phenylethanolamine
   N-methyltransferase (PNMT), and are designated C1 neurons. C1 neurons
   that contain mu-opioid receptors (MORs) are hyperpolarized by MOR
   activation and are activated during morphine withdrawal. The present
   study examined the subcellular distribution of the cloned MOR, MOR1, in
   rat C1 neurons following chronic morphine treatment, using RVLM sections
   that were dually labeled for PNMT-immunoperoxidase and MOR1-immunogold.
   Electron microscopic analysis of the subcellular distribution of MOR1
   revealed a lower abundance of plasma membrane-associated MOR1 in Cl
   dendrites of rats treated with morphine, compared to placebo-treated
   controls, only in distal dendrites. There were no differences in the
   size of dual-labeled dendrites between treatment groups or in the
   overall density of MOR1 within PNMT immunoreactive dendrites between
   treatment groups. These results suggest that chronic morphine treatment
   leads to a decreased presence of MOR1 at the cell surface, without a
   significant reduction in cytoplasmic receptor density. These
   observations suggest that chronic morphine produces a selective
   internalization of MOR1 in C1 neurons, without apparent changes in
   receptor synthesis or trafficking. The reduction of accessible MORs on
   these neurons may be a mechanism for tolerance with regard to autonomic

Abstract = {{High-level recombinant expression of protein kinases in eukaryotic cells
   or Escherichia coli commonly gives products that are phosphorylated by
   autocatalysis or by the action of endogenous kinases. Here, we report
   that phosphorylation occurred on serine residues adjacent to
   hexahistidine affinity tags (His-tags) derived from several commercial
   expression vectors and fused to overexpressed kinases. The result was
   observed with a variety of recombinant kinases expressed in either
   insect cells or E coli. Multiple phosphorylations of His-tagged
   full-length Aurora A, a protein serine/threonine kinase, were detected
   by mass spectrometry when it was expressed in insect cells in the
   presence of okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase inhibitor. Peptide
   mapping by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry detected
   phosphorylations on all three serine residues in an N-terminal tag,
   alpha-N-acetyl-MHHHHHHSS GLPRGS. The same sequence was also
   phosphorylated, but only at a low level, when a His-tagged protein
   tyrosine kinase, Pyk2 was expressed in insect cells and activated in
   vitro. When catalytic domains of Aurora A and several other protein
   serine/threonine kinases were expressed in E coli, serines in the
   affinity tag sequence GSSHHHHHHSSGLV-PRGS were also variably
   phosphorylated. His-Aurora A with hyperphosphorylation of the serine
   residues in the tag aggregated and resisted thrombin-catalyzed removal
   of the tag. Treatment with alkaline phosphatase partly restored
   sensitivity to thrombin. The same His-tag sequence was also detected
   bearing alpha-N-D-gluconoylation in addition to multiple
   phosphorylations. The results show that histidine-tag sequences can
   receive complicated posttranslational modification, and that the
   hyperphosphorylation and resulting heterogeneity of the recombinant
   fusion proteins can interfere with downstream applications. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Retroviruses can induce hematopoietic disease via insertional
   mutagenesis of cancer genes and provide valuable molecular tags for
   cancer gene discovery. Here we show that insertional mutagenesis can
   also identify genes that promote the immortalization of hematopoietic
   cells, which normally have only limited self-renewal. Transduction of
   mouse bone marrow cells with replication-incompetent murine stem cell
   virus (MSCV) expressing only neo, followed by serial passage in liquid
   culture containing stem cell factor (SCIF) and interleukin-3 (IL-3),
   produced immortalized immature myeloid cell lines with neutrophil and
   macrophage differentiation potential in about 50\% of the infected
   cultures. More than half of the lines have MSCV insertions at Evil or
   Prdm16. These loci encode transcription factor homologs and are
   validated human myeloid leukemia genes. Integrations are located in
   intron 1 or 2, where they promote expression of truncated proteins
   lacking the PRDI-BF1-RIZ1 homologous (PR) domain, similar to what is
   observed in human leukemias with EVI1 or PRDM16 mutations. Evi1
   overexpression alone appears sufficient to immortalize immature myeloid
   cells and does not seem to require any other cooperating mutations.
   Genes identified by insertional mutagenesis by their nature could also
   be involved in immortalization of leukemic stem cells, and thus
   represent attractive drug targets for treating cancer.}},

Abstract = {{The extensive amount of multimedia information available necessitates
   content-based video indexing and retrieval methods. Since humans tend to
   use high-level semantic concepts when querying and browsing multimedia
   databases, there is an increasing need for semantic video indexing and
   analysis. For this purpose, we present a unified framework for semantic
   shot classification in sports video, which has been widely studied due
   to tremendous commercial potentials. Unlike most existing approaches,
   which focus on clustering by aggregating shots or key-frames with
   similar low-level features, the proposed scheme employs supervised
   learning to perform a top-down video shot classification. Moreover, the
   supervised learning procedure is constructed on the basis of effective
   mid-level representations instead of exhaustive low-level features. This
   framework consists of three main steps: 1) identify video shot classes
   for each sport, 2) develop a common set of motion, color, shot
   length-related mid-level representations; and 3) supervised learning of
   the given sports video shots. It is observed that for each sport we can
   predefine a small number of semantic shot classes, about 5-10, which
   covers 90\%-95\% of broadcast sports video. We employ nonparametric
   feature space analysis to map low-level features to mid-level semantic
   video shot attributes such as dominant object (a player) motion, camera
   motion patterns, and court shape, etc. Based on the fusion of those
   mid-level shot attributes, we classify video shots into the predefined
   shot classes, each of which has clear semantic meanings. With this
   framework we have achieved good classification accuracy of 85\%-95\% on
   the game videos of five typical ball type sports (i.e., tennis,
   basketball, volleyball, soccer, and table tennis) with over 5500 shots
   of about 8 h. With correctly classified sports video shots, further
   structural and temporal analysis, such as event detection, highlight
   extraction, video skimming, and table of content, will be greatly
   facilitated.}},

Abstract = {{Thalamic mast cells (TMCs), the Only immunocytes known to infiltrate the
   brain in physiological conditions, respond to pharmacological that
   increases their number. We analysed the effects of two other main agents
   including sumatriptan - a serotonergic anti-migraine agent analgesics:
   morphine chlorhydrate, a mu opioid agonist, and acetylsalicylic acid
   (ASA), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. All three drugs have
   specific modes of action, and morphine and ASA, unlike sumatriptan, are
   also known to interact with peripheral mast cells. Only ASA was
   effective in promoting TMC number decrease. TMCs, unlike other mast
   cells, do not express cyclooxygenase (COX) - the key enzyme in the
   production of prostanoids and the main site of action of ASA - thus
   dismissing a direct local cellular COX-mediated action. Direct TMC
   COX-independent mechanisms or effects mediated via distant Populations
   of COX-positive cells Such as platelets, leptomeningeal, endothelial and
   peripheral mast cells are thus probable. ASA, morphine and sumatriptan
   have distinct TMC effects, suggesting that the TMC number variations
   they induce are more likely to derive from systemic vasoactive actions
   than from pharmacological mechanisms devoted to pain relief (C) 2005

Abstract = {{In most stages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection,

   remains unknown, although it is agreed that the FDCs themselves are not

   spliced mRNA isolated from individual splenic white pulps, it was shown
   here that the majority of HIV-1 viral particles are produced locally
   within the supporting lymphoid structure and do not result from trapping
   of circulating viruses or immune complexes. These findings underline the

Abstract = {{We present a general numerical method for computing precisely the false
   vacuum decay rate, including the prefactor due to quantum fluctuations
   about the classical bounce solution, in a self-interacting scalar field
   theory modeling the process of nucleation in four-dimensional
   space-time. This technique does not rely on the thin-wall approximation.
   The method is based on the Gelfand-Yaglom approach to determinants of
   differential operators, suitably extended to higher dimensions using
   angular momentum cutoff regularization. A related approach has been
   discussed recently by Baacke and Lavrelashvili, but we implement the
   regularization and renormalization in a different manner, and compare
   directly with analytic computations made in the thin-wall approximation.
   We also derive a simple new formula for the zero mode contribution to
   the fluctuation prefactor, expressed entirely in terms of the asymptotic
   behavior of the classical bounce solution.}},

Abstract = {{Three experiments examine the effect of base rate consistency under
   direct experience. Base rate consistency was manipulated by blocking
   trials and setting base rate choice reinforcement to be either
   consistent or inconsistent across trial blocks. Experiment 1 shows that,
   contrary to the usual finding, participants use base rate information
   more than individuating information when it is consistent, but less when
   it is inconsistent. In Experiment 2, this effect was replicated, and
   transferred in verbal questions posed subsequently. Despite experience
   with consistent base rates increasing sensitivity to base rates in word
   problems, verbal responses were far from normative. In Experiment 3,
   participants' use of base rates was once again moderated by its
   consistency, but this effect was itself moderated by the diagnosticity
   of base rate information. Participants were highly accurate in
   estimating experienced base rates. These studies demonstrate that base
   rate usage is complex and a function of how base rates are presented
   (experienced versus summary statistics) and response format (choice
   proportions versus probability estimates). Knowledge of base rates was
   insufficient for proper usage in verbal word problems. Although choice
   proportions showed a sophisticated sensitivity to experienced base rate
   information, participants seemed unable to demonstrate a similar
   sophistication when given typical word problems indicating that base
   rate neglect is a function of information representation and not an
   inherent processing bias.}},

Abstract = {{The main difference between quadrupole and axisymmetric charge particle
   beam focusing systems is that quadrupole systems do not produce a
   regular image of an object like axisymmetric systems. Because of the
   special symmetry in geometry and electric or magnetic fields along the
   axis, only the Russian quadruplet (RQ) can produce an image, however,
   for each geometry and given maximum field gradient of the RQ, the number
   of experimentally attainable focal distances in one system is limited to
   one or two.
   A new quadrupole focusing system with the same symmetry as the RQ is now
   under development at the Louisiana Accelerator Center that produces an
   image and has the possibility to vary the focal distance over a wide
   range by changing the excitation of the middle lenses. As a result, the
   magnification may be changed from 10(-3) to 10(+3) so that this
   versatile design can be adapted for several applications of high-energy
   focusing ion beam (HEFIB) systems, including nuclear nanoprobe, scanning
   microscope or transmission microscope. The configuration of this lens
   system consists of six quadrupole lenses and although these lenses can
   be combined either as magnetic (RMS) or electrostatic (RES) sextuplets,
   the Louisiana Accelerator Center is presently constructing an RMS system
   due to operational requirements. The zoom capability of the RMS is
   numerically investigated and the smallest beam spot size and appropriate
   optimal parameters of the RMS are presented for different emittances and
   compared with the corresponding parameters of the RQ. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This third paper in this series regarding the mechanism and kinetics of
   urethane systems presents the results obtained in the study of the
   influence of molecular weight and chemical structure of several
   polycarbonate diols on the polycondensation reaction with
   4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI), comparing them with those
   obtained previously for condensation reaction with p-tolyl isocyanate
   (p-TI). The substitution effect induced in the second isocyanate group
   by the reaction of the first isocyanate group of a symmetric
   diisocyanate likes MDI has been studied by size exclusion chromatography
   (SEC) using a model monoalcohol. The condensation reaction kinetics is
   adequately described by an autocatalyzed third order rate equation. The
   values obtained for rate constants, using a Runge-Kutta mathematical
   model, suggest association phenomena by hydrogen bonding implying
   hydroxyl groups but also urethane groups. In bulk and in stoichiometric
   conditions, the association phenomena observed increase proportionally
   on one hand, to the decrease of molecular weight of macrodiol and on the
   other hand, to the tendency to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The
   activation energies were obtained from the evaluation of kinetic data at
   different temperatures in the range 45-65 degrees C. As association
   phenomena increase, activation energies decrease. The slightly higher
   activation energies obtained for polycondensation compared to
   condensation are explained because of the rapid increase of viscosity of
   the medium. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To evaluate site-to-site variation within fecal pats from
   cattle with regard to detection of Escherichia coli O157 and determine
   the effect on the accuracy of prevalence estimates of assay of multiple
   samples collected from the same fecal pat.
   Sample Population-120 freshly voided fecal pats collected from 2 beef
   feedlots.
   Procedures-5 samples were systematically collected from each fecal pat
   and analyzed for E coli O157 via selective preenrichment techniques,
   immunomagnetic separation, and biochemical tests. Presumptive isolates
   were definitively identified via agglutination assays and polymerase
   chain reaction techniques. Best estimators of prevalence were calculated
   from the distribution of E coli O157-positive samples per pat.
   Results-Of the 120 fecal pats, 96, 13, 4, 2, 3, and 2 fecal pats had 0,
   1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 E coli O157-positive samples, respectively. The
   greatest estimate of E coli 0 157 prevalence (20\%) was achieved when
   all 5 samples were assessed; this estimate represented a 2.4-fold
   increase in prevalence, compared with that provided via analysis of 1
   sample/pat (8.2\%). Compared with assessment of 5 sites/pat, the
   relative sensitivity of detecting an E coli O157-positive fecal pat via
   analysis of 1 site/pat was 40.1\%.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results suggest that estimates of E
   coli O157 prevalence derived from sampling of 1 location/pat are likely
   underestimates of the true prevalence of this pathogen in fecal pats
   (and by extension, cattle). Additional research is warranted to confirm
   these results in situations of high and low prevalence and across
   different feedlots.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing body of literature presenting the argument that
   processes of organizational identification (OI) are extremely important
   in helping to ensure that staff work towards the interests of the
   organization. There are, however, a number of problems with the way that
   the notion of OI has been conceptualized and operationalized in the
   extant literature. This paper examines how OI has been defined and
   measured over a number of decades. A number of problems are identified
   with how OI has been conceptualized by researchers, including, for
   example, issues about whether there is an affective element to
   identification and how the construct relates to organizational
   commitment. The paper also includes a review of previous approaches to
   measuring the concept of OI and raises some key problems with existing
   research tools. The paper concludes by arguing for a particular
   conceptualization of OI which helps to clarify the complex relationship
   between identification and organizational commitment, while at the same
   time accommodating previous definitions of the construct.}},

Abstract = {{A method of synchronization of several identical chaotic systems using a

   between the systems, and one leading oscillator affecting the rest of
   them were proposed. After synchronization, all systems make identical

   in principle, control may be made arbitrarily small. Numerical modeling
   bore out efficiency of this method for any number of oscillators.}},

Abstract = {{Backgroudn Several skin diseases and atopic disorders including
   Netherton syndrome and atopic dermatitis have been associated with
   mutations and deviations of expression of SPINK5, the gene encoding the
   human 15-domain serine proteinase inhibitor LEKTI. The biochemical
   mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not yet been fully clarified.
   Objectives To identify target proteinases of LEKTI important for
   processes of desquamation and inflammation of the skin which will enable
   the development of specific drugs.
   Methods The inhibitory activities of LEKTI domains 6 and 15 were tested
   on a number of commercially available serine proteinases and also on the
   purified kallikreins hK5 and hK7. In addition, recombinant hK5 was used.
   Results LEKTI domain 6 is a potent inhibitor of hK5 and hK7, whereas
   LEKTI domain 15 exhibits inhibitory activity on plasmin. hK5 and hK7 in
   particular are relevant to skin disorders.
   Conclusions The inhibition of hK5 and hK7 by LEKTI domain 6 indicates an
   important regulatory role of LEKTI in processes of skin desquamation and
   inflammation, which may explain the severe pathological symptoms
   associated with abnormalities of SPINK5 and/or its expression. Thus,
   LEKTI represents a potential drug for the treatment of these disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, including superoxide (O-2(-)) and
   nitric oxide (NO), are known to be mediators of oxidative stress and
   play pivotal roles in the onset of numerous life style-related diseases.
   While a number of studies have shown that naturally occurring
   anti-oxidants may be applicable for prevention and therapy for those
   diseases, most in vitro anti-oxidation tests reported have not provided
   significant insight into the absorption efficiency or metabolism of
   dietary anti-oxidants in the gastrointestinal tract. In the present
   study, we established a novel assay system by focusing on the
   bioconversion of food constituents using differentiated Caco-2 cells as
   a model of human intestinal epithelial cells. Various fresh food
   preparations {[}ginger, garlic, shimeji ( Hypsizigus marmoreus ), onion,
   carrot] were added to the apical side of differentiated Caco-2
   monolayers. After incubation, the medium was recovered and tested for
   its inhibitory effects on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate
   (TPA)-induced generation in differentiated HL-60 cells, and on combined
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and interferon (IFN)-gamma -induced NO
   generation in RAW 264.7 macrophages. The garlic preparation (25\% v/v)
   basolateral medium abolished generation without any cytotoxicity toward
   HL-60 cells, though it was cytotoxic to Caco-2 cells. In the NO
   generation tests, all of the food preparations showed notable inhibitory
   activity, while the garlic preparation (5\% v/v) basolateral medium
   inhibited NO generation with substantial cytotoxicity toward RAW 264.7
   cells. Interestingly, the carrot preparation (1\% v/v) basolateral
   medium inhibited NO generation in both a concentration- and
   time-dependent manner without any cytotoxicity toward RAW 264.7 or
   Caco-2 cells, and its activities were higher than those of the carrot
   preparation alone (1\% v/v). Our results indicate that the present assay
   system is appropriate and reliable for determination of the
   anti-oxidative efficacy of dietary phytochemicals in vivo .}},

Abstract = {{Analyses of different robustness aspects for models of the direct signal
   transduction pathway of receptor-induced apoptosis is presented.
   Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death, removing unwanted cells
   within multicellular organisms to maintain a proper balance between cell
   reproduction and death. Its signalling pathway includes an activation
   feedback loop that generates bistable behaviour, where the two steady
   states can be seen as `life' and `death'. Inherent robustness, widely
   recognised in biological systems, is of major importance in apoptosis
   signalling, as it guarantees the same cell fate for similar conditions.
   First, the influence of the stochastic nature of reactions indicating a
   role for inhibition reactions as noise filters and justifying a
   deterministic approach in the further analyses is evaluated. Second, the
   robustness of the bistable threshold with respect to parameter changes
   is evaluated by statistical methods, showing the need to balance both
   the forward and the back part of the activation loop. These analyses can
   also discriminate between the models favouring the model consistent with
   novel biological findings. The parameter robustness analyses are also
   applicable to other signal transduction networks, as several have been
   shown to display bistable behaviour. These methods therefore have a
   range of possible applications in systems biology not only to measure
   robustness, but also for model discrimination.}},

Abstract = {{Nitric oxide (NO) is the most widespread signaling molecule found in the
   retina in that it can be made by every retinal cell type. NO is able to
   influence a wide variety of synaptic mechanisms ranging from increasing
   or decreasing neuro transmitter release to the modulation of gap
   junction conductivity. Although biochemical methods can analyze overall
   levels of NO, such methods cannot indicate the specific cell types
   involved. In the last few years, fluorescent imaging methods utilizing
   diaminofluorescein have allowed the real-time visualization of
   neurochemically or light stimulated NO-induced fluorescence (NO-IF) in
   specific retinal cells. Recent experiments have shown that this NO-IF
   can be stabilized using paraformaldehyde fixation. This aldehyde
   stabilization has allowed the imaging of NO production in the dark and
   in response to light, as well as the neurochemical modulation of light
   stimulated NO production. The results of these studies indicate that NO
   is not always freely diffusible and that NO is largely retained in many
   cells which make it. The NO production in retina is highly damped in
   that in the absence of stimulation, the endogenous levels of NO
   production are extremely low. Finally, different neurochemical or light
   stimulation protocols activate NO production in specific cells and
   subcellular compartments. Therefore, although the NO signaling is
   widespread in retina, it is very selectively activated and has different
   functions in specific retinal cell types. The use of NO imaging will
   continue to play a critical role in future studies of the function of NO
   in retina and other neural systems. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Introduction: Most data on tuberculosis in human immunodeficiency virus
   (HIV)-infected children in Africa come from hospital-based and
   cross-sectional Studies.
   Objectives: To estimate the incidence of tuberculosis in HIV-infected
   children participating in all observational cohort. Methods:
   HIV-infected children in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, are followed in a
   prospective cohort. At enrollment, all children had a physical
   examination, CD4 lymphocyte Counts, chest radiograph and a tuberculin
   test. Quarterly follow-up visits are organized. All patients with
   suspected tuberculosis undergo specific investigations including gastric
   aspiration and culture. All isolates are tested for susceptibility.
   Results: From October 2000 to December 2003, 129 girls and 153 boys were
   recruited. Of children without a Current or previous diagnosis of
   tuberculosis, 6.5\% (13 of 199) had a tuberculin test result of > 5 mm,
   compared with 17.5\% of children (10 of 57) with current or previous
   tuberculosis (P < 0.02). Forty-eight children (17\%) had a history of
   treated tuberculosis, and 27 children were being treated for
   tuberculosis at enrollment or during the first month of follow-up.
   Eleven children were diagnosed with tuberculosis after the first month
   of follow-up, and the diagnosis of mycobacterial infection was confirmed
   in 7 cases. Of 5 tested isolates of mycobacterium tuberculosis, 3 were
   resistant to at least 1 antitubercular drug.
   Cumulative incidence of tuberculosis was 2060/100,000 at 12 months,
   3390/100,000 at 2 years and 5930/100,000 at 3 years. The 3-year risk was
   12,400/100,000 in immunocompromised children (CD4 < 15\%) and
   3300/100,000 in other children (P < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: The risk of tuberculosis among HIV-infected children in Cote
   d'Ivoire is strongly associated with the degree of immunodeficiency in
   HIV infection.}},

Abstract = {{The Extrinsic Affective Simon Task (DeHouwer, EAST; Experimental
   Psychol. 50 (2003) 77) was used to assess how different context
   conditions lead to differential activation of cognitive schemata in
   anxiety. Participants completed two identical EASTs, in which ambiguous
   target words (e.g., legs, net) were categorized together with pleasant
   words and unpleasant, fear-related words. Each EAST was preceded by the
   presentation of pictures, activating either a `human' concept or a
   `spider' concept. Results indicated that spider fearful participants
   showed threat associations towards the target words, but only when the
   spider concept was primed. Non-fearful participants did not show threat
   associations with either type of priming. We conclude that impact of
   threat associations depends on the activated context, and that the EAST
   is suitable for the assessment of fear associations and their current
   activation level. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Ulcerations affect the small bowel and are unrelated to drugs,

   episodes of jejunoileal ulcerations. Several resections of the small

   from cytotoxic T cells, the patient developed a T-cell lymphoma, and
   malignant cells could be detected at the bottom of the ulcers, or from
   acid-producing cells in areas of gastric metaplasia. Two mechanisms
   might thus be responsible for the occurrence of repetitive ulceration,

Abstract = {{Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disease that
   affects thousands of Americans each year. The resulting
   thrombocytopenia, which develops from destruction of platelets (PLT) by
   anti-PLT autoantibodies (APAb), is often associated with hemorrhagic
   complications. Existing therapies are not effective and are associated
   with significant morbidity. Recently, a new treatment modality using
   plasmapheresis with a Protein-A column has shown some clinical promise.
   Yet, although this method would remove the pathogenic APAb, it would
   also deplete protective antibodies, thereby weakening the body's
   self-defense system. Because about 80\% of patients with ITP develop
   APAb against the GPIIb/IIIa antigens on PLT, a novel approach of
   attaching a GPIIb/IIIa-linked bioreactor with an extracorporeal circuit
   is suggested herein to achieve highly effective/specific APAb removal
   and overcome shortcomings of plasmapheresis in treating ITP. A hollow
   fiber-based bioreactor device was fabricated, and GPIIb/IIIa antigens
   were immobilized onto the inner lumens of the hollow fibers by using the
   epichlorohydrin activation method. An optimized bioreactor containing a
   loading of 1.63 mg GPIIb/IIIa/g fibers and adsorption capacity of 1.9 mg
   7E3/g fibers was developed. Preliminary proof-of-concept investigation
   using a 7E3-induced thrombocytopenic rat model (which mimicked clinical
   ITP) was carried out. A complete (100\%) return of PLT counts to their
   initial levels was observed in rats within 6 h after the GPIIb/IIIa
   bioreactor treatment. In addition, a rapid restoration of WBC counts in
   the treated rats was also found. These preliminary findings shed light
   of promise of using the GPIIb/IIIa bioreactor approach in achieving
   highly improved ITP therapy. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Children become infected when they are exposed to infectious adults with

   progress to disease (TB). Children at greatest risk of developing
   disease are those younger than 5 years of age, HIV-infected and severely
   malnourished. TB is diagnosed in a child when the child has been exposed
   to an infectious case, has symptoms and a radiological picture
   suggestive of TB. Children are treated by the DOTS strategy, and can be
   treated with 6- or 8-month regimens. HIV-infected children are treated
   with the same regimens. Children under 5 years of age exposed to an
   infectious case or infected with TB (tuberculin skin test positive) who
   are asymptomatic must receive preventive chemotherapy (isoniazid for 6
   months). Babies born to mothers with active TB must be managed
   carefully, as they could have congenital TB, and if they do not have TB
   they will need preventive chemotherapy for 6 months. BCG is indicated in
   all children soon after birth, except for those with symptomatic HIV
   infection. The main aim of any TB programme is to prevent the spread of
   TB, and also the spread to children, which is best achieved by early
   detection and treatment of adults with smear-positive TB.}},

Abstract = {{We report quantitative analysis of positive magnetoresistance (PMR) for

   contribution from streaming orbits (SOs) accounts for only small
   fraction of the total PMR. For small V-0, the limiting magnetic field
   B-e of SO can be identified as an inflection point of the
   magnetoresistance trace. The major part of PMR is ascribed to drift
   velocity arising from incompleted cyclotron orbits obstructed by

Abstract = {{While the construction of a linear pulse forming network (PFN) for a
   constant load impedance is relatively easy, the process is more
   difficult for a nonlinear or time-varying load. A passive PFN can
   certainly be synthesized for nonlinear loads, but is usually large and
   lacks the flexibility to be truly useful in most practical and research
   applications. This investigation describes the design and construction
   of a sequentially-fired pulse forming network (SFPFN) that maintains
   constant voltage and current for a nonlinear load. Operation of the
   SFPFN consists of charging multiple capacitor banks (or modules) to
   various levels and sequentially firing these banks into the load at
   appropriate times. The load and its characteristics determine the module
   charge voltage. An added benefit with the SFPFN is real-time computer
   monitoring and control allowing the PFN modules to be charged from a
   single prime power source via a group of switching relays. The nonlinear
   load used in this investigation is a helical coil electromagnetic
   launcher (HCEL). The SFPFN is also tested with a linear load consisting
   of a pulsed field coil. The nonlinearity of the HCEL is well-known with
   a factor of 2 change in winding resistance due to joule heating and a
   large variation in terminal voltage due to changes in the armature
   back-voltage. Experimental measurements show the SFPFN can deliver a
   relatively constant current pulse on the order of 5-15 kA into the HCEL
   load for a pulse length up to 8 ms. The maximum SFPFN operating voltage
   is 900 V with a total stored energy of 125 kJ. Scaling the SFPFN to
   larger or smaller pulse amplitudes or lengths is possible.}},

Abstract = {{Chemotherapy options for esophagogastric adenocarcinoma remain limited.
   Irinotecan has demonstrated broad activity in a variety of epithelial
   malignancies. Forty-six patients with previously untreated, measurable,
   unresectable, or metastatic esophagooastric adenocarcinoma were
   enrolled. Patients received irinotecan (125 mg/m(2) intravenously over
   90 min weekly) for 4 consecutive weeks followed by a 2-week rest.
   Forty-three patients received at least one treatment and were evaluable
   for response and toxicity. One complete and five partial responses were
   observed, for an overall response rate of 14\% (95\% CI, 4-24\%). Median
   survival for all 43 patients was 6.4 months (95\% Cl, 4.6-8.2 months).
   Grade 3 to 4 toxicity included 10 patients (23\%) with neutropenia, 13
   patients (30\%) with late diarrhea, 6 patients (14\%) with vomiting, and
   6 patients (14\%) with fatigue. We conclude that although single-agent
   irinotecan is an active agent for esophagogastric adenocarcinoma, the
   schedule utilized in this trial is associated with moderate toxicity.
   When used as a single-agent, a triweekly schedule may be preferable for
   this patient population.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Failure to decrease blood pressure ( BP) normally during
   night-time, which is called non-dipping, in hypertensive individuals is
   associated with higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In
   addition, non-dipping BP leads to structural changes in the left
   ventricle; however, the effect of non-dipping BP on coronary flow
   reserve ( CFR) has not been studied yet. Methods. In this study, we
   measured CFR of 22 subjects with non-dipper hypertension, and 15
   subjects with dipper hypertension using transthoracic second-harmonic
   Doppler echocardiography ( Acuson Sequoia C256H). None of the subjects
   had any systemic disease or coronary risk factor except hypertension.
   Results. Age, gender, body mass index, lipids and echocardiographic
   findings including left ventricular mass index were similar between the
   groups. Office BP recordings were similar between non-dipper and dipper
   groups ( 147.9 +/- 6.1/93.9 +/- 4.3 vs 144.0 +/- 8.0/93.0 +/- 3.7).
   Daytime and 24-h ambulatory BP measurements were similar within the
   groups, but night-time BPs were significantly greater in non-dipper
   group than those were in dipper group. Left ventricular diastolic and
   systolic functions, and both baseline and hyperemic peak diastolic
   coronary velocity as well as CFR, were similar between the non-dipper
   and dipper groups ( CFR: 2.47 +/- 0.59 vs 2.39 +/- 0.47). Conclusion.
   CFR were similar in patients with non-dipper and dipper hypertension in
   the absence of excessive left ventricular hypertrophy and other
   cardiovascular risk factors.}},

Abstract = {{Observations of dense water formation on the shelf of the Gulf of
   Thermaikos (North Aegean) are presented, based mainly on continuous
   monitoring of temperature and currents, during the winter of 2001-2002,
   at an instrumented mooring and a CTD survey carried out in early
   February 2002. A 2.5-month realistic simulation, corresponding to the
   period of observation, was performed to investigate the processes of
   dense water formation and cascading. The simulation is first compared to
   the main characteristics of the dense water, time variation of bottom
   temperature and spatial distribution of the dense water on the shelf.
   Subsequently, the simulation is used (a) to show that the formation of
   dense water takes place within the semi-enclosed Thessaloniki Bay and
   (b) to explain the intermittence of cascading out of the bay in relation
   to wind variations. The pathways of the dense water through the shelf
   are investigated with an emphasis on the role of the bottom slope and
   friction in the Ekman layer. The export of dense water towards the open
   sea occurs primarily along the slope bounding the western coast. (c)

Abstract = {{The Early Cretaceous lizard genus Dalinghosaurus from the Yixian
   Formation of Liaoning, China, was originally described on the basis of a
   partial postcranial skeleton characterised by extremely long slender
   hind feet and a long tail. The skull has remained unknown and the
   systematic position is undetermined. Here we describe the skeletal
   anatomy of this lizard in detail based on a series of new specimens in
   the collections of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and
   Paleoanthropology, Beijing. The adult animal is small, with a
   well-ossified skull having a characteristic pattern of pustulate
   sculpture on the roofing bones and an expanded angular flange on the
   lower jaw. Skin impressions show a pattern of fine granular dorsal
   scales, rhomboidal ventral scales, and elongate tail scales arranged in
   annulae. In many features, the skull resembles that of the living
   Xenosaurus and Shinisaurus, as well as Carusia from the Late Cretaceous
   of Mongolia and China. Phylogenetic analysis using three different data
   sets provides some support for that interpretation. The postcranial
   skeleton is characterised by long hind limbs and short forelimbs, but
   the delicacy of the long pes and the slender claws suggest this animal
   may have been a climber rather than a facultative bipedal runner.}},

Abstract = {{Hermite-sine-Gaussian and Hermite-sinh-Gaussian laser beam intensities
   in a turbulent atmosphere are investigated. The received intensity is
   formulated by applying the extended Huygens-Fresnel principle to
   generalized Hermite-hyperbolic-Gaussian and Hermite-sinusoidal-Gaussian
   beam incidences. From this result, the association to different types of
   Hermite-hyperbolic-Gaussian and Hermite-sinusoidal-Gaussian beams are
   defined. The average receiver intensity expressions for
   Hermite-sine-Gaussian and Hermite-sinh-Gaussian laser beams are
   evaluated and plotted against the variations in source parameters and
   propagation conditions. It is observed that the propagation of
   Hermite-sine-Gaussian and Hermite-sinh-Gaussian laser beams in
   turbulence have many similarities to their counterparts,
   Hermite-cosine-Gaussian and Hermite-cosh-Gaussian laser beams, that are
   examined earlier. It is further observed that under certain conditions
   the main features of the previously established reciprocity concept
   between cosine-Gaussian and cosh-Gaussian beams are mostly applicable to
   Hermite-sine-Gaussian and Hermite-sinh-Gaussian laser beams. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Stauria favosa exhibits a typical pattern of axial division (tripartite
   or quadripartite). The four protosepta first appear with a definite
   polarity in offset corallites, and metasepta are inserted serially,
   following Knuth's rule. There are no variations in essential modes of
   asexual reproduction. However, at the corallum periphery, up to four
   offset corallites appear to have been derived by discrete offsetting
   within the parent calices. Detailed observations of vertical
   morphological changes, however, indicate that this apparently unique
   mode of increase is derived from axial division at the sites of the four
   protosepta, as usual in this species. Just after the initiation of
   division, the contraction of polyps occurred in response to somewhat
   accidental, deteriorating habitat conditions. The combination of
   asexually divided corallites and rejuvenescence resulted in phaceloid
   daughter corallites, which subsequently underwent partial mortality at
   the corallum periphery. Stauria favosa always exhibits not only regular
   modes of asexual reproduction and septal insertion under the strict
   control of phylogenetic and developmental constraints, but also variable
   growth forms of corallites and coralla. This variability, though within
   limited options, is palaeoecologically significant for successfully
   coping with unpredictable habitats.}},

   analysed. The average spectrum is well described by thermal
   Comptonization with an electron temperature of 50 keV and Thomson
   optical depth tau(T) similar to 1 in a slab geometry. The spectral shape
   is almost constant during the outburst. For the first time we detect a
   spin- up, v = 8.4 x 10(-13) Hz s(-1), of an accreting millisecond
   pulsar. The ISGRI data reveal the pulsation of X- rays at a period of
   1.67 milliseconds up to similar to 150 keV. The pulsed fraction is shown
   to increase from 6 per cent at 6 keV to 12 - 20 per cent at 100 keV.
   This is naturally explained by the action of the Doppler effect on the
   exponentially cutoff Comptonization spectrum from the hot spot. The
   nearly sinusoidal pulses show soft lags with a complex energy
   dependence, increasing up to 7 keV, then decreasing to 15 keV, and
   seemingly saturating at higher energies.}},

Abstract = {{Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug widely used as an
   analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent. The conjugated forms of naproxen
   and O-DMN, its demethylated metabolite, account for 66-92\% of naproxen
   found in human urine. In this study, O-DMN and structurally related
   compounds were tested as substrates for seven isoforms of human
   cytosolic sulfotransferase (SULT). The SULT2 or hydroxysteroid SULT
   isoforms, SULT2A1 and SULT2B1b, did not show reactivity with any of the
   compounds. All five SULT1 isoforms were active although there was
   variability between SULT isoforms and compounds assayed. O-DMN was
   sulphated by SULT1A1, SULT1B1 and SULT1E1. All five SULT1 isoforms were
   capable of conjugating both alpha-naphthol and beta-naphthol. Apparent
   K-m values for O-DMN sulphation were significantly higher than the
   values for either alpha-naphthol or beta-naphthol. SULTs 1A1, 1B1 and
   1E1 had K(m)s for O-DMN sulphation of 84 mu M, 690 mu M and 341 mu M,
   respectively. These K-m values were 40-1150-fold higher than the K-m
   values for alpha- and beta-naphthol. The role of the side-chain in O-DMN
   sulphation was studied using a series of structurally related
   beta-naphthol compounds as substrates for SULT1A1 and SULT1E1. The
   presence of lipophilic groups increased affinity for both SULT isoforms
   whereas inclusion of a carboxyl group inhibited activity. These studies
   indicate that O-DMN is sulphated by SULT1A1, B1 and 1E1. Because of the
   high concentrations of SULT1A1 expression in human liver and intestines
   and its higher affinity for O-DMN sulphation, SULT1A1 may have a role in
   the first pass metabolism of O-DMN.}},

Abstract = {{Linoleic acid was m microen capsulated with gum arabic using a
   spray-drier with a centrifugal atomizer. The oxidation process of
   encapsulated linoleic acid was observed at various temperatures and at
   different relative humidities. The inlet-air temperature of the dryer
   was found to have no significant effect on the Sauter mean diameter or
   moisture content of the microcapsules; hence, the oxidation process of
   encapsulated linoleic acid was unaffected by the inlet-air temperature.
   However, the rotational speed of the atomizer did affect the size and
   moisture content of the microcapsules, which were found to be larger and
   higher, respectively, for microcapsules prepared at the lower rotational
   speed. The oxidation of linoleic acid in larger microcapsules proceeded
   more slowly. In addition, oxidation progressed more quickly at a higher
   relative humidity, and it was suggested that the glass transition of the
   wall material might affect the progress of oxidation. The oxidation
   process was analyzed based on the Weibull equation, and the rate and
   shape constants were evaluated. Relative humidity was found to have
   little effect on the activation energy of oxidation during storage of
   the microcapsules.}},

Abstract = {{Prunella vulgaris L. (Labiatae), a popular Western and Chinese herbal
   medicine, has long been associated with anti-viral and anti-bacterial
   effects. While its anti-viral effects are attributed mainly to the
   inhibition of virus replication, the biological mechanisms of its
   anti-bacterial effects remain unknown. As a biological response modifier
   (BRM), the polysaccharides isolated from P. vulgaris have been shown to
   up-regulate the immune responses of monocytes/macrophages. However, the
   immune stimulatory effects seem to contradict its well-known
   anti-inflammatory properties. We hypothesized that the anti-microbial
   effects exhibited by the polysaccharides isolated from P. vulgaris
   encompass both anti-inflammatory and immune stimulatory effects. One of
   the polysaccharide fractions PV2IV markedly stimulated the production of
   superoxide and nitrite representing nitric oxide from murine macrophage
   RAW264.7 and brain macrophage BV2 cells. The amount of nitrite and
   superoxide produced after PV2IV stimulation was as high as that
   stimulated by bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in a
   dose-dependent manner. In addition, PV2IV also increased cellular
   protein levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and mRNA for
   tumor necrosis factor-cc (TNF alpha). Similar to the effects of a high
   dose of LPS, the fraction PV2 could trigger activation-induced cell
   death (AICD) by stimulating caspase-3 activity and reduction of MTT
   uptake in monocytes/macrophages. These results may help our
   understanding of the molecular mechanism of P. vulgaris, which exhibited
   both immune stimulatory and anti-inflammatory effects against microbial
   invasion.}},

   activated pathway for meiotic recombination in the absence of Rec12, the
   Spo11 homolog of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Rad2, a FEN-1 flap
   endonuclease homolog, is involved in processing Okazaki fragments. In
   its absence, meiotic recombination and proper segregation of chromosomes
   were restored in rec12 Delta mutants to nearly wild-type levels.
   Although readily detectable in wild-type strains, meiosis-specific DSBs
   were undetectable in recombination-proficient rad2 Delta rec12 Delta
   strains. On the basis of the biochemical properties of Rad2, we propose
   that meiotic recombination by this alternative (Rec{*}) pathway can be
   initiated by non-DSB lesions, such as nicks and gaps, which accumulate
   during premeiotic DNA replication in the absence of Okazaki fragment
   processing. We compare the Rec{*} pathway to alternative pathways of
   homologous recombination in other organisms.}},

Abstract = {{Although it is known that overall mortality is increased after hip
   fracture, the influence of hip fracture risk factors on the subsequent
   mortality and cause of death has not been well studied. The objective of
   this study was to establish the survival after hip fracture in women and
   to assess the impact of comorbidity on mortality. We identified a
   complete population-based set of 2,245 incident hip fracture cases and
   4,035 randomly selected population-based controls among women 50-81
   years old in Sweden and followed these subjects for an average of 5
   years through the Swedish National Inpatient and Cause-of-Death
   Registers. Information on factors related to hip fracture was obtained
   through linkage to hospital discharge data and through a mailed
   questionnaire. We studied excess mortality of hip fracture patients
   compared to controls using survival curves and proportional hazard
   regression models. During follow-up, 896 hip fracture patients (40\%)
   and 516 (13\%) controls died. The relative risk (RR) of death, adjusted
   for age and previous hospitalization for serious disease, was 2.3 (95\%
   CI 2.0-2.5). Although the highest mortality risks were in the 1st 6
   months post-fracture, RRs for fractures versus controls were increased
   for at least 6 years. Increased mortality was apparent both in those
   with evidence of comorbidity and those without. Hip fracture patients
   have a substantially increased risk of death that persists for at least
   6 years post-fracture. The relative excess mortality is independent of
   comorbidity and known hip fracture risk factors.}},

Abstract = {{Diagnostic instrumentation and monitoring of bridges are essential for
   reliable structural condition assessment and performance evaluation.
   This management step applies particularly to structurally deficient
   bridges that cannot be accurately evaluated by inspection and/or
   analysis alone. Reliable evaluation is an economic and engineering
   requirement before any decision-making for preventive action. Thus,
   field diagnostic capabilities are indispensable tools to enable
   evaluation and support field-calibrated modeling, analysis,
   identification, and load rating. The reliability of structural
   evaluation for objective bridge management is determined by the
   dependable performance of all the system components. Although
   instrumentation and monitoring procedures appear to be well established,
   some misconceptions still keep recurring critically in practice. To
   improve the state-of-practice of structural diagnostics, available field
   systems and methods need re-evaluation of their instrumentation and
   monitoring performance under real-world conditions. Subsequently,
   dedicated field capabilities can be formulated and developed to have
   advanced and practical characteristics. This article discusses various
   less-emphasized critical aspects of multidisciplinary research
   experience on bridge structural health monitoring, to explore dependable
   evaluation methods, compile practical data on actual bridge monitoring
   for immediate implementation, and generate focused insight for the
   development of advanced, reliable, and practical research methods in the
   future. To reach a systematic conceptualization for a better
   methodology, various diagnostic components are criticized. The resulting
   discussions on the various bridge evaluation aspects are practical for
   transportation agencies, bridge officials, and researchers. The detailed
   aspects are intended to help select appropriate implementation practices
   in field applications of bridge instrumentation and monitoring. These
   help focus bridge management policies, re-orient evaluation strategies,
   and reconsider diagnostic methods.}},

Abstract = {{In previous papers, we used abstract potential theory, as developed by
   Fuglede and Ohtsuka, to a systematic treatment of rendezvous numbers. We
   considered Chebyshev constants and energies as two variable set
   functions, and introduced a modified notion of rendezvous intervals
   which proved to be rather nicely behaved even for only lower
   semicontinuous kernels or for not necessarily compact metric spaces.
   Here we study the rendezvous and average numbers of possibly infinite
   dimensional normed spaces. It turns out that very general existence and
   uniqueness results hold for the modified rendezvous numbers in all
   Banach spaces. We also observe the connections of these magical numbers
   to Chebyshev constants, Chebyshev radius and entropy. Applying the
   developed notions with the available methods we calculate the rendezvous
   numbers or rendezvous intervals of certain concrete Banach spaces. In
   particular, a satisfactory description of the case of LP spaces is
   obtained for all p > 0.}},

Abstract = {{Chromium is widely used in industry but exposure to chromium compounds
   in the workplace can result in nephrotoxicity. Various nephrotoxicants
   affect the brush border membrane (BBM) lining the epithelial cells of
   the proximal tubule, but there have been no studies regarding the effect
   of potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7), a hexavalent chromium compound, on
   renal BBM. In the present work, the effect of administering a single
   intraperitoneal dose (15 mg/kg body weight) of K2Cr2O7 on rat renal BBM
   enzymes and inorganic phosphate (Pi) transport was studied. The animals
   were administered normal saline (control) or K2Cr2O7 and sacrificed 1,
   2, 4 and 8 days after treatment. K2Cr2O7 induced reversible damage to
   the rat kidney function as indicated by serum creatinine (Scr) and urea
   nitrogen levels. The activities of BBM marker enzymes were significantly
   decreased in isolated BBM vesicles (BBMV) and homogenates of cortex and
   medulla on 1, 2 and 4 days after administration of K2Cr2O7 with complete
   recovery to control values after 8 days. The decrease in the activities
   of the enzymes was mainly due to changes in maximum velocity (V-max)
   values, while the Michaelis constant (K-m) remained unchanged. The
   sodium dependent Pi transport across BBMV was reduced by 50\% after
   treatment with K2Cr2O7. Thus, the administration of a single dose of
   K2Cr2O7 leads to impairment in the functions of renal BBM. These results
   suggest that the nephrotoxicity of K2Cr2O7 may be mediated, at least in
   part, by its effect on renal BBM.}},

Abstract = {{Vertebral fractures are the hallmark of osteoporosis, responsible for
   increased back pain, impairment of mobility and functional limitations.
   These factors have an impact on patients' health-related quality of life
   (QOL). The aim of this study was to assess QOL, using QUALEFFO, in
   osteoporotic postmenopausal women, according to the number and the
   severity of the vertebral fractures. A group of 629 osteoporotic
   postmenopausal women (60-80 years) with symptoms that, according to a
   rheumatologist, could be related to a vertebral fracture, had spine
   X-rays with standardized procedures. All the X-rays were assessed in a
   central facility. The number of fractures was a determinant of a low
   QOL, as indicated by an increased score in physical function (P=0.001),
   social function (P=0.002) and total score (P=0.027). Patients with
   higher grades of vertebral deformities, i.e., more severe fractures, had
   low QOL in these three domains, too (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001 and P=0.005,
   respectively). There was no difference in QOL according to the thoracic
   or lumbar location of the fractures. Both anterior and middle
   deformities of the vertebral bodies had a negative impact on QOL. In
   none of the analyses were the pain and mental function domains of
   QUALEFFO discriminant among the patients. QOL, assessed by an
   osteoporosis-specific instrument, is decreased in osteoporotic women as
   a function of both the number and the severity of the vertebral
   fractures. Treating women with prevalent fractures may avoid a further
   decrease in their quality of life.}},

Title = {{A family of driving forces to suppress chaos in jerk equations: Laplace
   domain design}},
Journal = {{CHAOS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A family of driving forces is discussed in the context of chaos
   suppression in the Laplace domain. This idea can be attained by
   increasing the order of the polynomial in the expressions of the driving
   force to account for the robustness and/or the performance of the closed
   loop. The motivation arises from the fact that chaotic systems can be
   controlled by increasing the order of the Laplace controllers even to
   track arbitrary orbits. However, a larger order in the driving forces
   can induce an undesirable frequency response, and the control efforts
   can result in either peaking or large energy accumulation. We overcame
   these problems by showing that considering the frequency response
   (interpreted by norms), the closed-loop execution can be improved by
   designing the feedback suppressor in the Laplace domain. In this manner,
   the stabilization of the chaotic behavior in jerk-like systems is
   achieved experimentally. Jerk systems are particularly sensitive to
   control performance (and robustness issues) because the acceleration
   time-derivative is involved in their models. Thus, jerky systems are
   especially helped by a robust control design. (C) 2005 American

Abstract = {{We report significantly improved dc characteristics and RF performance
   of AlGaN-GaN HEMTs grown on grooved sapphire substrates. Grooves 60 nm
   deep with 2-mu m-wide ridges and 4-mu m-wide trenches were created along
   the (1010) orientation of the substrate by inductively coupled-plasma
   reactive ion etching. Device mesas were defined over the trench regions
   where superior crystalline quality was observed by other
   characterization techniques. Compared to conventional HEMTs grown on the
   planar area, the devices on the grooved substrate show increased drain
   saturation current and peak transconcductance. Their reverse gate
   leakage current is over three orders of magnitude lower. These devices
   also show increased off-state breakdown voltage with hard breakdown
   characteristics. For nominal 1-mu m-gate-length HEMTs, the best current
   gain and power gain cutoff frequencies were 15 and 54 GHz, respectively.
   The on-wafer output power, gain, and power-added efficiency of an
   unpassivated device measured at 4 GHz were 3.26 W/mm, 25.7 dB, and
   55.6\%. The enhanced performance is attributed to low-density mixed

Abstract = {{Representative measurements of ammonia volatilisation from manure at
   storing and spreading stages were carried out during several years in
   Poland. All measurements were made using passive horizontal flux
   samplers. The average ammonia emission from manure storage heaps was
   determined as 11 kg/LU/year corresponding to a quarter of the stored
   total nitrogen amount. The ammonia emissions were higher in the winter
   when the temperature difference between the heap and the ambient air was
   higher. The project is part of the Baltic agriculture run-off action
   program (BAAP) applied to Poland. One measurement of the ammonia
   emission from a slurry tank gave a significantly lower emission compared
   to the commonly used manure storage heap. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Single-point mutations are one of the most frequent causes of genetic
   variability in both human and close species. The recent availability of
   different bioinformatics tools for annotating human single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) has opened the possibility of using them to score
   SNPs from species with a biomedical interest, in particular from mice
   and other models of human disease. Also, this ability to predict
   pathogenicity of single point mutations in one species, based on data
   from another species, opens the possibility to predict the pathological
   character of single point mutations in humans using data from
   well-characterized model systems of human disease. This could provide a
   valuable alternative to the more traditional genetic population
   approaches. However, transferral of prediction tools may be limited by
   different factors, from a species bias in the training set, to a large
   sequence divergence between the proteomes of the training and the target
   species. Here we study the conditions under which prediction tools can
   be transferred among species, concentrating in the case of mice. We find
   that for the majority of the human-mouse homolog pairs, the sequence
   similarity is large enough to preserve the pathological character of
   mutations among species, in general. We then establish that
   prediction/annotation tools developed for one organism can be used to
   predict the neutral/pathological character of mutations/SNPs in the
   other organism.}},

   samples from 187 cats living in three Chilean cities were obtained. IgG
   and methods. Blood samples from 187 cats living in three Chilean, cities
   were obtained. IgG antibodies against Bartonella henselae were measured
   using indirect immunofluorescence. Blood cultures were clone in 60
   samples. The presence of Bartonella henselae in positive cultures was
   confirmed by restriction fragment length polymorphism, polimerase chain
   reaction (RFLP-PCR). Results: The general prevalence of IgG antibodies
   against Bartonella henselae was 85.6\%. No differences in this
   prevalence were formed among cats younger or older than 1 year, or those
   infested or not infested with fleas. However domestic cats had a lower
   prevalence when compared with stray cats (73 and 90\% respectively, p
   <0.01). Bartonella henselae was isolated in 41\% of blood cultures. All
   the isolated were confirmed as Bartonella henselae by RFLP-PCR.

Abstract = {{This paper studies multi-unit ascending (English) auctions with a
   buyer's option. The buyer's option gives the winner of an auction the
   right to purchase any number of units at the winning price. We develop a
   theoretical model and derive the optimal strategies for the bidders. The
   model predicts various behavioral implications (e.g., the winner never
   exercises the option, the price declines...) that are tested using a
   unique data set on wine auctions held at the Paris-based auction house
   Drouot. We also analyze why the buyer's option is used. Estimating the
   model in a structural econometric way, and using counterfactual
   comparisons, we find that the buyer's option does not affect the
   seller's revenue (relative to a system where the units are auctioned
   sequentially without the option). Drouot, however, saves a lot of time
   with the option and this effect represents a considerable amount of
   money. The time-saving effect seems thus to be the primary purpose of
   the buyer's option.}},

Abstract = {{We use evolutionary game theory (EGT) to investigate the dynamics and
   equilibria of selection methods in coevolutionary algorithms. The
   canonical selection method used in EGT is equivalent to the standard I
   `fitness- proportional{''} selection method used in evolutionary
   algorithms. All attractors of the EGT dynamic are Nash equilibria; we
   focus on simple symmetric variable-sum games that have polymorphic
   Nash-equilibrium attractors. Against the dynamics of proportional
   selection, we contrast the behaviors of truncation selection, (mu,
   lambda), (mu, + lambda), linear ranking, Boltzmann, and tournament
   selection. Except for Boltzmann selection, each of the methods we test
   unconditionally fail to achieve polymorphic Nash equilibrium. Instead,
   we find point attractors that lack game-theoretic justification, cyclic
   dynamics, or chaos. Boltzmann selection converges onto polymorphic Nash
   equilibrium only when selection pressure is sufficiently low; otherwise,
   we obtain attracting limit-cycles or chaos. Coevolutionary algorithms
   are often used to search for solutions (e.g., Nash equilibria) of games
   of strategy; our results show that many selection methods are
   inappropriate for finding polymorphic Nash solutions to variable-sum
   games. Another application of coevolution is to model other systems; our
   results emphasize the degree to which the model's behavior is sensitive
   to implementation details regarding selection-details that we might not
   otherwise believe to be critical.}},

   Methods: This case control study used data on all children presenting to

   fracture due to a playground fall. Cases were children who fell from a
   height off playground equipment. Controls were children who fell from

   reduction and minor if they did not.
   Results: Fractures from equipment falls were 3.91 ( 95\% CI 2.76 to

   counties in North Carolina, and followed them for dementia (1986-1987
   through June 2000). Information gathered during in-home interviews
   included sociodemographic characteristics, health status, health service
   use, and vitamin use. Diagnosis of dementia and AD was based on
   evaluations using the clinical and neuropsychological batteries of the
   Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease, with final
   determination by consensus agreement of specialists using Diagnostic and
   Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, third revision, and National
   Institute for Neurological and Communicative Disorders and
   Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders criteria.
   RESULTS: Of 616 persons initially dementia-free (mean age 73 y; 62\%
   female; 62\% African American), 141 developed dementia, of whom 93
   developed AD. Increased age and mobility problems were risk factors for
   dementia (only age for AD), while an increased number of outpatient
   visits reduced the likelihood of developing dementia. Neither use of any
   vitamins C and/or E (used by 8\% of subjects at baseline) nor high-dose
   use reduced the time to dementia or AD.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this community in the southeastern US where vitamin
   supplement use is low, use of vitamins C and/or E did not delay the
   incidence of dementia or AD.}},
