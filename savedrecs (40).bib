Abstract = {{A numerical model, which simulates the dynamics of alluvial river
   channels on geological (Quaternary) time scales, is presented. The model
   includes water flow, channel dimensions, sediment transport and channel
   planform type. A number of numerical experiments, which investigate the
   response of an alluvial river to imposed sequences of water and sediment
   supply, with special emphasis on the time lags between these controlling
   variables, as well as a downstream discharge increase, are presented. It
   is found that the influence of the time lags can be substantial, having
   major implications for the reconstructions of palaeo climate based on
   river channel behavior documented in the geological record. The model is
   further applied to both a conceptual warm-cold-warm cycle and a
   reconstructed evolution of the river Meuse, the Netherlands, during the
   Late Glacial-Holocene warming. Results show that the model is capable of
   explaining the response of this river, although batter validation
   against palaeoenvironmental data remains necessary. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The effect of histamine on intracellular free Ca2+ levels ({[}Ca2+]i) in
   HA22/VGH human hepatoma cells were evaluated using fura-2 as a
   fluorescent Ca2+ dye. Histamine (0.2-5 muM) increased {[}Ca2+](i) in a
   concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 value of about 1 muM, The
   {[}Ca2+](i) response comprised an initial rise, a slow decay, and a
   sustained phase, Extracellular Ca2+ removal inhibited 50\% of the
   {[}Ca2+](i) signal. In Ca2+-free medium, after cells were treated with 1
   muM thapsigargin (an endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump inhibitor), 5 muM
   histamine failed to increase {[}Ca2+](i). After pretreatment with 5
   double up arrow M histamine in Ca2+-free medium for 4 min, addition of 3
   mM Ca2+ induced a {[}Ca2+](i) increase of a magnitude 7-fold greater
   than control. Histamine (5 muM)-induced intracellular Ca2+ release was
   abolished by inhibiting phospholipase C with 2 muM 1-(6-((17 beta
   -3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl)amino)hexyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione
   (U73122), and by 5 muM pyrilamine but was not altered by 50 muM
   cimetidine. Together, this study shows that histamine induced
   {[}Ca2+](i) increases in human hepatoma cells by stimulating H1, but not
   H2, histamine receptors. The {[}Ca2+](i) signal was caused by Ca2+
   release from thapsigargin-sensitive endoplasmic reticulum in an inositol
   1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent manner, accompanied by Ca2+ entry.}},

Abstract = {{The expression of MHC class II molecules is actively regulated upon
   various cellular stimuli. Since apoptosis is an inducible cellular
   process, it was asked whether cells undergoing apoptosis would also
   modulate their expression of class II molecules. Using an
   EBV-transformed B-cell line, the cell surface expression of HLA-DR
   molecules was analyzed by fluorescence-activated flow cytometry on
   normal and oxidant-treated apoptotic cells. A rapid and continuous
   decrease in HLA-DR expression was observed in apoptotic cells. RNA
   analysis and semiquantitative RT-PCR of cytoplasmic beta -actin mRNA
   showed that apoptotic cells contain partially degraded RNA and much
   lower amounts of beta -actin mRNA. Nevertheless, when compared after
   normalization of intact mRNA amounts, the HLA-DRB mRNA signals were of
   similar strength in normal and apoptotic cells as determined by
   semiquantitative RT-PCR. Thus, the decrease in the number of class II
   molecules during apoptosis underlies no specific program for
   downregulation of HLA-DRB mRNA transcription but is due to a nonspecific
   degradation of RNA molecules accompanied by cell death.}},

Abstract = {{Does the replacement of the quadratic (H-2) predictor by the worst-case
   (H-infinity, or cumulative minimax) predictor robustify the predictive
   control laws? The present work provides a partial answer to this
   question, positive for the examples considered, representative of three
   broad classes of systems. The H-infinity prediction is demonstrated to
   be a powerful and convenient tool for frequency shaping of the gain of
   the dosed-loop complementary sensitivity function, capable of
   robustifying the closed loop for systems with different stability
   properties. The H-infinity-optimal k-step ahead predictor is derived for
   an unstable single-input-single-output CARMA model. A BIBO unstable
   filter for the disturbance rejection is obtained using the internal
   model principle and included into the closed loop, and the H-infinity
   predictor is applied to the combination of this filter with the plant.
   The sum over a finite horizon of the current and the predicted tracking
   error and control signal power spectral densities (PSDs) is decomposed
   into two parts, one induced by the worst-case predicted disturbance and
   the other-by the known future reference input. A two degrees of freedom
   algorithm, referred to as the multi-step closed-loop polynomial
   H-infinity predictive control law, is obtained that minimizes the peaks
   of the PSD of the first part and the integral on the unit circle of the
   PSD of the second. It is demonstrated on several systems that H-infinity
   prediction introduces a very intuitive tuning knob in the form of the
   prediction horizon capable of setting a trade-off between the
   steady-state disturbance rejection perfor mance in terms of the output
   error variance and the closed-loop robustness, however the efficacy of
   the knob strongly depends on the stability properties of the system and
   its inverse. The trade-off becomes less pronounced or completely
   disappears when the H-infinity predictor is replaced by the quadratic
   one. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley Br Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Small-scale heterogeneities in the lithosphere below the Frankonian Jura
   (SE Germany) and the Massif Central (France) are studied using scattered
   teleseismic wavefields. To compare both regions wavefields of
   earthquakes are analysed which were simultaneously recorded at permanent
   local networks. Because the average wavelets of the first P-arrivals are
   nearly identical in the Frankonian Jura and the Massif Central, it is
   possible to compare directly the scattering characteristics of the
   lithospheric environments. Although the overall form of the mean
   wavefields and the P-codas are quite similar in both areas, the
   intensity of the scattered seismic arrivals is increased in the Massif
   Central compared to the Frankonian Jura. The same result is obtained
   using waveform data from mobile stations. The increased seismic
   scattering strength in the Massif Central is interpreted as interaction
   of the incoming wavefield with solidified magmatic intrusions. The
   lithospheric heterogeneities are most likely related to the known
   upwelling of the asthenosphere and the Tertiary and Quaternary
   volcanism. In contrast, the lithosphere beneath the Frankonian Jura
   seems to be less heterogeneous, perhaps due to less structural
   alterations since its formation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{At Menninnie Dam, South Australia, a drilling program has revealed a
   complete section through the subsurface feeder system and erupted
   products of a small, hydroexplosive, rhyolitic centre within the
   Mesoproterozoic Gawler Range Volcanics. Porphyritic rhyolite intruded
   near-vertical faults in the Palaeoproterozoic basement and at less than
   a few hundred metres depth, interacted with fault-hosted (hot?)
   groundwater. Hydrofracturing of the wall rock occurred in advance of and
   at the margins of the rhyolitic intrusions. The rhyolitic intrusions
   have peperitic margins and grade into discordant lithic-rich PB facies.
   The advancing fragmentation front intersected the palaeosurface,
   triggering phreatic eruptions that deposited a poorly sorted,
   lithic-rich explosion breccia. Rhyolite then rose to the surface through
   the intrusive breccias and shallow-seated magma-water interaction
   occurred in the conduit within <50 m of the surface. As the magma
   discharge rate increased, ``dry{''} explosive activity prevailed. A fall
   deposit, the top of which is welded, was deposited close to the vent,
   and in more distal locations (>800 m from the inferred source), the
   products include muddy sandstone and pumice breccia. At the end of the
   eruption, rhyolitic lava was extruded in the form of a small dome. The
   presence of contemporaneous Pb-Zn-Ag mineralisation in the wall rocks
   suggests that an active hydrothermal system may have been involved in
   the formation of the Menninnie Dam hydroexplosive volcanic centre. (C)

   reduction of ionic platinum in the presence of
   poly{[}(vinylamine)-co-(N-vinylisobutyramide)] (PVAm-co-PNVIBA). To our
   knowledge, the temperature- and pH-responsive copolymer was used far the
   first time as the stabilizer of colloidal metal particles. Three
   PVAm-co-PNVIBA copolymers with PVAm contents of 4.1, 8.3, and 19.8
   mol-\% were examined. The particle size and morphology of the platinum
   colloids varied with the copolymer composition, as confirmed by TEM
   measurements. The polymer-stabilized Pt nanoparticles precipitated on
   heating above their critical flocculation temperatures (CFTs), which
   were strongly dependent on the solution pH and the copolymer
   composition. The CFTs were 0.2-1.6 degreesC lower than the tower
   critical solution temperatures (LCSTs) of the copolymers free in water
   and the differences increased with increasing PVAm content. The
   catalytic activity of the Pt nanoparticles was investigated in the
   aqueous hydrogenation of allyl alcohol. ft was found that the activity
   was regulated through temperature- and pH-induced phase separation. The
   PVAm content also strongly effected the catalytic activity and the
   morphology of phase separated catalysts. With a PVAm content of 4.1
   mol-\%, the colloidal platinum sol reversibly changed its catalytic
   activity with changes in temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Activation of inhibitory nonadrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) nerves in
   the rat duodenum cause relaxations, which are reduced by nitric oxide
   synthase (NOS) inhibitors indicating that this response involves a
   nitrergic neurotransmission. The precise nature of the nitrergic
   neurotransmitter is still controversial since nitric oxide (NO)
   scavengers and superoxide generators, even in the presence of superoxide
   dismutase inhibitors, failed to inhibit nitrergic neurotransmission
   mediated relaxations. In order to understand the role of NOS in
   nitrergic neurotransmission and considering that N-OH-arginine
   (OH-L-Arg), L-citrulline, NO, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) and
   hydroxylamine (NH2OH) can be formed in cells during the N-G-oxidation of
   L-arginine catalyzed by NOS we explored whether any of these products
   could exhibit biological properties comparable to those of the nitrergic
   neurotransmitter. After establishing which of them was able to relax the
   rat duodenum, the pharmacological profile of such effect was determined
   employing oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb), pyrogallol (PYR), hydroquinone (HQ),
   hydroxocobalamin (HC) or carboxy-PTIO (C-PTIO) and compared with that of
   nerve mediated relaxations. NO, GSNO and NH2OH, but not OH-L-ARG and
   L-citrulline, caused concentration-dependent relaxations that were not
   affected by tetrodotoxin or L-NOARG. OxyHb almost abolished NO-induced
   relaxations but decreased only marginally the magnitude of nerve-,
   NH2OH- and SNG-induced relaxations. PYR, HQ and C-PTIO reduced
   significantly GSNO- and NO- induced relaxations but did not affect those
   induced by NH2OH or nerve activation. In contrast, HC abolished
   NO-induced relaxations while it did not affect those induced by GSNO,
   NH2OH and nerve activation. The catalase inhibitor 1,2,4 aminotriazole
   failed to affect nerve and NH2OH induced relaxations, These findings
   indicate that among the products that can be formed during NOS catalyzed
   L-arginine N-G-oxidation, only NH2OH caused relaxations that exhibited a
   pharmacological profile similar to those induced by the nitrergic
   neurotransmitter. Furthermore, if NH2OH is the actual neurotransmitter
   it appears to be acting either directly or by a catalase independent
   release of NO. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Liver regeneration is controlled by multiple signaling pathways induced
   by a variety of growth factors, hormones, and cytokines. Here we report
   that protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt, part of a key cell survival signaling
   pathway, is markedly activated after partial hepatectomy (PHX). The
   antiapoptotic protein Bad, a downstream target of PKB/Akt, is also
   phosphorylated, This cascade can be activated by various factors in
   primary hepatocytes, with the strongest activation by insulin and the
   alpha (1)-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (PE), followed by IL-6,
   epidermal growth factor (EGF), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF).
   Pretreatment of cells with the specific PI3 kinase inhibitor LY294002
   abolished insulin- or PE-activation of PKB/ Akt, suggesting that
   activation of PKB/Akt is mediated by a PI3 kinase-dependent mechanism.
   In vivo administration of PE, insulin, IL-6, HGF, or EGF to mice
   markedly stimulated PKB/Akt in the liver, with the strongest stimulation
   induced by insulin and PE. Moreover, HGF and insulin were able to
   attenuate transforming growth factor beta -induced apoptosis in hepatic
   cells, and these effects were antagonized by LY294002. Taken together,
   these Findings suggest that rapid activation of PKB/Akt is a key
   antiapoptotic signaling pathway involved in liver regeneration. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/ERK2) have been shown
   transiently activated and involved in excitotoxicity. We searched for
   upstream molecules responsible for the regulation of glutamate-induced
   ERK1/ERK2 activation and ERK1/ERK2-mediated apototic-like death in
   cultured rat cortical neurons. ERK1/ERK2 activation (monitored by
   anti-active ERK1/ERK2 antibody) was almost completely prevented by
   blockage of NMDA receptor (NMDA-R) or elimination of extracellular Ca2+,
   but not any other glutamate receptor or L-type voltage-gated Ca2+
   channel. It was prevented largely by inhibition of protein kinase C
   (PKC), protein-tyrosine kinases (PTK), respectively, but mildly by that
   of CaM kinase II. Combined inhibition of CaM kinase IJ (but not PTK) and
   PKC had an additive effect. Reversion of ERK1/ERK2? activation was
   largely prevented by inhibition of protein phosphatase (PP) 1 or protein
   tyrosine phosphatase (PTP). Combined inhibition of PP 1 and PTP had no
   additive effect. Glutamate-induced apoptotic-like death (determined by
   DAPI staining) was largely prevented by inhibition of NMDA-R, PKC, CaM
   kinase II, PTK and MEK1/MEK2 (ERK1/ERK2 kinase). respectively. Combined
   inhibition of CaM kinase II (but not PKC or PTK) and MEK1/MEK2 had an
   additive effect. Glutamate-induced apoptotic-like death was promoted by
   inhibition of PP1 and PTP, respectively. The above results suggested
   that in glutamate-induced cortical neurotoxicity ERK1/ERK2? activation
   be mainly mediated by NMDA-R. Subsequently, a pathway dependent on both
   PKC and PTK was mainly involved, which was also mainly responsible for
   ERK1/ERK2-mediated apoptotic-like death, and a CaM kinase II-dependent
   pathway was relatively mildly involved. Reversion of ERK1/ERK2
   activation was mainly mediated by a pathway dependent on both PPI and
   PTP, which might be involved in the restrain of glutamate-induced
   neurotoxicity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   LAR scores not significantly different from those reexposed to both CS
   and the antigen; animals of these groups showed significantly higher LAR
   scores than rats that received no OVA aerosol challenge. High levels of
   stress and anxiety were observed 30-40 min after the challenge with OVA
   aerosol. In the 2nd experiment, rats sensitized with OVA and submitted
   or not to Pavlovian conditioning were observed in the open-field and in
   the plus maze apparatus in the absence of OVA aerosol but in the
   presence of the CS; after behavioral observations the animals were
   sacrificed for serum corticosterone level determination. Both behavioral
   and biochemical data showed high levels of stress and anxiety in rats
   for which the antigen was previously paired with the CS; these changes
   were not observed in animals which received the antigen 24 h after the
   presentation of the CS (unpaired) or in those exposed to PBS aerosol
   (the OVA vehicle) only. The present data show not only that LAR can be
   submitted to Pavlovian conditioning, but also and importantly, that high
   levels of stress and anxiety are related to the course of LAR. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Rapid exchange of high energy carrying molecules between intracellular
   compartments is essential in sustaining cellular energetic homeostasis,
   Adenylate kinase (AK)-catalyzed transfer of adenine nucleotide beta- and
   gamma -phosphoryls has been implicated in intracellular energy
   communication and nucleotide metabolism. To demonstrate the significance
   of this reaction in cardiac energetics, phosphotransfer dynamics were
   determined by {[}O-18]phosphoryl oxygen analysis using P-31 NMR and mass
   spectrometry. In hearts with a null mutation of the AK1 gene, which
   encodes the major AK isoform, total AX activity and beta -phosphoryl
   transfer was reduced by 94\% and 36\%, respectively. This was associated
   with up-regulation of phosphoryl flux through remaining minor AK
   isoforms and the glycolytic phosphotransfer enzyme, S-phosphoglycerate
   kinase, In the absence of metabolic stress, deletion of AK1 did not
   translate into gross abnormalities in nucleotide levels, gamma -ATP
   turnover rate or creatine kinase-catalyzed phosphotransfer. However,
   under hypoxia AK1-deficient hearts, compared with the wild type, had a
   blunted AK-catalyzed phosphotransfer response, lowered intracellular ATP
   levels, increased P-i/ATP ratio, and suppressed generation of adenosine,
   Thus, although lack of AK1 phosphotransfer can be compensated in the
   absence of metabolic challenge, under hypoxia AK1-knockout hearts
   display compromised energetics and impaired cardioprotective signaling,
   This study, therefore, provides first direct evidence that AK1 is
   essential in maintaining myocardial energetic homeostasis, in particular
   under metabolic stress.}},

Abstract = {{Troglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, is known to act as an insulin
   sensitizer. The various effects of the drug include stimulation of
   glucose utilization and inhibition of gluconeogenesis and fatty acid
   oxidation. We studied the effect of troglitazone treatment on rat liver
   acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), the key enzyme that catalyzes the
   formation of malonyl-CoA, the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of
   long chain fatty acids. Treatment of rats with troglitazone for 18 days
   resulted in more than 200\% increase in the activity of hepatic
   acetyl-CoA carboxylase (1.01 +/- 0.14 and 2.33 +/- 0.28 mU/mg
   supernatant protein for control and troglitazone-treated rats,
   respectively) (p<0.001). The expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase mRNA,
   as studied by RNAse protection assay, was not significantly different
   between the two groups of animals. The ACC from control and
   troglitazone-treated groups was purified by avidin-affinity
   chromatography. The purified enzyme migrated as a major protein band
   (M-r 262,000) on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Troglitazone treatment was
   associated with increased citrate sensitivity of ACC. The specific
   activity of the purified preparation in troglitazone-treated rats was
   increased by 67\% (2.5 vs. 1.5 U/mg). Quantitation of alkali labile
   phosphate content of the purified preparation revealed 5.66 +/- 0.17 and
   6.29 +/- 0.13 mol Pi/mol subunit of 262 Kda for control and
   troglitazone-treated rats, respectively (P<0.01). The subtle increase in
   phosphate content does not explain the observed activation of the
   enzyme. It is possible that additional mechanisms such as troglitazone
   related rearrangement of the occupancy of select phosphate binding sites
   or altered binding of the biotin cofactor may also contribute to the
   observed activation of ACC. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Interest in the electronic structure of amides and polypeptides arises
   in part because optical spectroscopy such as electronic circular
   dichroism (CD) may be readily used to monitor conformational changes of
   peptides and proteins in solution. Our current, albeit somewhat
   incomplete, understanding of the relationship between polypeptide
   conformation and CD spectra has come in part from experimental and
   theoretical studies of model systems such as cyclic diamides. In this
   paper, we study the interactions between amide groups in a bridged
   cyclic diamide, diazabicyclo{[}2.2.2] octane-3,6-dione, through the
   measurement of its infrared (IR) and ultra-violet (UV) absorption and
   electronic CD spectra and through ab initio calculations of its
   electronic structure. The particular rigidity of the bridged cyclic
   diamide removes ambiguity regarding the conformation of the molecule in
   solution, which must remain close to the structure determined by X-ray
   crystallography. The theoretical study has been performed using the
   complete-active-space self-consistent-field and multiconfigurational
   second-order perturbation theory methods. Solvent effects have been
   modeled using a self-consistent reaction field. The results of the
   electronic structure calculations agree well with the observed spectra
   and allow the origin of the bands to be assigned. The electronic
   spectrum is dominated by an intense pi (nb)pi{*} transition, which is
   calculated to lie at 6.28 eV in the gas phase and 6.07 eV in solution.
   In addition, a number of less intense n pi{*} and pi (nb)pi{*}
   transitions are characterized. The results show that the electronic CD
   spectrum arises from n pi{*} and pi (nb)pi{*} transitions that can be
   considered to be localized on one amide group, while charge-transfer
   transitions do not make a significant contribution to the electronic CD
   spectrum.}},

Abstract = {{An abundance of evidence is available from large, randomized clinical
   trials supporting the efficacy of therapies for the management of
   patients with acute coronary syndromes. For ST-segment elevation
   myocardial infarction (MI), a variety of databases can be used to assess
   how these therapies, bath pharmacologic and invasive, are being
   integrated into real practice. Little information is available, however,
   with regard to how newer treatments are actually being implemented for
   patients with unstable angina and nan-ST-segment elevation MI. There are
   several important issues to consider in evaluating current treatment
   practices for acute coronary syndromes, including limitations of
   clinical trial databases, a trend toward progressive shortening of
   length of hospital stay, and variations in the availability of resources
   among treatment centers. In response to the need for a broader database
   that would address the global impact of clinical management practices in
   acute coronary syndromes, the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events
   (GRACE) Registry has been established. The GRACE Registry will initially
   collect data on patient care from a variety of treatment centers in 14
   countries, the plan being to eventually enroll 10,000 patients per year.
   This international observational database will obtain information on the
   complete spectrum of acute coronary syndromes, with the specific goals
   of describing diagnostic and treatment strategies, determining hospital
   outcomes, improving quality of care, and developing hypotheses for
   future clinical research. (C) 2000 by Excerpta Medica, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{A new synthesis strategy with the use of a co-template allowed for the
   framework substitution of chromium and the preparation of CrAPO-5 with
   high sorption capacities for nitrogen and benzene (HS samples). For
   these materials as well as for those synthesized with classical methods
   and exhibiting low sorption capacities (LS samples), X-band electron
   paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were measured at room and liquid
   nitrogen temperatures, The spectra of the as-synthesized HS and LS
   samples consist of a broad intense line (g(eff) = 1.971 +/- 0.001,
   DeltaH(pp) congruent to 500 G) with a positive lobe at g(eff) = 5.15 +/-
   0.01, assigned to the Cr3+ (3d(3), F-4(3/2)) ions with severely
   (rhombic) distorted octahedral coordination. The calcined samples show
   an additional narrow EPR signal of axial symmetry with g(parallel to) =
   1.971 +/- 0.001 and g(perpendicular to) = 1.959 +/- 0.001 that is
   assigned to the Cr5+ (3d(1), D-2(3/2)) ions in octahedral coordination
   as well. The HS samples heated under a vacuum exhibit a decrease in
   intensity of the Cr3+ lines as well as several new signals. Two of these
   signals are characterized by an axially symmetric g factor and belong to
   the Cr5+ centers in square pyramidal and tetrahedral coordinations. The
   third signal may be assigned to the Cr1+ (3d(5), S-6(5/2)) ions. The
   spectra of the LS samples heated under a vacuum show a strong decrease
   in intensity of the Cr3+ lines and only the two signals of the Cr5+
   centers in the same coordinations. Their g factors are similar to those
   in the HS samples. The thermal treatments under oxidative (O-2) and
   reductive (H-2) atmospheres reveal reproducible redox properties of the
   Cr5+ ions and a high stability of the Cr3+ ones, especially in the HS
   samples. The EPR results give strong support for the framework
   incorporation of the Cr3+ ions in the HS materials.}},

Abstract = {{Vasoconstrictor responses to electrical held stimulation (EFS, 0.2-32
   Hz, 0.1 ms, 12 V, for 1 min) were measured in endothelium-denuded
   segments of guinea-pig mesenteric vein and compared to responses in
   mesenteric artery. The distribution of both tyrosine hydroxylase-like
   immunoreactivity (TH-LI) and neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity
   (NPY-LI) was also studied using anti-TH and anti-NPY antibodies. The
   effect of exogenous NPY (10 nM) on EFS (8 Hz, 0.3 ms, 12 V, for 1
   min)-evoked overflow of noradrenaline (NA) was also studied using an
   HPLC technique with electrochemical detection. Veins responded with
   contractions at lower frequencies of stimulation than arteries. Prazosin
   (0.1 muM) abolished the EPS-evoked contractions in artery at 0.5-32 Hz
   and in vein at 0.2-1 Hz of stimulation. However. in vein, the
   contractile responses to EFS at 2-32 Hz of stimulation were only reduced
   by prazosin. Phentolamine (1 muM) abolished the responses to 0.5-4 Hz
   and reduced the responses to 8-32 Hz of EFS in artery. In vein,
   phentolamine (1 muM) abolished the responses to 0.2-1 Hz and facilitated
   the contractions elicited by 16-32 Hz. The NPY-receptor antagonist
   BIBP3226 (1 muM), in combination with phentolamine. abolished
   contractions in vein. Yohimbine (0.1 muM) abolished the responses to
   lower frequencies of stimulation in both artery (0.5-2 Hz) and vein
   (0.2-1 Hz). The responses to greater frequency stimulation were not
   affected by yohimbine in artery. and were facilitated in vein.
   Pre-treatment of animals for 24 h with reserpine abolished contractile
   responses to EFS in artery, whereas in vein, responses to 0.2-2 Hz were
   abolished while responses to 4-32 Hz were unchanged. Suramin (100 muM)
   or alpha,beta -methylene ATP (alpha,beta MeATP: 10-100 muM) treatment
   did not affect the contractile responses to EFS in either artery or
   vein. Pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid tetrasodium
   (PPADS; 30 muM), even potentiated the responses to 2-16 Hz in vein.
   However. following reserpine-treatment, both PPADS and suramin reduced
   the nerve-evoked contractions of vein. Either BIBP3226 (1 muM) alone or
   BIBP3226 in combination with PPADS or suramin abolished the contractile
   response to EFS in reserpine-treated veins. NPY ( 100 nM) produced
   significantly more contraction in vein than in artery (i.e., 93 +/- 2.5
   versus 71 +/- 4\% of the response to 70 mM KCl, respectively). NPY(10
   nM) significantly reduced the NA overflow evoked by EFS at 8 Hz. Flat
   mount preparations and cryostat sections of both mesenteric artery and
   vein revealed that TH-LI and NPY-LI were co-localized in a dense network
   of fibers within the adventitial layer. In conclusion, NA exclusively
   mediates the contractile response to sympathetic nerve stimulation in
   guinea-pig mesenteric artery, whereas at least three neurotransmitters
   {[}i.e., NA, adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) and NPY] are involved in
   the neural response of mesenteric vein. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

   two-color resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) and zero

   spectra recorded via the SI states of the isomers provide adiabatic
   ionization energies of 65 228, 64 741, and 65 648 +/- 5 cm(-1),
   respectively. The isomers are assigned with the aid of HF/cc-pVDZ,
   MP2/cc-pVDZ, and B3LYP/cc-pVDZ ab initio and density functional theory

Abstract = {{Several methyl-substituted allylic lithium compounds have been prepared
   by CH3Li cleavage of their corresponding
   bis(methyl)bis(allylic)stannanes. Low-temperature C-13 and proton NMR
   studies of 1:1 complexes of these allylic lithium compounds with TMEDA
   establish their structures. NMR lineshape changes with temperature
   provide barriers to rotation. Results are listed in order as follows
   (allyl substituents, compound number, barrier to rotation in
   kcal.mol(-1), and bonds undergoing rotation): 1,1-dimethyl, 26, 18, 2-3;
   endo-1-methyl, 27,1 19, 2-3;. endo-1-exo-3-dimethyl, 28, 21, 1-2 and
   2-3. These observations together with the allylic C-13 NMR chemical
   shifts indicate that in the case of unsymmetrical alkyl substitution at
   the termini the allyl C-C bond to the more substituted terminus is of
   higher bond order than that to the less substituted terminus.
   Unsymmetrical substitution is proposed to reduce the degree of
   delocalization compared to the symmetrically substituted allylic lithium
   compounds. A mechanism is proposed for the rotation process which is
   consistent with the Eyring activation parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The copolymers of vinyl imidazole (VI) and vinyl trimethoxy silane (VTS)
   were applied as the corrosion inhibitors and the adhesion promoters for
   the polyimide/ copper system at elevated temperatures. The mol ratios of
   VI to VTS were 100 : 0, 70 : 30, 30 : 70, and 0 : 100, Preoxidation of
   the primer was performed to improve the reactivity of the primer on
   poly(amic acid). A peel test was performed to evaluate the adhesion
   strength of the polyimide/primer/copper system after heat treatment at
   400 degreesC in a nitrogen atmosphere. The effect of the preoxidation of
   the primer on corrosion protection and adhesion promotion were
   investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM). The adhesion strength of the polyimide/primer/copper system
   depended on not only the chemical interaction between polyimide and the
   preoxidized primer, but also the thermal stability of the primer. It
   showed the highest value when the mol ratio of VI to VTS was 30 : 70.
   The primer layer reduced or suppressed copper diffusion into the
   polyimide layer. The degree of corrosion protection by the primer was
   affected by its thermal stability and its reactivity on copper. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The risk of initiating and maintaining the use of opiates up to the
   point of abuse and dependence is to a large degree genetically
   transmitted and is separate from genetic risk factors for addiction to
   other drugs of abuse. Pharmacogenetic studies have so far focused on
   obvious candidate genes that are expected to be involved either in the
   pharmacokinetics or in the pharmacodynamics of opioids in the mesolimbic
   reward system of the brain. The few findings of a positive allelic
   association rarely withstand replication in independent case-control or
   less stratification-prone family-based association samples. A
   pharmacogenomic approach in the best sense of the word, however,
   involves an unbiased, genome-wide, parallel search for risk genes and
   gene expression patterns. So far, only quantitative trait loci mapping
   studies of inbred rodent strains and differential expression studies
   using high-density DNA microarrays fulfill these requirements. The
   present state of pharmacogenomic and pharmacogenetic studies in animals
   and humans with respect to opiate addiction is reviewed in this paper.

Abstract = {{The ammonium, calcium, and sodium concentrations from three intermediate
   depth ice cores drilled in the area of Dronning Maud Land, East
   Antarctica, have been investigated. Since all measurements were
   performed by a high-resolution Continuous Flow Analysis system, for the
   first time seasonal signals of chemical trace species could be obtained
   from the interior of central Antarctica over a period of approximately 2
   millennia. Although the elevation as well as the accumulation rate
   differ between the drilling sites, similar values were obtained by
   comparing mean concentrations spanning the last 900 years. However, a
   distinct lack of intersite correlation was found on decadal timescales.
   Despite a noticeable accumulation change, apparent in one core, no
   significant concentration change of all three species has occurred. All
   the measured ions show clear seasonal signals over the whole records.
   While the sea-salt-related component sodium peaks simultaneously with
   calcium, the maximum ammonium concentration occurs in the snow with a
   time lag of 2 months after the sea-salt peak. More than 60\% of the
   calcium concentration can be attributed to an ocean source. Elevated
   sodium concentrations were found within this millennium compared to mean
   values of the whole records, but the spatially varying shape of the
   increase suggests that a possible climatic signal is biased by local
   deposition effects.}},

Abstract = {{Previous four- and five-factor solutions of the 18-item Brief
   Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) suggested the possibility of an
   affective dimension in psychosis. A principal components analysis was
   used to analyze psychiatric symptom data rated on an expanded 24-item
   version of the BPRS. BPRS data were collected during a period of acute
   psychotic and affective illness with 114 young adult, recent-onset
   schizophrenia and schizoaffective patients and 27 bipolar manic
   patients. Principal components analyses of the 18-item and 24-item BPRS
   indicated a four-factor solution was the most interpretable. Principal
   components analysis of the 24-item BPRS produced a clear mania factor
   characterized by high loadings from items added to the 18-item BPRS,
   which included elevated mood, motor hyperactivity, and distractibility.
   This factor solution suggests that the 24-item BPRS allows for an
   expanded assessment of affective symptoms relating to a manic dimension.
   Potentially important symptoms that were added to the traditional
   18-item version, namely suicidality, bizarre behavior, and seif-neglect,
   also make clear contributions to other factors. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objective: To estimate mortality by drug use in a cohort of patients
   with PD relative to age- and sex-matched comparators. Methods: Two
   longitudinal cohorts of patients with 7 and 11 years' duration of PD
   were constructed with matched comparators in Tayside, Scotland. Subjects
   were eligible for inclusion if they received a first prescription for an
   anti-Parkinson's drug from July 1989 to December 1995, with no PD drug
   prescription in the previous 6 months. Those who had previously taken a
   neuroleptic drug or were younger than 40 years of age were excluded.
   Results: Overall, subjects with PD in relation to comparators had higher
   mortality with a rate ratio (RR) of 1.16 (95\% CI 1.11, 2.81) in the
   7-year cohort. There was significantly greater mortality in patients
   with PD who received levodopa monotherapy (RR = 2.45, 95\% CI 1.42,
   4.23) relative to the comparators, adjusting for previous cardiovascular
   drug use and diabetes. However, there was no significant difference in
   mortality in those with PD receiving combination therapy of selegiline
   with levodopa and other drugs in relation to the comparators (RR = 0.92,
   95\% CI 0.37, 2.31). Conclusions: Subjects with PD had twice the rate of
   mortality relative to age- and sex-matched comparators. However, those
   subjects who received selegiline at any time in combination with
   co-careldopa or co-beneldopa showed no significant difference in
   mortality compared with the comparators. Monotherapy with levodopa was
   associated with the highest mortality.}},

   molecules are found to be in the L-2 mesophase at 5 mN/m and in the LS
   mesophase at 30 mN/m, whereas the FEP molecules appear disordered. In
   the mixture, the GIXD measurements, associated with previous
   thermodynamical and optical microscopy results, show that in the whole
   range of molar ratio, the two molecules are completely phase-separated,
   Also, we observed at 5 mN/m, relaxation in the pure ST monolayer and in
   the mixtures rich in ST; the tilt angle of the molecules and the

   dendrimers (sugar ball) and anionic surfactants such as sodium dodecyl
   sulfate (SDS) and lithium perfluorooctanesulfonate (LiFOS) on positively
   charged alumina particles was investigated at pH 3.5 by measuring the
   amount of adsorbed sugar ball and anionic surfactant, zeta potential,
   and sedimentation rate of alumina suspensions. The sugar balls of
   generations G3 and G5 were used. Under constant initial concentrations
   of the sugar balls, the amount of adsorbed sugar balls sharply
   increases, reaches a maximum, and then decreases, while the anionic
   surfactant adsorption increases with increasing anionic surfactant. The
   enhancement in the adsorption of the sugar balls is due to the
   adsorption of complexes consisting of sugar ball and anionic surfactant.
   In addition, the dispersion stability of alumina suspensions caused by
   the adsorption of the sugar ball and anionic surfactant depends on the
   zeta potential of alumina as well as the adsorption of sugar ball. A
   significant difference in the adsorption characteristics is not observed
   for the generation of sugar ball and kind of anionic surfactant.}},

Abstract = {{Human heparin/heparan sulfate interacting protein/L29 (HIP/L29) is
   thought to be involved in the promotion of cell adhesion, the promotion
   of cell growth in the cancerous state, and the modulation of blood
   coagulation. These activities are consistent with the proposed function
   of HIP/L29 as a heparin/heparan sulfate (Hp/HS) binding growth factor
   that has a preference for anticoagulantly active Hp/HS. Previous studies
   showed that a peptide derived from the C terminus of human HIP/L29 (HIP
   peptide-1) can selectively bind anticoagulant Hp and support cell
   adhesion. However, a murine ortholog does not have an identical HIP
   peptide-1 sequence, yet still retains the ability to bind Hp, suggesting
   that there may be additional Hp/HS binding sites outside of the HIP
   peptide-1 domain. To test this hypothesis, a systematic study of the
   domains within human and murine HIP/L29 responsible for Hp/HS binding
   activity was undertaken. Using deletion mutants, proteolytic fragments,
   and protease protection of HIP/L29 by Hp, we demonstrate that multiple
   binding domains contribute to the overall Hp/HS binding activity of
   HIP/L29 proteins. Furthermore, a conformational change is induced in
   human HIP/L29 upon I-Ip binding as detected by circular dichroism
   spectroscopy. These studies demonstrate the multiplicity of Hp/HS
   binding sequences within human and murine HIP/L29.}},

Abstract = {{CRAMPS NMR of H-1 was used for the structural analysis of some natural
   silk fibroins such as Tussah Antheraea pernyi and Bombyx mori in the
   solid state. We were able to resolve all expected H-1 NMR resonances.
   When tied to the resolution of C-13 NMR via 2D H-1-C-13 HETCOR
   experiments, overlapping proton resonance under CRAMPS are able to be
   further resolved. The simplified H-1 signals of these natural proteins
   could be successfully assigned on the basis of the
   conformation-dependent H-1 chemical shifts of model polypeptides. The
   H-1 chemical shift of the H-alpha signals of Tussah A. pernyi fibroin
   adopting an alpha -helix conformation (4.0 ppm) agrees with that of
   alpha -helical poly(L-alanine) (3.9 ppm) to within +/-0.1 ppm. A
   well-defined poly(L-alanylglycine), {[}Ala-Gly](12), was used as a model
   polypeptide of B. mori silk fibroin. The H-1 CRAMPS spectra of B. mori
   fibroins adopting the silk I or silk II form were similar to those of
   {[}Ala-Gly](12) adopting a corresponding conformation. The H-alpha
   chemical shifts of the silk I fibroin were 3.9 ppm (singletlike) whereas
   those of the silk II fibroin exhibited peaks at 5.0 and 3.9 ppm.
   Further, we found that the H-1 chemical shift of side chains in silk I
   was downfield by 0.4 ppm compared with that in silk II. Thus, it is
   possible to assign the H-1 CRAMPS NMR spectra of natural proteins such
   as silk fibroins using model polypeptides of known structure as
   references.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes the development of thin film optical sensors for pH,
   metal ions (ferric and mercury), and 2,4-dinitrotoluene detection. To
   fabricate the pH sensor, a fluorescent molecule,
   1-hydroxypyren-3,6,8-trisulfonate, was assembled with a polycation by an
   electrostatic layer-by-layer assembly technique. The fluorescent
   indicator molecule exhibits distinct and well-defined emission peaks for
   protonated and deprotonated forms. The relative peak positions and
   intensity of fluorescence of the protonated and deprotonated forms
   change in response to pH variations. For metal ion (ferric and mercury)
   and 2,4-dinitrotoluene sensing, the indicator molecules were covalently
   incorporated into poly(acrylic acid) and subsequently assembled with a
   polycation employing electrostatic layer-by-layer assembly. The sensor
   is based on the fluorescence quenching of indicator molecules by
   electron transfer from indicator to electron-deficient analytes such as
   ferric ions, mercury, and 2,4-dinitrotoluene. Fluorescence intensities
   decreased with increasing concentration of analytes, Quenching behavior
   follows Stern-Volmer bimolecular quenching kinetics. Linear increase in
   absorbance, film thickness, and emission intensity was observed as a
   function of number of bilayers deposited in all these films.}},

Abstract = {{The binding of SDS to pluronic F127 was studied using a SDS surfactant;
   selective electrode via electromotive force, isothermal titration
   calorimetry, and light scattering. Ata concentration of 0.5\% w/v the
   block copolymer F127 exists as an equilibrium mixture of micelles and
   monomers at 35 degreesC. When SDS is gradually added to this solution,
   binding of SDS to the F127 micelles takes place even at the lowest;
   measured SDS concentration (1 x 10(-5) mol dm(-3)). Initially F127/SDS
   mixed micelles are formed and the size of these micelles remains
   constant until similar to5 x 10(-5) mol dm(-3) of SDS has been reached.
   At a total SDS concentration of 5 x 10(-5) mol dm(-3) there are similar
   to6 SDS monomers in an aggregate containing 69 F127 monomers. Further
   addition of SDS results in a dramatic breakdown of the F127 rich mixed
   micelles into smaller aggregates. During this process SDS continually
   binds to the F127 micelles forming mixed micelles which simultaneously
   break down to smaller aggregates and also become richer in SDS. This
   process continues until the monomer SDS concentration reaches a value of
   3.5 x 10(-4) mol dm(-3) which is the thermodynamic condition for the
   onset of the binding of SDS micelles on unassociated F127 oligomers.
   This occurs until the total SDS concentration reaches 1 x 10(-3) mol
   dm(-3) which precedes the point where all the F127/SDS mixed aggregates
   are broken down (3 x 10(-3) mol dm(-3)). Therefore in the SDS
   concentration region I x 10-3 to 3 x 10-3 mol dm-3 two simultaneous
   binding processes take place (1) SDS forms mixed micelles with F127 and
   these micelles break down to smaller aggregates, and (2) SDS micelles
   bind to unassociated F127 oligomers. Further addition of SDS in excess
   of 3 x 10-3 mol dm(-3) results in the formation of more and larger SDS
   micelles bound to individual F127 monomers until all the unassociated
   F127 oligomers available for binding become fully saturated with bound
   SDS micelles at similar to0.1 mol dm(-3) added SDS. At this limiting
   point the complexes contain, on average, one SDS micelle per F127
   monomer. No F127 aggregates appear to exist when the SDS concentration
   reaches or exceeds 3 x 10(-3) mol dm(-3).}},

   domains separated by a single ligand-binding repeat. The second CUB
   domain is followed by a cluster of three additional ligand-binding
   repeats and a transmembrane domain. The COOH-terminal intracellular
   region contains a proline-rich region. LRP9 mRNA was expressed in the
   liver, kidney, lung, and heart at high levels, and in the spleen and
   brain at low levels. In situ hybridization analysis of mouse liver,
   kidney, and brain detected LRP9 transcripts in hepatocytes, sinusoidal
   lining cells, peritubular capillaries, choroid plexus, ependyma of the
   third ventricle, pia matter, and hippocampus. In particular, high levels
   of expression were observed in the vascular walls. Apolipoprotein E
   (apoE)-enriched beta -VLDL stimulated cellular cholesteryl ester
   formation in ldl-A7/LRP9. These results raise the possibility that this
   newly identified receptor, which is expressed in the liver, may play a
   physiological role in the uptake of apoE-containing lipoproteins.}},

Abstract = {{It has recently been established experimentally that the supramolecular
   assemblies formed by a particular class of chiral discotic molecules in
   solution exhibit a helical transition. To rationalize the experimental
   data, we apply the standard theory of linear self-assembly modified by a
   simple two-state model for the molecules in the aggregates, based on the
   Zimm-Bragg theory for the helical transition in conventional polymers.
   The theory provides a description of the amount of material in
   aggregates as well as their mean size and state of helicity as a
   function of the concentration of dissolved material, two binding
   strengths, and a parameter measuring the cooperativity of the helical
   transition. By fitting to the experimental data, all the model
   parameters are determined. It emerges that the helical transition is
   highly cooperative and that the growth spurt the aggregates exhibit at
   low temperatures is largely due to coupling of the self-assembly to the
   helical transition.}},

   The variation of the second-harmonic light intensity generated by guided

Abstract = {{Direct formation of isobutene from n-butane was investigated over
   zeolite TON and gamma -Al2O3 supported platinum and platinum-copper
   catalysts. Addition of Cu decreases Pt dispersion, irrespective of
   preparation methods and nature of catalyst supports. The presence of
   potassium was found to reduce acidity and Pt dispersion. The experiments
   were performed in a fixed-bed microreactor system operating at 673 K and
   atmospheric pressure. Changing the support from gamma -Al2O3 to TON,
   shows that n-butane conversion is almost independent of acidity.
   However, significant changes in products selectivities are observed. The
   selectivities to isobutene, C-1-C-3 fractions, and aromatics increases
   drastically from 3.5 to 32.6\%, 20.3 to 27.2\%, and 3.0 to 20.6\%,
   respectively, for the TON-supported catalyst whereas dehydrogenation is
   largely predominant when gamma -Al2O3 is used as support. Addition of
   Cu, as expected, has an adverse effect on n-butane conversion as less
   active sites are available due to the reduction in Pt dispersion. Though
   Cu addition has marginal effect on isobutene selectivity, it certainly
   suppresses hydrogenolysis which evidences a reduction in size of the Pt
   ensembles at the surface of the Pt particles. (C) 2000 Published by

   Neurosci. 12:776-780). The present study investigates the effects of
   intrathecally delivered NT-3 and BDNF on the survival and atrophy of
   ascending spinocerebellar neurons of Clarke nucleus (CN) after cervical
   spinal cord injury in adult rats. At 8 weeks after cervical spinal cord
   hemisection, 40\% of the axotomized CN neurons had been lost, and the
   remaining cells exhibited marked atrophy. Microglial activity was
   significantly increased in CN of the operated side. Intrathecal infusion
   of NT-3 for 8 weeks postoperatively resulted in 91\% cell survival and a
   reduction in cell atrophy, but did not reduce microglial activity. In
   spite of the fact that the CN neurons expressed both TrkC and TrkB
   receptors, only NT-3 had a neuroprotective effect, whereas BDNF was
   ineffective. Furthermore, when a combination of BDNF and NT-3 was
   administered, the neuroprotective effect of NT-3 was lost. The present
   results indicate a therapeutic potential for NT-3 in the treatment of
   spinal cord injury, but also demonstrate that in certain neuronal
   populations the neuroprotection obtained by a combination of
   neurotrophic factors may be less than that of a single neurotrophin. J.

Abstract = {{The history of Ankara's urban parks goes back to the early days of the
   Turkish Republic. Some of the present large parks originate from parks
   established as part of the reconstruction works following the
   declaration of Ankara as the capital city of the newly founded Republic
   (1920s). User surveys are important sources of data to aid the planning,
   design and management processes of urban parks. This paper focuses on
   three parks in Ankara for survey and evaluation purposes. To analyse the
   use of the parks, a literature survey and a questionnaire survey were
   carried out together. The former describes the distributional structure
   of the parks whereas the latter makes assessments by exploring the
   characteristics of park users, user satisfaction, reported problems and
   requirements. The findings suggest that the use of each park has its own
   characteristics although there appear some similarities within some of
   the studied use areas. As a result, recommendations for future planning
   are suggested. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis of a series of Re-I, Ru-II, and Os-II complexes that
   contain rigid polyphosphine/eumulene spacers is reported here. These
   cumulenic Ligands, namely, 1,1 ` ,3,3 `
   -tetrakis(diphenylphosphino)allene (C3P4) and 1,1 ` ,4,4 `
   -tetrakis(diphenylphosphino)cumulene (C4P4), utilize diphenylphosphino
   linkage components to coordinate to the metal-polypyridyl or
   metal-carbonyl units. Characterization of all mono-, homo-, and
   heterobimetallic complexes is achieved using P-31\{H-1\} NMR, IR, and
   fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy (FAB/MS) and elemental analysis.
   The two Re-I homobimetallic complexes were also characterized by
   single-crystal X-ray structure determination, which provided the
   structural evidence of a 90 degrees rotation between the C-3 and C-4
   adducts causing a change in the electrochemical behavior. The
   ground-state electronic absorption and redox interactions, along with
   the excited-state photophysical characteristics, are also explored.
   Electrochemical studies showed that an increase in the carbon chain
   length resulted in a greater amount of a-donation from the ligand to the
   metal centers, as well as a greater amount of electronic communication
   between the metal termini of the bimetallic species. The electronic
   absorption and emission spectra of the new complexes were also
   determined and characterized. The lifetimes of the excited-state
   luminescence of the Re-I mono- and homobimetallic complexes were found
   to be an order of magnitude shorter than the lifetimes of the
   heterobimetallic complexes containing the Ru-II and Os-II moieties.
   Excited-state energy transfer was observed from the higher MLCT excited
   state of the Re-I centers to the lower energy MLCT excited state of the
   Ru-II and Os-II centers on the following basis: no Re-I-based emission
   was detected in the steady-state emission measurements, the
   time-resolved decay traces were fitted to only single-exponential
   decays, and the quantum yields were identical for each compound at two
   different excitation wavelengths when different percentages of the
   metal-based chromophores were excited.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical and computational aspects of the self-induced motion of
   closed and periodic three-dimensional vortex sheets situated at the
   interfaces between two inviscid fluids with generally different
   densities in the presence of surface tension are considered. In the
   mathematical formulation, the vortex sheet is described by a continuous
   distribution of marker points that move with the velocity of the fluid
   normal to the vortex sheet while executing an arbitrary tangential
   motion. Evolution equations for the vectorial jump in the velocity
   across the vortex sheet, the vectorial strength of the vortex sheet, and
   the scalar circulation field or strength of the effective dipole held
   following the marker points are derived. The computation of the
   self-induced motion of the vortex sheet requires the accurate evaluation
   of the strongly singular Biot-Savart integral whose existence requires
   that the normal vector Varies in a continuous fashion over the vortex
   sheet. Two methods of computing the principal value of the Biot-Savart
   integral are implemented. The first method involves computing the vector
   potential and the principal value of the harmonic potential over the
   vortex sheet, and then differentiating them in tangential directions to
   produce the normal or tangential component of the velocity, in the
   spirit of generalized vortex methods developed by Baker (1983). The
   second method involves subtracting off the dominant singularity of the
   Biot-Savart kernel and then accounting for its contribution by use of
   vector identities. Evaluating the strongly singular Biot-Savart integral
   is thus reduced to computing a weakly singular integral involving the
   mean curvature of the vortex sheet, and this allows the routine
   discretization of the vortex sheet into curved elements whose normal
   vector is not necessarily continuous across the edges, and the
   computation of the self-induced velocity without kernel
   desingularization. Numerical simulations of the motion of a closed or
   periodic vortex sheet immersed in a homogeneous fluid confirm the
   effectiveness of the numerical methods for a limited time of evolution.
   Numerical instabilities arise after a certain evolution time due to the
   ill-posedness of vortex sheet dynamics. The motion may be regularized by
   desingularizing the Biot-Savart kernel using either Krasny's (1986b)
   method or spectrum truncation. Depending, however, on the physical
   mechanism that drives the motion, the instabilities may persevere.}},

Abstract = {{Thrombin acts as a procoagulant when it cleaves fibrinogen and promotes

   The dual function of thrombin in the blood poses the challenge to turn
   the enzyme into a potent anticoagulant by selectively abrogating
   fibrinogen cleavage. Using functional and structural data, we have
   rationally designed a thrombin mutant, W215A/E217A, that cleaves
   fibrinogen with a value of k(cat)/K-m about 20,000-fold slower than
   wild-type but activates protein C in the presence of thrombomodulin with
   a specificity comparable with wild-type. This mutant demonstrates for
   the first time that the relative specificity of thrombin toward
   fibrinogen and protein C can be completely reversed.}},

Abstract = {{The present study utilizes in situ molecular hybridization and
   immunocytochemistry to investigate the follicular localization and
   expression of four thematically related sterol-metabolizing genes;
   low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, steroidogenic acute regulatory
   protein (StAR), cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage (CYP11A) enzyme, and
   cytochrome P450 17 alpha -hydroxylase/C17-20 lyase (CYP17). To this end,
   semiquantitative analyses were applied to individual nonatretic
   follicles (N = 54) harvested from cycling gilts slaughtered on days 1,
   3, 5, and 7 (N = 3 per day) following withdrawal of the progesterone
   agonist, altrenogest. In situ and immunocytochemical signal intensities
   were assigned numerical values of 0-3 corresponding to the degree of
   expression of each mRNA and its corresponding protein. LDL receptor mRNA
   and protein content was undectable in theca and granulosa cells on days
   1, 3, and 5, acid then increased to low levels in theca cells on day 7.
   StAR message rose progressively in theca cells with follicular
   maturation, reaching a maximum on day 5, and then declining slightly on
   day 7 after the LH surge. In granulosa cells, small amounts of StAR mRNA
   and protein were detected on days 5 and 7. The amounts of CYP11A mRNA
   and protein were high in theca cells, and increased at each time point
   studied. Granulosa cells exhibited minimal CYP11A message on days 3, 5,
   and 7, while protein became detectable at low levels on day 7 only.
   Expression of CYP17 was localized exclusively in theca cells with
   protein and message content increasing unidirectionally to maxima on
   days 5 (RNA) and 7 (protein), respectively. Follicular fluid
   concentrations of androstenedione, and progesterone in contralateral
   ovaries correlated strongly and positively with accumulation of CYP17,
   and CYP11A proteins. In summary, these analyses demonstrate that
   preovulatory follicular development proceeds with the coordinate
   induction of pivotal genes and proteins that mediate the selective
   uptake, delivery and utilization of sterol substrate in granulosa and
   theca-cell steroidogenesis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Mesangial cells (MC) grown on extracellular matrix protein-coated plates
   and exposed to cyclic strain/relaxation proliferate and produce
   extracellular matrix protein, providing an in vitro model of signaling
   in stretched MC, Intracellular transduction of mechanical strain
   involves mitogen-activated protein kinases, and we have shown that
   p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (extracellular signal-regulated
   kinase (ERK)) is activated by cyclic strain in MC,ln vivo studies show
   that increased production of nitric oxide (NO) in the remnant kidney
   limits glomerular injury without reducing glomerular capillary pressure,
   and we have observed that NO attenuates stretch-induced ERK activity in
   MC via generation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), Accordingly,
   we sought to determine whether NO affects strain-induced ERK activity
   after strain and how this is mediated. Strain-induced ERK activity was
   dependent on time and magnitude of stretch and was maximal after 10 min
   at -27 kilopascals, Actin cytoskeleton disruption with cytochalasin D
   abrogated this. The non-metabolizable cGMP analogue 8-bromo cyclic GMP
   (8-Br-cGMP) dose-dependently attenuated strain-induced ERK activity.
   Cytoskeletal stabilization with jas-plakinolide prevented this
   inhibitory effect of 8-Br-cGMP, Cyclic strain increased nuclear
   translocation of phospho-ERK by immunofluorescent microscopy, again
   attenuated by 8-Br-cGMP. Jasplakinolide prevented the inhibitory effect
   of 8-Br-cGMP on activated ERK nuclear translocation after strain. Strain
   increased ERK-dependent AP-1 nuclear protein binding, which was
   attenuated by cytochalasin D and 8-Br-cGMP, These data indicate that
   cGMP can inhibit cyclic strain-induced ERK activity, nuclear
   translocation, and AP-1 nuclear protein binding. Cytoskeletal disruption
   leads to the same effect, whereas cytoskeleton stabilization reverses
   the effect of 8-Br-cGMP, Thus, NO inhibits strain-induced ERK activity
   by cytoskeletal destabilization.}},

Abstract = {{We previously reported that c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase
   (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase-associated protein 1 (JSAP1)
   functions as a putative scaffold factor in the JNK mitogen-activated
   protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. In that study we also found MEK1 and
   Raf-1, which are involved in the extracellular signal-regulated kinase
   (ERK) MAPK cascades, bind to JSAP1. Here we have defined the regions of
   JSAP1 responsible for the interactions with MEK1 and Raf-1. Both of the
   binding regions were mapped to the COOH-terminal region (residues
   1054-1305) of JSAP1. We next examined the effect of overexpressing JSAP1
   on the activation of ERK by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in
   transfected COS-7 cells and found that JSAP1 inhibits ERK's activation
   and that the COOH-terminal region of JSAP1 was required for the
   inhibition. Finally, we investigated the molecular mechanism of JSAP1's
   inhibitory function and showed that JSAP1 prevents MEK1 phosphorylation
   and activation by Raf-1, resulting in the suppression of the activation
   of ERK. Taken together, these results suggest that JSAP1 is involved
   both in the JNK cascades, as a scaffolding factor, and the ERK cascades,
   as a suppressor.}},

Abstract = {{In the chemical and petrochemical industries, Pt-based catalysts are
   very sensitive to sulfur poisoning. Synchrotron-based high-resolution
   photoemission, thermal desorption mass spectroscopy (TDS), and
   first-principles density-functional slab calculations were used to study
   the adsorption of sulfur on Pt(111) and a p(2x2)-Sn/Pt(111) surface
   alloy. Our results show important variations in the nature of the
   bonding of sulfur to Pt(111) depending on the coverage of the adsorbate.
   For small coverages, theta (S)<0.3 ML, atomic sulfur is the most stable
   species. The adsorbate is bonded to hollow sites, has a large adsorption
   energy (> 75 kcal/mol), and desorbs as S. The Pt-S bonds are mainly
   covalent but sulfur induces a significant decrease in the density of Pt
   5d states near the Fermi level. When the sulfur coverage increases on
   the surface, theta (S)>0.4 ML, there is a substantial weakening in the
   Pt <---->S interactions with a change in the adsorption site and a
   tendency to form S-S bonds. Desorption of S-2 is now observed in TDS and
   the S2p core levels shift to higher binding energy. At coverages near a
   full monolayer, S-2 is the most stable species on the surface and its
   adsorption energy is similar to 45 kcal/mol. Similar trends are observed
   for the adsorption of sulfur on a p(2x2)-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy, but
   the adsorbate <----> substrate interactions are weaker than on Pt(111).
   The formation of Pt-Sn bonds reduces the reactivity of Pt toward sulfur.
   Electronic effects associated with bimetallic bonding can be useful for
   controlling or preventing sulfur poisoning. (C) 2000 American Institute

   the minimum number of water required to stabilize a free SO42- is three.
   The first four waters bind tightly to SO42-, each forming two H-bonds
   with SO42- without inter-water H-bonding. The charges of the dianion are
   stabilized sufficiently that additional waters form only single H-bonds
   with SO42- and that inter-water H-bonding is observed starting at n=5.

   evaporated onto buffed PMDA-ODA polyimide alignment layers and onto
   highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. The tensor nematic order parameter
   was derived from the x-ray dichroism as a function of layer thickness
   and thermal history. The liquid crystal orientation on buffed polyimide
   is markedly different from that observed on graphite. While on graphite
   the aromatic rings are oriented parallel to the substrate, there is-on
   average-a cylindrical symmetry around the molecular main axes for the
   orientational distribution function of 8CB on polyimide. The main axes
   are oriented parallel to the substrate in both cases. A brief heat
   treatment induces desorption of most of the LC material, leaving only
   the most tightly bound molecules behind. On graphite the remaining 8CB
   layer is highly oriented, whereas annealing does not significantly
   change the orientational parameters on polyimide. LC films adsorbed on

Abstract = {{Primary cultures of uterine smooth muscle cells from post-partum rats
   express interstitial collagenase in response to serotonin and the
   serotonin-dependent production of interleukin-1 (IL-1) {[}Wilcox, B.D.,
   Dumin, J.A. and Jeffrey, J.J. Serotonin regulation of interleukin-1
   messenger RNA in rat uterine smooth muscle cells. Relationship to the
   production of interstitial collagenase J. Biol. Chem., 269, (1994a),
   29658]. Transient transfections of these cells indicate that rat
   collagenase transcription is regulated via a proximal consensus AP-1
   site within an extended palindrome. Mutation of either the AP-1 site or
   extended palindrome (EP) decreases promoter activity to approximately
   30\% of the wild-type. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays reveal the
   binding of smooth muscle cell nuclear proteins to the AP-1 EP. This
   binding is barely detectable after mutation of the EP and is completely
   eliminated by mutation of the AP-1 heptamer. Competition experiments
   demonstrate that binding to the AP-1 EP is specific and of higher
   affinity than binding to oligonucleotides containing a mutated EP.
   Binding to the AP-1 EP is higher when smooth muscle cells are cultured
   in the presence of serotonin than in its absence. Although IL-1 is
   required for collagenase transcription, binding to the AP-1 EP appears
   to be IL-1-independent, FosB, Fra-2, c-Jun, JunB and, most abundantly,
   JunD bind the AP-1 EP in the absence and presence of serotonin. In
   contrast, Fra-1 expression and binding are serotonin-dependent
   suggesting that the activation of Fra-1 may be a key component of
   collagenase transcriptional activation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells contributes to the development of
   cardiomyopathy. Recent studies showed that insulin-like growth factor I
   (IGF-I) inhibits apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells and improves
   myocardial function in experimental heart failure. This study was
   carried out to elucidate the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI
   3-kinase) in the anti-apoptotic actions of IGF-I in cardiomyocytes and
   to explore whether expression of constitutively active PI 3-kinase can
   inhibit apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. Apoptosis of primary cardiomyocytes
   was induced by doxorubicin treatment and serum withdrawal. Transduction
   of cardiomyocytes with constitutively active PI 3-kinase specifically
   lead to serine phosphorylation of Akt, whereas phosphorylation of IGF-I
   receptor, IRS1/2 and p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase were not
   increased. In the cardiomyocytes transduced with constitutively active
   PI 3-kinase, activation of the pro-apoptotic caspase 3 was attenuated
   and fragmentation of DNA was reduced. Preincubating cells with PI
   3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 was associated with loss of anti-apoptotic
   actions of IGF-I and PI S-kinase. Neither IGF-I nor constitutively
   active PI 3-kinase lead to serine phosphorylation of Bad, suggesting
   that the anti-apoptotic effects of PI 3-kinase are not mediated through
   Bad phosphorylation in cardiac muscle cells. To determine whether
   activation of caspase 3 is sufficient to induce apoptosis in
   cardiomyocytes, an engineered TAT-caspase 3 protein was introduced to
   cardiomyocytes. Significant reduction of cell viability occurred in the
   cardiomyocytes transduced with active caspase 3, indicating that
   activation of caspase 3 is sufficient to cause cardiomyocyte death.
   These findings indicate the existence of an IGF-I receptor-PI
   3-kinase-caspase 3 pathway in cardiomyocytes that plays an important
   role in the anti-apoptotic actions of IGF-I in heart. Moreover, these
   data suggest that modulation of PI 3-kinase activities may represent a
   potential therapeutic strategy to counteract the occurrence of apoptosis
   in cardiomyopathy.}},

Abstract = {{Troglitazone, a thiazolidinedione derivative, is an oral antidiabetic
   agent that enhances insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant states.
   K-ATP channels, on the other hand, have important roles protecting
   cardiovascular system in ischemic and for hypoxic states. They are also
   important in the control of vascular tone, and therefore of blood
   pressure. We tested whether troglitazone can directly affect vascular
   K-ATP channel opener-induced relaxations in vitro. 1, 10 or 100 muM
   troglitazone incubations for 30 min did not alter cromakalim (a K-ATP
   channel opener) - induced relaxations in endothelium-denuded aortas from
   rat, saphenous veins from type 2 diabetic and nondiabetic patients. In
   addition, we compared the sensitivity to cromakalim in diabetic
   saphenous veins with that of nondiabetic veins. The
   concentration-response curve for cromakalim was shifted to the right in
   diabetic vein, pD(2) values for cromakalim were 6.85 +/- 0.08 vs. 6.61
   +/- 0.04 (p<0.05) in nondiabetic (n:10) and diabetic (n:7) veins
   respectively. \% maximum response of cromakalim was also significantly
   decreased by 24 +/- 3\% in diabetic veins. However, responsiveness of
   veins to phenylephrine or sodium nitroprusside were similar in both
   groups. The results obtained may be clinically useful 1. suggesting that
   in ischaemic and I or hypoxic insults troglitazone may not worsen
   vascular dilatation, through K-ATP channel, in diabetic patients who are
   more prone to these conditions than healthy people, 2, providing an
   evidence that diabetes causes an impaired dilatation of human saphenous
   vein through K-ATP channels. This may partly be related with
   diabetes-induced vascular complications, such as vasospasm and even
   hypertension. Accordingly, since saphenous veins are used as conduit
   vessels in coronary by-pass graft surgery, the results also suggest that
   the defective dilatation through K-ATP channels may pray a role on the
   performance of saphenous vein grafts in type 2 diabetes. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Objectives: To evaluate plasma population pharmacokinetics and
   penetration into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by indinavir (IDV) in
   HIV-infected individuals receiving IDV, zidovudine and lamivudine.
   Methods: Plasma population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed on 805
   IDV plasma Values from 171 patients, using a non-linear mixed-effects
   modeling approach. CSF data from 19 patients were analyzed using an
   individual approach.
   Results: Mean individual Bayesian estimates for oral clearance (CL) and
   volume of distribution (V) by the final model that incorporated
   interoccasion variability were 0.75 I/h per kg {[}coefficient of
   variation (CV) 54.8\%]: and 1.74 I/kg (CV 82.7\%), respectively. Mean
   model-predicted plasma IDV level at 8 h, maximal level, area under the
   plasma level-time curve up to 8 h and plasma half-life were 0.42 mu
   mol/l (CV 57.5\%), 9.51 mu mol/l (CV 47.3\%), 29.56 mu mol/l.h (CV
   46.9\%) and 1.50 h (CV 20.9\%), respectively. The mean IDV CSF level was
   0.11 mu mol/l (CV 49.7\%) and the mean CSF plasma concentration ratio
   was 0.017.
   Conclusions: Population estimates of pharmacokinetic parameters of IDV
   and its CSF penetration were in excellent agreement with previously
   reported data from individual analyses. Intraindividual interoccasion
   variability of IDV pharmacokinetics was estimated to be of similar order
   of magnitude to its interindividual variability, which may affect
   response to long-term antiretroviral therapy involving IDV. CSF levers
   of IDV exceeded its in vitro 95\% inhibitory concentration of HIV
   replication. Given that CSF is virtually free of protein, viral
   suppression in the central nervous system should be achievable with an
   IDV-containing regimen. (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.}},

Abstract = {{The theoretical quantitative analysis of the temperature dependence and
   enthalpic effects of ion adsorption, developed in our earlier
   publications, was applied here to study the features of
   hematite/electrolyte interfaces. This is the first time that our set of
   experimental data could be used to carry out a simultaneous analysis of
   both the temperature dependence of the titration isotherm and directly
   measured enthalpic effects. To draw possible general conclusions about
   the features of the hematite/electrolyte interfaces, we considered two
   sets of experimental data measured in two laboratories, using the
   hematite samples prepared in different ways. The differences in sample
   preparations are manifested by substantially different values of the
   monitored surface charges and related calorimetric effects. The present
   quantitative analysis in Part I or this publication was carried out by
   using the model of an energetically homogeneous solid surface, which is
   still commonly accepted. Certain inconsistencies were found in the
   parameter values leading to a good fit of titration isotherms and those
   that are best to fit directly measured enthalpic effects. Thus, the
   general conclusion was drawn that this popular model is too crude for a
   quantitative analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Symbiotic stars are binary systems consisting of a hot star, typically a
   white dwarf, and a cool giant companion. The wind from the cool star is
   ionized by the radiation from the hot star, resulting in the
   characteristic combination of sharp nebular emission lines and stellar
   molecular absorption bands in the optical spectrum. Most of the emission
   lines are readily identifiable with common ions. However, two strong,
   broad emission lines at 6825 and 7082 Angstrom defied identification
   with known atoms and ions. In 1989 Schmid made the case that these long
   unidentified emission lines resulted from the Raman scattering of the O
   VI resonance photons at 1032, 1038 Angstrom by neutral hydrogen.
   We present contemporaneous far-UV and optical observations of direct and
   Raman-scattered O VI lines for nine symbiotic stars obtained with the
   Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope (Astro-2) and various ground-based optical
   telescopes. The O VI emission lines are present in every instance in
   which the lambda lambda 6825, 7082 lines are present, in support of the
   Schmid Raman-scattering model. We calculate the scattering efficiencies
   and discuss the results in terms of the Raman-scattering model.
   Additionally, we measure the flux of the Fe II fluorescence line at 1776
   Angstrom which is excited by the O VI line at 1032 Angstrom and
   calculate the first estimates of the conversion efficiencies for this
   process.}},

Title = {{Anticipating high-resolution STIS spectra of four multiphase MgII
   absorbers: A test of photoionization models}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{545}},
Number = {{2, 1}},
Pages = {{635-656}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a test of the validity of a photoionization
   modeling technique that is applicable when a combination of high- and
   low-resolution spectra are available for various chemical transitions.
   We apply this technique to the four Mg II systems along the line of
   sight toward the z(em) = 1.335 quasar PG 1634+706 to infer the physical
   conditions in the multiple phases of their absorbing gas. We apply
   constraints from (1) High Resolution Spectrograph (HIRES/Keck I)
   profiles (R = 45,000 and FWHM = 6.6 km s(-1)) of low-ionization species
   Mg II and Fe II and (2) a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) archival,
   low-resolution Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS) spectrum (FWHM = 230 km
   s(-1)) covering Ly alpha, Ly beta, Si II, Si III, Si IV, C II, C III, C
   IV, and N V. For this bright quasar, very high signal-to-noise ratio
   (S/N) Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) spectra at high
   resolution (FWHM = 10 km s(-1)) were recently obtained (1999 May and
   June), covering 1850-3100 Angstrom. However, at the time of this
   writing, these data are still proprietary in the HST archive, and we
   deliberately present this paper without knowledge of the spectra. Since,
   in the near term, it is only plausible to obtain high-resolution UV
   spectra for a handful of the brightest quasars, it is important to
   determine, without any ``after the fact{''} biases, what can be learned
   from low-resolution FOS data. Photoionization models of the four Mg II
   systems are constrained by the existing FOS and HIRES absorption
   profiles. In general, it is possible to constrain the low-ionization Mg
   II phase and to infer the presence of an additional high-ionization
   phase, but not to infer the detailed properties of the latter. Using
   some examples of consistent models, we simulate STIS high-resolution
   profiles of the key transitions that will be covered by the new
   observations, at the expected S/N. This study will serve as a fair test
   of the applicability of the photoionization modeling of a combination of
   low- and high-resolution profiles and also as an unbiased guide for
   extracting the detailed gaseous conditions from the forthcoming,
   high-resolution STIS observations.
   We find that the four Mg II absorbers along the PG 1634+706 line of
   sight exhibit a variety of Mg II kinematic structures and higher
   ionization phases. The z = 0.8182 system is a single-cloud, weak Mg II
   absorber without detected C IV in the FOS spectrum {[}W-r(C IV) < 0.07
   <Angstrom> at 3 sigma]. The new STIS observations could detect C IV to a
   higher sensitivity and distinguish between a broad C IV phase and C IV
   associated with the narrow Mg II cloud. In contrast, the z = 0.9056
   absorber is a weak, single-cloud system with strong C IV absorption in
   the FOS spectrum; we infer that it must have supersolar metallicity,
   depletion of Fe relative to Mg, or an alpha -group-enhanced abundance
   pattern. In this system, three phases were required to match the FOS
   profiles : the narrow b similar to 3 km s(-1) Mg II cloud phase, a
   broader b similar to 20 km s(-1) phase required to produce the observed
   C IV, and an effective b similar to 400 km s(-1) phase needed to Dt the
   wings of the Ly alpha line. The z = 0.9902 system is a strong Mg II
   absorber with five blended components; it has a relatively low
   metallicity, Z < -1, constrained by a strong Lyman limit break; and it
   also requires a broad b <similar to> 40 km s(-1) phase to fit the
   observed C IV. The z = 1.0414 system has four, very weak, blended Mg II
   clouds and is most unusual in that two components of C IV absorption are
   apparent, even in the low-resolution FOS spectrum. The redward component
   is centered on the Mg II, but the stronger component is similar to 200
   km s(-1) to the blue of the Mg II clouds and thus requires an offset,
   broad, high-ionization phase.}},

Abstract = {{A series of experiments was performed in an aerobic chemostat reactor
   using a multi-substrate system consisting of acetate, phenol, and
   2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP). The phenolic compounds require initial
   oxygenation reactions, while acetate is oxidized without oxygenations.
   The biomass completely dechlorinated DCP and utilized all of the
   substrates simultaneously as electron donors and carbon sources.
   However, DCP removal was less than for phenol and depended on the solids
   retention time. A novel substrate-specific yield analysis indicated that
   true yield values were approximated well by the number of electrons
   removed in non-oxygenation reactions. Experiments for estimating the
   kinetic parameters for utilization of the phenolic compounds were
   designed to eliminate the effects of the key cosubstrates of oxygenation
   reactions, O-2 and the reduced intracellular electron carrier, NADH +
   H+. The maximum specific rate of substrate utilization, q(max), and the
   half-maximum rate concentration, K,for phenol and DCP were estimated.
   The kinetics for DCP were much slower than those for phenol, and the
   largest effect was a half-maximum rate concentration, which was 19 times
   larger for DCP. The larger K for DCP explains why DCP removal was low
   and sensitive to the solids retention time. (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Mabs H36 (IgG2a) and H37 (IgG3) recognize epitopes in antigenic sites Sb
   and Ca2, respectively, in the HA1 subunit of influenza virus A/PR/8/34
   (H1N1). Their neutralization was complex. Our aim here was to
   investigate the mechanism of neutralization by the IgGs and their Fabs.
   In MDCK and BHK cells, both IgGs neutralized primarily by inhibiting
   virus-cell fusion, although at higher IgG concentrations virus
   attachment to target cells was also inhibited. In contrast, the Fabs
   neutralized entirely by inhibiting virus attachment, although a higher
   concentration of Fab than IgG was required to bring this about. Both H36
   and H37 exerted a concentration-dependent spectrum of neutralization
   activity, with virus-cell fusion inhibition and virus-cell attachment
   inhibition being the predominant mechanisms at low- and high-antibody
   concentration, respectively, and both mechanisms occurring
   simultaneously at intermediate concentrations. However, it may be that
   attachment inhibition was a secondary event, occurring to virus that had
   already been neutralized through inhibition of its fusion activity.
   Neutralization by H36 and H37 Fabs was a simple process. Both inhibited
   virus attachment but required much higher (>100-fold) molar
   concentrations for activity than did IgG. The functional affinities of
   the IgGs were high (0.4-0.6 nM) and differences between these and the
   affinity of their Fabs (H36, nit; H37, 23-fold) were not sufficient to
   explain the differences observed in neutralization. Similar
   neutralization data were obtained in two different cell lines. The
   dose-response curve for neutralization by H36 F(ab')(2) resembled that
   for IgG, although eightfold more F(ab')(2) was required for 50\%
   neutralization. Overall, neutralization mechanisms of H36 and H37
   antibodies were similar, and thus independent of antigenic site,
   antibody isotype, and target cell. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Protein transduction can be described as the direct uptake by the cell
   of exogenous proteins;peptides or protein/peptide:chemical complexes, as
   a result of a specific property of the protein/peptide component. In
   this review, the three most widely studied protein transducing
   activities are described, with particular emphasis on the TAT protein
   transduction domain. Current progress in protein transduction technology
   suggests the potential development of a variety of molecular and cell
   biology tools that will enable researchers to by-pass conventional
   genetic routes for modulating the cells' biological activity, thus
   negating many of the problems associated with genetic intervention. The
   potential application of this class of molecule in the development of
   tools for the study of senescent populations is discussed. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{We herein report two new genes, human neugrin and mouse homologue
   m-neugrin, found by screening the cDNA library for the human spinal
   cord. The neugrin mRNA encodes 219 amino acids and its deduced amino
   acid sequence contains an NLS-like domain. No previously known motif is
   found in it. m-neugrin mRNA encodes 233 amino acids. Neugrin and
   m-Neugrin are 70\% homologous in amino acid sequence. Northern analysis
   revealed that neugrin was strongly expressed in the heart, brain, and
   skeletal muscle, and m-neugrin in the liver, kidney, and brain. A
   transfection study indicated that these proteins are localized in the
   nucleus. Although the expression of neugrin was found to be ubiquitous
   in the nervous system, in situ hybridization showed that both neugrin
   and m-neugrin were expressed mainly in the neurons rather than the glial
   cells. Their expression was highly upregulated with the neurite
   outgrowth associated with neuronal differentiation in neuroblastoma cell
   lines. These results indicate that neugrin and m-neugrin are mainly
   expressed in neurons in the nervous system, and play an important role
   in the process of neuronal differentiation. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{We recently demonstrated that the constitutive expression of
   cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 protein and prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2))
   biosynthesis were significantly enhanced in human skin epidermal cancer
   cells and that cancer cell growth was effectively inhibited by the
   suppression of COX-2 expression by transfection with COX-2 antisense
   oligonucleotide. The purpose of this study was to search for agents
   which suppress COX-2 expression and examine their effects on cell
   growth. Since retinoids and antioxidants have been used for
   chemoprevention of cancers in several tissues, the effects of these
   agents on COX-2 expression and PGE? biosynthesis in skin squamous
   carcinoma cells were investigated. Treatment with a retinoid
   (9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA)) or an antioxidant
   (pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC)) suppressed COX-2 expression and PGE2
   biosynthesis in a concentration-dependent manner. Cell growth was
   significantly inhibited by 9-cis-RA and PDTC. These results suggest that
   9-cis-RA and PDTC may be useful in preventing skin cancer grow;th and
   that COX-2 is involved in their protective effects on skin

Abstract = {{Ventricular septal (150-200 mum) arteries were isolated from the hearts
   of six-week-old CD-1 mice and mounted on a pressure myograph.
   Equilibration of the vessels at 70 mm Hg for 60 min resulted in the
   development of spontaneous myogenic tone. Maximum tone observed in these
   vessels greatly exceeded that previously reported in septal arteries
   from rats. Inhibition of endothelin ETA and endothelin ETB receptors
   with bosentan (1 and 10 muM) reduced basal tone. Endothelin release
   required intact endothelial cells. The alpha (1)-adrenceptor selective
   agonists phenylephrine and methoxamine did not cause change in coronary
   tone, while the alpha (2)-adrenceptor selective agonists
   6-allyl-2-amino5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4H-thiazolo-{[}4,5-d]azepin-dihydrochl
   oride (BHT 920) and clonidine produced vasodilatation. Noradrenaline (1
   nM-10 muM) induced a concentration-dependent vasodilatation, which was
   inhibited by concurrent treatment with yohimbine (10 muM) and
   propranolol (20 muM). Vasodilatation due to BHT 920 was abolished with
   vessel denudation, indicating the endothelial location of alpha
   (2)-adrenoceptors. Acetylcholine (1 nM-10 muM) caused an endothelium
   dependent vasodilatation; inhibition of nitric oxide synthase with
   N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester attenuated this response. The
   endothelium-dependent vasodilators bradykinin and substance P produced
   no vasomotor effect in mouse coronary arteries. Differences between
   human and murine responses may impact on the relevance of the mouse
   coronary artery for use as a potential model of human coronary vessel
   diseases. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{K+ currents through ERG (ether-a-go-go related gene) channels were
   recorded in whole-cell voltage clamped NG108-15 neuroblastoma x glioma
   hybrid cells. The channels were fully activated by low holding potential
   (V-H = -20 mV) and long depolarizing prepulses. Hyperpolarizing pulses
   elicited inward currents which deactivated after reaching a peak.
   Lowering {[}Ca2+], from 5 to 1.5 or 0.5 mM decreased tau (-1), the rate
   constant of deactivation. The effect can be explained by a shift of the
   tau (-1)(V) curve to more negative potentials caused by an increase in
   surface charge density. Plotting tau (-1) against {[}Ca2+](0) for
   different potentials yielded straight lines; their slope was independent
   of potential at -140 to -120 mV and decreased at more positive
   potentials. The time to peak curve and the maximum of the steady-state
   inward current were also shifted to more negative potentials. In
   addition, peak ERG inward current increased. Raising {[}Ca2+](0) from 5
   to 10 mM accelerated deactivation and decreased the peak current. 5 mM
   Ba2+ affected tau (-1) similarly and inhibited peak current more
   strongly whereas 5 mM Mg2+ was less potent. As found by Faravelli et al.
   (J. Physiol. 496 (1996) 13), bath solutions devoid of divalent cations
   (0 Ca2+, 0 Mg2+, 0.1 or 1.1 mM EGTA) abolished deactivation almost
   completely. The phenomenon was seen with bath containing either 40 or
   6.5 mM K+. Its occurrence was favored by raising the temperature to 34
   degreesC. It suggests a particular requirement of channel closing for
   Ca2+. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Measurement of the surface roughness and thickness of biological films
   is laborious and usually destructive, thus hampering research in this
   area. We developed a laser triangulation sensor (LTS) set-up for the
   fast and nondestructive measurement of these biofilm parameters during
   growth. Using LTS measurements, the morphological development of a
   dichloromethane-(DCM) degrading biofilm cultured on a wetted-wall column
   was studied. The measurements show that the biofilm develops faster at
   the entrance of the reactor. The biofilm consisted of a base film in
   which microbial colonies were embedded. The biofilm-surface area
   gradually increased by 23\% compared to the bare surface due to the
   formation of a large number of these colonies. The number and shape of
   these colonies were followed in time. Using LTS measurements, biofilms
   distinctly different in surface roughness could be distinguished in a
   laboratory trickling filter removing DCM from a waste gas. The
   consequences of the observed surface characteristics for the
   reaction-diffusion process in the biofilm and for the falling film
   hydrodynamics are discussed. (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons.}},

Abstract = {{Seawater desalination by reverse osmosis was studied as an alternative
   process for the production of fresh water to supply 20,000 m(3)/d of
   drinking and boiler feed water at the Badak natural gas liquefaction
   plant and community housing. Seawater resources will be taken off shore
   from the Bontang Sea near the plant site. The chemical and physical
   analysis of seawater will be made at several locations in the Bontang
   Sea, which contains around 33,000 ppm TDS without any special
   characteristics. The Hydranautic RO design will be used for pre-design
   of the RO system. Data input needed for simulation are characteristics
   of seawater, production of fresh water and the price of energy at the
   local site. Total water cost ranges from US\$ 0.46-0.64 based on an
   energy price of US\$ 0.038 kWh at Badak. By simulation, product water
   had TDS 452 and boiler water feed TDS 15. Total investment cost based on
   20,000 m3/d product ranges from US\$ 8-16 million, depending on local
   site conditions. The area needed for a seawater RO plant is around
   2500m(2). This study describes an idea and an illustration about other
   fresh water resources before implementation of RO seawater desalination
   at Badak before the fresh water resources dry out. The pre-design gave
   satisfactory results in the prediction of total water cost and total

   the strong line emission can be attributed to the interaction of a
   continuing (but decaying) postburst relativistic outflow from the
   central engine with the progenitor stellar envelope at distances less
   than a light-hour. Only a small mass of Fe is then required, which could
   have been readily produced by the star itself.}},

Abstract = {{The features of hydrothermal mineral phases hosted in ankaramite basalts
   from the lower part of the Taganana area (northside Anaga, Tenerife) are
   studied in this work. This area. known as ``Arco de Taganana{''},
   constitutes a volcanic rift zone that is overturned to the northwest and
   now identified by a dense NE-SW striking dyke swarm with a distinct SE
   dip. The must recent K-Ar data indicate a mid-upper Miocene age for the
   emplacement of the dykes. The rocks are intensely altered, usually
   brecciated, and an deeply eroded. This allows us to look at the roots of
   a volcanic edifice that has almost disappeared. Basaltic pyroclastic
   deposits and lava flows, as well as salic breccias, associated to the
   emplacement of salic domes, unconformably overly these rocks.
   Mineralogical and geochemical characteristics. of the mineralization as
   well as isotopic data are reported in this paper. Some mineral
   paragenesis and isotopic data reflect submarine conditions of
   alteration.
   Mineralogy was studied by transmitted and reflected light microscopy,
   XRD, SEM and electron microprobe. In general terms, the mineralization
   consists of major jasper (quartz and opal) and celadonite, in
   association with minor hematite, magnetite, Fe +/- Ca, Mg carbonates,
   Kaersutite, calcite and traces of ilmenite, which is always associated
   with magnetite, Four paragenetic stages were recognized in the studied
   area; two of them exhibit hydrothermal mineralization. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Using high-resolution bathymetric data, 97 seamounts within two large
   submarine areas, N and SE of Tenerife, have been identified and studied
   in detail. Main dimensions and associated parameters of these seamounts
   have been measured, allowing a morphometric and morphologic
   classification on a shape basis.
   In order to be certain of their volcanic origin, several restrictive
   criteria were applied (conical shape with maximum height >150 m, basal
   ratio >1, aspect ratio >0.1) to the initial tally, obtaining finally 31
   regular shapes that can be identified without any reasonable doubt as
   volcanic seamounts, These are very similar to submarine volcanoes
   described elsewhere on the sea floor.
   Most of these volcanic seamounts are aligned along two lines that follow
   the main volcano-tectonic trends of the Canary Archipelago. The NW-SE
   line crosses the island, while the NE-SW line coincides with a
   seismically active reverse fault that separates the Tenerife and Gran
   Canaria insular blocks.
   The distribution of the submarine volcanism to the north of Tenerife
   permits a better knowledge of the island from its base on the sea floor
   and defines the tectonic control of the growth of the shield between 4
   and 2 Ma. Therefore, the evolution of the submarine edifice of Tenerife
   shows that the widespread parasite or satellite eruption centres are
   also very important in the overall growth of large shield edifices of
   volcanic islands. (C) 2000 Elsevier science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg) of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) typically
   consists of two related protein species. The small HDAg (S-HDAg) is a
   24-kDa protein of 195 amino acids and the large HDAg (L-HDAg) is a
   27-kDa protein with an additional 19 amino acids at its C-terminus.
   These two proteins have distinct functions in the HDV life cycle. We
   have developed conditions for expressing S-HDAg and L-HDAg in E. coli as
   soluble proteins to facilitate large-scale purification. These proteins
   were purified to homogeneity and shown to be biologically active.
   Transfection of the purified recombinant S-HDAg together with HDV
   genomic RNA resulted in viral RNA replication. Surprisingly, the
   purified S-HDAg could not initiate replication from the
   antigenomic-sense HDV RNA, even though the latter led to RNA replication
   when transfected with an mRNA encoding the S-HDAg. These results suggest
   that initiation of HDV RNA synthesis from the antigenomic RNA may
   require a form of HDAg that is modified in mammalian cells; in contrast,
   RNA synthesis from the genomic RNA could be initiated by the recombinant
   S-HDAg from E. coli. Interestingly, the purified L-HDAg appeared as
   multiple protein species, including one corresponding to S-HDAg,
   probably as a result of degradation. The partially proteolyzed L-HDAg
   also initiated HDV RNA replication under the same conditions. These
   results add to the mounting evidence that genomic- and
   antigenomic-strand HDV RNA syntheses are carried out by different
   mechanisms. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Sodium chloride enhanced oxygenase activity while curtailing carboxylase
   activity of Rubisco (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase; EC
   4.1.1.39) purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. Exposure to 200 mM
   NaCl brought about an increase in the potential of Rubisco to oxygenate
   RuBP by over 50\%. On the other hand, proline suppressed both oxygenase
   as well as carboxylase activities of Rubisco. Interestingly,
   proline-induced suppression in oxygenase activity was significantly
   higher than that of carboxylase activity. Most amazingly,
   salt-stress-induced enhancement in oxygenase activity was fully
   alleviated by proline even when present at a concentration as low as 50
   mM. The findings presented in this communication clearly demonstrate for
   the first time that stress-induced proline accumulation might have a
   critical role in lowering the loss in fixed carbon by curtailing
   salt-stress-promoted enhancement in oxygenase activity of Rubisco. (C)

Abstract = {{The consequences for lambs of infection over the winter with
   Teladorsagia circumcincta were quantified by deliberate, trickle
   infection of selected animals at 7 months of age. Infected and control
   uninfected animals were each allocated into four groups, relatively
   resistant animals on a normal diet, relatively resistant animals on an
   isocaloric diet supplemented with urea, and relatively susceptible
   animals on the same two diets. Resistance and susceptibility was
   assessed by faecal egg counts following natural infection during the
   summer preceding the deliberate infection. During the deliberate
   infection egg counts remained low and most parasites recovered at
   necropsy were inhibited larvae. Nonetheless, infection reduced weight
   gain, decreased albumin and fructosamine concentrations and provoked a
   noticeable pepsinogen and eosinophil response. As most larvae were
   inhibited these responses may have been largely a consequence of
   immune-inflammatory responses in the host rather than the direct action
   of parasites themselves. Relatively resistant animals on the
   supplemented diet allowed fewer larvae to establish and had higher
   fructosamine concentrations, higher albumin concentrations and decreased
   pepsinogen responses. Therefore, a combination of relatively resistant
   sheep and nutritional supplementation appears most efficient at
   controlling infection. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The effect of alpha -tocopherol on the structure and phase behaviour of
   mixed aqueous dispersions of phosphatidylcholine and
   phosphatidylethanolamine has been examined by synchrotron X-ray
   diffraction. Equimolar mixtures of dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine :
   dioleoylphosphatidylcholine and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine :
   dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine did not show evidence of phase
   separation of an inverted hexagonal structure typical of alpha
   -tocopherol and phosphatidylethanolamine from lamellar phase. Mixed
   dispersions of dioleoyl derivatives of phosphatidylethanolamine :
   phosphatidylcholine (3:1) form a typical miscible gel phase at low
   temperatures but which phase separates into lamellar liquid-crystal and
   inverted hexagonal phases at temperatures greater than 65 degreesC. The
   presence of 1, 2 or 5 mol\% alpha -tocopherol caused a decrease in the
   temperature at which the inverted hexagonal phase appears. Phase
   separation of non-lamellar phase from lamellar gel phase can be detected
   in the presence of 7.5 and 10 mol\% alpha -tocopherol, indicating a
   limited capacity of the phosphatidylcholine to incorporate alpha
   -tocopherol into the lamellar domain. A partial phase diagram of the
   ternary mixture has been constructed from the X-ray scattering data. It
   was concluded that there is no preferential interaction of alpha
   -tocopherol with phosphatidylethanolamine in mixed aqueous dispersions
   containing phosphatidylcholines. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Questionnaires were posted to 800 randomly selected registered Victorian
   dairy farmers in 1996. Five hundred and thirty-four responses were
   received and analysed. Johne's disease (JD) had been diagnosed on the
   farm of 13.2\% of respondents in the last 5 years. JD was rated second
   only to neonatal diarrhoea in importance as a disease of calves, even
   though other diseases occurred more frequently. However, there was a low
   level of compliance with JD control recommendations by the respondents.
   There was no significant difference in the number of JD control
   recommendations adopted by farmers between the three major Victorian
   regions. There was a significant difference in compliance between farms
   having had a diagnosed case of JD and those that had not. Although there
   is awareness among dairy farmers of the importance of JD, there appears
   to be a poor implementation of measures by farmers to prevent the spread
   of the disease. Current JD control recommendations and the method of
   information transfer to Victorian dairy farms should be reassessed to
   ensure that dairy heifers are reared with minimal risk of transmission
   of JD. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   radiation exposure-induced cytogenetic damage was used in the present
   study to investigate the genotoxic effect of microwaves in human
   peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro exposed in G(o) to electromagnetic
   fields with different frequencies (2.45 and 7.7 GHz) and power density
   (10, 20 and 30 mW/cm(2)) for three times (15, 30 and 60 min). The
   results showed for both radiation frequencies an induction of
   micronuclei as compared to the control cultures at a power density of 30
   mW/cm(2) and after an exposure of 30 and 60 min. Our study would
   indicate that microwaves are able to cause cytogenetic damage in human
   lymphocytes mainly for both high power density and long exposure time.

Abstract = {{We have defined the histone acetylation pattern of the endogenous murine
   beta -globin domain, which contains the erythroid-specific beta -globin
   genes. The beta -globin locus control region (LCR) and transcriptionally
   active promoters were enriched in acetylated histones in fetal liver
   relative to fetal brain, whereas the inactive promoters were
   hypoacetylated. In contrast, the LCR and both active and inactive
   promoters were hyperacetylated in yolk sac. Hypersensitive site two of
   the LCR was also hyperacetytated in murine embryonic: stem cells,
   whereas beta -globin promoters were hypoacetylated. Thus, the
   acetylation pattern varied at different developmental stages. Histone
   deacetylase inhibition selectively increased acetylation at a
   hypoacetylated promoter in fetal liver, suggesting that active
   deacetylation contributes to silencing of promoters. We propose that
   dynamic histone acetylation and deacetylation play an important role in
   the developmental control of beta -globin gene expression.}},

Abstract = {{Because of recent high-yield native ligation techniques, chemical
   synthesis of larger multidomain bioactive proteins is rapidly coming
   within reach. Here we describe the total chemical synthesis of a
   designed ``microprotein S,{''} comprising the gamma -carboxyglutamic
   acid-rich module, the thrombin-sensitive module, and the first epidermal
   growth factor-like module of human plasma protein S (residues 1-116).
   Synthetic microprotein S expressed anticoagulant cofactor activity for
   activated protein C in the down-regulation of blood coagulation, and the
   anticoagulant activity of microprotein S was not neutralized by
   C4b-binding protein, a natural inhibitor of native protein S in plasma.
   The correct folding of this complex multidomain protein was enhanced
   compared with individual modules because the gamma -carboxyglutamic
   acid-rich module and the thrombin-sensitive module markedly facilitated
   correct folding of the first epidermal growth factor-like module
   compared with folding of the first epidermal growth factor-like module
   alone. These results demonstrate that total chemical synthesis of

Abstract = {{The study of mammalian evolution often relies on detailed analysis of
   dental morphology. For molecular patterning to play a role in dental
   evolution, gene expression differences should be linkable to
   corresponding morphological differences. Because teeth, like many other
   structures, are complex and evolution of new shapes usually involves
   subtle changes, we have developed topographic methods by using
   Geographic Information Systems. We investigated how genetic markers for
   epithelial signaling centers known as enamel knots are associated with
   evolutionary divergence of mof at teeth in two rodent species, mouse and
   vote. Our analysis of expression patterns of Fgf4, Lef1, p21. and Shh
   genes in relation to digital elevation models of developing tooth shapes
   shows that molecular prepatterns predict the lateral cusp topography
   more than a day in advance. A heterotopic shift in the molecular
   prepatterns can be implicated in the evolution of mouse molar, changing
   locations from which historically homologous cusps form. The subtle but
   measurable heterotopic shifts may play a large role in the evolution of
   tooth cusp topographies. However, evolutionary increase in the number of
   longitudinal cusps in vole molar has involved accelerated longitudinal
   growth and iterative addition of new cusps without changes in lateral
   cusp topography. The iterative addition of cusps after the establishment
   of lateral cusp topography may limit the independence of individual
   morphological features used in evolutionary studies. The diversity of
   mammalian molar patterns may largely result from the heterotopic and
   iterative processes.}},

Abstract = {{CD4(+) T cells selected by the type 1 diabetes associated class II MHC
   I-A(g7) molecules play a critical role in the disease process.
   Multivalent MHC/peptide tetramers have been used to directly detect
   antigen-specific T cells. Detection of autoantigen-activated CD4(+) T
   cells with tetramers should be Very helpful in the study of the roles of
   these cells in diabetes. We report here the generation of tetramers of
   I-A(g7) covalently linked to two glutamic acid decarboxylase (CAD)
   peptides and the detection of GAD peptide-activated T cells from
   nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. The I-A(g7) heterodimers can form stable
   complexes with a covalently bound GAD peptide and can stimulate antigen
   specific T cells, Furthermore, I-A(g7)/GAD peptide tetramer can detect
   most if not all of the antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells from immunized
   NOD mice. Antigen-specific T cells detected by the tetramers can
   up-regulate their CD4 expression on the cell surface after being
   restimulated with the CAD peptides in vitro. In contrast, the tetramers
   can detect a percentage of T cells in lymph nodes and spleens and T
   cells infiltrating islets from nonimmunized mice that is not
   significantly above the background, Therefore, T cells specific for the
   CAD peptides are present in NOD mice at a frequency too low to be
   detected, but immunization of NOD mice can facilitate their detection by
   tetramers.}},

Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{50}},
Pages = {{15353-15364}},
Month = {{DEC 19}},
Abstract = {{Initial crystallographic studies suggested that fully liganded mammalian
   hemoglobin can adopt only a single quaternary structure, the quaternary
   R Structure. However, more recent crystallographic studies revealed the
   existence of a second quaternary structure for liganded hemoglobin, the
   quaternary R2 structure. Since these quaternary structures can be
   crystallized, both must be energetically accessible structures that
   coexist in solution. Unanswered questions include (i) the relative
   abundance of the R and R2 structures under various solution conditions
   and (ii) whether other quaternary structures are energetically
   accessible for the liganded alpha (2)beta (2) hemoglobin tetramer.
   Although crystallographic methods cannot directly answer the first
   question, they represent the most direct and most accurate approach to
   answering the second question. We now have determined and refined three
   different crystal structures of bovine carbonmonoxyhemoglobin. These
   structures provide clear evidence that the dimer-dimer interface of
   liganded hemoglobin has a wide range of energetically accessible
   structures that are related to each other by a simple sliding motion.
   The dimer-dimer interface acts as a ``molecular slide bearing{''} that
   allows the two arp dimers to slide back and forth without greatly
   altering the number or the nature of the intersubunit contacts. Since
   the general stereochemical features of this interface are not unusual,
   it is likely that interface sliding of the kind displayed by fully
   liganded hemoglobin plays important structural and functional roles in
   many other protein assemblies.}},

Abstract = {{The ecdysone-inducible gene switch is a useful tool for modulating gene
   expression in mammalian cells and transgenic animals. We have identified
   inducers derived from plants as well as certain classes of insecticides
   that increase the versatility of this gene regulation system.
   Phytoecdysteroids share the favorable kinetics of steroids, but are
   inert in mammals. The gene regulation properties of one of these
   ecdysteroids have been examined in cell culture and in newly developed
   strains of ecdysone-system transgenic mice. Ponasterone A is a potent
   regulator of gene expression in cells and transgenic animals, enabling
   reporter genes to be turned on and off rapidly. A number of nonsteroidal
   insecticides have been identified that also activate the ecdysone
   system. Because the gene-controlling properties of the ecdysone switch
   are based on a heterodimer composed of a modified ecdysone receptor
   (VgEcR) and the retinoid X receptor (RXR), we have tested the effect of
   RXR ligands on the VgEcR/RXR complex. Used alone, RXR ligands display no
   activity on the ecdysone switch. However, when used in combination with
   a VgEcR ligand, RXR ligands dramatically enhance the absolute levels of
   induction. This property of the heterodimer has allowed the development
   of superinducer combinations that increase the dynamic range of the
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Growth factors can cause cells to proliferate, differentiate, survive,
   or die. Distinguishing between these responses is difficult in
   multicellular, multiparameter systems. Yet this is essential to
   understand the impact on cells like hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs),
   which have strict and still poorly understood growth factor
   requirements. Single cell plating in serum-free medium allows direct
   assessment of growth factor responses. The range of tested factors can
   be expanded if the cells are protected from growth factor
   deprivation-induced apoptosis. BCL-2 is overex- pressed in HSCs of
   H2K-BCL-2 transgenic mice, protecting them from many apoptotic stimuli.
   The response of single wild-type and transgenic HSCs to stimulations
   with individual factors was tested. Surprisingly, we Emd that high level
   BCL-2 expression does not prevent rapid death under serum-free
   conditions, even though it does in the presence of serum. We also find
   that transgenic, but not wild-type cells, survive and proliferate
   rapidly in response to steel factor (Kit ligand). These studies show
   that two separate signals are necessary to prevent apoptosis in HSCs,
   and that Kit ligand by itself provides a strong proliferative stimulus
   to HSCs. However, the proliferative response does not result in
   self-renewal, but in differentiation to all known hematopoietic
   oligolineage progenitors.}},

Abstract = {{The magnetic properties of Sr2FeMoO6 oxides are investigated over a
   broad temperature range extending From 10 K to 800 K. It is found that
   the magnetization fully saturates at low temperatures at a value of 3.75
   mu (B). In the paramagnetic regime, above the Curie temperature (T-C
   approximate to 420 K), the magnetic susceptibility can be well described
   by a Curie-Weiss law. It is found that the experimental effective moment
   mu (eff){*} is gradually reduced under a field, an effect that can be
   attributed to some non-intrinsic behaviour. By means of detailed data
   analysis, it is shown that the paramagnetic effective moment mu (eff) is
   close to that expected for a 3d(6):4d(0) atomic configuration. This
   result is interpreted as due to some electronic charge transfer from the
   itinerant 4d(0)(Mo) towards the 3d(5)(Fe) orbitals in the paramagnetic
   phase. We have also observed that the paramagnetic Curie temperature
   theta (p) is positive and that theta (p) approximate to T-C, thus
   suggesting that the nearest-neighbour magnetic interactions are
   ferromagnetic in nature. These observations strongly support a
   double-exchange picture for the ferromagnetic coupling in these oxides.}},

Abstract = {{The reaction in perchloric acid solution between Hg2+ and Fe2+ was found
   to proceed extremely slowly until it suddenly exhibited an autocatalytic
   surge. In conjunction with this rise, a yellow-green by-product formed
   and disappeared again when the reaction came to an end. In the related
   reaction between Hg-2(2+) and Fe2+, the autocatalytic behaviour started
   early and the yellow-green by-product again appeared. No metallic
   mercury or other solid formed in either reaction, but the production of
   colloidal mercury was demonstrated by the Tyndall effect and by
   electrophoresis experiments. A five-step mechanism for these reactions
   is proposed and incorporated into a computer simulation called Mercury.
   The behaviour predicted by these simulations agrees well with the
   unusual experimental findings. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Zonal averages of annual and seasonal averages of ozone amounts from
   Nimbus 7/TOMS (1979-1992) have been examined to estimate the systematic
   interannual variability of UV-B (390-320 nm) exposure to solar radiation
   between +/-60 degrees latitude. As shown from statistical modeling,
   clear-sky interannual UV-B changes can be ascribed mainly to the
   quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) driven by stratospheric winds. The QBO
   oscillations can cause interannual changes in UV-B exposure of +/-15\%
   at 300 nm and +/-5\% at 310 nm at the equator and at middle latitudes.
   In addition to QBO effects, there are larger interannual changes in
   ozone and UV-B associated with dynamical effects at higher latitudes.
   When UV-B attenuation from clouds is included, the general latitudinal
   structure of the interannual variability is maintained. At the equator
   the interannual variability of ozone amounts and UV exposure caused by
   the combination of the 2.3 year QBO and annual cycles implies that there
   is about a 5 year periodicity in UV-B variability caused by dynamical
   effects. At higher latitudes the appearance of the interannual UV-B
   maximum is predicted by the QBO but without the regular periodicity. The
   QBO effects on UV-B irradiance are larger than the long-term changes
   caused by the decrease in ozone amounts.}},

Abstract = {{Background Arrhythmias cause much morbidity and mortality after
   myocardial infarction, but in previous trials, antiarrhythmic drug
   therapy has not been convincingly effective. Dofetilide, a new class III
   agent, was investigated for effects on all-cause mortality and morbidity
   in patients with left-ventricular dysfunction after myocardial
   infarction.
   Methods In 37 Danish coronary-care units, 1510 patients with severe
   left-ventricular dysfunction (wall motion index less than or equal
   to1.2, corresponding to ejection fraction less than or equal to0.35)
   were enrolled in a randomised, double-blind study comparing dofetilide
   (n=749) with placebo (n=761). The primary endpoint was all-cause
   mortality. Secondary endpoints included cardiac end arrhythmic mortality
   and total arrhythmic deaths. Analyses were by intention to treat.
   Findings No significant differences were found between the dofetilide
   and placebo groups in all-cause mortality (230 {[}31\%] vs 243
   {[}32\%]), cardiac mortality (191 {[}26\%] vs 212 {[}28\%]), or total
   arrhythmic deaths (129 {[}17\%] vs 140 {[}18\%]). Atrial fibrillation or
   flutter was present in 8\% of the patients at study entry. In these
   patients, dofetilide was significantly better than placebo at restoring
   sinus rhythm (25 of 59 vs seven of 56; p=0.002). There were seven cases
   of torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia, all in the dofetilide
   group.
   Interpretation In patients with severe left-ventricular dysfunction and
   recent myocardial infarction, treatment with dofetilide did not affect
   ail-cause mortality, cardiac mortality, or total arrhythmic deaths.
   Dofetilide was effective in treating atrial fibrillation or flutter in
   this population.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. The differential diagnosis of a parkinsonian syndrome is
   extensive and complex. In most cases, however a detailed clinical
   examination will help to differentiate between idiopathic Parkinson's
   disease (IPD) and other causes of parkinsonism. Patients and methods. 10
   patients with an average age of 65.1 years (range 60-70), of whom 6 were
   men and 4 women were referred to ou,. department with a diagnosis of IPD
   and history of backwards falls. The average duration of disease was 4,7
   years (range 4-7). All 10 patients had at presentation a severe
   akinetic-rigid syndrome with no other symptoms of IPD. IV apomorphine
   (APO) was administered to each of them at a rate of 8.9 mg/hr (range
   15-3 mg/hr)for an average time of 5.4 hours (range: 3-10 hours).
   Results. The improvement of the akinetic-rigid stale in six of the
   patients during the IV infusion with APO helped to elicit signs that are
   atypical of IPD (ataxia and postural instability). Three of the patients
   did not respond to IV APO and one of them could not be evaluated, as he
   did not tolerate the infusion. Oral Dopa challenge or s/c APO bolus has
   not been as successful in helping to differentiate IPD from other
   parkinsonian syndromes. Conclusions. The prompt detection of postural
   instability or retropopulsion is necessary in order to diagnose atypical
   parkinsonian syndroms. In difficult cases, continuous IV APO will
   improve the akinetic-rigid state and facilitate the detection of
   atypical signs. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of APO, and the
   advantage of it being possible to administer the drug IV in a few hours
   increases the viability of this test.}},

Abstract = {{Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha -GaLNAc-ase; EC 3.2.1.49) is an
   exoglycosidase specific for the hydrolysis of terminal alpha -linked
   N-acetylgalactosamine in various sugar chains. The cDNA, nagA, encoding
   alpha -GalNAc-ase from Acremonium sp. was cloned, sequenced, and
   expressed in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The nagA contains an open
   reading frame which encodes for 547 amino acid residues including 21
   residues of a signal peptide in its N-terminal. The calculated molecular
   mass of mature protein from the deduced amino acid sequence of nagA is
   57260 Da, which corresponds to the value obtained from SDS-PAGE of
   native and recombinant enzymes treated with endo-beta
   -N-acetyl-glucosaminidase ii. The amino acid sequence of NagA showed
   significant similarity to those of eukaryotic alpha -GalNAc-ases and
   alpha -galactosidases (alpha -Gal-ases), particularly alpha -Gal-ase A
   (AglA) from Aspergillus niger. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that NagA
   does not belong to the cluster of vertebrate alpha -GalNAc-ase and alpha
   -Gal-ase but forms another cluster with AglA and yeast alpha -Gal-ases.
   Thus, the evolutionary origin of the fungal alpha -GalNAc-ase is
   suggested to be different from that of vertebrate alpha -GalNAc-ase.
   This is the first report of a microbial alpha -GalNAc-ase gene. (C) 2000

   of the initial total mass of the system to gravitational radiation
   producing effectively a drifting of the quasinormal frequencies. The

Abstract = {{Vibrational spectra of CH3Mn(CO)(5) and CH3Re(CO)(5) have been

   (3500-50 cm(-1)) solid phase (at ambient and liquid nitrogen
   temperature) and solution (in CH2Cl2) polarization data for the Re
   compound are presented. Based on the available and the present
   experimental data and the results of the normal coordinate calculations,
   the assignment of the frequencies has been reviewed and some
   modifications in the low frequency region have been suggested.
   Force-field calculations have been performed on the basis of vibrational
   data of the -CH3, -CD3, and -(CH3)-C-13 species of gaseous, dissolved,
   and solid samples. Density functional theory calculations show that the
   rotational barrier of the methyl group is less than 0.5 kcal mol(-1).
   The study of pressure effect on CO and M-CH3 stretching force constants
   proved that the stronger CO bonds have a relatively smaller pressure
   effect than the much weaker M-CH3 bonds. As a characteristic of pressure
   sensitivity `bond compressibility' has been introduced. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The spin susceptibility of the electron gas is studied using a
   functional integral formulation. a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation
   is used to decouple the electron-electron interaction. A uniform Pock
   mean field is chosen, and effects of small fluctuations about this mean
   field are retained up to second order. The term that gives the usual
   spin random-phase approximation susceptibility is identified, with the
   ladder sum contained in the propagator for the field fluctuations.
   Computations of the static spin susceptibility outline the region of
   stability as a function of electron-gas coupling parameter and wave
   vector. These computations parallel those of Hamann and Overhauser
   {[}Phys. Rev. 143, 183 (1966)] for the Yukawa interaction. We use the
   analytic continuation method of Staunton ct al. {[}Phys. Rev. Lett. 82,
   3340 (1999)] to extend the calculations to nonzero frequency. The
   resulting spectral density shows the increase in low-energy spin
   fluctuations as the spin-density-wave transition is approached, and the
   development of a pseudogap in the spin fluctuation spectrum near the

   experiments performed in specially designed reactors. This spatial
   bistability introduces an additional geometric dimension in the system

   additional complexity can play in the observation of patterns associated

   or absent from the more aggressive cell lines, There was an inverse
   correlation between HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha induction and clonogenic
   survival under hypoxia. Thus, cell lines with reduced induction of HIF-1
   alpha or HIF-2 alpha showed high basal levels of VEGF and improved
   survival under hypoxia, A reduction in HIF expression was also
   associated with a more aggressive phenotype in vivo, To confirm these
   results, we carried out stable transfection of the MDA 435 cell line
   with human HIF-2 alpha cDNA, There was no change in the growth rate in
   monolayer culture. However, in vitro growth as colonies and irt vivo
   tumor growth of the HIF-2 alpha overexpressing cells were significantly
   impaired Compared with the control transfectants. Thus, despite the fact
   that HIF proteins are necessary for optimal tumor growth and
   angiogenesis in vivo, overexpression of these molecules seems
   detrimental to tumor growth. A balance between the angiogenic and
   tumor-inhibiting levels of HIF proteins may, therefore, be necessary for
   optimal tumor growth.}},

Title = {{Frictional-viscous flow of simulated fault gouge caused by the combined
   effects of phyllosilicates and pressure solution}},

Abstract = {{It is widely believed that conventional brittle-plastic strength
   envelopes may significantly overestimate crustal strength, in part
   because they fail to account for the effects of fluid-assisted
   deformation mechanisms. In particular, pressure solution has been
   suggested to allow fault creep behaviour at a shear stress well below
   that predicted by conventional strength envelopes. In addition, many
   natural fault zones contain significant amounts of phyllosilicates,
   often defining a foliation. Phyllosilicates are believed to inhibit
   grain contact healing and increase the rate of pressure solution in
   quartzose rocks. Hence, the interaction between phyllosilicates and
   pressure solution may strongly influence fault rheology under the
   hydrothermal conditions pertaining around the brittle-ductile
   transition. The aim of this research is to assess the combined effects
   of pressure solution and phyllosilicates on fault slip behaviour. To
   this end, we performed high strain, rotary shear experiments on
   experimental faults containing brine-saturated mixtures of halite and
   kaolinite as simulated gouge. The experiments were done under conditions
   when pressure solution and cataclasis dominate over dislocation creep,
   thus simulating the brittle-ductile transition. Halite was chosen as a
   rock analogue because of its well-constrained pressure solution
   kinetics. Experiments were done at room temperature and atmospheric
   pressure, under drained conditions. In the experiments we explored the
   effect of varying sliding velocity, normal stress and clay content on
   fault strength. The results showed frictional-viscous behaviour, i.e.
   shear strength depending on both normal stress and shear strain rate, in
   brine-saturated halite/kaolinite mixtures. In contrast, purely
   frictional (i.e. normal stress dependent and shear strain rate
   insensitive) behaviour was observed when an inert pore fluid (silicone
   oil instead of brine) or an inert solid (quartz instead of halite) was
   used. Monomineralic halite and kaolinite gouges showed purely frictional
   behaviour as well. This demonstrates that the observed
   frictional-viscous behaviour was caused by the combined effects of
   pressure solution and phyllosilicates. The microstructures, which
   strongly resemble natural mylonites in many respects, suggest that
   deformation of the gouge involved sliding along kaolinite-rich foliation
   planes, accommodated by pressure solution and dilatation/cataclasis, the
   relative amounts of which varied with sliding velocity. If similar
   behaviour occurs in natural phyllosilicate-rich fault zones, such zones
   are expected to be significantly weaker than predicted by traditional
   brittle-ductile strength envelopes. In addition, our microstructures
   suggest that pressure solution may play an important role next to
   dislocation creep in microstructural evolution in mylonitic rocks. (C)

Abstract = {{The stereochemical course of the electrophilic iodination and
   bromination of tri-O-benzyl-D-glucal under various conditions has been
   compared to that of substituted dihydropyrans 2-5. IN3 addition in
   acetonitrile affords trans-alpha -iodoazides (80-87\%), besides small
   amounts of trans-beta -adducts, in the presence or the absence of
   benzyloxy substituents at C-3 or C-4, and in agreement with bridged
   iodonium ion intermediates. In contrast, the diastereofacial selectivity
   of bromine addition in dichloroethane going through open bromo
   oxacarbenium ions depends strongly on the substituents. Whereas the
   trans-alpha -dibromides are the main (85-95\%) adducts in the absence of
   C-4 and C-5 substituents, in their presence a moderate to exclusive
   selectivity for cis-alpha -addition (60-99\%) is observed. The
   predominance of trans-alpha -addition is again observed whatever the
   substituents when the bromination is carried out in the same solvent but
   with a tribromide ion salt, supporting a concerted addition of the two
   bromine atoms under these conditions. Finally, bromine addition in
   methanol exhibits a completely different behavior with the nonselective
   formation of trans-alpha- and trans-beta -methoxybromides and a small
   dependence on the substituents. In agreement with the absence of azide
   trapping of any cationic intermediate, it is concluded that these
   brominations which do not go through an ionic intermediate are concerted
   additions of bromine and methanol with very loose rate- and
   product-determining transition states. Finally, the substituent
   conformation at C-4 influences drastically the stereoselectivity in all
   these brominations. Evidence for alpha -anomeric control of the
   nucleophile approach at C-4 is given by the highly predominant formation
   of alpha -adducts, except in the methanolic bromination. The factors
   determining the versatile selectivity of the electrophile approach are
   discussed in terms of PPFMO theory and of the special mechanisms of
   glycal reactions.}},

Abstract = {{In peripheral steroidogenic tissues, dehydroepiandrosterone (D) is
   formed from pregnenolone (P) by the microsomal cytochrome P450c17
   enzyme. Although some steroidogenic P450s have been found in brain
   tissue, no enzyme has been shown to possess P450c17 activity. We
   recently demonstrated the presence of an alternative. Fe2+-dependent
   pathway responsible for D formation from alternative precursors in rat
   glioma cells. We and others could not find P450c17 mRNA and protein in
   rat brain. but demonstrate herein the presence of Fe2+-dependent
   alternative pathway for D formation in rat brain cortex microsomes.
   Using primary cultures of differentiating rat glial cells, we observed
   that P450c17 mRNA and protein were present in O-2A oligodendrocyte
   precursors and mature oligodendrocytes. In the presence of P, O-2A and
   mature oligodendrocytes formed D. Addition of Fe2+ together with
   submaximal concentrations of P increased D formation by these cells.
   Treatment of oligodendrocytes with the P450c17 inhibitor SU 10603 in the
   presence or absence of P failed to inhibit D production. These data
   suggest that D formation in oligodendrocytes occurs independently of the
   P450c17 protein present in the cells. In isolated type I astrocytes we
   did not find neither P450c17 mRNA nor protein. These cells responded to
   Fe2+ by producing D and addition of P together with Fe2+ further
   increased D synthesis. SU 10603 failed to inhibit D formation by
   astrocytes. Taken together these results suggest that in differentiating
   rat brain oligodendrocytes and astrocytes D is formed via a
   F450c17-independent and oxidative stress-dependent alternative pathway.

Pages = {{9195-9206}},

Abstract = {{During disinhibition, the neocortex generates synchronous activities.
   Block of GABA(A) receptors in neocortex transforms cortical slow-wave
   oscillations into large-amplitude similar to1 Hz discharges consisting
   of a negative spike or multiple negative spikes riding on a positive
   wave. Further block of GABA(B) receptors in neocortex slows the
   discharges to similar to0.5 Hz and increments the number of negative
   spikes forming rhythmic similar to 10 Hz neocortical oscillations.
   Although the thalamus responds robustly to these neocortical discharges,
   these are unaffected by thalamic inactivation using tetrodotoxin. Thus,
   an important problem relates to the origin of these activities within
   the neocortex. Current source density analysis and intracellular
   recordings revealed that the first negative spike in a discharge
   corresponded to a current sink that reflected a paroxysmal depolarizing
   shift (PDS) and could originate in the lower layers or in the upper
   layers. Regardless of the origin (upper or lower layer), the initial
   current sink always spreads to the same site in upper layer V-IV. In
   contrast, the similar to 10 Hz oscillation that follows the initial
   negative spike corresponds to current sinks that always originate in the
   lower layers but do not spread to upper layer V-IV, jumping directly to
   the upper layers. Each current sink in the similar to 10 Hz oscillation
   reflects a small PDS and is followed by a current source that reflects
   the repolarization after each PDS.}},

Abstract = {{A polymorphism in coagulation factor V, factor V Leiden (FVL), is the
   major known genetic risk factor for thrombosis in humans. Approximately
   10\% of mutation carriers experience clinically significant thrombosis
   in their lifetime. In a small subset of patients, thrombosis is
   associated with coinheritance of other prothrombotic gene mutations.
   However, the potential contribution of additional genetic risk factors
   in the majority of patients remains unknown. To gain insight into the
   molecular basis for the variable expressivity of FVL, mice were
   generated carrying the homologous mutation (R504Q {[}single-letter amino
   acid codes]) inserted into the endogenous murine Fv gene. Adult
   heterozygous (FVQ/+) and homozygous (FVQ/Q) mice are viable and fertile
   and exhibit normal survival. Compared with wild-type mice, adult FVQ/Q
   mice demonstrate a marked increase in spontaneous tissue fibrin
   deposition. No differences in fetal development or survival are observed
   among FVQ/Q, FVQ/+ or control littermates on the C57BL/6J genetic
   background. In contrast, on a mixed 129Sv-C57BL/6J genetic background,
   FvQ/Q mice develop disseminated intravascular thrombosis in the
   perinatal period, resulting in significant mortality shortly after
   birth. These results may explain the high degree of conservation of the
   R504/R506 activated protein C cleavage site within FV among mammalian
   species and suggest an important contribution of other genetic factors
   to the thrombosis associated with FVL in humans. (C) 2000 by The

   we deal with the convergence properties according to the way in which
   the different parameters vary, and the preservation of global smoothness
   and classes of functions determined by concave moduli of continuity. A
   remarkable feature of our approach is that if f is differentiable, the
   approximation properties of both L(n)({[}k])f and its derivatives can be
   discussed simultaneously. Throughout the paper, probabilistic methods
   play an important role. (C) 2000 Academic Press}},

Abstract = {{During mast cell degranulation the soluble component of the granule is
   released into extraceUuIar fluid, whereas two neutral proteases and
   heparin proteoglycans form the extracellular granule remnants. These
   structures are negatively charged and bind with high affinity LDL and
   other basic molecules.
   In this study we show that granule remnants expelled into extracellular
   fluid are able to bind the aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin and the
   anticancer agent doxorubicin in a dose-dependent manner. In addition,
   granule remnants loaded with the two basic substances are subsequently
   phagocytosed by macrophages. Indeed, when cells are incubated for24 h
   with 1 mg/ml gentamicin, the intracellular concentration of the drug,
   which in basal conditions is extremely low, increases significantly in
   the presence of degranulating mast cells (from 5.1 +/- 1.0 to 25.4 +/-
   2.5 mug/mg protein) and a good correlation between histamine release and
   gentamicin uptake is evident. The antineoplastic agent doxorubicin can
   penetrate cells by passive diffusion; however, when mast cells are added
   to macrophage monolayer, incubated for 30 min with 50 muM of the
   antineoplastic agent, a significant increase in intracellular
   doxorubicin concentration is observed (from 3.5 +/- 0.2 to 4.7 +/- 0.2
   mug/mg protein).
   Internalization of granule remnants carrying gentamicin or doxorubicin
   is also evident in smooth muscle cells of the synthetic phenotype. In
   particular, when smooth muscle cells are incubated for 24 h with 1 mg/ml
   gentamicin, addition of isolated granules increases the uptake from 2.4
   +/- 0.2 to 4.8 +/- 0.4 mug/mg protein. Similar results are obtained in
   smooth muscle cells incubated for 4 h with doxorubicin 50 muM (from 3.3
   +/- 0.2 to 4.8 +/- 0.5 mug/mg protein). Data are confirmed by
   microscopic experiments by means of fluorescence microscopy and electron
   microscopic studies.
   The study demonstrates that basic substances can enter phagocytic cells
   when loaded to granule remnants. The phenomenon can be of particular
   interest for substances like the aminoglycosides that do not cross
   biological membranes; indeed, the storage of these antibiotics in
   phagocytic cells could have important consequences on their
   antibacterial activity in vive. Macrophages and smooth muscle cells can
   also act as a reservoir for doxorubicin. High concentrations of the
   antineoplastic agent in these cells could be responsible for toxicity,
   as well as play an important role in the transport of the drug to tumor
   cells. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{To achieve the most natural features of metal hydride thermal energy
   conversion systems, both physical analysis of system components and
   optimization of the operation process are required, which can be solved
   by numerical simulation without arduous works of trial and error. The
   conventional and new cycling performance of a system can be predicted
   also by numerical simulation and easily proved by bench-scale techniques
   constructed with simulation results. In order to realize this procedure
   for the system development, it is necessary to set a computer simulation
   program which is based on detailed information about equilibrium
   properties of metal hydride and operating conditions. In the series of
   numerical runs of the simulation program, it was shown how metal hydride
   thermal energy conversion techniques could be optimized through the
   choice of a proper hydride pair from Zr-based alloys and several
   operation parameters. Especially, it was found that the heat transfer
   problem played a decisive roll in cooling power of the system. Finally,
   the unlimited capability of numerical simulation was proved by a good

Abstract = {{Photocurrent (PC) spectroscopy is employed to study several important
   aspects of the interband optoelectronic properties of InAs/GaAs
   self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs). PC spectroscopy is first shown to
   be a highly sensitive, quantitative technique to measure the interband
   absorption spectra of SAQDs. Up to four well-defined features are
   observed in the spectra arising from transitions between confined hole
   and electron levels. The transition energies are shown to agree well
   with those observed in electroluminescence, with negligible Stokes
   shifts found, contrary to previous reports. Large quantum-confined Stark
   shifts of the transitions are observed in PC spectroscopy as discussed
   in detail elsewhere {[}Fry et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 733, (2000)].
   Discrete interband transitions are observed superimposed on a broad
   background signal, shown to arise in part from field-dependent
   transitions into tail states of the two-dimensional wetting layer and
   the GaAs cladding region. A field-independent contribution to the
   background is also found, possibly from dots with larger size and shape
   fluctuations than those which give rise to the resolved interband
   transitions. By comparison of photocurrent signals from quantum dots and
   the wetting layer within the same sample, it is demonstrated that the
   quantum-dot oscillator strength is not significantly modified relative
   to that of a quantum well of the same surface area, consistent with
   performance found from quantum-dot laser devices. Polarization studies
   for in-plane light propagation are reported. The measurements show that
   the observed interband transitions involve predominantly heavy-hole-like
   levels, consistent with an assumption of theoretical modelling of
   Stark-effect results. Finally carrier escape mechanisms from the dots
   are deduced, with tunneling found to dominate at low temperature, and
   thermally activated escape becoming increasingly important at
   temperatures above similar to 100 K. Carrier escape is shown to occur
   from a common level, the ground state, demonstrating that excited-state
   to ground-state relaxation is faster than direct excited-state escape.}},

Abstract = {{Failure of radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) in the treatment of
   solid tumors, for the most part, is a result of undesirable
   pharmacokinetics that lead to significant radiation exposure of normal
   tissues and an inadequate delivery of radiation doses to tumors. Using
   genetic engineering, antitumor MAbs can be optimized for desirable
   clinical applications. In the present study, we report the generation of
   a tetravalent single-chain Fv \{{[}sc(Fv)(2)](2)\} of the murine MAb
   CC49 that recognizes the tumor-associated glycoprotein, TAG-72.
   {[}Sc(Fv)(2)](2) was expressed as a secreted soluble protein in Pichia
   pastoris under the regulation of alcohol oxidase 1 promoter. The in
   vitro binding properties of the tetravalent construct were analyzed by
   solid-phase RTA and surface plasmon resonance studies using BIA core.
   The binding affinity constant (K-A) for the {[}sc(Fv)(2)](2) and CC49
   IgG were similar, i.e., 1.02 x 10(8) M-1 and 1.14 x 10(8) M-1,
   respectively, and were 4-fold higher than its divalent scFv
   {[}sc(Fv)(2); 2.75 x 10(7) M-1]. At 6 h postadministration, the
   percentage of injected dose accumulated/g of LS-174T colon carcinoma
   xenografts was 21.3 +/- 1.3, 9.8 +/- 1.3, and 17.3 +/- 1.1 for
   radioiodinated {[}sc(Fv)(2)](2), sc(Fv)(2), and IgG, respectively.
   Pharmacokinetic analysis of blood clearance studies showed the
   elimination half-life for {[}sc(Fv)(2)](2), sc(Fv)(2), and IgG as 170,
   80, and 330 min, respectively. The gain in avidity resulting from
   multivalency along with an improved biological half-life makes the
   tetravalent construct an important reagent for cancer therapy and
   diagnosis in MAb-based radiopharmaceuticals.}},

Abstract = {{For ideal type-II GaAs/AlAs superlattices it was predicted that the
   coupling between Gamma and X-z electron states is allowed (forbidden) if
   the number of monolayers in AlAs slabs is even (odd). We use a simpler
   structure, namely, a single GaAs/AlAs/GaAs type-II double quantum well
   with thickness gradient to show experimental evidence of the
   AlAs-monolayer dependence of the Gamma -X coupling. A careful
   determination of layer thicknesses is obtained from electron microscopy
   and optical spectroscopy using additional quantum wells inserted in the
   structure. The results concerning the Gamma -X coupling are obtained
   from the study of the ratio of photoluminescence intensities of the
   zero-phonon line and the phonon replica and from their time decay. The
   variation of the Gamma -X coupling with AlAs thickness cannot be
   explained simply by the variation of the overlap of Gamma and X-z
   envelope functions. It clearly shows the monolayer dependence of the
   Gamma -X mixing potential. We develop a simple model to obtain the Gamma
   -X coupling in the case of nonabrupt interfaces. The amplitude of
   variation of the radiative recombination time due to the Gamma -X mixing
   is well reproduced within this model.}},

Abstract = {{The new satellite Earth gravity field model GRIM5-SI was recently
   prepared in a joint GFZ and GRGS effort. Based on this satellite
   solution and terrestrial and altimetric gravity anomalies from NIMA, a
   combined model GRIM5-C1, with full variance-covariance matrix up to
   degree and order 120, was computed. Surface gravity and altimetric
   gravity data are corrected for several systematic effects, such as
   ellipsoidal corrections and aliasing. A weighting scheme for gravity
   anomalies, according to their given standard deviations was developed.
   From each data set full normal equations were set up and finally
   combined with the GRIM5-S1 normals. To take into account good
   information from the satellite-only model a procedure was developed to
   identify such coefficients and appropriately weighed them in the final
   normal equation system. Internal error propagation and comparisons to
   external data sets show, that the GRIM5-C1 model represents the best

Abstract = {{We report a new pathway of translation regulation that may operate in
   interferon-treated or virus-infected mammalian cells. This pathway is
   activated by P56, a protein whose synthesis is strongly induced by
   interferons or double-stranded RNA. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we
   identified the P48 subunit of the mammalian translation initiation
   factor eIF-3 as a protein that interacts with P56, The P56-P48
   interaction was confirmed in human cells by co-immunoprecipitation
   assays and confocal microscopy, Gel filtration assays revealed that P56
   binds to the large eIF-3 complex that contains P48. Purified recombinant
   P56 inhibited in vitro translation of reporter mRNAs in a dose-dependent
   fashion, and that inhibition was reversed by the addition of purified
   eIF-3. In vivo, expression of transfected P56 or induction of the
   endogenous P56 by interferon caused an inhibition of overall cellular
   protein synthesis and the synthesis of a transfected reporter protein.
   As expected, a P56 mutant that does not interact with P48 and eIF-3
   failed to inhibit protein synthesis in vitro and in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{A general method for formulating complex thermodynamic systems in terms
   of hierarchical interactions has been developed, and has been applied in
   a previous analysis to hemoglobin oxygen binding data. Polyprotic acids
   can be considered a simple chemical model of thermodynamic interaction
   between ligand binding events. To further illustrate the hierarchical
   interaction approach it is applied to the analysis of the thermodynamic
   interactions between proton binding events in inorganic polyprotic
   acids. pK values for arsenate, carbonate, chromate, phosphate,
   phosphite, selenite, sulfide and sulfite were recast into hierarchical
   interaction terms. The intrinsic K-d,(h) for protonation ranged from 8.8
   x 10(-13) (M) for phosphate to 1.3 X 10(-6) (M) for chromate. Pairwise
   interactions (Kd,hh) between protonation events ranged from 1.3 x 10(4)
   for phosphite to 9.4 X 10(5) for carbonate. Third order interactions
   (K-d,K-hhh) were 0.91 and 0.51 for arsenate and phosphate, respectively,
   values relatively close to the no interaction value of 1. A principle
   feature of systems described by hierarchical interactions is that higher
   order interactions, representing more complex interactions, are less
   likely to be significant than lower order interactions, and this is
   further illustrated by these observations from polyprotic acids. The set
   of significant hierarchical interaction values can be used to predict
   values for as yet unobserved events, and projected pK values are made
   for all the polyprotic acids included in this study. Finally,
   application of this method to the protonation equilibria of water
   demonstrates a profound painwise interaction between protonation events
   (K-d,K-hh = 1.3 x 10(17)), which is attributed to oxygen's small size
   and lack of polarizability. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Over the past 18 years we have been deeply involved with the synthesis
   and applications of stimuli-responsive polymer systems, especially
   polymer-biomolecule conjugates. This article summarizes our work with
   one of these conjugate systems, specifically polymer-protein conjugates.
   We include conjugates prepared by random polymer conjugation to lysine
   amino groups, and also those prepared by site-specific conjugation of
   the polymer to specific amino acid sites that are genetically engineered
   into the known amino acid sequence of the protein. We describe the
   preparation and properties of thermally sensitive random conjugates to
   enzymes and several affinity recognition proteins. We have also prepared
   site-specific conjugates to streptavidin with temperature-sensitive
   polymers, pH-sensitive polymers, and light-sensitive polymers. The
   preparation of these conjugates and their many fascinating applications
   are reviewed in this article. (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Friction force microscopy (FFM) was used to distinguish the different
   surface terminations on the nanoscale on atomically flat SrTiO3(001)
   surfaces, obtained by a combination of ultrasonic agitation and
   subsequent annealing in air at 1000 degreesC. The surface exhibits
   atomically flat terraces and sharp steps whose height is 0.2 nm,
   corresponding to half the height of a unit cell of SrTiO3, or a single
   atomic layer, where strong friction contrast appears. A compositional
   analysis of the topmost surface by coaxial-impact-collision
   ion-scattering spectroscopy (CAICISS) indicated that the friction
   contrast corresponded to different surface terminations, namely, the SrO
   and TiO2 layer as a topmost surface, where the TiO2 domain was dominant.
   This is further supported by the correlation between the compositional
   Sr/Ti ratio and the area ratio which was observed by CAICISS and FFM,
   respectively. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{A computationally economical scheme which unifies the density functional
   description of an ionic solute and the classical description of a
   solvent was developed. The density functional part of the scheme
   comprises Car-Parrinello and related formalisms. The substantial saving
   in the computer time is achieved by performing the ab initio molecular
   dynamics of the solute electronic structure in a relatively small basis
   set constructed from lowest energy Kohn-Sham orbitals calculated for a
   single anion in vacuum, instead of using plane wave basis. The
   methodology permits simulation of an ionic solution for longer time
   scales while keeping accuracy in the prediction of the solute electronic
   structure. As an example the association of the Li+-Br- ion-pair system
   in water is studied. The results of the combined molecular dynamics
   simulation are compared with that obtained from the classical simulation
   with ion-ion interaction described by the pair potential of
   Born-Huggins-Mayer type. The comparison reveals an important role played
   by the polarization of the Br- ion in the dynamics of ion pair
   association. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Supergravity solutions related to large N SU(N) pure gauge theories with
   eight supercharges have recently been shown to give rise to an
   ``enhancon,{''} a new type of hypersurface made of D-branes. We show
   that enhancons also arise in similar situations pertaining to SO(2N+1),
   USp(2N) and SO(2N) gauge theories, using orientifolds. Enhancons
   therefore appear to come in types A, B, C, and D. The latter three
   differ globally from type A by having an extra Z(2) identification, and
   are distinguished locally by their subleading behavior in large N. We
   focus mainly on (2+1)-dimensional gauge theory, where a relation to M
   theory and the Atiyah-Hitchin and Taub-Newman-Unti-Tamburino (NUT)
   manifolds enables the construction of the smooth supergravity solution
   and the study of some of the 1/N corrections. The role of the enhancon
   in 11-dimensional supergravity is also uncovered. There is a close
   relation to certain multimonopole moduli space problems.}},

Abstract = {{Remyelination of the CNS is necessary to restore neural function in a
   number of demyelinating conditions. Schwann cells, the myelinating cells
   of the periphery, are candidates for this purpose because they have more
   robust regenerative properties than their central homologs, the
   oligodendrocytes. Although the ability of Schwann cells to remyelinate
   the CNS has been demonstrated, their capacity to enter the adult spinal
   cord in large numbers and effect functional recovery remains uncertain.
   We used cholera toxin B-subunit conjugated to saporin to demyelinate the
   rat lumbar spinal cord, remove macroglia, and produce paraplegia. After
   the removal of oligodendrocyte and astrocyte debris by invading
   macrophages, there was a spontaneous entry of Schwann cells into the
   spinal cord, along with axonal remyelination and concomitant functional
   recovery from paraplegia occurring within 75 d. The Schwann cells
   appeared to enter the dorsal funiculi via the dorsal root entry zone and
   the lateral funiculi via rootlets that had become adherent to the
   lateral spinal cord after the inflammation. In the following weeks,
   Schwann cell myelin surrounding central axons was progressively replaced
   by oligodendrocyte myelin without lapse in motor function. Our results
   show that endogenous Schwann cells can reverse a severe neurological
   deficit caused by CNS demyelination and enable later oligodendrocyte
   remyelination.}},

Abstract = {{Six different biotinylated radicicol derivatives were synthesized as
   affinity probes for identification of cellular radicicol-binding
   proteins. Derivatives biotinylated at the C-17 (BR-1) and C-11 (BR-6)
   positions retained the activity of morphological reversion in
   v-src-transformed 3Y1 fibroblasts. Two radicicol-binding proteins, 120
   and 90-kDa in size, were detected in HeLa cell extracts by employing
   BR-1 and BR-6, respectively. The 90-kDa protein bound to BR-6 was
   identified to be Hsp90 by immunoblotting. The 120-kDa protein bound to
   BR-1 was purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and its internal
   amino acid sequence was identical to that of human and rat ATP citrate
   lyase. The identity of the 120-kDa protein as ATP citrate lyase was
   confirmed by immunoblotting. Interaction between BR-1 and ATP citrate
   lyase was blocked by radicicol but not by herbimycin A that interacts
   with Hsp90. These results suggest that radicicol binds the two proteins
   through different molecular portions of its structure. BR-1-bound ATP
   citrate lyase isolated from rabbit reticulocyte lysate showed no
   enzymatic activity. The activity of rat liver ATP citrate lyase was
   inhibited by radicicol and BR-1 but not by BR-6. Kinetic analysis
   demonstrated that radicicol was a noncompetitive inhibitor of ATP
   citrate lyase with K-i values for citrate and ATP of 13 and 7 muM,

Abstract = {{MSLT guidelines recommend performing MSLTs following polysomnography
   (PSG) to document the preceding night's sleep. We tested the hypothesis
   that patients are objectively sleepier after in-laboratory full
   diagnostic PSG than after a sleep recording at home. Sixteen patients
   with the sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (SAHS; AHI 35+/-SD 28 per hour
   slept) were recruited into a randomized crossover study. To monitor
   sleep with minimal disruption at home, only sleep was recorded on 2
   consecutive nights, the first for acclimatization. The laboratory limb
   followed standard PSG. Bath study nights were followed next day by MSLT
   and MWT. There were no differences in MSLT (12.0 SD 5.1 home, 11.6+/-4.7
   min laboratory; p=0.7), MWT (32.7+/-8.7, 31.6+/-9.3 min; p=0.6) or total
   sleep time (362+/-53, 343+/-51 min; p=0.15) between home and laboratory
   limbs. However, on the home night, fewer microarousals (31+/-14,
   54+/-25/hr slept; p<0.0001) and less \% wake (15+/-10, 24+/-11; p=0.006)
   were found. On the home study night, patients had greater \% REM sleep,
   slow-wave sleep and sleep efficiency (all p<0.009). This study does not
   support the hypothesis that patients are sleepier after laboratory PSG
   compared to home study night. However, the improved sleep at home raises
   the question whether laboratory-based polysomnography is always required
   prior to MSLT/MWT testing or whether less obtrusive monitoring of sleep
   duration at home would sometimes suffice.}},

Abstract = {{According to the three-signal model of mesoderm patterning in Xenopus,
   all mesoderm, with the exception of the Spemann organizer, is originally
   specified as ventral type, such as lateral plate and primary blood
   islands. It is proposed that the blood islands become restricted to the
   ventralmost mesoderm because they are not exposed to the BMP-inhibiting
   activity of the Spemann organizer. We present evidence here that,
   contrary to predictions of this model, the blood islands remain
   ventrally restricted even in the absence of Spemann organizer signaling.
   We further observed that inhibition of FGF signaling with a dominant
   negative receptor resulted in the expansion of the blood island-forming
   territory with a concomitant loss of somite. The requirement for FGF
   signaling in specifying somite versus blood island territories was
   observed as early as midgastrulation. The nonoverlapping expression
   domains of Xnr-2 and Xbra in the gastrula marginal zone appear to mark
   presumptive blood island and somite, respectively. Inhibition of FGF
   signaling with dominant negative receptor leads to an expansion of Xnr-2
   expression and to a corresponding reduction in Xbra expression. On the
   other hand, we found no evidence that manipulation of BMP signaling,
   either positively or negatively, altered the expression domains of Xnr-2
   and Xbra. These results suggest that FGF signaling, rather than
   BMP-inhibiting activity, is essential for restriction of the ventral
   blood islands to ventral mesoderm. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Janus kinases Jak1 and Tyk2 play an important role in urokinase-type
   plasminogen activator (uPA)-dependent signaling. We have recently
   demonstrated that both kinases are associated with the uPA receptor
   (uPAR) and mediate uPA-induced activation of signal transducers and
   activators of transcription (Stat1, Stat2, and Stat4) in human vascular
   smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Janus kinases are not only required for Stat
   activation but may also interfere with other intracellular signaling
   pathways. Here we report that in VSMC, Tyk2 interacts with a downstream
   signaling cascade involving phosphatidylinositol S-kinase (PI3-K). me
   demonstrate that uPA induces PI3-K activation, which is abolished in
   VSMC expressing the dominant negative form of Tyk2. The regulatory
   subunit p85 of PI3-K. co-immunoprecipitates with Tyk2 but not with Jak1,
   Jak2, or Jak3, and uPA stimulation increases the PI3-K activity in Tyk2
   immunoprecipitates. Tyk2 directly binds to either of the two Src
   homology 2(SH2)p85 domains in a uPA-dependent fashion. me provide
   evidence that the Tyk2-mediated PI3-K activation in response to uPA is
   required for VSMC migration. Thus, two unrelated structurally distinct
   specific inhibitors of PI3-K, wortmannin and LY294002, prevent VSMC
   migration induced by uPA. No migratory effect of uPA was observed in
   VSMC expressing the dominant negative form of Tyk2. Our results
   underscore the versatile function of Tyk2 in uPA-related intracellular
   signaling and indicate that PI3-K plays a selective role in the
   regulation of VSMC migration.}},

Journal = {{BLOOD}},

Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{4152-4159}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Despite the discovery of thrombopoietin (TPO) and its contribution to
   megakaryocytopoiesis, the exact mechanisms and sites of platelet
   production are unknown. It has been shown that mature megakaryocytes
   (MKs) functionally express the stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF-1)
   receptor, CXCR4. SDF-1-induced migration of mature MKs through
   endothelial cell layers results in increased platelet production.
   Because the migration of polyploid MKs from the bone marrow
   microenvironment requires remodeling of the perivascular extracellular
   matrix, it was hypothesized that mature polyploid MKs may express matrix
   metalloproteinases (MMPs), facilitating their exit into the bone marrow
   extravascular space. In this report, it is demonstrated that SDF-1
   induces the expression and release of gelatinase B (MMP-9) by purified
   mature polyploid human MKs and an adeno-CXCR4-infected megakaryocytic
   cell line. Neutralizing antibody to MMP-9, but not MMP-2, blocked
   SDF-1-induced migration of MKs through reconstituted basement membrane,
   suggesting that expression of MMP-9 is critical for MK migration.
   Incubation of mature MKs with a synthetic MMP inhibitor,
   5-phenyl-1,10-phenanthrolene, resulted in the inhibition of platelet
   formation, suggesting that the expression of MMPs is not only critical
   for megakaryocyte migration but also for subsequent platelet release.
   Confirming these results, adeno-SDF-1 injection into normal mice
   resulted in increased platelet counts, a process that could be blocked
   by a synthetic MMP inhibitor. These results suggest mobilization of MKs
   involves sequential expression and activation of chemokine receptors
   such as CXCR4, MMP-9, followed by transendothelial migration, MMP
   inhibitors may have potential use in the treatment of thrombotic and
   myeloproliferative disorders. (C) 2000 by The American Society of

Abstract = {{Over time, the epidemiologic and demographic characteristics of AIDS
   have changed in the United States, while the use of highly active
   antiretroviral therapy has changed the natural history of the disease.
   The goal of the study was to ascertain any changes in the epidemiologic,
   immunologic, pathologic, or clinical characteristics of AIDS-related
   lymphoma (ARL) over the course of the AIDS epidemic. Records of 369
   patients with ARL diagnosed or treated at a single institution from 1982
   through 1998 were reviewed. Single institutional data were compared to
   population-based data from the County of Los Angeles. Significant
   changes in the demographic profile of patients with newly diagnosed ARL
   have occurred, with the later time intervals associated with a higher
   prevalence in women (P = .25), in Latino/Hispanic individuals (P <
   .0001), and in those who acquired human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
   heterosexually (P = .01). These changes were similar in both countywide,
   population-based analyses and in those from the single institution. The
   median CD4(+) lymphocyte count at lymphoma diagnosis has decreased
   significantly over the years, from 177/dL in the earliest time period
   (1982-1986), to 53/dL in the last time period from 1995 to 1998 (P =
   .0006). The pathologic spectrum of disease has also changed, with a
   decrease in the prevalence of small noncleaved lymphoma (P = .0005) and
   an increase in diffuse large cell lymphoma (P < .0001). Despite changes
   in the use of antiretroviral or chemotherapy regimens, the median
   survival has not significantly changed. (C) 2000 by The American Society

Abstract = {{Purpose: To examine the relationship between received dose, received
   dose-intensity (RDI), and survival in patients with osteosarcoma.
   Patients and Methods: Between 1983 and 1993,the European Osteosarcoma
   Intergroup (EOI) conducted two randomized trials involving patients with
   high-grade, nonmetastatic, biopsy-proven osteosarcoma of the extremity.
   These trials shared a common treatment arm of doxorubicin (DOX) 75
   mg/m(2) and cisplatin (CDDP) 100 mg/m(2) planned for six cycles at
   3-week intervals. Definitive surgery was scheduled at week 9, after
   three cycles. Survival time was calculated from 122 days, the scheduled
   end of chemotherapy.
   Results: A total of 287 patients randomized to DOX/CDDP received at
   least one cycle of chemotherapy, and 232 (81\%) received all six cycles.
   On average, 79\% of the intended dose of DOX and 80\% of the intended
   dose of CDDP was given. Mean time to completion of chemotherapy was 1.27
   times that specified by the protocol. Mean RDI was 0.64 for DOX (SD =
   0.19) and 0.65 for CDDP (SD = 0.18). Progression-free survival was lower
   for those who received one to five cycles compared with those who
   completed all six cycles (hazards ratio, 1.69; 95\% confidence interval,
   1.03 to 2.78). Survival and progression-free survival were lowest for
   patients with RDI less than 0.6, although these differences were not
   statistically significant at the 5\% level, There was no clear evidence
   of preoperative dose or dose-intensity influencing histologic response.
   Conclusion: This analysis did not establish a clear survival benefit far
   increasing received dose or dose-intensity in the context of this
   two-drug regimen. The hypothesis that increasing dose-intensity may
   improve survival in osteosarcoma requires prospective evaluation. J Clin
   Oncol 18:4028-4037. (C) 2000 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of calcein acetoxymethyl ester (calcein/AM) on macromolecular
   synthesis, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mode of death were
   studied in U-937 GTB lymphoma cells. This was accomplished by
   measurements of C-14-labeled thymidine and leucine incorporation,
   5,5',6,6' -tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolyl carbocyanine
   iodide (JC-1) and caspase-3 activity measurements, TdT-mediated dUTP
   nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, morphology, and a newly developed
   assay of apoptosis detection, the microculture kinetic assay (MiCK).
   This assay, based on absorbance measurements of cells, has been reported
   to reflect morphological changes in apoptosis. At 2.5 mug/mL, rapid
   inhibition of DNA and protein synthesis resembling that of the known
   inhibitors, aphidicholin and cycloheximide, was observed. Decreased
   mitochondrial membrane potential was evident after I hr of exposure and
   was followed by an increase in caspase-3 activity, while at 6 hr 30\% of
   cells appeared positive with TUNEL staining. After 12 hr of exposure,
   viability was less than 5\% as judged by morphological examination. In
   the MiCK assay, calcein (2.5 mug/mL) gave a rapid rise in absorbance
   after 3.5 hr of exposure with a peak at 5 hr, indicating maximum extent
   of apoptosis at that time. This was similar to the pattern generated for
   etoposide and doxorubicin. The results indicate that calcein, similar to
   cytotoxic drugs, induces a strong apoptotic response within hours of

Abstract = {{B cell Ag receptor editing is a process that can change kappa antigen
   recognition specificity of a B cell receptor through secondary gene
   rearrangements on the same allele, In this study we used a model mouse
   pre-B cell line (3839) to examine factors that might affect allelic
   targeting of secondary rearrangements of the kappa locus. We isolated
   clones that showed both productive and nonproductive rearrangements of
   one kappa allele, while retaining the other kappa allele in the germline
   configuration (kappa (+)/kappa degrees or kappa (-)/kappa degrees). In
   the absence of any selective pressures, subsequent rearrangement of the
   germline alleles occurred at the same frequency as secondary
   rearrangement of the productive or nonproductive rearranged alleles,
   Because 38B9 cells lack Ig heavy chains, we stably expressed heavy chain
   protein in 38B9 cells to determine whether heavy-light pairing might
   affect allelic targeting of secondary kappa rearrangements, Although the
   expression of heavy chain was found to both pair with and stabilize
   kappa protein In these cells, it had no effect on preferential targeting
   V kappa -J kappa receptor editing compared with rearrangement of a

Title = {{Partial sciatic nerve transection as a model of neuropathic pain: a

Journal = {{PAIN}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{97-106}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{One of the most commonly used experimental animal models for neuropathic
   pain is the chronic constriction injury (CCI) where four loose ligatures
   are tied around the sciatic nerve. One disadvantage of this model is the
   introduction of foreign material into the wound, which causes a local
   inflammatory reaction. Thus the distinction between the neuropathic and
   the inflammatory component of pain is difficult in this model. In order
   to produce a pure nerve lesion, we performed a partial sciatic nerve
   transection (PST; a modification of the Seltzer model) in female
   Sprague-Dawley rats and compared behavior and nerve pathology. These
   rats developed thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia comparable
   to the CCI model. Recovery of these symptoms was found between days 40
   and 60 after the nerve lesion. Som-animals still showed symptoms on day
   101, which was associated with a neuroma formation. The main
   pathological findings in the endoneurium in nerve segments distal to the
   lesion were edema, loss of myelinated fibers and increase in endoneurial
   cells, especially macrophages. In the epineuriurn the number of
   macrophages was strikingly increased after CCI compared with PST,
   indicating that the response of the immune system is different in a
   structural lesion with and without foreign material. In conclusion, PST
   is a pure nerve injury model without an epineurial inflammatory
   component due to foreign material and is therefore well suited for
   studying the role of local endoneurial processes in the development and
   maintenance of neuropathic pain. Also, the importance of regeneration in
   the termination of hyperalgesia can convincingly be shown in this model.

   to STM experiments. Frequency shift versus distance curves are analyzed
   to determine the forces between probing tip and sample using the force
   separation method. The short-range chemical forces are in good agreement
   with an exponential law. The decay lengths of these chemical forces are
   found to be twice as large as the decay length of the tunneling current,
   as predicted by a simple theoretical model. However, both lengths are
   significantly larger than expected for metallic adhesive interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Background, Long congenital tracheal stenosis is a life-threatening
   condition, and the available surgical treatments do not give
   satisfactory long-term results.
   Methods. Human embryonic tracheas were implanted in the abdominal
   cavities of nude mice until their differentiation was completed. These
   differentiated tracheas were used to patch-repair surgically induced
   tracheal stenosis in piglets. The human, mouse, or pig origin, of all
   the cells in the two successive xenotransplants in the nude mouse and
   the pig, was determined on tissue sections by in situ hybridization with
   species-specific DNA probes.
   Results, The transplanted pigs thrived and reached normal adulthood,
   irrespective of the administration of immunosuppressive treatment. The
   human tracheal tissue developed in nude mice conserved human structures,
   with the exception of feeding capillaries, which were of mouse origin.
   The tracheal patch in the adult healthy pigs comprised only pig cells
   organized into a fibrous scar, which was covered by normal pig
   epithelium.
   Conclusions. Results suggest that human embryonic trachea grown in nude
   mice can be successfully used as patch tracheoplasty for long congenital
   tracheal stenosis without conventional immunosuppression.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies suggest that stress-induced atrophy and loss of
   hippocampal neurons may contribute to the pathophysiology of depression.
   The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of antidepressants
   on hippocampal neurogenesis in the adult rat, using the thymidine analog
   bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) as a marker for dividing cells. Our studies
   demonstrate that chronic antidepressant treatment significantly
   increases the number of BrdU-labeled cells in the dentate gyrus and
   hilus of the hippocampus. Administration of several different classes of
   antidepressant, but not non-antidepressant, agents was found to increase
   BrdU-labeled cell number, indicating that this is a common and selective
   action of antidepressants. In addition, upregulation of the number of
   BrdU-labeled cells is observed after chronic, but not acute, treatment,
   consistent with the time course for the therapeutic action of
   antidepressants. Additional studies demonstrated that antidepressant
   treatment increases the proliferation of hippocampal cells and that
   these new cells mature and become neurons, as determined by triple
   labeling for BrdU and neuronal- or glial-specific markers. These
   findings raise the possibility that increased cell proliferation and
   increased neuronal number may be a mechanism by which antidepressant
   treatment overcomes the stress-induced atrophy and loss of hippocampal
   neurons and may contribute to the therapeutic actions of antidepressant
   treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and release into mammal CSF plays a
   fundamental role in the etiogenesis of fever induced by the
   proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and other
   pyrogens. The source and mechanism of IL-1 beta -induced intracellular
   Ca2+ mobilization was investigated using two experimental models. IL-1
   beta (10 ng/ml) treatment of rat striatal slices preloaded with
   Ca-45(2+) elicited a delayed (30 min) and sustained increase (125-150\%)
   in spontaneous Ca-45(2+) release that was potentiated by L-arginine (300
   muM) and counteracted by N-omega -nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)
   (1 and 3 mM). The nitric oxide (NO) donors diethylamine/NO complex
   (sodium salt) (0.3 and 1 mM) and spermine/NO (0.1 and 0.3 mM) mimicked
   the effect of IL-1 beta on Ca2+ release. IL-1 beta stimulated tissue
   cGMP concentration, and dibutyryl cGMP enhanced Ca2+ release. The guanyl
   cyclase inhibitors 1H-{[}1,2,4]oxadiazole{[}4,3-a] quinoxalin-1-one (100
   muM) and 6-{[}phenylamino]-5,8 quinolinedione (50 muM) counteracted Ca2+
   release induced by 2.5 but not 10 ng/ml IL-1 beta. Ruthenium red (50
   muM) and, to a lesser extent, heparin (3 mg/ml) antagonized IL-1 beta
   -induced Ca2+ release, and both compounds administered together
   completely abolished this response. Similar results were obtained in
   human astrocytoma cells in which IL-1 beta elicited a delayed (30 min)
   increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ({[}Ca2+](i)) (402 +/-
   71.2\% of baseline), which was abolished by 1 mM L-NAME. These data
   indicate that the NO/cGMP-signaling pathway is part of the intracellular
   mechanism transducing IL-1 beta -evoked Ca2+ mobilization in glial and
   striatal cells and that the ryanodine and the
   inositol-(1,4,5)-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ stores are involved.}},

Abstract = {{Because many preventable medication errors occur at the ordering stage,
   a program for improving the quality of writing inpatient orders and
   outpatient prescriptions at one institution was developed.
   To determine whether potential problems existed in the order-writing
   process tot inpatients, all physician orders for a seven-day period in
   1997 were reviewed (n = 3740). More than 10\% of all orders had
   illegible handwriting or were written with a felt-tip pen, which makes
   NCR copies difficult to read. Other potential errors were also
   identified. Following educational programs for physicians and residents
   focusing on the importance of writing orders clearly, physician orders
   were reviewed for a 24-hour period (n = 654). The use of felt-tip pens
   decreased to 1.37\% of all orders, and no orders had illegible
   handwriting. A similar quality improvement approach was used to evaluate
   the outpatient prescription-writing process. A review of all new
   prescriptions for a consecutive seven-day period at a local
   hospital-owned community pharmacy (n = 1425) revealed that about 15\% of
   the prescriptions had illegible handwriting and roughly 10\% were
   incomplete. Additional data were gathered through a survey sent to 71
   outside provider pharmacies requesting information on problems related
   to prescriptions written by physicians from the institution; 66\%
   responded. Failure to print prescriber name (96\%), illegible signature
   (94\%), failure to include DEA number (89\%), and illegible handwriting
   other than signature (69\%) were reported as the main problems. Each
   physician was given a self-inking name stamp to use when writing
   prescriptions. In addition, educational programs covering examples of
   poorly written prescriptions and the legal requirements of a
   prescription were held for physicians and residents. A follow-up survey
   showed that 72\% of pharmacies saw stamps being used; when stamps were
   not used, however, illegible signatures continued to be a problem.
   Follow-up reviews of outpatient prescriptions indicate improvements in
   handwriting and completeness, but continuing educational efforts are
   needed. The quality of order writing for inpatients and outpatients
   continues to be monitored on a regular basis.
   Ongoing educational programs, followup reminders, and feedback to
   physicians have greatly improved the prescription-writing habits of
   physicians.}},

Abstract = {{In rheumatoid synovial tissues, synovial fibroblasts are activated by
   proinflammatory cytokines and proliferate to develop hyperplastic pannus
   tissues, which irreversibly damage the affected joints. We recently
   reported that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p16(INK4a) and
   p21(Cip1) are not expressed in vivo in rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts,
   but are readily inducible in vitro. This observation was followed by the
   successful treatment of rat adjuvant arthritis by local p16(INK4n) gene
   transfer, showing that the inhibition of the cell cycle of the synovial
   cells ameliorates the arthritis. In this study, we show that another
   animal model of rheumatoid arthritis, murine collagen-induced arthritis,
   can be effectively treated by local gene transfer of p21Cip1 as well as
   that of p16(INK4a). Th, anti-arthritic effects were observed even when
   the treatment was conducted after the arthritis had developed.
   Furthermore, the effects included suppression of the expression of
   proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Our
   results demonstrate that the ectopic expression of cyclin-dependent
   kinase inhibitors not only prevents synovial overgrowth but also
   ameliorates the proinflammatory milieu in the affected joints. The
   induction of p21(Cip1) in rheumatoid synovial tissues by pharmacological
   agents may also be an effective strategy to treat rheumatoid arthritis.}},

Abstract = {{Head-and-neck squamous-cell cancer (HNSCC) is an important public-health
   problem, accounting for approximately 40,300 new cancer cases and 12,000
   cancer deaths annually in the United States (Greenlee et (al., 2000),
   Patients with early-stage disease are often cured with surgery or
   radiotherapy but are at high risk for second primary tumor (SPT)
   development (Lippman and Hong, 1989), and the majority of patients
   present with advanced disease, for which the outcomes have not markedly
   improved despite advances in combined-modality therapy (Vokes et al,,
   1993). HNSCC arises from transformation of the genetic material of
   normal cells, followed by successive genetic alterations in a multistep
   fashion, leading to clonal evolution of progeny cells with a
   proliferative advantage (Vogelstein and Kinzler, 1993), induced by the
   Field-wide exposure to tobacco carcinogens (Slaughter et (II., 1953).
   Chemoprevention aims at reversal of this process through re-regulation
   of growth and differentiation and possibly elimination of genetically
   and phenotypically aberrant clones. Chemoprevention studies in upper
   aerodigestive tract (UADT) cancers are based on these fundamental
   premises and the identification of molecular genetic and biologic
   cellular changes. These alterations represent biomarkers of the
   carcinogenesis process and ultimately, if validated, could serve as
   intermediate end points for these studies. Int. J, Cancer 88:852-855,

Abstract = {{Organic anion secretion by human hepatocytes was characterized using
   primary liver parenchymal cell cultures and the anionic fluorescent dye
   carboxy-2',7'-dichrorofluorescein (CF). Probenecid, a well-known common
   blocker of the membrane transport process for anions, was shown to
   increase CF accumulation in primary human hepatocytes by inhibiting
   cellular CF efflux in a dose-dependent manner, thereby establishing the
   presence of an efflux system for organic anions in cultured hepatocytes.
   Outwardly directed transport of CF from hepatocytes was found to be
   temperature-dependent; it was not altered by changes in the ionic
   composition of the incubation medium used in efflux experiments. In
   addition to probenecid, Various structurally and functionally unrelated
   xenobiotics such as glibenclamide, rifampicin, vinblastine, MK-571,
   indomethacin, and cyclosporin A were shown to inhibit secretion of CF by
   primary human hepatocytes, thus suggesting that organic anion excretion
   by human liver may be impaired by various drugs. Northern blot and
   Western blot analyses of the expression of multidrug resistance proteins
   (MRP), such as MRP1 and MRP2, which are known to mediate cellular
   outwardly directed transport of organic anions indicated that MRP2 was
   present at substantial levels in cultured human hepatocytes as well as
   in their in vivo counterparts, whereas MRP1 expression was only barely
   detectable. These results therefore suggest that MRP2, unlike MRP1, may
   contribute to the organic anion efflux system displayed by primary human
   hepatocytes and inhibited by a wide range of xenobiotics. BIOCHEM

Abstract = {{We studied whether the beta -adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol (ISO),
   regulates Na,K-ATPase in alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) via a
   mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ extracellular signaling related
   kinase (ERK) dependent pathway. ISO increased ERK activity in AEC by 10
   min via a beta -adrenergic receptor, protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent
   mechanism. Activation of the MAPK pathway by ISO, resulted in increased
   Na,K-ATPase beta 1and alpha1 subunit protein abundance in whole cell
   lysates, which resulted in functional Na,K-ATPases at the basolateral
   membranes. ISO did not change the alpha1 or beta1 mRNA steady state
   levels, but rapamycin, the inhibitor of the mammalian target of
   rapamycin, also blocked the ISO-mediated increase in Na,K-ATPase total
   protein abundance, suggesting a posttranscriptional regulation. We
   conclude that ISO, regulates the Na,K-ATPase in AEC via PKA, ERK and
   rapamycin-sensitive mechanisms. (C) 2000 Federation of European

   which it differs in having a broader, stepped spire, a proportionally
   shorter but broader aperture, and a deeply impressed sutural canal.
   Merica deynzeri differs from other Philippine species of Merica by its
   deeply impressed sutural canal, its much stronger and coarser axial and
   spiral sculpture, more rounded aperture, and its lack of banding
   pattern. Merica ektyphos can be distinguished from all other described
   species of Merica in its distinctively heavy inflated shell, as well as
   by its extremely coarse axial and spiral sculpture.}},

Abstract = {{We have studied the transport propel-ties of a high quality
   one-dimensional constriction formed in an undoped GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs
   heterostructure and therefore largely free of the random potential of
   ionized donors. We induce an electron gas electrostatically and are able
   to vary the sheet carrier density (n(2D)) by a factor of at least seven.
   The constriction shows resonance-free integer conductance plateaus and
   the additional ``0.7 structure,{''} a plateaulike feature, the
   conductance of which decreases from about 0.80 towards 0.5 x 2e(2)/h at
   low and high n(2D) This low value is unaffected by a high in-plane
   magnetic field, supporting previous evidence and theories that the
   breaking of the spin degeneracy at high fields persists in some form,
   even at zero field. The height of the feature generally seen at a
   conductance of about 0.85 x 2 e(2)/h at high de bias also varies, and we
   show that this is in reasonable agreement with a simple relation linking
   the conductances of the two features. We use a source-drain bias to
   study the spin splitting of the lowest one-dimensional subbands, and
   find a spin gap that is independent of n(2D) for the first subband. We
   discuss possible reasons for the splitting, and show how various models
   for the 0.7 structure can be applied in the finite bias regime.}},

Abstract = {{The chondrocytes of adult articular cartilage rely upon transport
   phenomena within their avascular extracellular matrix for many
   biological activities. Therefore, changes in matrix structure which
   influence cytokine transport parameters may be an important mechanism
   involved in the chondrocyte response to tissue compression. With this
   hypothesis in mind, partitioning and diffusion of 3-, 10-, and 40-kDa
   dextrans conjugated to tetramethylrhodamine, and 430-Da
   tetramethylrhodamine itself, mere measured within statically compressed
   bovine articular cartilage explants using a novel experimental apparatus
   and desorption fluorescence method. Partitioning and diffusion were
   examined as functions of solute molecular weight and matrix proteoglycan
   density, and diffusion was measured versus static compression up to 35\%
   volumetric strain. In general, partition coefficients and diffusivities
   were found to decrease with increasing solute molecular weight. In
   addition, for a given solute, diffusivities decreased significantly with
   increasing static compression. Results therefore suggest a possible role
   for transport limitations of relatively large molecular weight solutes
   within the extracellular matrix in mediating the biological response of
   chondrocytes to cartilage compression. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{High-temperature scanning tunneling microscope investigation of Ir(110)
   reveals that the originally \{331\} faceted room-temperature surface
   flattens upon heating to form (1 x 3) + (1 x 1) and eventually (1 x 2)
   missing row reconstructed terraces at about 800 K, thus finally
   resolving a long-standing controversy on its equilibrium configuration.
   The surprising structural transformations can be explained by a surface
   stress related mechanism that is consistent also with the reconstruction
   behavior of the other low index planes of the noble metals.}},

Abstract = {{The oncofoetal antigen 5T4 is a 72 kDa glycoprotein expressed at the
   cell surface. It is defined by a monoclonal antibody, mAb5T4, that
   recognises a conformational extracellular epitope in the molecule.
   Overexpression of 5T4 antigen by tumours of several types has been
   linked with disease progression and poor clinical outcome. Its
   restricted expression in non-malignant tissue makes 5T4 antigen a
   suitable target for the development of antibody directed therapies. The
   use of murine monoclonal antibodies for targeted therapy allows the
   tumour specific delivery of therapeutic agents. However, their use has
   several drawbacks, including a strong human anti-mouse immune (HAMA)
   response and limited tumour penetration due to the size of the
   molecules. The use of antibody fragments leads to improved targeting,
   pharmacokinetics and a reduced MAMA. A single chain antibody (scFv)
   comprising the variable regions of the mAb5T4 heavy and light chains has
   been expressed in Escherichia coli. The addition of a eukaryotic leader
   sequence allowed production in mammalian cells. The two 5T4 single chain
   antibodies, scFvST4WT19 and LscFvST4, described the same pattern of 5T4
   antigen expression as mAb5T4 in normal human placenta and by FAGS.
   Construction of a 5T4 extracellular domain-IgGFc fusion protein and its
   expression in COS-7 cells allowed the relative affinities of the
   antibodies to be compared by ELISA and measured in real time using a
   biosensor based assay. MAb5T4 has a high affinity, K-D = 1.8X10(-11) M,
   as did both single chain antibodies, scFvST4WT19 K-D = 2.3X10(-9) M and
   LscFvST4 K-D = 7.9X10(-10) M. The small size of this 5T4 specific scFv
   should allow construction of fusion proteins with a range of biological
   response modifiers to be prepared whilst retaining the improved
   pharmacokinetic properties of scFvs. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{We develop a coupled-cluster theory with single and double excitations
   in the framework of the equation-of-motion approach, to study the
   electronic excitations and linear and nonlinear optical properties of
   conjugated oligomers: the linear polyenes and paraphenylenevinylenes. It
   is found that this approach can provide extremely high accuracy in
   calculating the ground-state and ionic excited-state properties. The
   accuracy is relatively poor for the even-parity covalent excited states
   (2A(g) for instance) since the molecular-orbital basis is not
   appropriate to describe such spin excitations. The linear and nonlinear
   optical coefficients are calculated via the correction vector method. We
   stress that special attention should be paid to the secular terms, which
   have been either neglected or improperly included in previous studies
   for the third-order molecular polarizability; within a single and double
   excitation framework, it is imperative to fully include this term;
   however, at the single configuration interaction or random-phase
   approximation level, this term should be deliberately excluded.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge about adhesion checkpoints is important to counteract
   dissemination of cells from solid tumors. Lack of anchorage in adherent
   cells is associated with growth arrest and inhibition of
   cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) required to drive cell cycle
   progression. Because cyclin-cdk complex activation requires
   CDK-activating kinase comprising cdk7 and cyclin H, we now investigated
   their relationship to decreased proliferation by lack of cell spreading.
   This report shows that either UV irradiation on an adhesive substrate or
   culture on a nonadhesive substrate produced K1735 melanoma growth
   arrest. Inhibition of proliferation by UV primarily induced the cdk
   inhibitor p21WAF1 without a significant effect on cyclin H and cdk7. In
   contrast, lack of adhesion to substratum decreased cyclin H but not cdk7
   with accumulation of a slower migrating, presumably unphosphorylated
   cdk4 isoform, These results mere paralleled by decreased cdk7-mediated
   phosphorylation of GST-cdk2 and lower activation of a
   baculovirus-derived cdc2-cyclin B kinase complex. This is the first
   report showing that cyclin II-mediated down-regulation of cdk-activating
   kinase activity is involved in growth arrest induced by lack of

Abstract = {{The crystal structure of d(CATGGCCCATG)(2) shows unique stacking
   patterns of a stable B<->A-DNA intermediate. We evaluated intrinsic base
   stacking energies in this crystal structure using an ab initio quantum
   mechanical method. We found that all crystal base pair steps have
   stacking energies close to their Values in the standard and crystal
   B-DNA geometries, Thus, naturally occurring stacking geometries were
   essentially isoenergetic while individual base pair steps differed
   substantially in the balance of intrastrand and inter-strand stacking
   terms, Also, relative dispersion, electrostatic and polarization
   contributions to the stability of different base pair steps were very
   sensitive to base composition and sequence context. A large stacking
   flexibility is most apparent for the CpA step, while the GpG step is
   characterized by weak intra-strand stacking. Hydration effects were
   estimated using the Langevin dipoles solvation model, These calculations
   showed that an aqueous environment efficiently compensates for
   electrostatic stacking contributions, Finally, we have carried out
   explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulation of the d(CATGGGCCCATG)(2)
   duplex in water, Here the DNA conformation did not retain the initial
   crystal geometry, but moved from the B<->A intermediate towards the
   B-DNA structure. The base stacking energy improved in the course of this
   simulation. Our findings indicate that intrinsic base stacking
   interactions are not sufficient to stabilize the local conformational
   variations in crystals.}},

Abstract = {{The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Twist is highly
   conserved from Drosophila to vertebrates and plays a major role in
   mesoderm specification of triploblasts. The presence of a Twist
   homologue in diploblasts such as the cnidarian Podocoryne carnea raises
   questions on the evolution of mesoderm, the third cell layer
   characteristic for triploblasts. Podocoryne Twist is expressed in the
   early embryo until the myoepithelial cells of the larva differentiate
   and then again during medusa development. There, the gene is detected
   first when the myoepithelial cells of the polyp dedifferentiate to form
   the medusa bud and later Twist is found transiently in the entocodon, a
   mesoderm-like cell layer which differentiates into the smooth muscle and
   striated muscle of the bell. On the other hand, in later bud stages and
   the medusa, expression is seen where non-muscle tissues differentiate.
   Experimental analysis of in vitro transdifferentiation and regeneration
   demonstrates that Twist activity is not needed when isolated striated
   muscle regenerate medusa organs. Developmental roles of Twist are
   discussed with respect to early animal evolution from a common ancestor
   of cnidarians and bilaterians. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Pimelic acid formation for biotin biosynthesis in Bacillus subtilis has
   been proposed to involve a cytochrome P450 encoded by the gene biol. We
   have subcloned bioI and overexpressed the encoded protein, BioI. A
   purification protocol was developed utilizing ion exchange, gel
   filtration, and hydroxyapatite chromatography, Investigation of the
   purified BioI by UV-visible spectroscopy revealed spectral properties
   characteristic of a cytochrome P450 enzyme. BioI copurifies with
   acylated Escherichia coli acyl carrier protein (ACP), suggesting that in
   vivo a fatty acid substrate may be presented to BioI as an acyl-ACP. A
   combination of electrospray mass spectrometry of the intact acyl-ACP and
   GCMS indicated a range of fatty acids were bound to the ACP. A
   catalytically active system has been established employing E. coli
   flavodoxin reductase and a novel, heterologous flavodoxin as the redox
   partners for BioI. In this system, BioI cleaves a carbon-carbon bond of
   an acyl-ACP to generate a pimeloyl-ACP equivalent, from which pimelic
   acid is isolated after base-catalyzed saponification. A range of free
   fatty acids have also been explored as potential alternative substrates
   for BioI, with C16 binding most tightly to the enzyme. These fatty acids
   are also metabolized to dicarboxylic acids, but with less
   regiospecificity than is observed with acyl-ACPs. A possible mechanism
   for this transformation is discussed. These results strongly support the
   proposed role for BioI in biotin biosynthesis. In addition, the
   production of pimeloyl-ACP explains the ability of BioI to function as a
   pimeloyl CoA source in E. coli, which, unlike B. subtilis, is unable to
   utilize free pimelic acid for biotin production. (C) 2000 Academic

Abstract = {{Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces
   apoptosis via the death receptors DR4 and DR5 in different transformed
   cells in vitro and exhibits potent antitumor activity in vivo with minor
   side effects, The synthetic retinoid CD437 is a potent inducer of
   apoptosis in cancer cells through increased levels of death receptors.
   We demonstrate that treatment of human lung cancer cells with a
   combination of suboptimal concentrations of CD437 and TRAIL enhanced
   induction of apoptosis in tumor cell lines with wild-type p53 but not in
   normal lung epithelial cells. CD437 up-regulated DR4 and DR5 expression.
   The CD437 and TRAIL combination enhanced activation of caspase-3,
   caspase-7, caspase-8, and caspase-9 and the subsequent cleavage of
   poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and DNA fragmentation factor 45. Caspase
   inhibitors blocked the induction of apoptosis by this combination.
   Moreover, this combination induced Bid cleavage and increased cytochrome
   c release from mitochondria, These results suggest that the mechanism of
   enhanced apoptosis by this combination involves p53-dependent increase
   of death receptors by CD437, activation of these receptors by TRAIL,
   enhanced Bid cleavage, release of cytochrome c, and activation of
   caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-8, and caspase-9, These findings suggest a
   novel strategy fur the prevention and treatment of human lung cancer
   with the CD437 and TRAIL combination.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of trichostatin A (TSA), histone deacetylase inhibitor, on

   acid resistant (MKN-7 and Ho-I-N-I) and IFN-beta resistant cell lines
   (MKN-7, -28 and -45). TSA inhibited growth in all cell lines examined.
   Apoptotic cell death was confirmed by apoptotic ladder formation and
   induction of a cleaved form (85 kDa) of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
   (PARP) induction. TSA enhanced the protein expression of p21(WAF1),
   CREB-binding protein, cyclinE, cyclin A, Bak and Fax, while it reduced
   the expression of E2F-1, E2F-4, HDAC1, p53 and hyperphosphorylated form
   of ph. Furthermore, TSA induced morphological changes, such as
   elongation of cytoplasm and cell-to-cell detachment, in gastric and oral

Abstract = {{Core-binding factors (CBFs) are a small family of heterodimeric
   transcription factors that play critical roles in several developmental
   pathways, including hematopoiesis and bone development. Mutations in CBF
   genes are found in leukemias and bone disorders. CBFs consist of a
   DNA-binding CBF alpha subunit (Runx1, Runx2, or Runx3) and a
   non-DNA-binding CEF beta subunit. CBF alpha binds DNA in a
   sequence-specific manner, whereas CBF beta enhances DNA binding by CBF
   alpha. Recent structural analyses of the DNA-binding Runt domain of CBF
   alpha and the CBF beta subunit identified the heterodimerization
   surfaces on each subunit. Here we identify amino acids in CBF beta that
   mediate binding to CBF alpha. We determine the energy contributed by
   each of these amino acids to heterodimerization and the importance of
   these residues for in vivo function. These data refine the structural
   analyses and further support the hypothesis that CBF beta enhances DNA
   binding by inducing a conformational change in the Runt domain.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the back reaction of quantum electrodynamics upon an
   electric field E(x(+)) = - A(-)'(x(+)) which is parallel to x(3) and
   depends only on the light cone coordinate x(+) = (x(0) + x(3))/root2.
   Novel features are that the mode functions have simple expressions for
   arbitrary A(-)(x(+)) and that one cannot ignore the usual light cone
   ambiguity at zero + momentum. Each mode of definite canonical momentum
   k(+) experiences pair creation at the instant when its kinetic momentum
   p(+) = k(+) - eA(-)(x(+)) vanishes, at which point operators from the
   surface at x(-) = - infinity play a crucial role. Our formalism permits
   a more explicit and complete derivation of the rate of particle
   production than is usually given. We show that the system can be
   understood as the infinite boost limit of the analogous problem of an
   electric field which is homogeneous on surfaces of constant x(0).}},

Abstract = {{Risk assessment of dioxins is currently based on induction of liver
   tumors in rats, The toxicity of dioxins is characterized by large
   sensitivity differences among animal species and even strains of the
   same species, which complicates the risk assessment, The significance of
   these differences in dioxin-induced carcinogenicity is not known. We
   therefore studied the liver tumor-promoting activity of
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in the sensitive Long-Evans
   (L-E) and the resistant Han/ Wistar (H/W) rats differing > 1000-fold in
   their sensitivity to the acute lethality of TCDD. Female rats were
   partially hepatectomized, initiated with nitrosodiethylamine, and
   treated with TCDD for 20 weeks. Altered hepatic foci (AHF) were
   stereologically quantitated using glutathione S-transferase P as a
   marker. AHF were significantly (P < 0.001) and dose dependently
   increased in L-E rats at 10 and 100 ng/kg/day, but in H/W fats only at
   1000 ng/kd/day and above, indicating a remarkable (<similar to>100-fold)
   sensitivity difference between L-E and H/W rats. The same sensitivity
   difference hut Ill-fold less foci were observed between
   nonhepatectomized/noninitiated L-E and H/W rats. Induction of AHF was
   related to hepatotoxicity but not to cytochrome P4501A1 activity in the
   liver. Liver TCDD concentrations were similar in both strains. H/W rats
   are exceptionally resistant to induction of AHF by TCDD, and the
   resistance is associated with an altered transactivation domain of the
   aryl hydrocarbon receptor. Genetic differences may account for
   significant interindividual/ intraspecies sensitivity differences in
   dioxin-induced carcinogenesis. Understanding the role of transactivation
   domain of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in carcinogenesis is therefore
   likely to improve dioxin risk assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Hemocyanins are large oligomeric respiratory proteins found in many
   arthropods and molluscs. The hemocyanin of the tarantula Eurypelma
   californicum is a 24-mer protein complex with molecular mass of
   1,726,459 Da that consists of seven different polypeptides (a-g); each
   occupying a distinct position within the native molecule, Here we report
   the complete molecular structure of the E. californicum hemocyanin as
   deduced from the corresponding cDNAs, This represents the first complex
   arthropod hemocyanin to be completely sequenced. The different subunits
   display 52-66\% amino acid sequence identity. Within the subunits, the
   central domain, which bears the active center with the copper-binding
   sites A and B, displays the highest degree of identity. Using a homology
   modeling approach, the putative three-dimensional structure of
   individual subunits was deduced and compared. Phylogenetic analyses
   suggest that differentiation of the individual subunits occurred 400-550
   million years ago. The hemocyanin of the stemline Chelicerata was
   probably a hexamer built up of six distinct subunit types a, b/c, d, e,
   f, and g, whereas that of the early Arachnida was originally a 24-mer
   that emerged after the differentiation of subunits b and c.}},

Abstract = {{Beyond the normal DNA transactions mediated by topoisomerase II, we have
   recently demonstrated that the cleavage activity of the two human
   topoisomerase II isoforms is several-fold stimulated if a ribonucleotide
   rather than a deoxyribonucleotide is present at the scissile
   phosphodiester in one strand of the substrate. Here we show that
   ribonucleotides exert a position-specific effect on topoisomerase
   II-mediated cleavage without altering the sequence specificity of the
   enzyme, Ribonucleotides located within the 4 bp cleavage stagger
   stimulate topoisomerase Ii-mediated cleavage, whereas ribonucleotides
   located outside the stagger in general have an inhibitory effect,
   Results obtained from competition experiments indicate that the
   position-specific effect of ribonucleotides on topoisomerase II activity
   is caused by altered substrate interaction. When cleavage is performed
   with substrates containing one ribonucleotide in both strands or several
   ribonucleotides in one strand the effect of the individual
   ribonucleotides on cleavage is not additive, Finally, although
   topoisomerase II recognizes substrates with longer stretches of
   ribonucleotides, an RNA/DNA hybrid where one strand is composed entirely
   of RNA is not cleaved by the enzyme. The positional effect of
   ribonucleotides on topoisomerase Ii-mediated cleavage shares many
   similarities to the positional effect exerted by either abasic sites or
   base mismatches, demonstrating a general influence of DNA imperfections
   on topoisomerase II activity.}},

Abstract = {{The spectra of X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and extended
   X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) were measured in the
   ferromagnetic quasicrystals (a stable decagonal phase of
   Al40Mn25Fe15Ge20, a unstrained icosahedral phase of Al50Pd15Mn20B15, a
   strained icosahedral phase of Al42.5Pd7.5Mn30B20) and the orthorhombic
   approximant crystalline phase of Al30Mn40B30. In Al40Mn25Fe15Ge20, the
   intensity of XMCD at Mn K-edge and Fe K-edge were -7x10(-5) and
   -5x10(-5), respectively, which are normalized by the edge jump of the
   normal absorption spectra. The values suggest that Mn and Fe in this
   alloy contribute to the magnetism to the same degree. From the result of
   EXAFS, the nearest neighbors of Mn atoms and Fe atoms were analyzed to
   be at the same distance. The environment around Mn and Fe were found not
   so similar except for the nearest neighbor distance. In Al50Pd15Mn20B15,
   Al42.5Pd7.5Mn30B20 and Al30Mn40B30 alloys, the intensity of XMCD around
   the Mn K-edge were about -3x10(-4). The magnetic moments of Mn atoms in
   these alloys are roughly estimated to be 0.8 mu (B). The difference of a
   magnetic structure was detected between the quasicrystals and the
   approximant. The result of EXAFS analysis indicates that the distances
   from Mn to its first nearest neighbor and its second nearest neighbor
   are almost equal. The existence of phason strain field have no
   appreciable influence on the moment of Mn. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Collagenase-1 {[}matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1] is expressed by
   stromal fibroblasts of various invasive malignant tumors. Here, we have
   examined the molecular mechanisms of tumor-induced expression of MMP-1
   by stromal fibroblasts. Treatment of fibroblasts with conditioned media
   of tumor cells derived from squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the oral
   cavity and larynx resulted in activation of fibroblast MMP-1 expression
   at the transcriptional level. The induction of MMP-1 expression
   correlates with activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38
   mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphorylation of c-Jun and
   activating transcription factor-2(ATF-2) and is dependent on the
   activity of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Furthermore, using
   fibroblasts derived from JNK2-/- mice, we show that JNK2 is required for
   induction of fibroblast collagenase-3 expression in response to
   conditioned SCC tumor cell medium. Together, these results provide
   evidence that stress-activated p38 and JNK pathways play a crucial role
   in paracrine regulation of collagenolytic capacity of stromal
   fibroblasts in SCCs and suggest JNK2 as a novel target. for inhibition
   of MMP-1 expression and tumor invasion.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a case of unilateral stringhalt present for 18
   months in the right hind limb of a 4-year-old Warmblood gelding. The
   only abnormalities detected by e;extromyography (EMG) were a proloonged
   insertion activity, fibrillation potentials, and positive waves at rest
   and enhanced EMG activity in the right lateral digital extensor muscle
   on muscle contraction. This was interpreted as denervation and
   hyperirritability of this muscle. Both similarities and differences with
   Australian stringhalt could be found. As described for horses suffering
   from Australian stringhalt, phenytoin sodium was administered orally in
   a dosage ranging from 15 to 9.3 mg/kg body weight in order to tr to
   influence the hyperflexia. Therapeutic effects without side effects
   could be achieved at plasma concentrations between 5.1 and 9.9 mg/L at a
   dosage of 12 mg/kg body weight twice daily, which is consistent with
   data in the literature (5-10 mg/L). The EMG examination seems to help to
   clarify the aetiology of the classical form of stringhalt, since the
   only abnormality in this patient was an abnormal electrical activity in
   the lateral digital extensor muscle. As in Australian stringhalt, in
   this type of stringhalt phenytoin also relieved the hyperflexion of the

Abstract = {{Simultaneous blockade of the CD40 and CD28 T cell costimulatory pathways
   effectively promotes skin allograft survival in C3H/HeJ mice, extending
   median survival times (MSTs) beyond 100 days. This strategy is markedly
   less effective in C57BL/6 mice, with MSTs ranging between 20 and 30
   days. In this study, we investigate the underlying genetic causes of
   these distinct phenotypes, Using H-2 congenic mice, we show that the
   genetic basis for the varied responses between these two strains is
   independent of the H-2 locus and T cell precursor frequency. C57BL/6
   mice treated with costimulation blockade are able to generate
   allospecific CTL- and IFN-gamma -producing T cells within 3-4 wk
   posttransplant, whereas mice with a C3H background generate neither CTL-
   nor IFN-gamma -producing cells. Thus, differences appear to be in the
   generation of the immune response and not T cell homing. Strain
   differences in costimulation blockade-induced hyporesponsiveness persist
   in the absence of CD4(+) T cells, implying a direct effect on CD8(+) T
   cells. We demonstrate that genetic differences are important in cells of
   hemopoietic origin and that the costimulation blockade-resistant
   phenotype is dominant. Analysis of BXH recombinant inbred strains
   indicates that multiple loci contribute to the phenotype, and that the
   blockade resistance loci are preliminarily linked to 17 markers on four
   chromosomes. We conclude that strain variation in allograft MSTs
   following CD40/CD28 blockade results from the ability of CDS' T cells in
   some strains to use alternative modes of costimulation to mount an
   effective alloresponse.}},

Abstract = {{Channeling Monte Carlo simulations, in combination both with Rutherford
   backscattering (RBS) and pal-ride-induced X-ray emission (PIXE), have
   been performed on model quasicrystals of decagonal Al-Cu-Co with
   different amount of phason disorder. Comparing our simulation results to
   experimental data we obtain the best agreement For those models with a
   large amount of phason disorder. This leads us to the conclusion that
   the sample of d-Al-Cu-Co used in the measurements is a random tiling.
   Besides the aspect of phason disorder we also examined the Cu and Co
   distribution given by the Burkov models (S.E. Burkov, Phys. Rev. B 47
   (1993) 12325). We show that the chemical distribution is in contrast to
   the experimental PIXE yield profiles. By exchanging some of the Cu and
   Co positions it is possible to eliminate the discrepancy. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Human KRIT1 (Krev interaction trapped 1), a defective gene product in
   cerebral cavernous malformation, was cloned from a HeLa cell cDNA
   library by virtue of its interaction with Krev/rap1A, a small ras-family
   GTPase. We have now characterized the full-length cDNA for the murine
   orthologue that encodes a predicted protein of 736 amino acids, 207
   amino acids longer than the previously reported human protein. 5' Rapid
   amplification of cDNA ends analysis of mouse mRNA demonstrated a single
   transcriptional start site. The putative initiator codon was found
   within a context that conformed well to the Kozak consensus sequence and
   was preceded by an in-frame termination codon. BLAST analysis revealed
   that conceptual translation of a fragment of human genomic DNA upstream
   of the 5' end of the reported KRIT1 coding sequence predicts extension
   of the human open reading frame by 207 codons with 95\% amino acid
   identity between the novel putative human and murine amino termini. This
   block of coding sequence was divided among four exons that are flanked
   by consensus splice site sequences. The extreme evolutionary
   conservation of this region, including a putative nuclear localization
   signal, indicates functional importance. These data have immediate
   relevance to mutation screening efforts in cerebral cavernous
   malformation and may contribute to our understanding of the normal
   biology of KRIT1 and the pathogenesis of this disorder. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{We use the two-phase partitioning method to purify the plasma membrane
   vesicles as materials, and investigate the influence of water stress on
   the physical state of plasma. Our experiments show that, as the
   concentration of PEG increases (that is, as the extent of water stress
   increases), the fluorescent time and even fluorescent time of long-life
   composition of DPH decreases, the fluorescent polarized value of DPH and
   the fluorescent intensity of MC 540 increase. All of these imply that
   water stress makes plasma membranes vesicles small, the flowing and
   surface charge density of plasma membrane decreases. It also suggests
   the hydrophobicity reduction. In our further experiments, the time of
   long-time composition of intrinsic tryptophane decreased, and the
   activity of H+-ATPase reduced, which suggests the change of
   configuration and function of plasma membrane proteins. As a result, we
   thought that the change of the lipid physical state of plasma membranes
   is the primary response of possible awareness to water stress. (C) 2000

   is in vacuo, the electrostatic potential spreads mon widely than that of
   O-20 and is more negative by 6.8 kcal mol(-1) around O-3; the O-3
   lone-pair electron ionization energy is lower by 0.11 eV, and
   consequently, the hydrogen-bonded water-O-3 complex is more stable by
   2.8 kJ mol(-1) at 0 K. In CCl4 at 298 K, the hydrogen bonding of a
   phenol to O-3 is more favorable than hydrogen bonding of a phenol to
   O-20 by 3.1 and 3.6 kJ mol(-1) on the Gibbs energy and enthalpy scales,
   respectively. In pure hexafluoro-2-propanol, higher basicity and lower
   steric hindrance allows O-3 to be a triple-hydrogen bond acceptor, while
   O-20 is at most a double acceptor. The higher hydrogen-bond basicity and
   coordination number of O-3 compared to those of O-20 explain the
   octanol-water partition of progesterone. In the solid state, O-3-bonded
   water molecules exhibit a characteristic network of hydrogen bonds, and
   we find (i) more frequent hydrogen-bonded contacts to O-3, (ii) longer
   C-3=O bonds in the complexes, and (iii) shorter and more Linear OH . .
   .O-3 hydrogen bonds. These in vitro geometric and thermodynamic hydrogen
   bonding parameters agree well with the hydrogen bonding of progesterone
   to its human receptor.}},

Title = {{Partitioning the transcriptional program induced by rapamycin among the
   effecters of the Tor proteins}},
Journal = {{CURRENT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},

Pages = {{1574-1581}},

Abstract = {{Background: In all organisms, nutrients are primary regulators of
   signaling pathways that control transcription. In Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae, the Tor proteins regulate the transcription of genes
   sensitive to the quality of available nitrogen and carbon sources.
   Formation of a ternary complex of the immunosuppressant rapamycin, its
   immunophilin receptor Fpr1p and Tor1p or Tor2p results in the nuclear
   import of several nutrient- and stress-responsive transcription factors.
   Results: We show that treating yeast cells with rapamycin results in a
   broader modulation of functionally related gene sets than previously
   understood. Using chemical epistasis and vector-based global expression
   analyses, we partition the transcriptional program induced by rapamycin
   among five effecters (TAP42, MKS1, URE2, GLN3, GAT1) of the Tor
   proteins, and identify how the quality of carbon and nitrogen sources
   impinge upon components of the program. Biochemical data measuring Ure2p
   phosphorylation coupled with the partition analysis indicate that there
   are distinct signaling branches downstream of the Tor proteins.
   Conclusions: Whole-genome transcription profiling reveals a striking
   similarity between shifting to low-quality carbon or nitrogen sources
   and treatment with rapamycin. These data suggest that the Tor proteins
   are central sensors of the quality of carbon and nitrogen sources.
   Depending on which nutrient is limited in quality, the Tor proteins can
   modulate a given pathway differentially. Integrating the partition
   analysis of the transcriptional program of rapamycin with the
   biochemical data, we propose a novel architecture of Tor protein
   signaling and of the nutrient-response network, including the
   identification of carbon discrimination and nitrogen discrimination
   pathways.}},

Abstract = {{The expression of the linked but reciprocally imprinted Igf2 and H19
   genes is activated in adult liver in the course of tumor development. By
   in situ hybridization analysis we have shown that both the Igf2 and H19
   RNAs are expressed in the majority of the neoplastic nodules, and that
   hepatocellular carcinomas are developed in an experimental model of
   liver carcinogenesis. H19 is also highly activated in smaller and less
   distinct hyperplastic regions, The few neoplastic areas showing Igf2 but
   no H19 RNA display loss of the maternally inherited allele at the
   Igf2/H19 locus. These data are compatible with the existence of a common
   activation mechanism of these two genes during liver carcinogenesis and
   with a stronger H19 induction in the pre-neoplastic lesions. By using
   mice carrying a deletion of the H19 endodermal enhancer, we show that
   this regulatory element is necessary for the activation of the lgf2 and
   H19 genes upon induction of liver carcinogenesis. Furthermore, multiple
   sites of the H19 endodermal enhancer region become hypersensitive to
   DNase I when the carcinogenesis process is induced. Lastly, liver tumors
   developed in mice paternally inheriting the H19 enhancer deletion are
   found to have marked growth delays, increased frequency of apoptotic
   nuclei, and lack of Igf2 mRNA expression, thus indicating that this
   regulatory element plays a major role in the progression of liver
   carcinogenesis, since it is required for the activation of the
   anti-apoptotic lgf2 gene.}},

Abstract = {{A series of 2,3-benzodiazepine derivatives has been previously described

   11H-{[}1,2,4]triazolo{[}4,5-c] {[}2,3]benzodiazepin-3(2H)-ones (6) was
   synthesized starting from the corresponding bicyclic
   1-aryl-3,5-dihydro-7,8-dimethoxy-4H-2,3 (2, CFM). The new compounds were
   found to possess anticonvulsant effects against seizures induced both by
   means of auditory;stimulation hi DBA/2 mice and by pentylenetetrazole or
   maximal electroshock in Swiss mice. In addition,they antagonize the
   AMPA-induced seizures, and their anticonvulsant activity;is reversed by
   pretreatment with aniracetam, thus suggesting the involvement of AMPA
   receptors. The pharmacological studies revealed that the
   11H-{[}1,2,4]triazolo {[}4,5-c]{[}2,3]benzodiazepin-3(2H)-ones (6)
   herein reported show anticonvulsant activity comparable to that of their

   corresponding 2, the agents likely to be mainly responsible for the

   (Et{[}Ind](2)ZrCl2)/methylaluminoxane (MAO) gives rise to phenomenal
   increase of T-g upon annealing. Unaveraged solid-state C-13 NMR
   resonance of the CH carbons in the norbornene (53 and 49 ppm) evidenced
   the conformation conversion from T{[}X]T and G{[}M]G to more stable
   T{[}X]G conformers (where {[}X] = {[}T] or {[}G] represent the

   the conversion, local packing of the rigid chain subsequently occurs.
   Synchrotron source X-ray diffraction provides clear evidence of the
   averaged interchain contraction from 12.0 to 8.5 Angstrom and a tighter
   distribution in the spacing after annealing. In the preannealed state,
   T-1p(H) relaxation time revealed both mobile (where conformer converts)
   and rigid components (where conformation is frozen), which coalesce into
   a further rigid component after extended annealing. The mechanisms

Abstract = {{Background-Two mammalian digitalis-like factors, an ouabain-like
   compound (OLC) and marinobufagenin (MBG), exhibit specificity to alpha
   -3 and alpha -1 Na+, K+-ATPase isoforms, respectively. We compared
   regulation of MBG and OLC by acute NaCl loading in Dahl salt-sensitive
   (DS) and salt-resistant (DR) rats.
   Methods and Results-An intraperitoneal NaCl load (0.8 g/kg) was given to
   adult male rats (24 DS and 24 DR). Diuresis, natriuresis, renal
   excretion, and tissue levels of MBG and OLC were measured. Inhibition of
   renal Na+,K+-ATPase by MBC and ouabain was compared in DS, DR, and
   Wistar rats. DS (versus DR) exhibited a smaller peak (2 hours)
   natriuretic response (1.34+/-0.10 versus 2.08+/-0.14 mmol.kg(-1.)h(-1);
   P<0.01), despite a greater plasma Na+ (153+/-2 versus 145+/-1 mmol/L;
   P<0.01). In DS and DR, pituitary, adrenal, and plasma OLC exhibited
   transient 2-fold to 3-fold increases, followed by a decrease to baseline
   levels. Plasma and adrenal MBG doubled in both strains within 1 hour of
   NaCl loading and remained elevated. Eight-hour MBG excretion in DS was
   4-fold greater than in DR (15.8+/-0.8 versus 3.6+/-0.4 pmol; P<0.01),
   whereas OLC excretion in DS was only 30\% greater than in DR (16.1+/-1.1
   and 11.9+/-0.8 pmol; P<0.05). Kidney Na+,K+-ATPase (alpha -1 isoform)
   from Wistar rats and DS exhibited greater sensitivity to MBC than to
   ouabain.
   Conclusions-NaCl loading of DS causes transient increase in OLC but
   sustained increases in MBG tissue levels and excretion. We hypothesize
   that increased MBG production occurs in an attempt to compensate for
   genetically impaired pressure-natriuresis mechanisms.}},

   microscope. The lower nanotube, with gold contacts at both ends, acted
   as the central island of a single-electron transistor while the upper
   one functioned as a gate electrode. Coulomb blockade oscillations were
   observed on the nanotube at sub-Kelvin temperatures. The voltage noise
   of the nanotube single-electron transistor (SET) was gain dependent as
   in conventional SETs. The charge sensitivity at 10 Hz was 6x10(-4)
   e/root Hz. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{The enantiomerically pure bis-imino bis-quinoline ligands R,R-ImQ and
   S,S-ImQ have been prepared by Schiff condensation of 2-quinoline
   carboxyaldehyde with the pure R,R and S,S enantiomers of
   trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane; Both ligands form 2:2 helical complexes
   with Cu-I perchlorate, and the crystal and molecular structure of
   {[}Cu-2(R,R-ImQ)(2)]ClO4.H2O have been determined by X-ray diffraction
   methods: the {[}Cu-2(R,R-ImQ)(2)](2+) molecular cation is a chiral
   double helix of M handedness, in which the two ligands are entertwined
   in such an arrangement that half of each ligand is not equivalent to the
   other half of the same ligand. Coupled circular dichroism and H-1 NMR
   studies reveal that in CH3CN solution a rearrangement takes place toward
   a more symmetric helical structure (in which the two halves of the same
   ligand become equivalent), which mantains the same handedness found in
   the solid state and is a pure M isomer. Solid state and CH3CN solution
   CD experiments confirm that {[}Cu-2(S,S-ImQ)(2)]ClO4.H2O, both in
   solution and in the solid state, is a purl double helix of P handedness,
   i.e., the enantiomer of the species containing the RR ligand.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a detailed study of the beta decay continuum
   background in a spaceborn Ge spectrometer (SPI) and methods for its
   reduction. In the nuclear gamma -ray line energy range (10 keV, 20 MeV),
   much of the continuum background in the Ge spectrometers is due to the
   cosmic-ray generated protons and neutrons interacting in the detectors
   themselves. We have performed Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the
   neutron spectrum inside the EGO shield of the spectrometer SPI, thus
   allowing the calculation of the continuum background induced by the beta
   (-) and beta (+) decays of the Ge residuals nuclides. It is shown that
   if we use the Pulse Shape Discrimination (PSD) and energetic signatures
   in energy ranges well chosen to reduce the background, the main effect
   is an improvement of the sensitivity of SPI. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The directed movement of fibroblasts towards locally released
   platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a critical event in wound
   healing. Although recent studies have implicated polarized activation of
   phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase in G protein-mediated chemotaxis, the
   role of 3' PI lipids in tyrosine kinase-triggered chemotaxis is not well
   understood. Using evanescent wave microscopy and green fluorescent
   protein-tagged Akt pleckstrin homology domain (GFP-AktPH) as a molecular
   sensor, we show that application of a shallow PDGF gradient triggers a
   markedly steeper gradient in 3' PI lipids in the adhesion zone of
   fibroblasts, Polar GFP-AktPH gradients, as well as a new type of radial
   gradient, were measured from front to rear and from the periphery to the
   center of the adhesion zone, respectively. A strong spatial correlation
   between polarized 3' PI production and rapid membrane spreading
   implicates 3' PI lipids as a direct mediator of polarized migration.
   Analysis of the temporal changes of 3' PI gradients in the adhesion zone
   revealed a fast diffusion coefficient (0.5 mum(2)/s) and short lifetime
   of 3' Pls of <1 min. Together, this study suggests that the tyrosine
   kinase-coupled directional movement of fibroblasts and their radial
   membrane activity are controlled by local generation and rapid
   degradation of 3' PI second messengers.}},

Abstract = {{Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is an autosomal recessive disorder of
   cholesterol biosynthesis caused by mutations of the 7-dehydrocholesterol
   (7DHC) reductase gene (DHCR7), We present our experience with prenatal
   diagnosis of an affected fetus with a very mild form of SLOS, The mother
   underwent prenatal diagnosis by chorionic villus (CV) sampling at 11 2/7
   weeks because of having two prior affected sons with SLOS. The
   7DHC/total-sterol ratio in the fetus was higher than in normal control
   fetuses but lower than the ratio observed in CV of three other fetuses
   in whom SLOS was diagnosed prenatally. The pregnancy was terminated at
   13 2/7 weeks. The level of 7DHC in amniotic fluid (AF) obtained at the
   time of pregnancy termination was unequivocally elevated, confirming the
   diagnosis of SLOS, This report illustrates the difficulties with the
   interpretation of biochemical prenatal diagnosis based on the
   determination of 7DHC/total-sterol ratio in CV sample in a case of mild
   SLOS, whereas biochemical testing of amniotic fluid clearly manifests
   the biochemical defects of SLOS as early as 13 weeks of gestation. 2000

   isomeric mixture of fac/mer-Mo(CO)(3) (dppf)(eta (2)-C-60);(2) in 21\%
   yield, the photolysis of Mo(CO)(4)(dppf) and {[}60]fullerene in
   chlorobenzene at ambient temperature affords 2 in 87\% yield. Similarly,
   mer-W(CO)(3)(dppf)(eta (2)-C-60) (3), {[}mer-W(CO)(3)(dppf)](2)(eta
   (2)eta (2)-C-70) (4); mer-W(CO)(3)(dppf) (eta (2)-C-70) (5), and
   {[}mer-W(CO)a (dPPf)](2)(eta (2),eta (2)-C-70) (6) can be prepared by
   photolysis of W(CO)(4)(dppf) With {[}60]- or {[}70]fullerene in 87\%,
   13\%; 51\%, and 48\% yields, respectively. While all the new compounds
   1-6 have been characterized by elemental analyses and spectroscopic
   techniques, the structures of 1, W(CO)(4)(dppf), and 3 have been
   confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses, The cyclic
   voltammetric responses of 2 and 3 show that their sequential fullerene
   -centered reductions are shifted toward more negative potential values
   by about 0.2 V with respect to those of free C-60 Such a negative shift
   is quite similar to that previously observed for the related complexes
   W(CO)(3)(dPPb)(eta (2)-C-60) and Mo(CO)(3)(dppe)(eta (2)-C-60) Moreover,
   the fullerene-centered reductions of 5 are negatively shifted by about
   0.1 V with respect to free C-70, thus supporting that the eta
   (2)-coordination of the W(CO)(3)(dppf) fragment to fullerenes causes a
   higher electronic interaction with C-60 than with C-70.}},

Abstract = {{Trisomy 4 mosaicism is rare. To our knowledge only two cases of
   prenatally diagnosed trisomy 4 mosaicism have been reported. One case
   resulted in a normal liveborn male, the other resulted in an abnormal
   liveborn female. The karyotype of our case at the time of amniocentesis
   was 47,XY,+4{[}3]/46,XY{[}33] and resulted in a normal liveborn male,
   FISH analysis using an alpha satellite chromosome 4 probe was performed
   to confirm the cytogenetic findings. Follow-up chromosome analysis of
   cord blood, peripheral blood, foreskin, and umbilical cord fibroblasts
   showed a normal 46,XY male karyotype in all cells. FISH analysis of cord
   blood, umbilical cord fibroblasts, and amniotic fluid cells demonstrated
   two signals in 246 nuclei (i.e., 46,XY) and three signals in six nuclei
   (i.e., 47,XY,+4), Here we describe the present case of trisomy 4
   mosaicism, the literature is reviewed, and the significance of this
   finding is discussed. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{We present broadband radio observations of the afterglow of GRB 000301C,
   spanning from 1.4 to 350 GHz for the period of 3-130 days after the
   burst. These radio data, in addition to measurements in the optical
   bands, suggest that the afterglow arises from a collimated outflow,
   i.e., a jet. To test this hypothesis in a self-consistent manner, we
   employ a global fit and find that a model of a jet expanding into a
   constant-density interstellar medium (ISM + jet) provides the best fit
   to the data. A model of the burst occurring in a wind-shaped circumburst
   medium (wind-only model) can be ruled out, and a wind + jet model
   provides a much poorer fit of the optical/IR data than the ISM + jet
   model. In addition, we present the first clear indication that the
   reported fluctuations in the optical/IR are achromatic, with similar
   amplitudes in all bands, and possibly extend into the radio regime.
   Using the parameters derived from the global fit, in particular a jet
   break time t(jet) approximate to 7.3 days, we infer a jet opening angle
   of theta (0) approximate to 0.2 rad; consequently, the estimate of the
   emitted energy in the GRB itself is reduced by a factor of 50 relative
   to the isotropic value, giving EB approximate to 1.1 x 10(51) ergs.}},

Abstract = {{SKS and SKKS shear waves recorded on the INDEPTH III seismic array
   deployed in central Tibet during 1998-1999 have been analyzed for the
   direction and extent of seismic polarization anisotropy. The 400-km-long
   NNW trending array extended south to north, from the central Lhasa
   terrane, across the Karakoram-Jiali fault system and Banggong-Nujiang
   suture to the central Qiangtang terrane. Substantial splitting with
   delay times from 1 to 2 s, and fast directions varying from E-W to
   NE-SW, was observed for stations in the Qiangtang terrane and
   northernmost Lhasa terrane. No detectable splitting was observed for
   stations located farther south in the central Lhasa terrane. The change
   in shear wave splitting characteristics occurs at 32 degreesN,
   approximately coincident with the transcurrent Karakoram-Jiali fault
   system but similar to 40 km south of the surface trace of the
   Banggong-Nujiang suture. This location is also near the southernmost
   edge of a region of high Sn attenuation and low upper mantle velocities
   found in previous studies. The transition between no measured splitting
   and strong anisotropy (2.2 s delay time) is exceptionally sharp (less
   than or equal to 15 km), suggesting a large crustal contribution to the
   measured splitting. The E-W to NE-SW fast directions are broadly similar
   to the fast directions observed farther east along the Yadong-Golmud
   highway, suggesting that no large-scale change in anisotropic properties
   occurs in the east-west direction. However, in detail, fast directions
   and delay times vary over lateral distances of similar to 100 km in both
   the N-S and E-W direction by as much as 40 degrees and 0.5-1 s,
   respectively. The onset of measurable splitting at 32 degreesN most
   likely marks the northern limit of the underthrusting Indian
   lithosphere, which is characterized by negligible polarization
   anisotropy. Taken in conjunction with decades of geophysical and
   geological observations in Tibet, the new anisotropy measurements are
   consistent with a model where hot and weak upper mantle beneath northern
   Tibet is being squeezed and sheared between the advancing Indian
   lithosphere to the south and the Tsaidam and Tarim lithospheres to the
   north and west, resulting in eastward flow and possibly thickening and
   subsequent detachment due to gravitational instability. In northern
   Tibet, crustal deformation clearly follows this large-scale deformation
   pattern.}},

Volume = {{424}},
Pages = {{327-365}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Sound pressure fields generated by coaxial collisions of two vortex
   rings with equal/unequal strengths are simulated numerically. The
   axisymmetric, unsteady, compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved
   by a finite difference method, not only for a near field but also for a
   far field. The sixth-order-accurate compact Pade scheme is used for
   spatial derivatives, together with the fourth-order-accurate Runge-Kutta
   scheme for time integration. The results show that the generation of
   sound is closely related to the change of direction of the vortex ring
   motion induced by the mutual interaction of the two vortex rings. For
   the case of equal strength (head-on collision), the change of direction
   is associated with stretching of the vortex rings. Generated sound waves
   consist of compression parts and rarefaction parts, and have a
   quadrupolar nature. For the case of unequal strengths, the two vortex
   rings pass through each other; the weaker vortex ring moves outside the
   stronger vortex ring which shows a loop motion. The number of generated
   waves depends on the relative strength of the two vortex rings. The
   sound pressure includes dipolar and octupolar components, in addition to
   monopolar and quadrupolar components which are observed for the case of
   a head-on collision.}},

Abstract = {{In page-oriented memories, data pages commonly consist of comparable
   numbers of ON and OFF pixels. Data-page sparsity is defined by reduction
   of the number of ON pixels per page, leading to an increased diffracted
   power into each pixel. When page retrieval is dominated by a fixed noise
   floor, the number of pages in the memory is limited by the pixel
   diffraction efficiency. Sparsity increases the number of storable pages
   while reducing the amount of user information per page. A detailed
   analysis of sparsity in volume holographic memories shows that the total
   memory capacity can be increased by 15\% by use of data pages that
   contain on average 25\% ON pixels. Sparsity also helps to reduce the
   effects of interpixel cross talk by strongly reducing the probability
   that worst-case pixel patterns (e.g., blocks of ON pixels with a center
   OFF pixel) will occur in the data page. Enumeration block coding
   techniques provide construction of sparse-data pages with minimal
   overhead. In addition, enumeration coding offers maximum-likelihood
   detection with low encoding-decoding latency. We discuss the theoretical
   advantages of data-page sparsity. We also present experimental results
   that demonstrate the proposed capacity gain. The experiment verifies
   that it is practical to construct and use sparse-data pages that result
   in an overall user capacity gain of 16\% subject to a page retrieval
   bit-error rate of 10(-4). (C) 2000 Optical Society of America OCIS

Title = {{Evolution of the geomagnetic reversal rate since 160 Ma: Is the process
   continuous?}},

Abstract = {{Two main interpretations have been advanced for the evolution of the
   geomagnetic reversal rate lambda since about 160 Ma. These
   interpretations have quite different implications for Earth history and
   associated events and processes. Our own interpretation is that lambda
   gradually and continuously decreased from its value of about 4 1/2 per
   million years at about 160 Ma to zero at about 118 Ma, then at about 83
   Ma lambda began to recover, again gradually and continuously, until
   reaching its present value of about 4 1/2 per million years. The
   Cretaceous Superchron occurred from about 118 to about 83 Ma, when the
   reversal rate was zero. Recently, Gallet and Hulot {[}1997] suggested an
   alternative interpretation where mu (=1/lambda) was constant from 160 Ma
   to about 130 Ma, at which time the process was rapidly and strongly
   perturbed. This perturbation led to a discontinuous increase in the mean
   length mu of intervals and caused the Cretaceous Superchron. The process
   then gradually recovered from the strong perturbation with the mean
   length mu gradually decreasing until the reversal process again became
   stationary at about 25 Ma. This interpretation is predicated on mu being
   constant from 160 to 130 Ma, whereas our interpretation requires a
   gradual increase in mu over this time interval. Consequently, a new
   statistic is suggested to distinguish between the null hypothesis that
   the reversal process is stationary against the specific alternative that
   there is a trend in the mean length mu. Application of this statistic
   shows that the data require a trend toward larger values of mu in the
   reversal process going from 160 to 130 Ma and that this trend continues
   strongly to the beginning of the superchron. Thus the addition of a
   discontinuity at 130 Ma is neither required nor supported by the data.
   Furthermore, application of this statistic shows that the trend toward
   smaller values of mu from 83 to 25 Ma appears to continue from 83 Ma to
   at least 12 Ma. Certainly there is no requirement for a change in the
   style of process at 25 Ma. Overall, the Gallet and Hulot interpretation
   seems untenable with the available data. Despite this, the Gallet and
   Hulot interpretation has great value in that it is inherently testable
   and our ability to reject it has increased our knowledge about the
   reversal process.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a method of writing down interacting equations for all the

   variable approach that was used earlier for the free, and lowest order
   interacting cases. The generalization involves, as before, the
   introduction of a parameter to label the different strings involved in
   an interaction. The interacting string has thus becomes a ``band{''} of
   finite width. The interaction equations expressed in terms of loop
   variables, has a simple invariance that is exact even off shell. A
   consistent definition of space-time fields requires the fields to be
   functions of all the infinite number of gauge coordinates tin addition
   to space-time coordinates). The theory is formulated in one higher
   dimension, where the modes appear massless. The dimensional reduction
   that is needed to make contact with string theory (which has been
   discussed earlier for the free case) is not discussed here.}},

Abstract = {{When seismic waves generate a relative fluid-solid motion in a
   fluid-saturated porous medium, the moving charges (streaming current) in
   the electric double layer induce an electromagnetic (EM) field. This
   paper first experimentally confirms that the coupling between the
   seismic wave and the electromagnetic field in the kilohertz range is
   electrokinetic in nature. Seismoelectric signals are measured in
   homogeneous cylindrical porous rock samples and multilayered models. The
   seismoelectric signals in homogeneous rock are electric fields that move
   along with the acoustic wave. The mechanism of the seismoelectric
   conversion is completely different from the piezoelectric effect of
   quarts grains. The seismoelectric sensitivity with respect to salinity
   of the saturant has been experimentally determined. The amplitude of
   seismoelectric signals increases as the saturant conductivity decreases.
   The seismoelectric effects are generated by two different mechanisms.
   Both the EM radiation and the electric potential generated at an
   interface and within a porous medium, respectively, were measured as the
   P wave, at ultrasonic frequencies, passes through the layered models.
   Our experimental results demonstrate that seismoelectric effects exist
   and are measurable in the kilohertz range. The paper concludes with a
   comparison of experimental data and modeled data in a three-layer porous
   model. Seismoelectric measurements could be an effective means of
   obtaining transport coefficients such as hydraulic permeability and
   other porous rock properties.}},

Abstract = {{Regulatory phosphorylation of phospholamban and of SR Ca2+-ATPase
   SERCA2a isoform by endogenous CaM-K II in slow-twitch skeletal and
   cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is well documented, but much less is
   known of the exact functional role of CaM K II in fast-twitch muscle SR.
   Recently, it was shown that RNA splicing of brain-specific alpha CaM K
   II, gives rise to a truncated protein (alpha KAP), consisting mainly of
   the association domain, serving to anchor CaM K II to SR membrane in rat
   skeletal muscle {[}Bayer, K.-U., et al. (1998) EMBO J. 19, 5598-5605].
   In the present study, we searched for the presence of alpha KAP in
   sucrose-density purified SR membrane fractions from representative
   fast-twitch and slow-twitch limb muscles, both of the rabbit and the
   rat, using immunoblot techniques and antibody directed against the
   association domain of alpha CaM K LI. Putative alpha KAP was
   immunodetected as a 23-kDa electrophoretic component on SDS-PAGE of the
   isolated SR from fast-twitch but not from slow-twitch muscle, and was
   further identified as a specific substrate of endogenous CaM K II, in
   the rabbit. Immunodetected, P-32-labeled, non-calmodulin binding
   protein, behaved as a single 23-kDa protein species under several
   electrophoretic conditions. The 23-kDa protein, with defined properties,
   was isolated as a complex with 60-kDa delta CaM K II isoform, by
   sucrose-density sedimentation analysis. Moreover, we show here that
   putative alpha KAP, in spite of its inability to bind CaM in ligand blot
   overlay, co-eluted with delta CaM K II from CaM-affinity columns. That
   raises the question of whether CaM K II-mediated phosphorylation of
   alpha KAP and triadin together might be involved in a molecular
   signaling pathway important for SR Ca2+ release in fast-twitch muscle
   SR. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The Mechanosensitive channel of Large conductance (MscL) allows bacteria
   to rapidly adapt to changing environmental conditions such as
   osmolarity. The MscL channel opens in response to increases in membrane
   tension, which allows for the efflux of cytoplasmic constituents. Here
   we describe the cloning and expression of Salmonella typhimurium MscL
   (St-MscL). The amino acid sequence encoding for this MscL exhibits a
   high degree of similarity to Escherichia coli MscL (Eco-MscL). Using a
   fluorescence efflux assay, we demonstrate that efflux through the MscL
   channel during hypoosmotic shock can be monitored using endogenously
   produced fluorophores. These fluorophores are synthesized by a
   cotransformed gene, cobA. In addition, we observe that thermal
   stimulation, i.e., heat shock, can induce efflux through MscL. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Introduction: The duration of the official disinfection procedure of a
   Hopkins rhinoscope agreed by the hospital hygiene authorities may be a
   handicap in a busy ENT consultation. A shortened procedure is sometimes
   used, but without risk assessment.
   Objective: To determine the risk of contamination of the endoscope used
   for rhinoscopy after simple manual cleaning with a pad impregnated with
   a disinfectant solution (Neosabenyl(R)).
   Patients and method: In 60 patients undergoing rhinoscopy at our ENT
   policlinic, a nasal swab as well as the endoscope were examined
   bacteriologically. The nasal physiological flora and specifically
   Staphylococcus aureus were semiquantitatively analysed on each specimen.
   In 50 patients, the rhinoscopes were simply cleaned with an impregnated
   pad, whereas in 10 patients the official disinfection procedure with
   glutaraldehyde was applied.
   Results: 25 out of the 50 endoscopes (50\%) which were manually cleaned
   with the impregnated pad, were still contaminated with bacteria. Among
   the 12 (20\%) identified healthy carriers of S. aureus, 7 (58\%) showed
   a rhinoscope still contaminated with S. aureus after cleaning with the
   pad. The overall risk of contaminating the following patient with S.
   aureus 14\%. None of the 10 endoscopes cleaned and disinfected with
   glutaraldehyde were contaminated.
   Conclusions: Simple manual cleaning and disinfection with an impregnated
   pad is insufficient and carries the risk of contaminating the following
   patient. This emphasises the need to follow the recommended cleaning and
   disinfection procedures even in a small or busy practice.}},

   Such treatment resulted in dose-dependent (100-300 mg/kg, i.p.)
   increases in the amount of CRF mRNA in both the hypothalamus and
   cerebral cortex. The maxi mal increases were thus apparent with the dose
   of 300 mg/kg in the hypothalamus (+108\%) and cerebral cortex (+49\%) 30
   or 60 min, respectively, after the last drug injection, Foot-shock
   stress administered 30 min after the final drug injection had no effect
   on the pivagabine-induced increases in the abundance of CRF mRNA in the
   hypothalamus or cerebral cortex. Such stress also had no effect on the
   amounts of CRF mRNA in these brain regions of vehicle-treated rats.
   These results demonstrate that pivagabine increases the amount of CRF

Abstract = {{The vacuole is the major site of intracellular Ca2+ storage in yeast and
   functions to maintain cytosolic Ca2+ levels within a narrow
   physiological range via a Ca2+ pump (Pmc1p) and a H+/Ca2+ antiporter
   (Vcx1p) driven by the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase). We examined the
   function of the V-ATPase in cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis by comparing
   responses to a brief Ca2+ challenge of a V-ATPase mutant (vma2 Delta)
   and wild-type cells treated with the V-ATPase inhibitor concanamycin A.
   The kinetics of the Ca2+ response were determined using transgenic
   aequorin as an in vivo cytosolic Ca2+ reporter system. In wild-type
   cells, the V-ATPase-driven Vcx1p was chiefly responsible for restoring
   cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations after a brief pulse. In cells lacking
   V-ATPase activity, brief exposure to elevated Ca2+ compromised
   viability, even when there was little change in the final cytosolic Ca2+
   concentration. vma2 Delta cells were more efficient at restoring
   cytosolic {[}Ca2+] after a pulse than concanamycin-treated wild-type
   cells, suggesting long term loss of V-ATPase triggers compensatory
   mechanisms. This compensation was dependent on calcineurin, and was
   mediated primarily by Pmc1p.}},

Abstract = {{Twinrix(TM) (SmithKline Beecham Biologicals) is a combined hepatitis A
   and B vaccine licensed with a three-dose schedule. A two-dose combined
   hepatitis A and B vaccine would facilitate immunisation programs. In
   this prospective study, 100 healthy adults, aged between 18 and 40, were
   enrolled. A first group of 50 was given a high-dose vaccine at month 0
   and 6. A second group of 50 received Twinrix(TM) at month 0, 1 and 6.
   The reactogenicity was assessed after each vaccine dose. There were no
   severe local adverse events. Seven severe systemic reactions occurred,
   of which five were fatigue, one was headache and one consist in
   gastrointestinal symptoms. They all resolved during the 4-day follow-up
   period. One serious general adverse event was reported, but was clearly
   unrelated to the vaccine. Thus, both vaccines were well tolerated.
   The immunogenicity was evaluated by testing for anti-HBs and anti-HAV
   antibodies. Seroconversion rates and geometric mean titres (GMTs) were
   compared. At month 7, the anti-HAV GMTs were higher in the high-dose
   group than in the Twinrix(TM) group and, inversely, the anti-HBs GMTs
   were slightly higher in the Twinrix(TM) group than in the high-dose
   group. At month 7, all subjects in both groups were positive for
   anti-HAV. All subjects in the high-dose group and 97.6\% subjects in the
   Twinrix(TM) group had seroconverted for anti-HBs. Therefore, it can be
   concluded that with two injections of the high-dose hepatitis A and B
   vaccine, 6 months apart, a similar immune response can be obtained as
   induced with three doses of Twinrix(TM) at months 0, 1 and 6. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Chronic atrophic gastritis is regarded as a predisposing factor for
   gastric cancer associated with Helicobacter pylori infection, and its
   severity is suggested to be a key influence on gastric cancer risk. Our
   purpose was to elucidate chronological change in cumulative risk of
   gastric cancer occurrence with various degrees of chronic atrophic
   gastritis by long-term follow-up. A total of 5373 subjects without
   cancer or resected stomachs who underwent gastroscopic examination and
   completed a life-style questionnaire between 1985-1989 were
   prospectively followed until December 1999. Relative risks of gastric
   cancer associated with baseline endoscopic findings were estimated using
   hazard ratios and their 95\% confidence intervals with the Cox
   proportional hazard model, adjusting for gender, age and gastric cancer
   family history. After an average of 10 years of followup, 117 gastric
   cancer cases were identified. The risk was greatest among the subjects
   with moderate atrophy at baseline (hazard ratio: 2.22) and 4-6 years of
   follow-up (hazard ratio: 4.6-5.0). After this time point, risk
   attenuation with the length of follow-up period was observed. Our study
   gives the supportive evidence to the hypothesis that incomplete chronic
   atrophic gastritis and the processes occurring in atrophy are associated
   with development of gastric cancer. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland

Abstract = {{We examined the membrane topology and functional importance of residues
   in regions of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger NCX1 encompassing the conserved
   internal a repeats by substituted cysteine scanning analysis and kinetic
   analysis of site directed mutants. The results suggest that both the
   alpha -1 repeat and a region encompassing the a-a repeat and its
   immediately C-terminal segment contain reentrant loop domains, each
   oriented in an opposite direction with respect to the membrane, We found
   that single or multiple mutations of six residues including Asn-125 and
   conserved aspartates Asp-130, Asp-825, and Asp-829 in the a repeat
   reentrant domains reduce the apparent affinity of the exchanger for
   extracellular Ca2+ by up to g-fold, In contrast, the triple cysteine
   mutation D130C/D825C/D829C did not influence the current-voltage (I-V)
   relationship of the exchange current. Cysteine accessibility scanning
   with different thiol modifiers suggested that N125C, D130C, and D825C
   may be located in a restricted aqueous space in the membrane accessible
   only to ions when examined with external probes, although N125C and
   D825C were previously shown to be internally accessible during exchange
   reaction. The results suggest that these reentrant domains in the a
   repeats may participate in the formation of the ion transport pathway in
   the exchanger with some of the aspartates possibly lining it or located
   close to it.}},

Abstract = {{We utilized an expression screen to identify two novel Ca2+/calmodulin
   (CaM)-regulated protein kinases in Aspergillus nidulans. The two
   kinases, CMKB and CMKC, possess high sequence identity with mammalian
   CaM kinases (CaMKs) I/IV and CaMKK alpha/beta, respectively. In vitro
   CMKC phosphorylates and increases the activity of CMKB, indicating they
   are biochemical homologues of CaMKK alpha/beta and CaMKI/IV. The
   disruption of CMKB is lethal; however, when protein expression is
   postponed, the spores germinate with delayed kinetics. The observed lag
   corresponds to a delay in the G(1)-phase activation of the
   cyclin-dependent kinase NIMXcdc2. Disruption of cmkC is not lethal, but
   spores lacking CMKC also germinate with delayed kinetics and a lag in
   the activation of NIMXcdc2. Analysis of Delta cmkC suggests a role for
   CMKC in regulating the first and subsequent nuclear division cycles. We
   conclude that both CMKB and CMKC are required for the proper temporal
   activation of NIMXcdc2 as spores enter the cell cycle hom quiescence and
   suggest that this relationship exists during the G(1)/S transition of
   subsequent cell divisions.}},

Abstract = {{We carried out shallow depth indentations on ultra-thin hydrogenated
   amorphous carbon (a-C:H) films deposited by plasma enhanced chemical
   vapour deposition onto silicon and Al2O3-TiC ceramic substrates. These
   measurements are relevant to data storage and microelectronic
   applications, which require sub-50-nm, wear protective overcoats. We
   used the continuous stiffness measurement technique to monitor the Young
   Modulus (E) and the hardness (H) as a function of depth for films with
   thickness varying from 10 to 50 nm. Raman spectroscopy and atomic force
   spectroscopy show that the films have similar roughness and
   microstructural bonding environment. For all films, the sub-30-nm region
   shows a continuous increase of E and H with depth, with no discernible
   tip calibration artifact. Above 30 nm depth, the effect of the film is
   predominant, essentially hardening noticeably the silicon and softening
   slightly the ceramic substrate, with E and H values typical of a-C:H
   materials. Above 50 nm, the E and H curves are dominated by the
   properties of the substrates. Initial nano-scratch experiments indicate
   that the films have better wear resistance than the Al2O3-TiC substrate.
   Therefore, the hardness and wear of the samples show no correlation at
   these shallow depths. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Droloxifene is a tamoxifen derivative whose effects in the therapy of
   human breast cancer and postmenopausal osteoporosis have been studied
   widely. We had found that droloxifene could induce apoptosis of luteal
   cells of rat in vitro, but its mechanisms were unknown. In the present
   study, the expression of c-myc, bax and bcl-2 mRNA in cultured rat
   luteal cells during apoptosis induced by droloxifene was investigated
   and possible associations between these genes and apoptosis were
   analyzed. Cultured luteal cells of rats were incubated with droloxifene
   at various concentrations and with treatment durations. Occurrence of
   apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl
   tranferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling
   (TUNEL), DNA staining and DNA electrophoresis. Expression of these
   genes' mRNA was determined by semi-quantitative reverse
   transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results showed
   that the c-myc and bax mRNA levels increased as concentrations or
   treatment durations of droloxifene increased, while the bcl-2 mRNA level
   exhibited no changes. A marked increase of c-myc and bax mRNA appeared
   respectively with 12 and 24 h of treatment, while a clear increase of
   apoptosis of luteal cells was found at 18 h. These results suggested
   that droloxifene could induce apoptosis of luteal cells of rat in vitro.
   The increase of c-myc mRNA expression might be one of the initiating
   factors and the elevated ratio of bax/bcl-2 mRNA was also probably
   involved in this effect. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper considers the hypothesis that mumps vaccine may be an
   environmental factor for childhood diabetes and the difficulties
   assessing the available information about this. A review was undertaken
   of the published literature about mumps or mumps vaccine and diabetes
   mellitus in childhood. There has been considerable speculation about the
   role of wild mumps virus and mumps vaccine in the onset of childhood
   diabetes. Available data about this is incomplete and difficult to
   interpret partly as several factors are thought to be involved in the
   development of childhood diabetes. Well-designed and long-term studies
   about the use of mumps vaccine and incidence of childhood diabetes could
   be done. The general approach used in this paper could be applied to
   study the health effects of other vaccines. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Human epidermal stem cells express higher levels of beta1 integrins than
   their more differentiated daughters, transit amplifying cells. In a
   search for additional stem and transit cell markers we used proteomics
   and differential cDNA hybridisation to compare keratinocytes
   fractionated on the basis of beta1 integrin expression. There were
   remarkably few differences between the two populations and none of the
   RNAs differed in abundance by more than 2-fold. Nevertheless, proteomics
   revealed upregulated expression of epidermal fatty acid binding protein
   (PA-FABP, also known as E-FABP). Annexin II and two keratin related
   proteins in the transit population. An unknown high molecular mass
   protein was upregulated in the stem cell population. The upregulation of
   PA-FABP was confirmed by Northern blotting and conventional and whole
   mount labelling of human epidermis, We conclude that PA-FABP is a novel

Abstract = {{alpha (2A)-Adrenergic receptors (alpha (2A)AR) are presynaptic
   autoinhibitory receptors of noradrenergic neurons in the central and
   peripheral sympathetic nervous systems, which act to dynamically
   regulate neurotransmitter release. Signaling through the G(i)/G(o)
   family of G-proteins, the receptor subserves numerous homeostatic and
   central nervous system functions. A single nucleotide polymorphism of
   this receptor, which results in an Asn to Lys substitution at amino acid
   251 of the third intracellular loop, was identified in the human
   population. The frequency of Lys-251 was 10-fold greater in
   African-Americans than in Caucasians, but was not associated with
   essential hypertension. To determine the consequences of this
   substitution, wild-type and Lys-251 receptors were expressed in CHO and
   COS-7 cells. Expression, ligand binding, and basal receptor function
   were unaffected by the substitution. However, agonist-promoted
   {[}S-35]GTP gammaS binding was similar to 40\% greater with the Lys-251
   receptor. This enhanced agonist function was observed with
   catecholamines, azepines, and imidazolines albeit to different degrees.
   In studies of agonist-promoted functional coupling to G(i), the
   polymorphic receptor displayed enhanced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase
   (60 +/- 4.4 versus 46 +/- 4.1\% inhibition) and markedly enhanced
   stimulation of MAP kinase (57 +/- versus 15- +/- a-fold increase over
   basal) compared with wild-type alpha (2A)AR. The potency of epinephrine
   in stimulating inositol phosphate accumulation was increased similar to4
   fold with the Lys-251 receptor. Unlike previously described variants of
   G-protein-coupled receptors, where the minor species causes either a
   loss of function or increased non-agonist function, Lys-251 alpha (2A)AR
   represents a new class of polymorphism whose phenotype is a gain of
   agonist-promoted function.}},

Abstract = {{Photoinduced intermolecular electron transfer between Rhodamine 3B and
   N,N-dimethylaniline has been studied in a series of seven liquids:
   acetonitrile, ethanol, propylene glycol, and mixtures of ethanol,
   2-butanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and glycerol. In each
   liquid, the donor and acceptors have different diffusion constants and
   experience distinct dielectric properties. Ps time-dependent
   fluorescence measurements and steady-state fluorescence yield
   measurements were made and analyzed using a detailed statistical
   mechanical theory that includes a distance-dependent Marcus rate
   constant, diffusion with the hydrodynamic effect, and solvent structure.
   All solvent-dependent parameters necessary for calculations were
   measured, including dielectric constants, diffusion constants, and redox
   potentials, leaving the electronic coupling unknown. Taking the
   distance-dependence of the coupling to be beta =1 Angstrom (-1), data
   were fit to a single parameter, the coupling matrix element at contact,
   J(0). The theory is able to reproduce both the functional form of the
   time-dependence and the concentration-dependence of the data in all
   seven liquids by fitting only J(0). Despite the substantial differences
   in the properties of the experimental systems studied, fits to the data
   are very good and the values for J(0) are very similar for all solvents.

   Filamentous hemagglutinin (FI-IB) and pertussis toxin (PT) were

Abstract = {{Protein-tyrosine kinases contain a catalytic loop Arg residue located
   either two or four positions downstream of a highly conserved Asp
   residue, In this study, the role of this Arg (Arg-318) in the
   protein-tyrosine kinase C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) was investigated,
   The observed k(cat) for phosphorylation of the random copolymer
   poly(Glu,Tyr) substrate by Csk R318A is similar to 3000-fold smaller
   compared with that of wild type Csk, whereas the K-m values for ATP and
   poly(Glu,Tyr) are only mildly affected. The k(cat) value for
   poly(Glu,Tyr) phosphorylation by the Csk double mutant A316R,R318A is
   100-fold greater than the k(cat) value for the single R318A mutant,
   suggesting that an Arg positioned at the alternative location fulfills a
   similar function as in wild type, Csk R318A kinase activity can also be
   partially recovered by several exogenous small molecules including
   guanidinium and imidazole, These molecules contain key features whose
   roles in catalysis can be rationalized from a known x-ray structure of
   the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, Imidazole is the best of these
   activators, enhancing phosphorylation rates by Csk R318A up to 100-fold
   for poly(Glu,Tyr) and significantly stimulating Csk R318A
   phosphorylation of the physiologic substrate Src. This chemical rescue
   of mutant protein kinase activity might find applications in cell signal
   transduction experiments.}},

Abstract = {{The present investigation examined the interaction between
   2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine {[}DOM] and non-competitive NMDA
   antagonists in rats trained with DOM {[}0.6 mg/kg; 75 min pretreatment
   time] as a discriminative stimulus. Pretreatment with phencyclidine
   {[}PCP] at a dose of 3 mg/kg shifted the DOM dose-response relationship
   to the left. When a fixed dose of DOM {[}0.1 mg/kg] which by itself
   yielded 32\% DOM-appropriate responding was combined with a range of
   doses of PCP, dizocilpine, and ketamine, DOM-appropriate percentages
   increased to maxima of 73\%, 84\%, and 79\%, respectively. When given
   alone, PCP, dizocilpine, and ketamine were followed by maxima of 36\%,
   15\%, and 13\%, respectively. It is concluded that the effects of DOM as
   a discriminative stimulus are potentiated by pretreatment with
   non-competitive antagonists of glutamate receptors of the NMDA subtype.
   These data suggest that the application of the technique of drug-induced
   stimulus control may prove useful in the reconciliation and integration

Abstract = {{Various vertebrates use ultraviolet (UV) vision for such basic behaviors

   unveils for the first time the general mechanism of UV vision. Most
   contemporary UV pigments in vertebrates have maintained their ancestral
   functions by accumulating no more than one of the five specific amino

   pigment lost UV-sensitivity but some descendants regained it by one

Abstract = {{The electrical conductivity of cubic samples (monoliths) made of
   moderately compressed expanded graphite has been measured along two
   orthogonal directions, namely parallel and perpendicular to the pressing
   force. It is found that these highly porous materials exhibit a
   percolation behaviour, with a transition from insulator to conductor
   occurring at a very low critical density. Besides, the monoliths are
   found to be quite isotropic as their porosity is high; conversely,
   increasing their apparent density makes them become more and more
   anisotropic thanks to the orientation of their constitutive graphite
   particles. Both percolation and effective media theories are shown to
   accurately fit the conductivity data as far as isotropic materials are
   concerned. Microstructural parameters derived from the fits are
   discussed and found to be in fair agreement with the expected
   description of compressed expanded graphite, i.e. insulating voids
   surrounded by thin conducting flakes.}},

Abstract = {{We point out that massive gauged supergravity potentials, for example
   those arising due to the massive breathing mode of sphere reductions in
   M-theory or string theory, allow for supersymmetric (static) domain-wall
   solutions which are a hybrid of a Randall-Sundrum domain wall on one
   side, and a dilatonic domain wall with a runaway dilaton on the other
   side. On the anti-de Sitter (AdS) side, these walls have a repulsive
   gravity with an asymptotic region corresponding to the Cauchy horizon,
   while on the other side the runaway dilaton approaches the weak-coupling
   regime and a non-singular attractive gravity, with the asymptotic region
   corresponding to the boundary of spacetime. We contrast these results
   with the situation for gauged supergravity potentials for massless
   scalar modes, whose supersymmetric AdS extrema are generically maxima,
   and there the asymptotic regime transverse to the wall corresponds to
   the boundary of the AdS spacetime. We also comment on the possibility
   that the massive breathing mode may, in the case of fundamental
   domain-wall sources, stabilize such walls via a Goldberger-Wise
   mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Somatic hybrid plants were produced after protoplast electrofusion
   between a dihaploid potato, cv. BF15, and a wild tuber-bearing relative,
   Solanum phureja, with a view to transferring bacterial wilt resistance
   into potato lines. A total of ten putative hybrids were selected. DNA
   analysis using flow cytometry revealed that six were tetraploids, two
   mixoploids, one amphiploid and one octoploid. In the greenhouse, the
   putative hybrids exhibited strong vigor and were morphologically
   intermediate, including leaf form, flowers and tuber characteristics.
   The hybrid nature of the ten selected plants was confirmed by examining
   isoenzyme patterns for esterases and peroxidases, and analysis of RAPD
   and SSR markers. Analysis of chloroplast genome revealed that eight
   hybrids possessed chloroplast (ct) DNA of the wild species, S. phureja,
   and only two contained Solanum tuberosum ct type. Six hybrid clones,
   including five tetraploids and one amphiploid, were evaluated for
   resistance to bacterial wilt by using race 1 and race 3 strains of
   Ralstonia solanacearum, originating from Reunion Island. Inoculations
   were performed by an in vitro root dipping method. The cultivated potato
   was susceptible to both bacterial strains tested. All somatic hybrids
   except two were tolerant to race 1 strain, and susceptible to race 3
   strain. Interestingly, the amphiploid hybrid clone showed a good
   tolerance to both strains. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A full-length cDNA encoding the Vicia faba L. early nodulin VfEnod12 was
   isolated. The deduced protein sequence specified a 90 amino acid protein
   with a MW of 10 206 and contained a putative signal peptide sequence
   followed by PPX3 repeats characteristic of Enod12 proteins. The VfEnod12
   gene was found to be expressed specifically in root nodules as early as
   3 days post inoculation with Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae. In
   mature nodules, VfEnod12 transcripts were confined to the prefixing zone
   II. A 3.3 kb genomic fragment carrying the complete VfEnod12 coding
   region was isolated. No intervening sequences were identified in the
   coding region. A promoter fragment carrying the -692/-41 region mediated
   reporter gene expression in root cortical cells, module primordia and
   the prefixing zone II of transgenic Vicia hirsuta root nodules. This
   fragment contained a putative binding site for the transcription factor
   ENBP1. In contrast to the highly conserved terminal AATAA motif of the
   ENBP1 binding site of known Enod12 promoters, the VfEnod12 promoter was
   characterized by an altered terminal AATAT sequence. This alteration did

Abstract = {{The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor, Rb, is a transcription cofactor
   that controls cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. Mutant
   mouse embryos lacking Rb exhibit ectopic proliferation and apoptosis
   that are mediated in some tissues by E2F1, a major partner of Rb, and by
   the p53 tumor suppressor. Whether E2F1 and p53 also mediate the
   differentiation defects in Rb mutant embryos is, however, not clear.
   Here we show that partially rescued mgRb:Rb-/- mutant fetuses exhibit
   ectopic lens epithelial cell proliferation, apoptosis and severe
   cataract. The abnormal cell proliferation and apoptosis were
   significantly suppressed in the lens of compound mutant fetuses lacking
   both Rb and E2F1 at embryonic day (E) E15.5, Interestingly however, at
   E18.5, only ectopic proliferation, not apoptosis, was dramatically
   reduced in mgRb:Rb-/-:E2F1-/- lenses. In contrast, p53 did not exert
   such a stage-specific effect and apoptosis was invariably suppressed in
   mgRb:Rb-/-:p53-/- composite mutant lenses throughout embryogenesis.
   Using RT-PCR and iir situ hybridization analyses, me identified a subset
   of lens specific genes, most notably the late differentiation marker
   filensin, which were not properly induced during lens development in
   mgRb:Rb-/- fetuses. Remarkably, despite the inhibition of cell
   proliferation and apoptosis, the degeneration of lens fibers and
   aberrant expression of filensin were only marginally corrected in
   mgRb:Rb-/-:E2F1-/- fetuses at E15.5 but not at all at E18.5 or in
   mgRb:Rb-/-:p53-/- mutant fetuses. Thus, inactivation of E2F1 reduces
   ectopic cell proliferation and stage-specific p53-dependent apoptosis
   but does not rescue the differentiation defects associated with loss of
   Rb during lens development.}},

Abstract = {{To advance our understanding of the C-13 spin-lattice relaxation process
   and rotational dynamics of C-60 in various environments, we have
   acquired relaxation data on this molecule in chlorobenzene-d(5) as a
   function of field strength and at various temperatures. Field-dependent
   measurements allowed us to separate the contributions arising from the
   two possible modes for relaxation in this molecule: chemical shift
   anisotropy (CSA) and spin-rotation (SR). The CSA and SR values were used
   to extract the reorientational time, tau (c), and the angular momentum
   time, tau (J), which allowed us to investigate the rotational dynamics
   of C-60 in this solvent. We found that the longitudinal relaxation rate
   is dominated by the chemical shift anisotropy mechanism and that
   spin-rotation becomes rapidly more important with rising temperature.
   This is seen especially at 4.7 T, where SR dominates at the moderate
   temperature of 333 K. We also compared our field-dependent findings with
   values derived via the Hubbard relation, and we have found the Hubbard
   approach to overestimate the CSA contribution, causing underestimation
   of the SR effect. Finally, in an attempt at characterizing our
   experimental correlation times, we applied the Stokes-Einstein-Debye
   (SED), Gierer-Wirtz (GW), and Hynes-Kapral-Weinberg (HKW) models to our
   system and found their predictions to be inconsistent with our
   experimental findings. Far better agreement was obtained with the GW and
   HKW theories when these models were expanded to account for the inertial
   contribution to the overall rotational time. Our investigation also
   revealed that C-60 reorients in the intermediate regime rather than at
   either the ``slip{''} or the ``stick{''} extremes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new theoretical model for the analysis of the
   mass sensitivity of the Love wave device. We use this model along with
   calculations from perturbation theory to calculate sensitivity. The
   model is based on Love wave propagation in an isotropic,
   non-piezoelectric quartz substrate over-layered by a silica waveguiding
   layer and immersed in a viscous liquid. The analysis considers power
   flow in the three-layered system, comprising the quartz substrate, the
   silica over-layer and the viscous liquid. The model fully accounts for
   the first time for the power that hows through the liquid phase and
   assesses its effect on mass sensitivity. Mass sensitivity values were
   obtained by determining the displacement field throughout the viscous
   liquid and the Love waveguide device. The resulting velocity field was
   used to generate a number of trial functions that had solutions assuming
   stress and strain continuity at the boundaries, and the complex
   dispersion relation was evaluated numerically. The resulting wavevector
   k and propagation constant beta values were used to calculate the power
   in both the Love wave device and the liquid layer and the velocity
   amplitude at the surface. The model predicts that the mass sensitivity
   of the Love wave device will increase in the presence of a viscous
   solution due to power flow into the liquid.}},

Abstract = {{Fgf4, a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, is frequently
   amplified in a variety of human cancers, however, its expression in
   neoplastic tissues is rarely detectable, This makes uncertain its
   involvement in tumour aetiology, although several in-vitro studies link
   Fgf4 overexpression to malignant transformation and metastatization of
   culture cells, We generated a transgenic mouse model in which the whey
   acidic protein (WAP) promoter directs expression of human Fgf4 to
   mammary tissues during late pregnancy and throughout lactation, with the
   purpose of studying the involvement of this growth factor in mammary
   tumorigenesis, Expression of the transgene was specifically detected in
   lobular-alveolar cells of lactating mammary glands that, by histological
   analysis, displayed hyperplastic areas and a disorganized structure,
   This was accompanied by an increased number of red blood cells and
   expression, in alveolar epithelial cells, of the vascular endothelial
   growth factor, which is absent in wild type controls, The most striking
   effect caused by FGF4 overexpression was on the remodelling of mammary
   tissue at the end of lactation, Indeed, transgenic animals showed a
   delayed involution of the gland due to a dramatic reduction in the
   overall number of apoptotic cells, which are normally present in the
   organ after weaning, Nevertheless, none of the animals examined
   developed neoplastic lesions of the mammary gland even after several
   pregnancies and at old age. Our work represents the first in-vivo
   demonstration of the anti-apoptotic and angiogenic properties of FGF4.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental and theoretical photon echo (PE) study of the primary
   charge separation process in the photosystem II reaction center (PS II
   RC) at low temperature (T = 1.33 +/- 0.01 K) is reported. Experiments
   were carried out at low excitation intensities of 5 x 10(12)
   photons/cm(2) with time and spectral resolution of about 0.5 ps and 1
   nm, respectively, using the two-pulse photon echo technique (2PE). The
   data were interpreted in the framework of the exciton model. For that
   purpose the theory of the PE formation and energy transfer in an
   excitonically coupled system, including explicitly the electron-bath
   interaction, is developed. By comparing the measured and the simulated
   PE kinetics, we draw the conclusion that the accessory chlorophyll in
   the active branch of the RC core is the primary electron donor: The
   charge separation occurs with an intrinsic time constant of approximate
   to1.5 ps, in good agreement with previously published data (Wasielewski,
   M. R.; Johnson, D. G.; Seibert, M.; Govindjee Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
   U.S.A. 1989, 86, 524; Jankowiak, R.; Tang, D.; Small, G. J.; Seibert, M.
   J. Phys. Chem. 1989, 93, 1649; Tang, D.; Jankowiak, R.; Seibert, M.;
   Small, G. J. Photosynth. Res. 1991, 27, 19). However, the dipole-dipole
   interaction between pigments leads to a very wide distribution of the
   effective charge separation kinetics ranging from 1.5 ps up to a few
   nanoseconds. Thus, the experimentally observable effective distributive
   charge separation rate differs strongly from the intrinsic one. In this
   work the effect of the charge separation process in an excitonically
   coupled system is described for the first time. Energy transfer rates,
   calculated an the basis of developed theory, show that the energy
   transfer occurs in the 100-200 fs time domain in agreement with our own
   experimental observations, and previously published data. This fast
   energy transfer contributes to the intense and narrow peak at early
   delay times in the 2PE kinetics. In contrast, the slow dephasing
   observed in the 2PE kinetics at time delay above ca. 1 ps reflects
   mainly the primary charge separation process.}},

   biphenyl mesogen at the air-water interface were studied. It was found
   thar stable layers are obtained in the presence of a water-soluble
   polymer in the subphase, notably the sodium salt of
   carboxymethylcellulose. Furthermore, the formation of a surface-adsorbed
   polymer layer, either by aspiration of the depletion layer or by
   heating, prior to the spreading of the mesogen resulted in higher
   surface pressures. The stable monolayers were successfully transferred
   to glass and aluminium substrates to give multilayer Langmuir-Blodgett
   films. Reflection Infrared Spectra of the transferred films were
   obtained, and they indicated that both components are indeed present and
   that the biphenyl moiety and alkyl spacer of the mesogen both have a net
   orientation perpendicular to the film surface.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Recent studies have suggested that men with elevated plasma
   levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) may have an increased
   risk of prostate cancer. Furthermore, IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) and
   insulin can modulate the activity of IGF-I, In this study, we sought to
   determine the role of IGF-I as well as IGFBPs-1, -2, and -3 and insulin
   as possible etiologic factors for prostate cancer. Methods: We conducted
   a nested case-control study within the Northern Sweden Health and
   Disease Cohort Study. We measured levels of IGF-I, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2,
   IGFBP-3, and insulin in plasma samples from 149 men who had a diagnosis
   of prostate cancer between I month and 10 Sears after blood collection
   and among 298 control men. All statistical tests are two-sided. Results:
   Case subjects had statistically significantly higher mean levels of
   IGF-I than control subjects (229 ng/mL; 95\% confidence interval {[}CT]
   = 218-240 ng/mL] versus 214 ng/mL {[}95\% CI = 208-221 ng/mL]; P = .02)
   and IGFBP-3 (2611 ng/mL {[}95\% CI = 2518-2704 ng/mL] versus 2498 ng/mL
   {[}95\% CI = 2437-2560 ng/mL]; P = .04). Conditional logistic regression
   analyses showed increases in prostate cancer risk with rising levels of
   IGF-I (P-for trend = .02) and IGFBP-3 (P-for trend = .03). In case
   subjects younger than 59 years at the time of blood collection, the risk
   associated with increased IGF-I was higher (P-for trend = .01), whereas
   the risk associated with increased IGFBP-3 was lower (P-for trend = .44)
   than the corresponding risks in the full cohort. Prostate cancer risk
   was not associated with levels of IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2, or insulin.
   Conclusions: Prostate cancer risk is increased in men with elevated
   plasma IGF-I, This association was particularly strong in younger men in
   this study, suggesting that circulating IGF-I mag be specifically
   involved in the early pathogenesis of prostate cancer.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction, within a pi -conjugated donor-acceptor molecule, of an
   intermediate barrier to electron tunneling and ifs size scaling and
   influence on,electronic polarization properties have remained so far
   elusive issues of great potential interest toward the fine-tuning of the
   linear and nonlinear optical properties of molecular materials.
   Paracyclophane (pCP) provides a most relevant cornerstone for more
   elaborate compounds where donor and acceptor substituents are made to
   interact through a sterically constrained pi-pi stack. A first attempt
   in this direction is reported here with the synthesis of a model dipolar
   4-(4-dihexylaminostyryl)-16-(4-nitrostyryl){[}2.2]paracyclophane and the
   subsequent experimental and theoretical study of its quadratic nonlinear
   optical properties. A major outcome of this investigation is the
   evidence of a significant ``through-space{''} charge transfer as
   unambiguously designated by the strong departure of the beta quadratic
   hyperpolarizability tensor of the full doubly substituted molecule (60 x
   10(-30) esu) from the additive beta value (18 x 10(-30) esu) expected
   for strictly noninteracting singly substituted pCP moieties, This
   desired increase of nonlinear efficiency upon substitution is not offset
   by the usual red-shift of the absorption spectrum which generally
   curtails application perspectives in more common uninterrupted
   conjugated chains. The collective nonlinear polarization behavior
   involving the full end-to-end molecular structure is confirmed by
   theoretical calculations using the Collective Electron Oscillator (CEO)
   approach which furthermore indicates a significantly enhanced role of
   electron-hole pair delocalization in the higher order nonlinear
   response, compared to the linear polarizability or the static dipole
   moment.}},

Abstract = {{Mutant cDNAs encoding h4 plasma membrane Ca2+ pumps with deletions in
   the N-terminal segment have been constructed and expressed in COS cells.
   As judged by immunoblotting, each construct was expressed at a high
   level similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. The removal of the first
   six amino acids had no effect on the Ca2+ transport activity, but
   deletions in the segment 15-75 reduced the activity to undetectable
   levels. The d(43-56)h4 mutant, lacking amino acids 43-56, was also
   efficiently expressed in stable form in CHO cells. The Ca2+ transport
   activity of d(43-56)h4 in this system was about 40\% of that of the wild
   type. The d(43-56)h4 enzyme exhibited a similar affinity for Ca2+, a
   slightly increased apparent affinity for ATP, and a slightly lower
   sensitivity to inhibition by vanadate than the wild-type enzyme.
   Analysis of the phosphoenzyme intermediate formed in the presence of
   lanthanum showed that the phosphorylation reaction was not affected, but
   the maximum amount of phosphoenzyme was reduced to the same extent as
   the Ca2+ transport activity. These results suggest that the expressed
   d(43-56)h4 was a mixture of fully active and inactive enzyme. The
   d(43-56)h4 enzyme was more easily degraded by proteases and had a higher

Abstract = {{Following the outbreak of H5N1 ``bird flu{''} in Hong Kong in 1997 the
   isolation of H9N2 subtype viruses from patients in southern China and
   Hong Kong SAR once again raised the spectre of a possible influenza
   pandemic. H9N2 viruses have recently been responsible for disease in
   poultry in various parts of the world and preliminary studies of the H9
   haemagglutinin (HA) genes of viruses isolated during 1998 and 1999 in
   Germany, Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia showed a close relationship to
   the HA genes of the viruses that infected two children in Hong Kong SAR.
   Analysis of the complete genome of a Pakistan isolate,
   A/chicken/Pakistan/2/99, showed that it is closely related in all eight
   genes (97-99\% homology) to the human H9N2 isolates and furthermore that
   the six genes encoding internal components of the virus are similar to
   the corresponding genes of the H5N1 viruses that caused 6 (out of 18)
   fatal cases of human infection. Thus H9N2 viruses similar to those that
   caused human infections in Hong Kong are circulating more widely in
   other parts of the world. Whether or not these H9N2 viruses also have
   features that facilitate avian-to-human transmission is not known. Since
   avian H9N2 viruses are currently perceived to represent a significant
   threat to human health it is important to determine whether or not
   viruses of this subtype circulating in poultry in various parts of the
   world have the potential to infect people. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

   10(5) showed the highest mechanical properties. Outside this range of
   molecular weight, the compatibilizing property of LNR is no longer
   effective due to inhomogeneous blends. Improvements in the mechanical
   properties were in consonance with the increase in gel contents of the
   blends. The additions of LNR in the blends were able to reduce the
   interfacial tension; therefore, they improved the interaction between
   the phases of the blends. The studies also confirmed that, within the
   concentration range investigated, the LNR solvent did not influence the

   function in loading sugar from the apoplast into the conducting sieve tu
   bes. In the homozygous state, these mutations resulted in stunted
   growth, retarded development, and sterility. The source leaves of mutant
   plants contained a great excess of starch, and radiolabeled sugar failed
   to be transported efficiently to roots and inflorescences. These data
   provide genetic: proof that apoplastic phloem loading is critical for
   growth, development, and reproduction in Arabidopsis and that SUC2 is at
   least partially responsible for this step.}},

Abstract = {{Karstic watersheds appear as highly non-linear and non-stationary
   systems. The main focus of this paper is a heuristic study of this
   non-stationarity using a time-scale localisation method called the
   wavelet transform.
   First, a mathematical overview of these analysis methods is given. The
   wavelet transform methods used here can be divided into two main parts:
   the continuous Morlet wavelet transform and the multiresolution
   orthogonal analysis. A statistical interpretation of the wavelet
   coefficients is also presented, introducing wavelet spectrum analyses
   (univariate and cross-wavelet analyses).
   These wavelet methods are applied to rainfall rates and runoffs measured
   at different sampling rates, from daily to half-hourly sampling rate.
   The karstic springs under study are located in the Pyrenees Mountains
   (Ariege, France) and in the Causses of Larzac (Aveyron, France).
   They are first applied to a pumping and a naturally intermittent runoff
   process, allowing the separation of different sub-processes. Wavelet
   analyses of rainfall rates and runoffs and wavelet rainfall-runoff
   cross-analyses also give meaningful information on the temporal
   variability of the rainfall-runoff relationship. In particular, this
   kind of analysis provides a simple interpretation of the distribution of
   energy between the different scales. Finally, it is demonstrated that
   wavelet transforms make possible a physical explanation of the temporal
   structure of the basin response to rainfall allowing discrimination
   between a rapid response and recharge due to the karst drainage system
   and a slower one corresponding to infiltration response. (C) 2000

Volume = {{116}},

Abstract = {{In six squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus), the medulla oblongata was
   explored with microelectrodes, looking for vocalization-correlated
   activity. The vocalizations were elicited by microinjections of
   glutamate agonists into the periaqueductal grey of the midbrain.
   Vocalization-related cells were found in greater numbers in the nucl.
   ambiguus (Ab) and retroambiguus (RAb), in the parvocellular,
   magnocellular and central reticular formation as well as in the solitary
   tract nucleus and spinal trigeminal nucleus. Small numbers were also
   found in the vestibular complex, cuneate nuclei, inferior olive and
   lateral reticular nucleus. A differentiation of the neuronal responses
   into 12 reaction types reveals that the frequency of each reaction type
   varies from brain structure to brain structure, thus allowing a
   specification of the different vocalization-related areas. According to
   this specification, it is proposed that initiation of vocalization takes
   place via the parvocellular reticular formation; vocal pattern control
   is mainly brought about by the parvocellular reticular formation, Ab,
   solitary tract nucleus and spinal trigeminal nucleus; expiratory control
   and respiratory-laryngeal coordination is carried out by the RAb, Ab and
   central nucleus of the reticular formation; vocalization-specific
   postural adjustments are carried out via the vestibular and cuneate
   nuclei. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Karst aquifers, because of their unique hydrogeologic characteristics,
   are extremely susceptible to contamination by pathogens. Here we present
   the results of an investigation of contamination of a karst aquifer by
   fecal indicator bacteria. Two wells intercepting zones with contrasting
   effective hydraulic conductivities, as determined by pump test, were
   monitored both during the dry season and in response to a rain event.
   Samples were also collected from the adjacent ephemeral surface stream,
   which is known to be impacted by an upstream wastewater treatment plant
   after rainfall. Whole water and suspended sediment samples were analyzed
   for fecal coliforms and enterococci. During the dry season, pumping over
   a 2-day period resulted in increases in concentrations of fecal
   coliforms to greater than 10,000 CFU/100 mi in the high-conductivity
   well; enterococci and total suspended solids also increased, to a lesser
   degree. Toward the end of the pumping period, as much as 50\% of the
   fecal coliforms were associated with suspended sediment. Irrigation of
   an up-gradient pine plantation with primary-treated wastewater is the
   probable source of the bacterial contamination. Sampling after a rain
   event revealed the strong influence of water quality of the adjacent
   Terrieu Creek on the ground water. Bacterial concentrations in the wells
   showed a rapid response to increased concentrations in the surface
   water, with fecal coliform concentrations in ground water ultimately
   reaching 60,000 CFU/100 mi. Up to 100\% of the bacteria in the ground
   water was associated with suspended sediment at Various times. The
   results of this investigation are evidence of the strong influence of
   surface water on ground water in karst terrain, including that of
   irrigation water. The large proportion of bacteria associated with
   particulates in the ground water has important implications for public
   health, as bacteria associated with particulates may be more persistent
   and more difficult to inactivate. The high bacterial concentrations
   found in both wells, despite the difference in hydraulic conductivity,
   demonstrates the difficulty of predicting vulnerability of individual
   wells to bacterial contamination in karst. The extreme temporal
   variability in bacterial concentrations underscores the importance of
   event-based monitoring of the bacterial quality of public water supplies
   in karst. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{CD69 is a widely expressed type II transmembrane glycoprotein related to
   the C-type animal lectins that exhibits regulated expression on a
   variety of cells of the hematopoietic lineage, including neutrophils,
   monocytes, T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and platelets.
   Activation of T lymphocytes results in the induced expression of CD69 at
   the cell surface. In addition, cross-linking of CD69 by specific
   antibodies leads to the activation of cells bearing this receptor and to
   the induction of effector functions. However, the physiological ligand
   of CD69 is unknown. We report here the X-ray crystal structure of the
   extracellular C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) of human CD69 at 2.27
   Angstrom resolution. Recombinant CD69 was expressed in bacterial
   inclusion bodies and folded in vitro. The protein, which exists as a
   disulfide-linked homodimer on the cell surface, crystallizes as a
   symmetrical dimer, similar to those formed by the related NK cell
   receptors Ly49A and CD94. The structure reveals conservation of the
   C-type lectin-like fold, including preservation of the two alpha
   -helical regions found in Ly49A and mannose-binding protein (MBP).
   However, only one of the nine residues coordinated to Ca2+ in MBP is
   conserved in CD69 and no bound Ca2+ is evident in the crystal structure.
   Surprisingly, electron density suggestive of a puckered six-membered
   ring was discovered at a site structurally analogous to the
   ligand-binding sites of MBP and Ly49A. This sugar-like density may
   represent, or mimic, part of the natural ligand recognized by CD69.}},

Abstract = {{Economic development in agriculture is often accompanied by strong
   environmental pressures that present risks, which could lead to
   irreversible damage of the associated agro-ecosystem. A form of
   agricultural management that utilizes natural resources rationally yet
   maintains ecological stability is necessary. Ecologically sound, yet
   productive, use of resources requires indicators that assess not only
   productive and economic factors, but also environmental impact and
   ecological effects. Thus, to study an agricultural activity and its
   interaction with the environment, a holistic approach, capable of
   considering ecological, biophysical and socio-economic aspects is
   appropriate. Here we use emergy analysis and its indicators as given in
   Odum (Science 242 (1988) 1132-1139), to evaluate how sustainability of a
   soybean crop in south Tuscany (Italy) is increased using the specific
   bacteria inoculation to satisfy, through fixation, the nitrogen need of
   the crop. Cultivation was studied with two options: (1) utilization of
   chemical fertilizers to supply nitrogen needs as often done in the past,
   and as a viable present alternative and (2) the symbiotic activity of
   Bradyrhizobium bacteria, given as inoculum, to cover all nitrogen needs.
   This article shows that proper agricultural management should help
   maintain, and increase, system capacity, i.e. the quality of the system
   environment (soil, water,...), to sustain biomass, and prevent
   environmental degradation. For an Italian agro-ecosystem, the results
   demonstrate that agricultural production is more than doubled and the
   use of non-renewable and toxic inputs, such as chemical fertilizers, is
   reduced by use of the inoculum. The good results for soybean suggests
   development of analogous cultivation methods for other agricultural
   species, such as gramineous, for which different N-fixing bacteria such
   as Azospirillum, have been already identified. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{As part of a hygiene monitoring program in a meat processing plant a
   total of 131 Listeria isolates were detected by sampling different
   processing areas and meat products within a 2-year period. The isolates

   the genomic ApaI and SmaI fragment patterns of all isolates were
   examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). PFGE using SmaI and
   ApaI yielded 15 (Listeria monocytogenes), 20 (Listeria innocua) and six
   (Listeria welshimeri) pulsotypes. Of the environmental Listeria
   monocytogenes isolates the predominating PFGE-type B was clearly
   associated with processing area A whereas PFGE-type E predominated in
   the meat products. Moreover, the study showed the persistence of closely

Abstract = {{Filoviruses, including Ebola virus, are cytotoxic. To investigate the
   role of the Ebola virus glycoprotein (GP) in this cytopathic effect, we
   transiently expressed the GP in human kidney 293T cells. Expression of
   wild-type GP, but not the secretory form of the molecule lacking a
   membrane anchor, induced rounding and detachment of the cells, as did a
   chimeric GP containing its ectodomain and influenza virus hemagglutinin
   transmembrane-cytoplasmic domain. These results indicate that the GP
   ectodomain and its anchorage to the membrane are required for GP-induced
   morphologic changes in host cells. Since cell rounding and detachment
   could be associated with reduced levels of cell adhesion molecules, we
   also studied the expression of integrins, which are major molecules for
   adhesion to extracellular matrices, and found that the beta1 integrin
   group is downregulated by the GP. This result was further extended by
   experiments in which anti-beta1 monoclonal antibodies or purified
   integrins inhibited the infectivity of vesicular stomatitis virus
   pseudotyped with the GP. We suggest that integrins, especially the beta1
   group, might interact with the GP and perhaps be involved in Ebola virus

Abstract = {{The low nutritional Value of barley for poultry is because of the
   absence of an intestinal enzyme for efficient depolymerization of
   (1,3-1,4)-beta -glucan, the major polysaccharide of the endosperm cell
   walls. This leads to high viscosity in the intestine, limited nutrient
   uptake, decreased growth rate, and unhygienic sticky droppings adhering
   to chickens and floors of the production cages. Consequently, the 7.5
   billion broiler chickens produced annually in the United States are
   primarily raised on corn-soybean diets. Here we show that addition to
   normal barley of 6.2\% transgenic malt containing a thermotolerant
   (1,3-1,4)-beta -glucanase (4.28 mug.g(-1) soluble protein) provides a
   weight gain equivalent to corn diets. The number of birds with adhering
   sticky droppings is drastically reduced. Intestines and excrements of
   chickens fed the barley control diet contained large amounts of soluble
   (1,3-1,4)-beta -glucan, which was reduced by 75 and 50\%. respectively,
   by adding transgenic malt to the diet. The amount of active recombinant
   enzyme in the small intestine corresponded to that present in the feed,
   whereas an 11-fold concentration of the enzyme was observed in the ceca,
   and a 7.5-fold concentration occurred in the excrement. Glycosylation of
   the beta -glucanase isolated from the ceca testified to its origin from
   the transgenic barley. Analysis of the data from this trial demonstrates
   the possibility of introducing individual recombinant enzymes into
   Various parts of the gastrointestinal tract of chickens with transgenic
   malt and thereby the possibility of evaluating their effect on the
   metabolism of a given ingredient targeted by the enzyme.}},

Abstract = {{IFNs play critical roles in host defense by modulating the expression of
   various genes via signal transducer and activator of transcription
   factors. We show that IFN alpha/beta activates another important
   transcription factor, NF-kappaB. DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB was
   induced by multiple type 1 IFNs and was promoted by IFN in a diverse
   group of human, monkey, rat, and murine cells. Human IFN promoted
   NF-kappaB activation in murine cells that express the human IFN
   alpha/beta receptor-1 signal-transducing chain of the type 1 IFN
   receptor. IFN promotes inhibitor of kappa B alpha (I kappaB alpha)
   serine phosphorylation and degradation, and stimulates NF-kappaB
   DNA-binding and transcriptional activity. Importantly, IFN promotes cell
   survival by protecting cells against a variety of proapoptotic stimuli,
   such as virus infection and antibody-mediated crosslinking. Expression
   of superrepressor forms of I kappaB alpha, besides inhibiting
   IFN-mediated NF-kappaB activation and I kappaB alpha degradation, also
   enhanced apoptotic cell death in IFN-treated cells. We conclude that
   NF-kappaB activation by IFN alpha/beta is integrated into a signaling
   pathway through the IFN alpha receptor-1 chain of the type 1 IFN
   receptor that promotes cell survival in apposition to various apoptotic

Abstract = {{The effect of the surface structure of Pt (111) and Pt (100) has been
   investigated for cyclohexene hydrogenation and dehydrogenation, and
   ethylene hydrogenation by using sum frequency generation. Cyclohexene
   dehydrogenation is a structure sensitive reaction, and the rate was
   found to proceed more rapidly on the Pt (100) crystal surface than on
   the Pt (111) crystal surface. On Pt (100), the major reaction
   intermediate during cyclohexene dehydrogenation was 1,3-cyclohexadiene,
   whereas on Pt(111), both 1,3- and 1,4-cyclohexadiene were present. Both
   1,3- and 1,4-cyclohexadiene can dehydrogenate to form benzene, although
   the reaction proceeds more rapidly through the 1,3-cyclohexadiene
   intermediate. Because of this, the structure sensitivity of cyclohexene
   dehydrogenation is explained by noting that there are both a fast and
   slow reaction pathway for Pt (1), whereas there is only a fast reaction
   pathway on Pt (100). Ethylene hydrogenation is a structure insensitive
   reaction. Both ethylidyne and di-sigma -bonded ethylene are present in
   both Pt (111) and Pt (100) under reaction conditions, although the ratio
   of the concentrations of the two species are different. The rate of the
   reaction was found to be 11 +/- 1 and 12 +/- 1 molecules per site per
   second for Pt (111) and Pt (100), respectively. Since the reaction rate
   is essentially the same on the two surfaces, while the concentration of
   ethylidyne and di-sigma -bonded ethylene are different, these species
   must not be the active species which turnover under catalytic ethylene
   hydrogenation. The most likely species which turnover are pi -bonded
   ethylene and ethyl, and their concentrations are near the detection
   limit of SFG. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Cellular uptake of SLN was determined by incorporating 6-coumarin as

   incorporated in SLN was higher compared to the conventional doxorubicin
   solution, even at the lower concentrations. Paclitaxel in SLN was about
   100-fold more effective than free paclitaxel on MCF-7 cells, while on

   Closer links between industry and medicine are being explicitly
   encouraged both in academia and the health care sector for the mutual
   benefits they bring. However, these partnerships are the cause of
   growing unease within medicine.
   In the United States, rigorous legislation governing research protocols

Abstract = {{Using different density-functional methods, dimers, chains, monolayers,
   and crystals of Xe are studied. In contrast to most of the earlier
   studies on crystalline Xe, this one concentrates on structures with
   expanded lattices compared with equilibrium. In order to make a
   comparison with experimental photoelectron information, the variation of
   the band structures and density of states with distance is analysed in
   detail. Here, the calculations give results that are mutually consistent
   and in agreement with some other theoretical works, but which show some
   differences from other theoretical and some experimental studies. The
   differences that are observed for chains and monolayers, which
   experimentally are produced on some substrate, may be due to
   substrate-Xe interactions. In addition, we explore how spin-orbit
   couplings influence the results, and the differences between using a
   local-density and a generalized-gradient approximation are studied. For
   those systems where other information on the optimized bond length
   exists it is found that the density-functional calculations are
   inaccurate. When a comparison is possible, the bonds are found to be too
   short. Moreover, the calculations predict in all cases the existence of
   stable structures.}},

Abstract = {{Pyridinium chloride (PC) is examined as a selective, fluorescence
   quenching agent for alternant as opposed to nonalternant polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in two polar solvents - water and
   acetonitrile. Nine alternant and 13 nonalternant PAI-Is were dissolved
   in water and acetonitrile and a total of 0.2 M of pyridinium chloride
   was added. The resulting change in fluorescence intensity was observed
   and reported as the Stern-Volmer quenching constant. Results show that
   PC is a selective quencher in both polar solvents. It selectively
   quenches the fluorescence emission intensity of alternant PAHs while
   leaving the nonalternant PAH fluorescence emission virtually unchanged.
   These results agree with the selective quenching behavior seen for PC
   surfactant analogs, cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) and dodecylpyridinium
   chloride (DDPC). Furthermore, these results illustrate that the presence
   of a surfactant or micelle is not a requirement for selective quenching.
   The selective quencher PC is applicable to situations where a surfactant
   is not desirable or soluble. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In our ongoing efforts to decipher the sequence and structural
   requirements in the flanking region of the CpG motif in phosphorothioate
   oligodeoxynucleotides (PS-oligos), we have examined the requirement of
   free 5'- and 3'-ends of PS-oligos on immune stimulation. Our model
   studies using 3'-3'-linked (containing two free 5'-ends) and
   5'-5'-linked (containing two free 3'-ends) CpG-containing PS-oligos
   demonstrate that immunostimulatory activity is significantly reduced
   when the 5'-end of the PS-oligo is not accessible, rather than the
   3'-end, suggesting that the 5'-end plays a critical role in
   immunostimulatory activity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   to the assumption of tropical sprue, which was treated with
   tetracycline. Within 4 months the malabsorption deteriorated and the
   patient was readmitted with severe electrolyte imbalance. CT-scan of the
   abdomen revealed a thickened intestinal wall in the jejunum. Diagnostic
   laparotomy was performed and, surprisingly, revealed chylascites.
   Histology in a segment of the jejunum demonstrated intestinal
   lymphangiectasias as the cause of the malabsorption. These intestinal
   lymphangiectasias were most probably the sequela of radiotherapy 30
   years earlier for testicular teratocarcinoma. Symptomatic therapy with

Abstract = {{We study theoretically a potential motion of fluid with a free boundary

   describing the flow evolution from the initial to a highly nonlinear
   stage in 2D and 3D cases and study the influence of the initial
   conditions in a wide range of parameters. It is shown that at late time
   a nonlinear structure of bubbles and spikes is generated and the
   structure is determined by the initial velocity field. The local
   dynamics of highly symmetric 3D flows has a universal form when
   expressed in dimensionless units. Bubbles and spikes conserve a
   near-circular contour, and at a fixed length scale, the 3D solutions
   depend significantly on the flow symmetry. We show that the influence of
   the initial conditions could result in nonuniqueness of solutions

Abstract = {{Resistance theorists in education urge educators to evaluate the moral
   and political potential of opposition in schools. The scholarship of
   resistance calls us to examine oppositional acts of students in school
   settings as moral and political expressions of oppression. Resistance
   theorizing over the past several decades has not, however, adequately
   explored the idea that resistance is communication; that is, a means of
   signaling and constructing new meanings, and of building a discourse
   around particular problems of exclusion or inequality. In this paper, I
   use pragmatist theories of inquiry and communication to interpret and
   critique resistance theories in education. Using Dewey and Bentley's
   notion of transactionalism (1946), I present a theoretical framework for
   future inquiry into school opposition. Interpreting resistance theory
   through a pragmatist lens leads to a more relational reading of
   resistance, and can promote school-based inquiry (rather than simple
   avoidance or punishment) directed toward acts of resistance in schools.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of degassed water, simethicone, and
   patient rotation on ultrasonographic (US) visualization of the
   pancreatic tail.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy patients in whom visualization of the
   pancreatic tail was poor at US were reevaluated in the upright position
   after ingesting 2 cups (500 mL) of water with 80 mg of simethicone
   followed by rotating three times on the examination table. In a few
   patients, the right posterior obligee position was used. Pancreatic tail
   visualization and disbursement of gastric gas were evaluated. Seventy
   patients who received 500 mt of distilled water only served as control
   subjects.
   RESULTS: Pancreatic tail visualization in patients versus control
   subjects was complete in 55 (79\%) versus five (7\%) of 70 patients and
   control subjects, partial in 10 (14\%) versus 38 (54\%), and not
   improved in five (7\%) versus 27 (39\%). The effect on diminishing
   gastric air was closely correlated with the degree of improved
   visualization in most patients. All patients tolerated the procedure
   well, with no side effects. The technique added a mean of 8 versus 5
   minutes to the examination in patients versus control subjects. The full
   acoustic window effect of the simethicone-water mixture lasted
   approximately 10 minutes.
   CONCLUSION: The simethicone-water-rotation technique is simple, safe,
   inexpensive, and effective for improving pancreatic tail visualization
   in ambulatory patients and is superior to the use of water alone.}},

Abstract = {{Any modeling scheme for gaseous phenomena in graphics has to capture
   three aspects: the fuzzy geometry of the gas, the dynamics,
   characterized by the presence of vortices, and the interaction of light
   with the gaseous volume. We represent the gaseous volume as a particle
   system and apply Vol tex Element Methods (VEM) to model the dynamics. A
   Lagrangian formulation that is gridless and hence ideal for unbounded
   flows is used. A gridless approach to ray tracing the particle systems
   is developed using particle maps. These maps are used to estimate
   densities within a gaseous volume analogous to the way volume photon
   maps are used to estimate radiance during Monte Carlo I ny tracing. A
   technique is proposed to merge particle and volume photon maps to obtain
   an effective method for simulating multiple scattering in a dynamic
   inhomogeneous participating medium. Our method for modeling and
   rendering gaseous phenomena is conceptually simple and grid free.
   Particle maps play an effective role, as the nearest neighbor
   information obtained during the rendering phase is exploited during the
   dynamics computation. We preset results that demonstrate the
   effectiveness of our approach. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{The developmental expression patterns of the nuclear orphan receptors
   COUP-TFs (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors)
   have been correlated to neurogenesis in several animal species.
   Nevertheless, the role of COUP-TFs in neurogenesis remains unknown. We
   have studied the functional involvement of COUP-TFI in retinoic acid
   (RA)-induced neuronal differentiation of pig embryonal carcinoma cells
   through two complementary approaches: 1) deregulated expression of
   COUP-TFI, and 2) inactivation of endogenous COUP-TFs by means of a
   dominant-negative COUP-TFI mutant. Low levels of wild-type (wt)COUP-TFI
   transgene expression did not inhibit neural cell fate and primarily
   enhanced neuron outgrowth from RA-treated P19 aggregates. In contrast,
   high COUP-TFI expression impeded the neuronal differentiation of pig
   cells induced with RA, resulting in cell cultures lacking neurons. This
   morphological effect was correlated to an elevated level of E-cadherin
   mRNA. The dominant-negative COUP-TFI mutant induced cell packing after
   RA treatment and inhibited neurite extension and neuron outgrowth from
   aggregates. A RGD peptide interference assay indicated that endogenous
   COUP-TFs could favor migration of neurons through an integrin-dependent
   mechanism. Accordingly, vitronectin mRNA levels were shown to be
   up-regulated by COUP-TFI by RT-PCR analysis, and COUP-TFI stimulated the
   mouse vitronectin promoter activity in transient transfection assays.
   Taken together, these data indicate that COUP-TFI is not simply a global
   repressor of retinoid functions, but shows a high selectivity for
   regulating genes involved in cellular adhesion and migration processes
   that are particularly important for neuronal differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{Study objectives: To investigate the potential for mometasone furoate
   (MF) to exert systemic effects following administration by dry powder
   inhaler (DPI) or metered-dose inhaler (MDI).
   Design: Three randomized, evaluator-blind, placebo-controlled,
   parallel-group, 28-day studies.
   Patients: Adults with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma.
   Interventions: Study 1 (12 patients per treatment group; MF DPI at 200
   mug bid, 400 mug qd, 800 mug qd, or 1,200 mug qd). Study 2 (16 patients
   per treatment group; MF DPI at 400 mug bid or 800 mug bid, or oral
   prednisone at 10 mg qd). Study 3 (16 patients per treatment group; MF
   MDI at 400 mug bid or 800 mug bid, or fluticasone propionate {[}FP] at
   880 mug bid by MDI).
   Measurements and results: Study 1. Plasma concentrations were near the
   lower limit of quantitation (50 pg/mL) at the MF DPI 400-mug qd dosage
   and approximately 250 pg/mL at the 1,200-mug qd dosage. The area under
   the curve for serum cortisol concentrations over 24 h (AUC(24)) was
   essentially unaltered at all doses. Study 2. Plasma levels over days 7
   to 28 were 100.3 +/- 5.9 pg/mL (mean +/- SEM) for MF DPI 400 mug bid,
   and 181.0 +/- 10.9 pg/mL for 800 mug bid. Although there were relatively
   low levels of suppression (19 to 25\%) at earlier time points for MF DPI
   400 mug bid, serum cortisol AUC(24) levels at day 28 were similar to
   placebo. MF DPI 800 mug bid and oral prednisone both decreased serum
   cortisol AUC(24) levels at days 7 to 28 by 28.0 +/- 8.3\% and 67.2 +/-
   3.6\%, respectively. The response to cosyntropin was normal in 15, 14,
   11, and 1 of the patients in the placebo, MF DPI 400 mug bid, MF DPI 800
   mug bid, and prednisone groups, respectively. Study 3. MF MDI caused
   even less systemic exposure than by DPI. MF MDI 800 mug bid (24.0 +/-
   3.1\%) and FP (51.7 +/- 3.8\%) caused a significant decrease in serum
   cortisol AUC(24) on days 14 to 28. MF MDI 400 mug bid was similar to
   placebo treatment at all time points.
   Conclusions: The MF 800-mug bid dosage (1,600 mug/d), which is twice the
   highest projected clinical dosage, represents the lower limit for
   consistently detectable systemic effects of MF.}},

   defined rich sets of VST relationships which support and simplify the
   formulation of more semantical queries. An intuitive query interface
   which allows users to describe VST features of video objects by sketch
   and feature specification is presented. The conducted experiments prove
   the effectiveness of modeling and querying videos by the visual features

Abstract = {{Angiotensin II and norepinephrine (NE) have been implicated in the
   neurohumoral response to pressure overload and the development of left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The purpose of this study was to determine the
   temporal sequence for activation of the renin-angiotensin and
   sympathetic nervous systems in the rat after 3-60 days of pressure
   overload induced by aortic constriction. Initially on pressure overload,
   there was transient activation of the systemic renin-angiotensin system
   coinciding with the appearance of left ventricular hypertrophy (day 3).
   At day 10, there was a marked increase in AT(1) receptor density in the
   left ventricle, increased plasma NE concentration, and elevated cardiac
   epinephrine content. Moreover, the inotropic response to isoproterenol
   was reduced in the isolated, perfused heart at 10 days of pressure
   overload. The affinity of the beta (2)-adrenergic receptor in the left
   ventricle was decreased at 60 days. Despite these alterations, there was
   no decline in resting left ventricular function, beta -adrenergic
   receptor density, or the relative distribution of beta (1)- and beta
   (2)-receptor sites in the left ventricle over 60 days of pressure
   overload. Thus activation of the renin-angiotensin system is an early
   response to pressure overload and may contribute to the initial
   development of cardiac hypertrophy and sympathetic activation in the
   compensated heart.}},

   for earthquake regulations and building codes, especially for the cities
   on the north anatolian fault zone.
   In this paper, anelastic and scattering attenuation in Erzincan region
   is investigated by using of multiple lapse time window (MLTW) method
   based on the hypothesis of multiple isotropic scattering with uniform
   distribution of scatters. It is found that the scattering and intrinsic
   Q(-1) are almost equal for 3 Hz and lower frequencies and intrinsic
   attenuation is dominant over scattering attenuation for 6 Hz and higher
   frequencies. Model fitting was quite good for almost all frequencies at
   long distances, more scattered data and observed poor model fitting at
   low frequencies (1.5 Hz) and short distances (5-15 km) may indicate the
   complexities in the shallower part of crust in Erzincan. The seismic
   albedo is 0.52 for 1.5 Hz and 0.32 for 12 Hz. L-e(-1) value increases
   slightly with frequency as 0.058 for 1.5 Hz and 0.032 for 12 Hz. The
   coda Q(c)(-1) determined from the decay rate of coda waves is similar to
   Q(s)(-1) for 1.5 and 3 Hz and it is close to Q(t)(-1) for frequencies
   higher than 3 Hz. We found that the scattering attenuation is strongly
   frequency dependent, decreasing proportional to f(1.48) whereas
   intrinsic Q(i)(-1) is considerably less frequency dependent f(1.1). A
   decrease of Q(s)(-1) faster than f(1.0) with increasing frequency
   implies that the medium may be characterized by a Gaussian rather than
   exponential auto-correlation function. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

   marxianus cells has been tested under laboratory conditions as a

Abstract = {{Over the past few years gene expression profiling has become a key
   element of the quest to better understand gene function and cellular
   behavior. An expression profile can be measured either on the protein
   level, which is difficult given the limitations of current technologies,
   or it can be measured on the mRNA level. The fundamental assumption
   behind using the mRNA approach to elucidate cellular function is that
   abundance of a specific mRNA species is correlated with the abundance of
   the protein it encodes. It follows from this assumption that the profile
   of transcribed mRNA indirectly dictates function and behavior of the
   cell. Any changes in expression profiles are likely to cause changes in
   cellular functionality or behavior; but biologic characteristics like
   tissue type and cellular state would influence the expression profile in
   the first place. While the correlation between expression profile and
   phenotype is likely to be true, it must be emphasized that the
   relationship is highly complex and that our understanding of this
   correlation is in its infancy. Various strategies have been devised to
   assess gene expression profiles in a quantitative manner and, judged by
   today's standards, microarray technology appears to provide the most
   direct and comprehensive approach. This review describes microarray
   technology and its applications in drug discovery and in
   characterization of diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Data are presented on the development of tests of reading skill for
   primary school pupils in rural Tanzania. Instruction in these schools is
   in Kiswahili, a regularly spelled language. Using a translation of a
   standard reading test, children can read aloud all words once they have
   learned the sound-letter correspondences, regardless of comprehension.
   In addition, children can pass traditional comprehension tasks by
   decoding only some of the words. Three graded tests were developed to
   test children who had only some letter knowledge, could read single
   words, or were proficient readers. The tests required children both to
   decode and to understand the reading material in order to achieve high
   scores. The tests correlated well with scores on other educational
   achievement tests and showed age and school grade differences. It is
   suggested that these tests are useful measures of reading development in
   a regularly spelled language. Their adaptation to English and validation
   against standardized instruments are planned.}},

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. A successful immune response requires the functioning of a range of
   physiological mechanisms and is therefore supposed to be costly in terms
   of limited resources that could be used otherwise, such as energy or
   nutrients. Because immunity is costly, immune defence should be reduced
   if appropriate multiple immunogenic challenges are present.
   2. The working hypothesis that multiple challenges will reduce the
   immune system's capacity to respond is adopted. An existing infection by
   yet another parasite could also further reduce the strength of the
   immune response, since limited resources have to be divided among the
   different challenges.
   3. The bumble-bee, Bombus terrestris L., and its parasites are used as a
   model system to study (1) whether the melanization response towards an
   antigen is reduced or increased after a preceding challenge
   ('depletion/stimulation'); (2) if depletion occurs, how long it takes to
   mount a full defence response against the second challenge; and (3)
   whether the coinfection by another parasite reduces or increases the
   immune defence system's capacity to respond. A standard technique was
   used where two novel antigens (nylon filaments of different sizes and
   time intervals) were implanted into the haemocoel of individual workers.
   Controls were individuals implanted with a single fixed sized implant. A
   gut parasite, the trypanosome Crithidia bombi, was used for
   coinfections.
   4. Size of the implant had no effect on the melanization response as
   well as time between primary and secondary implant. Primary and
   secondary implants differed from the controls. In particular, the
   primary implant was melanized more intensively than the controls and
   secondary, respectively. Furthermore, a coinfection by C. bombi had no
   effect on the encapsulation response.
   5. The results suggest that no general depletion of the encapsulation
   system occurs under the conditions of our experiment and that a similar
   immune response (melanization) independent on the magnitude of the
   challenge, occurs. However, there seems to be a depletion effect on the
   secondary implant. Furthermore, the dynamics of two different parasites
   seem to run independently as far as within-host interactions are
   concerned.}},

Abstract = {{The energy requirements of Brandt's cormorants (Phalacrocorax

   under a metabolic chamber in a water flume. From the oxygen consumption
   recordings, we extrapolated the metabolic rate and cost of transport at
   water speeds ranging from 0 to 1.3 ms(-1). In still water, the birds'
   mean mass-specific rate of oxygen consumption ((V)over dot(O2),) while
   floating at the surface was 20.2ml O-2 min(-1) kg(-1), 2.1 times the
   predicted resting metabolic rate. During steady-state voluntary swimming
   against a how, their Po, increased with water speed, reaching 74 mi O-2
   min(-1) kg(-1) at 1.3 ms(-1), which corresponded to an increase in
   metabolic rate from 11 to 25 W kg(-1). The cost of transport
   decreased,vith swimming velocity, approaching a minimum of 19 J kg(-1)
   m(-1) for a swimming speed of 1.3 m s(-1) Surface swimming in the
   cormorant costs approximately 18\% less than sub-surface swimming. This
   confirms similar findings in tufted ducks (Aythya fuligula) and supports

Abstract = {{Objectives: Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic pain disorder,
   where 90\% of the patients struck by the disorder are women. The
   neuropeptide oxytocin is known to have antinociceptive and analgesic, as
   well as anxiolytic and antidepressant effects, which makes this
   neuropeptide of interest in fibromyalgia research. The aim of this study
   was to assess oxytocin concentrations in female FMS patients with
   different hormonal status and in depressed and non-depressed patients
   and relate oxytocin concentrations to adverse symptoms as pain, stress,
   depression, anxiety and to the positive item happiness.
   Methods: Thirty-nine patients and 30 controls registered these symptoms
   daily during 28 days and blood samples for the assessment of oxytocin
   were drawn twice in all patients and controls. Besides the daily
   ratings, depression was also estimated with the self-rating instrument
   Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).
   Results: Depressed patients according to the BDI differed significantly
   with low levels of oxytocin compared to the non-depressed patients and
   the controls. Low levels of oxytocin were also seen in high scoring
   pain, stress and depression patients according to the daily ratings;
   however, these subgroups were small. A negative correlation was found
   between the scored symptoms depression and anxiety and oxytocin
   concentration, and a positive correlation between the item happiness and
   oxytocin. The oxytocin concentration did not differ between the
   hormonally different subgroups of patients or controls.
   Conclusion: The results suggest that the neuropeptide oxytocin may,
   together with other neuropeptides and neurotransmitters, play a role in
   the integration of the stress axes, monoaminergic systems and the pain
   processing peptides in the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for
   the symptoms in the FMS.}},

Abstract = {{Holocene alluvial landforms in the Macgillycuddy's Reeks, southwest
   Ireland, mere investigated to determine the controls and timing of
   postglacial geomorphic activity. Detailed geomorphologic analysis of
   three alluvial-fan and debris cones within high-level cirque basins
   demonstrates evidence of episodic phases of late Holocene surface
   aggradation and incision. Radiocarbon dates from peat horizons above and
   below inorganic units show that phases of aggradation cluster into two
   distinct periods, the first after 230-790 calibrated (cal.) yr A.D. and
   the second from 1510 cal. yr A.D. to the present. An additional phase of
   fan aggradation at one site is dated after 1040-1280 cal. yr A.D. All
   three phases coincide with episodes of enhanced late Holocene
   valley-door alluviation and debris-flow activity from upland Britain.
   Alluvial fans and debris cones have developed primarily as a result of
   the resedimentation of late Midlandian (Wisconsin) drift and talus
   slopes, and mobilization of materials involved flooding,
   transitional-flow, and debris-flow processes. Pollen analysis of peat
   horizons interbedded with alluvial-fan and debris-cone sediments
   indicates that land-use changes mere an important factor in lowering the
   threshold for local slope erosion. Phases of aggradation also coincide
   with well-documented episodes of climate change, and, hence, fan
   development is probably a function of both anthropogenic and climatic
   forcing. A sequence of events may have involved initial slope
   destabilization due to overgrazing and removal of vegetation that mas
   followed by debris mobilization and fan aggradation during intense
   rainstorms associated with climate change.}},

Title = {{Controls on turbidite sand deposition during gravity-driven extension of
   a passive margin: examples from Miocene sediments in Block 4, Angola}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, exploration of the Lower Congo Basin in Angola has
   focused on the Neogene turbidite sand play of the Malembo Formation.
   Gravity tectonics has played an important role during deposition of the
   Malembo Formation and has imparted a well-documented structural style to
   the post-rift sediments. An oceanward transition from thin-skinned
   extension through mobile salt and eventually to thin-skinned
   compressional structures characterises the post-rift sediments. There
   has been little discussion, however, regarding the influence of these
   structures on the deposition of the Malembo Formation turbidite sands.
   Block 4 lies at the southern margin of the Lower Congo Basin and is
   dominated by the thin-skinned extensional structural style. Using a
   multidisciplinary approach we trace the post-rift structural and
   stratigraphic evolution of this block to study the structural controls
   on Neogene turbidite sand deposition.
   In the Lower Congo Basin the transition from terrestrial rift basin to
   fully marine passive margin is recorded by late Aptian evaporites of the
   Loeme Formation. Extension of the overlying post-rift sequences has
   occurred where the Loeme Formation has been utilised as a detachment
   surface for extensional faults. Since the late Cretaceous, the passive
   margin sediments have moved down-slope on the Loeme detachment. This
   history of gravity-driven extension is recorded in the post-rift
   sediments of Block 4. Extension commenced in the Albian in the east of
   the block and migrated westwards with time. In the west, the extension
   occurred mainly in the Miocene and generated allochthonous fault blocks
   or ``rafts{''}, separated by deep grabens. The Miocene extension
   occurred in two main phases with contrasting slip vectors; in the early
   Miocene the extension vector was to the west, switching to
   southwest-directed extension in the late Miocene. Early Miocene faults
   and half-grabens trend north-south whereas late Miocene structures trend
   northwest-southeast. The contrast in slip vectors between these two
   phases emphasises the differences in driving mechanisms: the early
   Miocene faulting was driven by basinward tilting of the passive margin,
   but gravity loading due to sedimentary progradation is considered the
   main driver for the late Miocene extension. The geological evolution of
   the late Miocene grabens is consistent with southwest-directed extension
   due to southwest progradation of the Congo fan.
   High-resolution biostratigraphic data identifies the turbidite sands in
   Block 4 as early Miocene (17.5-15.5 Ma) and late Miacene (10.5-5.5 Ma)
   in age. Deposition of these sands occurred during the two main phases of
   gravity-driven extension. Conditions of low sedimentation rates relative
   to high fault displacement rates were prevalent in the early Miocene.
   Seafloor depressions were generated in the hangingwalls of the main
   extensional faults, ultimately leading to capture of the turbidity
   currents. Lower Miocene turbidite sand bodies therefore trend
   north-south, parallel to the active faults. Cross-faults and relay ramps
   created local topographic highs capable of deflecting turbidite flows
   within the half grabens. Flow-stripping of turbidity currents across
   these features caused preferential deposition of sands across, and
   adjacent to, the highs. Turbidite sands deposited in the early part of
   the late Miocene were influenced by both the old north-south fault
   trends and by the new northwest-southeast fault trends. By latest
   Miocene times turbidite channels crosscut the active
   northwest-southeast-trending faults. These latest Miocene faults had
   limited potential to capture turbidity currents because the associated
   hangingwall grabens were rapidly filled as pro-delta sediments of the
   Congo fan prograded across the area from the northeast. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Probabilistic seismic-hazard assessments use attenuation relations that
   give some measure of earthquake ground motion as a function of distance,
   magnitude, and sometimes other parameters. Among the various relations
   that have been presented, an ambiguity exists with respect to whether
   the amplitudes of strong motion on rock show a distance-dependent
   magnitude saturation. Given a high degree of scatter in a limited number
   of observations, current empirical data cannot resolve this issue.
   Therefore, a series of synthetic ground-motion simulations have been
   conducted to elucidate the magnitude dependence of the distance decay
   for rock sites. Three different techniques are used: one based on
   empirical Green's functions, one based on theoretical Green's functions
   with a simple source representation, and one based on theoretical
   Green's functions with a composite source representation. All three
   techniques imply that ground motion decays less rapidly with distance
   for larger magnitude earthquakes, so that there is a distance-dependent
   magnitude saturation. Intuitively this can be explained as follows: at
   longer distances the Green's functions are more complex due to various
   arrivals spread out over a longer duration of time. A larger earthquake,
   with more subevents spread over a greater time period, will have
   constructive interference among the various arrivals from each subevent,
   and the longer durations of the subevent signals at larger distances
   will cause a proportionately greater increase in the amplitude than what
   typically occurs at shorter distances. Five different attenuation
   relations are evaluated on the basis of this prediction, and the
   implications with respect to probabilistic seismic-hazard assessment are
   tested in Field and Peterson (2000).}},

Abstract = {{This essay was prepared as an invited closure of a thematic session on
   ``Scaling and Extrapolation{''} at the CGTE Conference on ``Food and
   Forestry: Global Change and Global Challenges{''}. It is addressed to
   those who prognosticate at the global or other large levels about food
   and forestry systems, and who naturally confront several problems, and
   inevitably also some risk. The problems range from conceptual and
   practical to measuremental and statistical. For other than simplistic
   models, many constraints apply to procedures used to aggregate from
   small-scale to large-scale representations of agricultural systems,
   whether they be biophysical or socioeconomic, especially when
   uncertainty is explicitly recognized. Model-linking procedures work well
   in some cases but by no means all. The risks encountered in such work
   are similarly wide-ranging, depending on the intrinsic uncertainties,
   context, analyst and audience. These spectrums of problems and risks,
   along with some suggestions for what practically can be done about them
   (largely involving ad hoc simulation modeling), are examined from a

Abstract = {{Human exposure to aldehydes has been evaluated in five urban locations
   and one rural-industrial location in the north-west area of Milan in
   winter 1999 and in summer 1998-99. Ambient air samples collected on
   dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH)-coated diffusive cartridges were analysed
   for aldehydes as their DNPH-derivatives. Aldehydes have been identified
   and their concentration measured via HPLC-UV and LC-APCI-MS negative ion
   mode methods. During the winter the range of total concentration of
   aldehydes was 16.7-30.7 mug/m(3) at the urban locations and 11.7
   mug/m(3) at the rural-industrial location. Formaldehyde accounted for
   50\% of the total amount of carbonyl compounds in all locations; the
   percentage of acetaldehyde was more variable: 23-38\% of the total
   carbonyls. The contribution of outdoor environment to the average human
   daily intake of formaldehyde in this area (urban and rural-industrial)
   is mostly 1-2\% of the total human exposure. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Background: The aim of this study was to ascertain the utility of
   echo-Doppler in the analysis of the low resistance thyroid
   vascularization in diffuse toxic goiter (DTG), and the effectiveness of
   Lugol's solution (iodine-iodide solution) in patients undergoing
   thyroidectomy.
   Study Design: Twenty-five patients with diffuse toxic goiter were
   evaluated and compared with 19 normal subjects. Patients were treated
   with increasing doses of Lugol's solution 2\% for 7 days until a total
   dose of 75 mg of iodine was given. Echo-Doppler was performed on the
   last day of treatment, 12 hours before operation.
   Results: Mean basal Doppler Resistance Index (RI) of intrathyroid
   arterial flow was significantly lower in patients with DTG compared with
   normal controls (0.4718 +/- 0.0625 versus 0.55 +/- 0.05, range: 0.472 to
   0.643; p = 0.008). Moreover, the RI was significantly increased in
   patients with DTG after Lugol's solution (+16.46 +/- 10.22\%, range:
   -2.59 to +39.97; p < 0.0005).
   Conclusions: Echo-Doppler RI allowed documenting lower arterial
   resistances within the thyroid gland in patients with DTG. The use of
   preoperative Lugol's solution therapy induces normalization of those
   changes for safer thyroidectomy. (J Am Coll Surg 2000;191:607-612. (C)

Abstract = {{Aims Abciximab has previously been shown to enhance thrombolysis and
   improve myocardial perfusion when combined with reduced doses of
   alteplase. The purpose of the reteplase phase of TIMI 14 was to evaluate
   the effects of abciximab when used in combination with a reduced dose of
   reteplase for ST-elevation myocardial infarction.
   Methods and Results Patients (n=299) with ST-elevation myocardial
   infarction were treated with aspirin and randomized to a control arm
   with standard dose reteplase (10+10 U given 30 min apart) or abciximab
   (bolus of 0.25 mg.kg(-1) and 12-h infusion of 0.125 mug.kg(-1).min(-1))
   in combination with reduced doses of reteplase (5+5 U or 10+5 U).
   Control patients received standard weight-adjusted heparin (bolus of 70
   U.kg(-1); infusion of 15 U.kg(-1).h(-1)), while each of the combination
   arms with abciximab and reduced dose reteplase received either low dose
   heparin (bolus of 60 U.kg(-1); infusion of 7 U.kg(-1).h(-1)) or very low
   dose heparin (bolus of 30 U.kg(-1): infusion of 4 U.kg(-1).h(-1)). The
   rate of TIMI 3 how at 90 min was 70\% for patients treated with 10+10 U
   of reteplase alone (n=87, 73\% for those treated with 5+5 U of reteplase
   with abciximab (n=88), and 77\% for those treated with 10+5 U of
   reteplase with abciximab (n=75. Complete (greater than or equal to 70\%)
   ST resolution at 90 min was seen in 56\% of patients receiving a reduced
   dose of reteplase in combination with abciximab compared with 48\% of
   patients receiving reteplase alone.
   Conclusions Reduced doses of reteplase when administered in combination
   with abciximab were associated with higher TIMI 3 how rates than
   reported previously for reduced doses of reteplase without abciximab and
   were at least as high as for full dose reteplase alone (C) 2000 The

Abstract = {{Aim: Purification of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) from rat testis;
   separation and-identification of various subunits and their role in
   eicosanoid biosynthesis. Methods: Purification of mt testicular GSTs by
   affinity chromatography, employing S-hexylglutathione-linked
   epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B column and separation of individual
   subunits by reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC).
   Characterization of affinity purified GSTs by Sodium dodecyl
   sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot
   analysis. The role of testicular GSTs in eicosanoid biosynthesis was
   determined by incubating GSTs with 5,6-Leukotriene A(4)Me (LTA(4)Me) and
   prostaglandin H-2(PGH(2)) and analyzing the products formed on HPLC/TLC.
   Results: The present study reveals that majority of rat testicular GSTs
   are of Y-b size (60\%) with molecular weight of 27 kDa. The most
   predominant subunits, however, are GST Y-n2(27\%), followed by GST
   Y-c(24\%) and GST Y-n1(20\%). These testicular GSTs showed very high
   Leukotriene C-4 (LTC4) synthase activity with 5, 6-Leukotriene A(4)Me
   (LTA(4)Me) as the substrate and prostaglandin D (PGD) synthase activity
   with prostaglandin H-2(PGH(2)) as the substrate. Conclusion: Majority of
   rat testicular GSTs are Y-b sized and are involved in the synthesis of
   eicosanoids like LTC4 and PG(4).}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: We employed modern statistical and data mining methods to
   model survival based on preoperative and intraoperative parameters for
   patients undergoing damage control surgery.
   METHODS: One hundred seventy-four parameters were collected from 68
   damage control patients in prehospital, emergency center, operating
   room, and intensive care unit (ICU) settings. Data were analyzed with
   logistic regression and data mining. Outcomes were survival and death
   after the initial operation.
   RESULTS: Overall mortality was 66.2\%. Logistic regression identified pH
   at initial ICU admission (odds ratio: 4.4) and worst partial
   thromboplastin time from hospital admission to ICU admission (odds
   ratio: 9.4) as significant. Data mining selected the same factors, and
   generated a simple algorithm for patient classification. Model accuracy
   was 83\%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Inability to correct pH at the conclusion of initial
   damage-control laparotomy and the worst PTT can be predictive of death.
   These factors may be useful to identify patients with a high risk of
   mortality. (C) 2001 by Excerpta Medica, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigated effective methods of teaching tool-using
   skills to junior high school students. Students participating in the
   study were having difficulty using tools. The relative effectiveness of
   3 types of instruction for helping the students improve working skills
   was analyzed by a comparison of 3 groups of participants. In the first
   method, 21 students were told how to use the claws of a hammer, and
   given a demonstration. In the secund method (22 students), charts and
   pictures illustrating the laws of leverage were explained simply, and a
   demonstration was given. The third method (21 students) included the
   second method plus immediately having the students practice pulling
   nails. When the 3 groups were compared, the results showed that
   participants in the third group improved their skills the most. This
   group was also able to transfer the skill to other tools that use the
   laws of leverage, such as a sheet metal cutter, even though the
   appearance of those tools is suite different from the tool the
   participants were trained on. The explanation of the laws of leverage
   was effective, but immediately allowing the students to work with actual
   tools was an even more effective method of instruction.}},

Abstract = {{Eighty-six healthy, young Caucasian 18-year-old men with no known
   disease or bone injury were recruited to this study at the United States
   Naval Academy, Change in bone mineral density (BMD) of the hip, lumbar
   spine, and distal tibia, and total body bone mineral content (TBMC) was
   measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), BMD and TBMC of
   these men were measured within 2 months (67 +/- 3 days) of entering the
   Academy, and, at the end of their first, second, and fourth years, Hip
   BMD was unchanged during the study period (p > 0.05), Lumbar spine BMD
   increased 3\% (p < 0.001) and distal tibia BMD increased 5\% (p <
   0.001), TBMC showed a 7.5\% increase over the study period, In this
   group of young men, gain in BMD and TBMC is greatest to age 21 years,
   with minimal further increase after age 21, The significance of this
   rise in bone mass during early adulthood on risk for osteoporotic
   fractures in later life or its impact on exercise-related bone injuries
   is unknown and warrants further examination. (C) 2000 by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The study objective was to investigate the relationship of insulin
   resistance (IR) with the lipoprotein phenotype in familial combined
   hyperlipidemia (FCH). Thirty-seven FCH men diagnosed by clinical and
   biochemical criteria and classified as lipoprotein phenotype lla (0 =
   9), llb (0 = 17), or IV (n = 11) were compared with a healthy control
   group of 30 men of similar age, body mass index (BMI), waist to hip
   ratio (WHR), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In all subjects,
   the plasma lipoprotein profile and baseline and post-oral glucose
   tolerance test (OGTT) glucose and insulin plasma values were measured.
   An intravenous glucose tolerance test was performed and IR was studied
   by the peripheral insulin sensitivity index (Si). After the OGTT,
   significantly higher values for insulinemia (at 0, 60, 90, and 120
   minutes) and the area under the curve (AUC) of insulin secretion were
   observed in FCH. The AUC of insulin was greater in FCH subjects with the
   hypertriglyceridemic phenotype as compared with the controls and
   significantly lower Si levels, indicating greater IR, were found in the
   three FCH groups (control, 3.48 a 1.87 mU/L/min; FCH lla, 2.09 +/- 1.08;
   FCH llb, 1.54 +/- 0.77; FCH IV, 1.47 +/- 0.93; P < .001). The prevalence
   of IR (Si < 2 x 10(-4) mU/L/min) was greater in FCH, independent of the
   lipoprotein phenotype, as compared with the controls (P < .0001). Higher
   plasma glucose and insulin levels at 120 minutes and lower Si values
   were found in the FCH lla group compared with the controls (P < .05),
   indicating a state of IR in this subgroup of normotriglyceridemic
   subjects. In conclusion, IR was found in the three FCH lipoprotein
   phenotypes, being more severe in subjects with hypertriglyceridemia.
   Hence, the therapeutic goals in FCH should include measures to normalize
   plasma lipids and improve peripheral insulin sensitivity. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Like other members of the genus Hantavirus in the family Bunyaviridae,
   Puumala virus (PUUV) is thought to be co-evolving with its natural host,
   the bank vole Clethrionomys glareolus. To gain insight into the
   evolutionary history of PUUV in northern Europe during the last
   post-glacial period, we have studied wild-type PUUV strains originating
   from areas along two postulated immigration routes of bank voles to
   Fennoscandia. Full-length sequences of the S RNA segment and partial
   sequences (nt 2168-2569) of the M segment were recovered by RT-PCR
   directly from bank vole tissues collected at three locations in Russian
   Karelia and one location in Denmark. Phylogenetic analysis showed that
   strains from Karelia and Finland belong to the same genetic lineage,
   supporting the hypothesis that PUUV spread to present Finland via a
   Karelian land-bridge. The Danish PUUV strains showed no particularly
   close relatedness to any of the known PUUV strains and formed a distinct
   phylogenetic lineage on trees calculated for both S and M segment
   sequences. Although no direct link between the Danish PUUV strains and
   those of the southern Scandinavian lineage was found, within the S
   segment of Danish PUUV strains, two regions with higher similarity to
   either northern Scandinavian or - to a less extent - southern
   Scandinavian genetic lineages were revealed, suggesting evolutionary
   connections of their precursors.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, medical schools have begun increasing the amount of
   problem-based teaching, which gives students the opportunity to apply a
   database in a simulated clinical setting. This exercise helps them
   incorporate principles of diagnosis and treatment into their procedural
   memory. Although problem-based teaching has great educational benefits,
   it poses a unique challenge. It is extremely labor-intensive, because
   until now it has been assumed that patient-based teaching can only be
   done in small groups, requiring a large number of faculty to moderate
   group seminars. In today's economic climate, with difficulty in
   recruiting sufficient faculty, having an alternative to small-group
   teaching has potential advantages. Here, the authors describe the
   process of developing principles of problem-based teaching from small
   groups into an instructional method for a large-group setting for a
   large clinical neuroscience course using patient-based sessions.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine whether transplanting paediatric
   cystic fibrosis (CF) patients later in the course of their disease was
   detrimental to their post-transplant survival. Data was collected from
   51 children with CF undergoing lung or heart-lung transplantation May
   1988-March 1999. The following risk factors were tested by Cox
   proportional hazards modelling: age at transplant; sex; donor/recipient
   sex mismatch; donor/recipient cytomegalovirus (CMV) mismatch; cold and
   warm graft ischaemic times; and donor age. Pretransplant forced
   expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), minimum oxygen saturation
   obtained during 12 min walk (Sa,O(2)min), and a survival probability
   score (SP) calculated from FEV1, age adjusted resting heart rate, age,
   sex, blood haemoglobin (Hb), and serum albumin were then added to the
   model.
   None of the risk factors were significantly correlated with death during
   the study period. Na evidence that clinical status prior to transplant
   has any effect upon the post-transplant survival of children with cystic
   fibrosis was found.}},

Abstract = {{A constitutively expressed beta -lactamase gene from a clinical isolate
   of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, J675Ia, has been cloned. Its DNA
   sequence is almost identical to that of bla(TEM2) (one nucleotide

   amino acid sequence identical to that of TEM-2, The bla(TEM) gene was
   present within a novel Tn1/Tn3-type transposon in the genome of isolate
   J675Ia and the transposon was able to mobilize bla(TEM) on to the broad
   host-range conjugative plasmid, R388. When transferred to an Escherichia
   coli recipient, R388::Tn conferred high-level ampicillin resistance.
   This represents the first identification of a TEM beta -lactamase in S.

Abstract = {{Nd and Pb isotopes from the Lake of the Woods greenstone belt indicate
   the presence of three distinct reservoir sources: old enriched crust
   (>3.0 Ga); pre-2.7 Ga, homogeneous depleted mantle; and post-2.70 Ga
   heterogeneous mantle. values of +1.1 to +2.3 for ultramafic to felsic
   metavolcanic rocks (2.74-2.72 Ga) indicate derivation from depleted
   mantle. The value of -0.9 for younger turbidite (2.71 Ga), in
   conjunction with detrital zircon ages ranging from 2.72 to 3.0 Ga,
   indicates detritus from local greenstone belt sources (depleted mantle)
   mixed with an older crustal source. Post-2.70 Ga heterogeneity is
   demonstrated by values ranging from -0.4 to +0.4 in shoshonitic to
   calc-alkaline metavolcanic rocks and +2.1 in a coeval ultrapotassic
   pluton. Pb isotopes from the pluton indicate derivation from a depleted
   mantle reservoir with an initial Pb-207/Pb-204 of 14.52, an initial
   Pb-206/Pb-204 of 13.29, and 7.86. Isotopic comparison with post-2.70 Ga
   potassic suites from across the Superior Province indicates widespread
   mixing between depleted mantle and enriched end members. The enriched
   end member has isotopic characteristics of rocks derived from old
   crustal terrains, such as the Winnipeg River and Opatica subprovinces.
   This type of isotopic heterogeneity could be the result of crustal
   contamination or derivation from metasomatized mantle. Contamination of
   the mantle wedge by influx of fluids derived from partial melting of
   isotopically evolved, subducted sediments is favoured for the Superior
   Province potassic suite, because elevated concentration of Sr, Nd, and
   Pb in conjunction with primitive Mg\#s suggest only limited crustal
   contamination has occurred.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the baryon-resonance admixture to the deuteron wave
   function on the momentum dependences of the differential cross section,
   the tensor analyzing power T-20, and the polarization-transfer
   coefficient kappa (0) for backward elastic deuteron-proton scattering at
   high energies is investigated. The reaction in question is assumed to
   proceed predominantly through nucleon and nucleon-resonance exchanges.
   The formalism used in this study is based on light-front dynamics. The
   effect of various parameters of the problem on the results of the
   calculations is analyzed, and it is shown that, even at a 1\% level of
   the total admixture of nucleon resonances to the deuteron wave function,
   a description of experimental data that is superior to that within the
   one-nucleon-exchange approximation can be achieved by appropriately
   choosing the contributions of various resonances. For qualitative
   agreement between the results of the calculations and experimental data
   to be attained, it is sufficient to take into account the contributions
   of the lightest negative-parity baryon resonances. Upon taking into
   account baryon exchanges, results computed for observables with
   different deuteron wave functions show a smaller scatter than analogous
   results obtained within the one-nucleon-exchange approximation. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The Hubbard model is studied at half filling, using two complementary
   variational wave functions, the Gutzwiller ansatz for the metallic phase
   at small values of the interaction parameter U and its analog for the
   insulating phase at large values of U. The metallic phase is
   characterized by the Drude weight, which exhibits a jump at the critical
   point U-c. In the insulating phase the system behaves as a collection of
   dipoles which increase both in number and in size as U gets smaller. The
   two wave functions are able to describe the two asymptotic regimes
   (small and large values of U, respectively), but they can no longer be
   trusted in the region of the Mott transition (U approximate to U-c).
   More powerful methods are needed to study, for instance, the divergence

Abstract = {{Objectives: Although sleep disorders are common, these are
   under-recognized and underestimated by many workers in the medical field
   due to lack of physician's education in sleep and sleep disorders. We
   conducted this survey to assess the general knowledge and attitude of
   Primary Health Care Physicians in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia towards sleep
   disorders.
   Methods: A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to all
   Primary Health Care physicians working in Primary Health Care centers of
   the Ministry of Health in Riyadh. The following factors were assessed:
   demographic data of the participating physicians, their background about
   sleep disorders and their recognition of possible presentations,
   consequences and diagnostic tests for sleep disorders.
   Results: Complete data was available from 209 physicians. Fifty three
   percent were males and 47\% were females. Only 57\% a,agreed that sleep
   disorders are a distinct medical specialty and 40\% felt that sleep
   disorders are common medical problems based on their practice. The
   recognition of some of the serious consequences of Obstructive Sleep
   Apnea Syndrome was poor; motor vehicle accidents (63\%), ischemic heart
   disease (40\%), hypertension (50\%) and pulmonary hypertension (13\%).
   Only 15\% had attended lectures about sleep disorders during their
   postgraduate training or practice, Physicians who have attended lectures
   about sleep disorders referred significantly mon patients than
   physicians who have not attended any (P=0.003).
   Conclusion: We conclude that Primary Health Care physicians in Riyadh do
   not completely recognize the importance and impact of Obstructive Sleep
   Apnea Syndrome and other sleep disorders. Education of Primary Health
   Care physicians about sleep disorders may increase detection of sleep
   disorders; and hence, the number of referrals, the provision of proper
   treatment and the prevention of complications.}},

Abstract = {{The Eastern Bristlebird Dasyornis brachypterus inhabits a wide range of
   vegetation communities including rainforest, eucalypt forest, woodland,
   mallee, shrubland, swamp, heathland and sedgeland. At Barren Grounds,
   East ern Bristlebirds mostly occurred in habitat with the characteristic
   layers of ground cover (less than or equal to 0.25 m), low cover
   (0.25-1.0 m) and tall shrub cover (greater than or equal to 1 m). Using
   the point-frequency method, the ground cover measure averaged 91\% and
   consisted of herbs, coral ferns and litter; the low cover averaged 92\%
   and consisted of a tangle of herbs, coral ferns, litter and/or small
   shrubs; and the: tall shrub cover averaged 74\% and consisted of larger
   shrubs but also included mallee and tree cover. At Barren Grounds, in
   1992 and 1995, respectively, the density of Eastern Bristlebirds in old
   fire-age habitat (9-15 years) was 2.5-times and 5-times the density in
   young fire-age habitat (three years). In the recently burnt areas,
   Eastern Bristlebirds generally avoided regenerating low vegetation in
   favour of unburnt clumps, rapidly regenerating malice or shrubs,
   particularly Mclaleuca squarrosa in wet areas, and patchily burnt areas
   some of which were associated with escarpment edges. In old fire-age
   habitat at Barren Grounds-Budderoo. Jervis Bay and Nadgee, Eastern
   Bristlebirds breed and occur at relatively high densities. Fire has been
   implicated in the local extinction of numerous Eastern Bristlebird
   populations. However, the two populations which are currently the
   largest, Barren Grounds-Budderoo and Jervis Bay, are characterised by a
   three decade recent history of relatively small-area burns and long
   periods between fires ol er much of the available habitat. The Eastern
   Bristlebird is a cover-dependent and fire-sensitive species. Areas of
   known Eastern Bristlebird habitat and adjacent potential habitat should
   be managed to enhance the growth of dense low vegetation and to exclude
   fire.}},

   encountered, bringing porphyrins into laddered stacks with edge-to-edge
   contacts of 3.5 Angstrom. The isomeric diesters Zn-3 and Zn-4 show
   different tendencies in pi-pi stacking. Models of bacteriochlorophyll c
   Zn-8 and Zn-11, possessing a formyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and a

Abstract = {{Background: Clinical studies have shown that patients with Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) who are treated with rivastigmine have statistically
   significantly better scores on 5 scales used to assess AD than control
   patients receiving placebo. However, the clinical meaning and cost
   implications of these differences are not clear.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical meaning
   and cost implications of statistically significant results obtained in
   clinical trials of rivastigmine for the treatment of AD. Potential cost
   implications for the health care system, caregivers, and society are
   considered.
   Methods: Data on clinical effects of rivastigmine were obtained from
   published North American and European clinical studies of patients with
   mild to moderately severe AD receiving rivastigmine 6 to 12 mg/d (n =
   828) or placebo (n = 647). Differences in scores on the Alzheimer's
   Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Function, Clinician's Interview-Based
   Impression of Change with both clinical and caregiver information
   considered, Progressive Deterioration Scale, Mini-Mental State
   Examination (MMSE), and Global Deterioration Scale were assessed. A
   convenience panel of 9 Canadian specialists experienced in the treatment
   of AD provided their opinions on the clinical importance of the trial
   results. Chart review was performed to identify specific behaviors that
   improved, and cost implications of improvements were assessed.
   Results: The panel determined that statistically significant differences
   in scores on all scales except the MMSE were likely associated with
   functional or cognitive differences that were clinically relevant for
   patients, reflecting stabilization that would have beneficial
   consequences for caregivers and health care resource use. Subsequent
   chart review showed that improvement on specific scale items confirmed
   the physician panel's opinion. Analysis of possible cost implications to
   society indicated that medication expenditures would be offset largely
   by delays in the need for paid home care and institutionalization,
   positive effects on caregiver health, and less time lost from work for
   the caregiver.
   Conclusions: From the perspective of a Canadian specialist panel,
   rivastigmine treatment for AD produces clinically relevant effects for
   patients that are beneficial to caregivers. These effects suggest
   decreased use of caregiver resources and delays in the need for
   institutionalization, both of which reduce societal costs.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To demonstrate the use of high resolution ultrasound
   measurements and power Doppler mode in the diagnosis and follow up of a
   patient with psoriatic arthritic with retrocalcaneal bursitis and
   Achilles tendonitis.
   Methods-An outpatient based ATL HDI 3000 ultrasound equipment was used
   with a CL10-5 MHZ 26 mm probe and musculoskeletal software. Real time B
   mode and power Doppler mode were used to detect changes in structure and
   blood flow.
   Results-Unilateral retrocalcaneal bursitis and Achilles tendonitis were
   demonstrated by sonography. Power Doppler mode was useful to demonstrate
   an increased blood flow around an abnormal retrocalcaneal bursa. A
   follow up examination showed marginal thickening of the Achilles tendon
   without any bursitis.
   Conclusions-Ultrasonography is an objective method in the confirmation
   of clinical diagnosis after physical examination. During the examination

Title = {{The relation of shoulder pain and range-of-motion problems to functional
   limitations, disability, and perceived health of men with spinal cord
   injury: A multifaceted longitudinal study}},
Journal = {{ARCHIVES OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{81}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: To determine if shoulder pain and range-of-motion (ROM)
   problems can be predicted by demographic, injury-related, body weight,
   and radiographic data over 3 years and to determine the relationships
   among these shoulder problems and functional limitations, disability,
   and perceived health.
   Design: A longitudinal, 2-panel study in which data were collected at 2
   points in time, 3 years apart.
   Setting: The community.
   Participants: Eighty-nine adult men with traumatic spinal cord injury
   (SCI) in the Houston-Galveston, TX, area.
   Main Outcome Measures: The acromioclavicular (AC) and the glenohumeral
   (GH) joints were x-rayed on plain film in standard anteroposterior
   position. Functional limitations were determined with the FIM(TM)
   instrument; disability was measured with the Craig Handicap Assessment
   and Reporting Technique (CHART).
   Results: Thirty percent had shoulder pain and 22\% had shoulder ROM
   problems. Men with shoulder pain had lived longer with SCI, were more
   likely to report shoulder ROM problems, had lower CHART mobility scores,
   and were more likely to rate their health as fair than those without
   shoulder pain. Shoulder ROM problems were more common among men who were
   older, had AC joint narrowing, had lower FIM scores, and reported poorer
   health.
   Conclusion: Shoulder pain and ROM problems were relatively prevalent.
   Demographic, injury-related, and radiographic variables were identified
   that were predictive of these problems over a period of at least 3
   years. The shoulder problems were related to functional limitations,
   disability, and perceived health.}},

Abstract = {{Using the real-time diffusion methodology first developed by Codastefano
   {[}Rev. Sci. Instrum. 48, 1650 (1977)] we show that deviations from
   strictly one-dimensional transport (i.e., blockages and voids) widely
   cited in the literature as leading to erroneous results, have little
   effect on the measured diffusivity. In this methodology, radiotracer,
   initially located at one end of a cylindrical diffusion sample, is used
   as the diffusant. The sample is positioned in a concentric isothermal
   radiation shield with collimation bores located at defined positions
   along its axis. The intensity of the radiation emitted through the
   collimators is measured as a function of time using solid state
   detectors. Diffusivities are calculated from the signal difference
   between the detectors. These results were obtained using In-114m
   radiotracer in benign indium. A 60\% blockage was simulated by using a 2
   mm source disk diffusing into 3 mm diameter host section. A void/bubble
   was simulated by inserting a 1 mm diameter by 1 mm long side plug into
   the sample 7 mm from the top (radiotracer section). The resulting
   self-diffusivities obtained were, for both modifications, comparable
   with other ground experiments. These results agree with numerical
   simulations. An analytical model describing the minimal effects of
   blockages and voids on the output diffusivity is presented. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Mixed starters containing Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc cremoris and
   Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains were produced on commercial starter
   media (MB Complete, Thermolac, Marlac), as well as on milk. With the
   exception of Marlac, the starters were cultured under pH control, The
   effect of media and incubation temperature (22 or 32 degreesC) on
   population ratios, on specific acidifying activities (SAA) of the
   cultures as well as on their ability to produce aroma compounds in milk
   was studied. The starters had higher contents in lactobacilli when they
   were produced at 32 degreesC, whereas a tendency to obtain higher
   Leuconostoc populations was observed at 22 degreesC, With respect to the
   lactococci, there was a significant interaction between temperature and
   growth medium for both strains. Thus, Le. cremoris T2 reached higher
   populations at 32 degreesC if grown in MB complete and Thermolac,
   whereas in Marlac and skim milk, viable counts were higher at 22
   degreesC. The lactococci represented 50\% of the total population of the
   culture at the beginning of the incubation, but they composed between
   80\% and 99\% of the total population following fermentation. The best
   medium for growth of Leuconostoc was milk, but populations of only 10(8)
   Cfu/ml were reached. The lactobacilli did not grow well in MB Complete,
   and their development was best in the low-phosphate Marlac medium. The
   cultures grown on Marlac had the highest SAA values, whereas those grown
   on MB complete had the lowest. Overall, more ethanol and diacetyl were
   detected in the fermented milks when the starters used to inoculate them
   were produced at 22 degreesC.}},

Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1447-1460}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Several commercial instruments size particles based on their
   acceleration in a high-velocity flow field. Previous work suggested that
   droplet distortion in these instruments resulted in inaccurate sizing.
   Liquid aerosol droplet shape distortion produced in an accelerating flow
   field was therefore computed through analytical solution of the
   Navier-Stokes equation for comparison to experiment. A
   high-Reynolds-number empirical approximation to the pressure external to
   the droplet was used in these calculations. Within the droplet, the
   longest-lived excitations correspond to a quadrupolar distortion of
   shape. Droplet excitations were obtained in terms of aerosol diameter,
   viscosity, surface tension and density. At the largest viscosities
   considered (as in many oils), only a damped relaxation was found,
   whereas at lower viscosities and high surface tension (as in water)
   damped capillary oscillations were predicted as possible, given rapid
   shifts in the surrounding air flow. In order to compute the effect of
   airflow varying in time, an approximate Green's function was used. The
   Green's function in the frequency domain was approximated using only a
   pair of poles, thereby accounting for only the longest-lived
   excitations. In application of the theory to compute aerosol distortion
   on passage through an aerodynamic particle sizer (APS) acceleration
   nozzle, the change in air velocity was found to be so gradual that no
   oscillations were induced for droplets as small as 20-mum diameter.
   Measurements of droplet undersizing in the APS compared favorably with
   the theoretical predictions. The theoretical results were also
   consistent with photographs of distorted oleic acid and only slightly
   distorted water droplets emerging from a nozzle. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},

Abstract = {{1. To determine the influence of macrophyte beds on plankton abundance
   within fluvial lakes of the St Lawrence River, planktonic components
   (macrozooplankton, heterotrophic bacteria, and phytoplankton as
   chlorophyll-a {[}Chl-a]) were sampled in Lake St Francis and Lake St
   Pierre during summer 1998. We tested the hypothesis that the abundance
   of planktonic components was higher within macrophyte beds in comparison
   to the more rapidly flushed open water areas of the fluvial lakes.
   2. The large cross channel variation in zooplankton biomass was indeed
   correlated with the presence of dense beds of submerged macrophytes.
   Total macrozooplankton biomass was nine-fold greater within the beds
   (mean = 180 mug L-1 dry mass) than in either the open water or areas
   with only sparse vegetation (mean = 20 mug L-1 dry mass).
   3. Chl-a and heterotrophic bacterial abundance were also higher in the
   beds, but only slightly so. There was no difference in total phosphorus
   or dissolved organic carbon concentrations between areas of dense
   vegetation, sparse vegetation or open water.
   4. Macrophyte beds on the margins of the fluvial lakes allow the
   development of high planktonic abundance relative to the fast flowing
   central channel. Macrozooplankton biomass was much higher at the
   outflows of the lakes (similar to 50 mug L-1 dry mass) in comparison to
   the inflows (<20 <mu>g L-1 dry mass). The increase is due to the
   transfer of organisms from submerged macrophyte beds into the central
   channel in the downstream quarter of the two lakes where the marginal
   littoral waters enter central channel waters.
   5. Along rivers, shallow fluvial lakes appear to act as sources of
   plankton which is exported downstream during years of extensive littoral
   macrophyte development.}},

Abstract = {{A number of problems of interest in signal processing can be reduced to
   nonlinear parameter estimation problems, The traditional approach to
   studying the stability of these estimation problems is to demonstrate
   finiteness of the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for a given noise distribution.
   We review an alternate, determinstic notion of stability for the
   associated nonlinear least squares (NLS) problem from the realm of
   nonlinear programming (i.e., that the global minimizer of the least
   squares problem exists and varies smoothly with the noise). Furthermore,
   we show that under mild conditions, identifiability of the parameters
   along with a finite CRB for the case of Gaussian noise is equivalent to
   deterministic stability of the NLS problem. Finally, we demonstrate the
   application of our result, which is general, to the problems of
   multichannel blind deconvolution and sinusoid retrieval to generate new
   stability results for these problems with little additional effort.}},

Abstract = {{Models of carbon storage in softwood and hardwood trees and forest soils
   and its emission from timber products and waste are developed and
   integrated with data on storage benefits to yield estimates of the value
   of the net carbon flux generated by afforestation. The long-term nature
   of the processes under consideration and the impact of varying the
   discount rate are explicitly incorporated within the model. A
   geographical information system (GIS) is used to apply carbon
   sequestration models to data on tree growth and soil type distribution
   for a large study area (the entire country of Wales). The major findings
   are: (1) all three elements under analysis (carbon sequestration in
   livewood, release from different products and waste, and storage or
   emission from soils) play a vital role in determining overall carbon
   flux; (2) woodland management has a substantial impact upon carbon
   storage in livewood however the choice of discount rate exerts the
   largest overall influence upon estimated carbon flux values; (3) timber
   growth rates (yield class) also have a major impact upon values; (4)
   tree species does affect storage values, however this is less important
   than the other factors listed above; (5) non-peat soils generally
   sequester relatively low levels of carbon. Planting upon peat soils can
   result in very substantial emissions of carbon which exceed the level of
   storage in livewood.
   The GIS is used to produce valuation maps which can be readily
   incorporated within cost-benefit analyses regarding optimal locations
   for conversion of land into forestry. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

   Fifteen patients with partial polycystic ovaries and eighteen patients

Abstract = {{Providing clean water at relevant quality and quantity is a challenge
   that regulatory authorities have to face in metropolitan cities that
   seem to develop at their limits of sustainability. Istanbul strives to
   face such a challenge for its population of over 10 million, through six

   reservoirs are presented, one based on current regulations and an
   alternative based on a more detailed classification. The results have
   shown that nutrient control is the primary issue, and one of the
   reservoirs has already exceeded the limits of being eutrophic, one is at
   mesotrophic conditions, and the remaining four are at the limit of being
   eutrophic, indicating the significance of making the correct decision
   and taking pertinent measures for management and control. It has been
   observed that the only mesotrophic resource, which also has the best
   general quality class, has no industry and a very low population
   density, whereas the one that is already eutrophic is also the one with
   the lowest quality class, has the highest population density, and has

Abstract = {{Reepithelialization and granulation tissue formation during cutaneous
   wound repair are mediated by a wide variety of growth and
   differentiation factors. Recent studies from our laboratory provided
   evidence for an important role of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) in
   the repair of the injured epithelium and for a novel function of the
   transforming growth factor-beta superfamily member activin in
   granulation tissue formation, KGF is weakly expressed in human skin, but
   is strongly upregulated in dermal fibroblasts after skin injury. Its
   binding to a transmembrane receptor on keratinocytes induces
   proliferation and migration of these cells. Furthermore, KGF has been
   shown to protect epithelial cells from the toxic effects of reactive
   oxygen species. We have identified a series of KGF-regulated genes that
   are Likely to play a role in these processes, In addition to KGF,
   activin seems to be a novel player in wound healing. Activin expression
   is hardly detectable in nonwounded skin, but this factor is highly
   expressed in redifferentiating keratinocytes of the hyperproliferative
   wound epithelium as well as in cells of the granulation tissue. To gain
   insight into the role of activin in wound repair, we generated
   transgenic mice that overexpress activin in basal keratinocytes of the
   epidermis, These mice were characterized by a hyperthickened epidermis
   and by dermal fibrosis, Most importantly, overexpression of activin
   strongly enhanced the process of granulation tissue formation,
   demonstrating a novel and important role of activin in cutaneous wound
   repair.}},

Abstract = {{Background Neither exsanguination to pulselessness nor cardiac arrest of
   30 min duration can be reversed with complete neurologic recovery using
   conventional resuscitation methods. Techniques that might buy time for
   transport, surgical hemostasis, and initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass
   or other resuscitation methods would be valuable. We hypothesized that
   an aortic flush with high-volume cold normal saline solution at the
   start of exsanguination cardiac arrest could rapidly preserve cerebral
   viability during 30 min of complete global ischemia and achieve good
   outcome.
   Methods: Sixteen dogs weighing 20-25 kg were exsanguinated to
   pulselessness over 5 min, and circulatory arrest was maintained for
   another 30 min. They were then resuscitated using closed-chest
   cardiopulmonary bypass and had assisted circulation for 2 h, mild
   hypothermia (34 degreesC) for 12 h, controlled ventilation for 20 h, and
   intensive care to outcome evaluation at 72 h. Two minutes after the
   onset of circulatory arrest, the dogs received a flush of normal saline
   solution at 4 degreesC into the aorta (cephalad) via a balloon catheter,
   Group I (n = 6) received a flush of 25 ml/kg saline with the balloon in
   the thoracic aorta; group n (n = 7) received a flush of 100 ml/kg saline
   with the balloon in the abdominal aorta.
   Results: The aortic flush decreased mean tympanic membrane temperature
   (Tty) in group I from 37.6 +/- 0.1 to 33.3 +/- 1.6 degreesC and in group
   II from 37.5 +/- 0.1 to 28.3 +/- 2.4 degreesC(P = 0.001). In group I,
   four dogs achieved overall performance category (OPC) 4 (coma), and 2
   dogs achieved OPC 5 (brain death). In group II, 4 dogs achieved OPC 1
   (normal), and 3 dogs achieved OPC 2 (moderate disability). Median
   (interquartile range {[}IQR]) neurologic deficit scores (NDS 0-10\% =
   normal; NDS 100\% = brain death) were 69\% (56-99\%) in group I versus
   4\% (0-15\%) in group II (P = 0.003). Median total brain histologic
   damage scores (HDS 0 = no damage; > 100 = extensive damage; 1,064 =
   maximal damage) were 144 (74-168) in group I versus 18 (3-36) in group
   II (P = 0.004); in three dogs from group II, the brain was
   histologically normal (HDS 0-5).
   Conclusions A single high-volume flush of cold saline (4 degreesC) into
   the abdominal aorta given 2 min after the onset of cardiac arrest
   rapidly induces moderate-to-deep cerebral hypothermia and can result in
   survival without functional or histologic brain damage, even after 30
   min of no blood flow.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Dyschromatopsia is a prominent sign in a variety of central
   retinal diseases, such as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC). The
   changes in colour vision may be due to either optical or neuronal
   factors in the diseased retina. The relative contribution from the two
   causes is unknown, but may be elucidated by obtaining knowledge of the
   anatomical derangement in the diseased retina in CSC.
   Methods: Twenty-six normal persons had their colour vision tested using
   the Tomey anamaloseope. The calculation of setting range (SR) and
   central mean point (CMP) for Rayleigh match and Moreland match was
   optimized, and normal ranges for these values were defined. Subsequently
   24 patients with CSC were examined by anomaloscopy and optical coherence
   tomography scanning, and the measures of colour vision were related to
   the anatomical changes observed on the scans.
   Results: The algorithm for calculating SR and CMP which is integrated
   into the Tomey anomaloscope could be considerably improved to increase
   sensitivity and reproducibility of these measures. Fifteen patients had
   abnormal colour vision. Nine patients had pseudo-protanomaly, seven
   patients had pseudo-tritanomaly, and three patients had abnormalities in
   both matches. There was no relation between these colour vision
   abnormalities and the anatomical derangement as seen by OCT in the
   diseased central retina.
   Conclusion: The findings argue against the notion that the density of
   retinal cell nuclei, the orientation of photoreceptors, or the size of
   the central serous detachment are related to the colour vision
   abnormalities in CSC. The question of whether these abnormalities are
   due to optical or neuronal factors remains open.}},

Abstract = {{The exposed and gulf-stream warmed south-west coast of Ireland has, a
   Lusitanean fauna composed of elements of the colder waters to the north
   and east, and others from the warmer Mediterranean Sea. Lough Hyne, a
   small marine body, is unusual on this coast in being very sheltered, but
   also in being characterised by many different niches within a small
   space (1 km(2)), Sponges are particularly abundant, morphologically
   varied and more than 100 species have been described. Species diversity
   was measured at 6 m intervals on vertical and inclined profiles (to a
   maximum of 30 m) at six sites, spanning a range of Row rate and
   sedimentation regimes. Diversity, richness, evenness and density varied
   significantly with both flow regime and depth, but was much lower on the
   surrounding Atlantic coast. Four different sponge communities were
   differentiated on the basis of sponge species assemblages which
   correlated with different environmental conditions. At sites of
   turbulent and fast flow conditions, sponge diversity and richness were
   lowest, with the highest values being found at the sites of moderate and
   high sedimentation. Significant differences were observed in all four
   ecological variables with respect to substratum angle with the exception
   of the site experiencing the most turbulent flow conditions. Lough Hyne
   was found to possess the second highest sponge species diversity
   (H=3.626) and richness (77 species) of all available figures from
   temperate, polar and tropical areas (of similar sized sampling area).
   The uniqueness, diversity and species composition of the sponge
   community at this location suggests Lough Hyne is, biologically. a
   marine island within the island of Ireland.}},

   Changes depend on olive varieties rather than extraction systems used.

Abstract = {{Interhemispheric field-aligned currents flowing between dayside
   conjugate ionospheres are calculated for different seasons. The currents
   are a result of redistribution of original three-dimensional currents
   because of different ionospheric conductivity in dark and sunlit
   conjugate hemispheres. Interhemispheric currents and related patterns
   for the electric potential distribution are computed for a reasonable
   model of the ionospheric conductivity. The interhemispheric
   field-aligned currents are attached to the terminator position, and they
   close a part of ionospheric currents, flowing in the summer
   high-latitude ionosphere, through the conjugate ionosphere of the
   opposite hemisphere. Although the interhemispheric currents are more
   significant for summer/winter conditions, they can be observed for
   equinoctial conditions as well because of a diurnal variation in the
   terminator position with respect to the geomagnetic poles.
   Interhemispheric currents in the winter ionosphere are generated mainly
   by sources in the summer hemisphere. An interesting consequence of the
   existence of interhemispheric currents is that auroral events can be
   observed not in the hemisphere with incident field-aligned currents from
   a magnetospheric source but in the opposite hemisphere.}},

Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1079-1085}},

Abstract = {{The feasibility of simultaneous analysis of mixtures containing two to
   four butene isomers and up to six total components using process mass
   spectrometry is assessed. As for typical (nonisomeric) applications of
   process mass spectrometry, simultaneous analysis is based on the
   assumption that the electron ionization mass spectra of mixtures are
   Linear combinations of the spectra of the individual constituents.
   Limits of detection for binary isomer mixtures are on the order of 0.1\%
   to 10\%, Limited by the ability to distinguish small differences between
   similar spectra. As spectral and mixture complexity increase, both
   accuracy and precision decrease. Not surprisingly the similarity of the
   spectra of stereoisomers cis- and trans-2-butene is greater than that of

Abstract = {{The authors describe their vision of what continuing medical education
   (CME) should become in the changing health care environment. They first
   discuss six types of literature (e.g,, concerning learning and adult
   development principles, problem-based/practice-based learning, and other
   topics) that contribute to ways of thinking about and understanding CME.
   They then state their view that the Association of American Medical
   Colleges (AAMC) has made a commitment to helping CME be more effective
   in the professional development of physicians.
   In presenting their new vision of CME, the authors describe their
   interpretation of the nature and values of CME (e.g., optimal CME is
   highly self-directed; the selection and design of the most relevant CME
   is based on data from each physician's responsibilities and performance;
   etc.). They then present seven action steps, suggestions to begin them,
   and the institutions and organizations they believe should carry them
   out, and recommend that the AAMC play a major role in supporting
   activities to carry out these steps. (For example, one action step is
   the generation and application of new knowledge about how and why
   physicians learn, select best practices, and change their behaviors).
   Six core competencies for CME educators are defined. The authors
   conclude by stating that collaboration among the appropriate academic
   groups, professional associations, and health care institutions, with
   leadership from the AAMC, is essential to create the best learning
   systems for the professional development of physicians.}},

Abstract = {{Previous work using prediction-motion tasks has indicated that
   time-to-contact estimates are based exclusively on binocular information
   when the approaching object is small. The aim of this study was to
   examine the influence of object size on the use of binocular information
   sources in specifying time-to-contact in one-handed catching. Subjects
   (n=10) were required to time their grasp to catch different-sized balls
   (60, 80, and 100 mm in diameter) approaching with a constant spatial
   trajectory and constant velocity of 2.0 m/s. Binocular information was
   manipulated with a telestereoscope that increased the individuals'
   effective interocular separation. Subjects performed six trials with
   each of the different-sized balls in normal and telestereoscopic viewing
   conditions. It was found that subjects closed the hand earlier when
   catching the small and medium balls under telestereoscopic viewing
   compared with normal viewing; furthermore, that subjects closed their
   hand earlier for the small and medium balls compared with the large ball
   under telestereoscopic viewing. With regard to hand aperture, there was
   an effect of ball size, with the hand being opened to a wider aperture
   for each increase in ball size. Subjects also opened the hand to a wider
   aperture when catching the small and medium balls under telestereoscopic
   viewing. These findings are consistent with the notion of an increased
   reliance on the use of binocular information when the approaching object
   is small. Furthermore, they indicate that binocular and monocular
   sources of information are not used in isolation, but rather in
   combination to support the timing of one-handed catching.}},

Abstract = {{The work aims to explore the sensitivity response of a robust-diagnostic
   model of the Ross Sea area to different forcings and boundary
   conditions. Numerical experiments using different open boundary
   velocities, wind stress fields, constraints for sea surface elevation,
   objectively analyzed or constant ad hoc thermohaline fields with
   different relaxation coefficients are proposed.
   Results show that realistic patterns and velocities in the basin are
   induced mainly by the wind forcing, while its variability can explain
   part of the modulation of the current field observed but does not affect
   significantly the Ross island recirculation, mainly controlled by the
   thermohaline field. The in-out flow below the Ross Ice Shelf (RIS) is
   influenced by the assumptions adopted for the Sea Surface Elevation
   along the shelf itself, while the wind variability can explain the
   exchange between the RIS cavity and the sea.
   Even if the model has to be improved, especially for what concerns the
   sea-ice interactions that are not present in this version, comparisons
   between current meters moorings data averages and reconstructed fields
   show that features can be explained by wind stress variability, while
   circulation patterns are in good agreement with experimental
   observations and other theoretical studies. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Immortalized rat Schwann cells (ISC) express endothelin (ET) receptors
   coupled to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and stimulation of
   phospholipase C (PLC). These effects precede phenotypic changes and
   increased DNA synthesis. We have investigated the role of ETs in the
   regulation of arachidonic acid (AA) release and mitogen-activated
   protein kinases (MAPKs). Both ET-1 and ET-3 increased AA release in ISC.
   This effect was sensitive to the phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) inhibitors
   E-6-(bromomethylene)tetrahydro-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2H-pyran-2-one and
   arachidonyl-trifluoromethyl ketone but was insensitive to inhibitors of
   PLC or phospholipase D-dependent diacyl-glycerol generation.
   ET-1-dependent AA release was also unaffected by removal of
   extracellular Ca2+ and blocking the concomitant elevation in
   {[}Ca2+](i), consistent with participation of a Ca2+-independent PLA(2).
   Treatment of ISC with ETs also resulted in activation of extracellular
   signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK,
   A cause-effect relationship between agonist-dependent AA release and
   stimulation of MAPKs, but not the opposite, was suggested by activation
   of JNK by exogenous AA and by the observation that inhibition of MAPK
   kinase or p38 MAPK was inconsequential to ET-1-induced AA release.
   Similar effects of ETs on AA release and MAPK activity were observed in
   cultures expanded from primary SC and in ISC. Regulation of these
   effecters may mediate the control of proliferation and differentiation
   of SC by ETs during peripheral nerve development and regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we study the problem of dilating unital completely
   positive (CP) semigroups (quantum dynamical semigroups) to weak Markov
   hows and then to semigroups of endomorphisms (E-o-semigroups) using the
   language of Hilbert modules. This is a very effective, representation
   free approach to dilation. In this way we are able to identify the right
   algebra (maximal in some sense) for endomorphisms to act. We are led
   inevitably to the notion of tensor product systems of Hilbert modules
   and units for them, generalizing Arveson's notions for Hilbert spaces.
   In the course of our investigations we are not only able to give new
   natural and transparent proofs of well-known facts for semigroups on
   B(H), but also extend the results immediately to much more general
   setups. For instance, Arveson classifies E-o-semigroups on IB(H) up to
   cocycle conjugacy by product systems of Hilbert spaces.(5) We find that
   conservative CP-semigroups on arbitrary unital C{*}-algebras are
   classified up to cocycle conjugacy by product systems of Hilbert
   modules. Looking at other generalizations, it turns out that the role
   played by E-o-semigroups on B(H) in dilation theory for CP-semigroups on
   B(G) is now played by E-o-semigroups on B-a(E), the full algebra of
   adjointable operators on a Hilbert module E. We have CP-semigroup
   versions of many results proved by Paschke(27) for CP maps.}},

   revealed an open reading frame of 1257bp starting with a minor TTG codon

   46170. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the glutamate dehydrogenase
   from, A. pernix K1 clustered with those from aerobic Pryobaculum

   the enzyme from Thermococcales in Euryarchaeota. The branching pattern
   of the enzymes from A. Pernix K1, S. solfataricus, S. shibatae, and Pb.

Journal = {{MOLECULAR DIAGNOSIS}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Background: Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) has been
   identified as the catalytic subunit of telomerase ribonucleoprotein
   complex known to be required for cellular immortality and oncogenesis.
   Although human telomerase activity (hTA) is considered as a general
   marker for malignancy based on its presence in most malignant turners
   including bladder cancer, its detection in urine is affected by many
   factors. The objective of this study was to compare the clinical utility
   of detecting urine hTERT messenger RNA (mRNA) by multiplex hTERT/GAPDH
   RT-PCR and urine hTA by telomerase repeat amplification protocol (TRAP)
   in the diagnosis of bladder cancer.
   Methods and Results: Cystoscopy urine samples or bladder washes
   prospectively collected from 35 patients with confirmed (35) or
   clinically suspected (5) transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the
   bladder were examined by TRAP, hTERT/GAPDH RT-PCR, and urine cytology.
   The control group comprised 21 healthy volunteers and 3 patients without
   TCC. The hTERT/GAPDH RT-PCR test showed significantly higher diagnostic
   sensitivity than TRAP assay (93.3\% vs 48.6\%, P < .001) and urine
   cytology (95.2\% vs 61.9\% , P = .008) for confirmed TCCs, In
   particular, for superficial TCCs low grade (I-II), the hTERT/GAPDH
   RT-PCR test outperformed TRAP (90\% vs 25\%, P < .001) and urine
   cytology (91.7\% vs 58.3\%, P = .46). The overall specificity of the
   hTERT/GAPDH RT-PCR, TRAP and urine cytology was 92\% (22/24), 100\%
   (24/24), and 100\% (3/3), respectively. A positive hTERT mRNA expression
   was also detected in urologic specimens from 3 patients with previous
   history of TCC, 3 to 6 months before cystoscopic evidence of cancer.
   Conclusion: In this pilot study, the hTERT mRNA expression in urine
   sediments is a more sensitive marker for diagnosis of TCC of the bladder
   than hTA and cytology. However, there is a higher false-positive rate.}},

Abstract = {{The serviceability of a slope after an earthquake is controlled by
   deformations, consequently a stability analysis that predicts slope
   displacements is desirable.
   In cohesionless satured slopes the seismic loading may produce an
   increase in pore pressures, which in turn, reduces significantly the
   effective state of stress. Depending on the seismic intensity and on the
   effective stress conditions before the seismic loading, the induced
   excess pore pressures may produce the slope failure. Slope displacements
   may occur even for seismic accelerations lower then the initial critical
   acceleration, because of pore pressure build-up.
   In this paper, a simplified procedure for the seismic response of
   infinite slopes is described, and the role-played by relevant parameters
   such as soil relative density and initial pore pressure ratio is pointed

Abstract = {{Objective. To compare the efficacy and tolerability of paroxetine (a
   selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) with that of amitriptyline (a
   tricyclic antidepressant) in the treatment of depression in 191 patients
   with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
   Methods. A randomized, double blind, double dummy, parallel group study.
   A placebo washout period of 3-7 days was Followed by an 8 week active
   treatment phase during which patients received either paroxetine (20-40
   mg daily) or amitriptyline (75-150 mg daily). The primary efficacy
   variable was the change from baseline in Montgomery Asberg Depression
   Rating Scale score at endpoint.
   Results. Paroxetine was as effective as amitriptyline for the treatment
   of depression, with similar improvements in RA associated pain and
   disability also seen in both groups. However, paroxetine was better
   tolerated than amitriptyline, with an overall frequency of adverse
   experiences of 56.4\% and 67.7\% in the 2 groups, respectively. The
   frequency of anticholinergic adverse experiences was much lower in the
   paroxetine treatment group (18.1\% vs 43.8\% taking amitriptyline) and
   paroxetine treated patients als!, experienced fewer severe (16.0\% vs
   21.9\%), serious nonfatal (0\% vs 4.2\%), and drug related adverse
   experiences (12.8\% vs 29.2\%).
   Conclusion. Tolerability is an important consideration in this patient
   population, which is largely composed of elderly patients who are taking
   additional medications for RA. Paroxetine shows a number of advantages
   in the management of depression comorbid with RA.}},

Abstract = {{In most mammals, male development is triggered by the transient
   expression of the Y-chromosome gene, Sry, which initiates a cascade of
   gene interactions ultimately leading to the formation of a testis from
   the indifferent fetal gonad(1-4). Several genes(5-8), in particular
   Sox9, have a crucial role in this pathway(9-14). Despite this, the
   direct downstream targets of Sry and the nature of the pathway itself
   remain to he clearly established(15,16). We report here a new dominant
   insertional mutation, Odsex (Ods), in which XX mice carrying a 150-kb
   deletion (approximately 1 Mb upstream of Sox9) develop as sterile XX
   males lacking Sry, During embryogenesis, wild-type XX fetal gonads
   downregulate Sox9 expression, whereas XY and XX Ods/+ fetal gonads
   upregulate and maintain its expression(13,14). We propose that Ods has
   removed a long-range, gonad-specific regulatory element that mediates
   the repression of Sox9 expression in XX fetal gonads. This repression
   would normally be antagonized by Sry protein in XY embryos. Our data ate
   consistent with Sox9 being a direct downstream target of Sry and provide
   genetic evidence to support a general repressor model of sex
   determination in mammals(17,18).}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents three studies on Larson's 1996 Driver's Stress
   Profile, a measure of aggressive driving tendencies. In Study 1,
   utilizing 33 individuals (IS men, 18 women) who took the test twice with
   one week between tests, we found the test to have good test-retest
   reliability (r = .93). In Study 2, utilizing 176 individuals (77 men, 99
   women), we found different preliminary norms for men and women and good
   internal consistency (.93). We also found significant correlation
   between the total test scores and age (r = -.27) and a significant
   correlation (age corrected) between total rest scores and number of
   self-reported MVAs (r = .28). An exploratory factor analysis indicated
   that three factors, including 28 of tho 40 items, accounted for 43.4\%
   of the variance. In Study 3, utilizing the same subjects as in Study 2
   (84 individuals from the community of average age 33,3 yr.; 92 college
   students of average age 18.9 yr.), we found the full scale scores
   correlated significantly a with scores on Trait Anger and Anger Out and
   Type A Behavior, especially speed and impatience. Finally, scores
   correlated significantly with the Deffenbacher Driving Anger Scale (r =
   .57) but clearly tapped processes different, in part, from those
   measured by the Deffenbacher, et al. scale (1994). Overall, the Driver's
   Stress Profile appears to be a sound, reliable, and valid scale for use
   with aggressive driving.}},

Abstract = {{In Estonia, traditional chemical monitoring of surface water and
   effluents is performed but bioassays are not used as monitoring tools.
   Furthermore, the expediency of application of toxicity tests to surface
   water monitoring is questionable. The main aim of this study was to test
   the feasibility of using microbiotests in the biomonitoring of surface
   water and effluents. The sensitivity of five test species was also
   evaluated during the study. Water samples from rivers and wastewater
   treatment plants were collected over a period of 3 years and tested
   using bioassays with Selenastrum capricornutum, Thamnocephalus
   platyurus, Daphnia magna, Tetrahymena thermophila, and Lemna minor. The
   species used in the battery of tests showed different sensitivities for
   a specific sample. This confirms the need for a battery of bioassays for
   the assessment of possible ecological consequences of wastewater
   discharge. The studied test species are sensitive enough to indicate
   negative changes in surface water quality, which can affect the aquatic
   biota. The battery of bioassays consisting of T. platyurus, L. minor, S.
   capricornutum and D. magna can be recommended for control of waste water
   quality and assessment of a potential risk for aquatic biota. The
   results of tests with plant species may give additional important
   information on the possible effect of effluent on the eutrophication
   process in receiving waters. From the results obtained during the
   present study it can be recommended that toxicity tests be included in
   the effluent and surface water monitoring program in Estonia. (C) 2000

   oligosaccharides synthesized by arthropod cells. Analysis of C6/36 cells
   infected with NE2G216 by transmission electron microscopy revealed the
   presence of dense virus aggregates within cytoplasmic vacuoles and virus
   aggregates adhered to the cell surface. The virus aggregation phenotype
   of NE2G216 was reproduced in vertebrate cells (Pro-5) by the addition of
   1-deoxymannojirimycin, an inhibitor of carbohydrate processing which
   limits the processing of N-linked oligosaccharides to structures that
   are structurally similar, albeit not identical, to those synthesized in
   C6/36 cells. We conclude that defective maturation of NE2G216 in
   mosquito cells is due to virion aggregation and retention on the cell
   surface and that this phenotype is directly linked to the
   carbohydrate-processing properties of these cells.}},

Abstract = {{Lagrangian motion in a quasi-two-dimensional, time-dependent, convective
   flow is studied at different Rayleigh numbers. The particle tracking
   velocimetry technique is used to reconstruct Lagrangian trajectories of
   passive tracers. Dispersion properties are investigated by means of the
   recently introduced finite size Lyapunov exponent analysis. Lagrangian
   motion is found to be chaotic with a Lyapunov exponent which depends on
   the Rayleigh number as Ra-1/2. The power law scaling is explained in
   terms of a dimensional analysis on the equation of motion. A comparative
   study shows that the fixed scale method makes more physical sense than
   the traditional way of looking at the relative dispersion at fixed
   times. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES We sought to determine whether asymmetric dimethylarginine
   (ADMA) inhibits nitric oxide (NO) elaboration in cultured human
   endothelial cells and whether this is associated with the activation of
   oxidant-sensitive signaling mediating endothelial adhesiveness for
   monocytes.
   BACKGROUND Endothelial NO elaboration is impaired in
   hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis, which may be due to elevated
   concentrations of ADMA, an endogenous inhibitor of NO synthase.
   METHODS Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECV 304) and human
   monocytoid cells (THP-1) were studied in a functional binding assay.
   Nitric oxide and superoxide anion (O-2(-)) were measured by
   chemiluminescence; ADMA by high pressure liquid chromatography, monocyte
   chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) by:ELISA and NF-KB by electromobility gel
   shift assay.
   RESULTS Incubation of endothelial cells with ADMA (0.1 muM to 100 muM)
   inhibited NO formation, which was reversed by coincubation with
   L-arginine (1 mM). The biologically inactive stereoisomer symmetric
   dimethylarginine did not inhibit NO release. Asymmetric dimethylarginine
   (10 muM) or native low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (100 mg/dL)
   increased endothelial O-2(-) to the same degree. Asymmetric
   dimethylarginine also stimulated MCP-1 formation by endothelial cells.
   This effect was paralleled by activation of the redox-sensitive
   transcription factor NF-kappaB. Preincubation of endothelial cells with
   ADMA increased the adhesiveness of endothelial cells for THP-1 cells in
   a concentration-dependent manner. Asymmetric dimethylarginine-induced
   monocyte binding was diminished by L-arginine or by a neutralizing
   anti-MCP-1 antibody.
   CONCLUSIONS We concluded that the endogenous NO synthase inhibitor ADMA
   is synthesized in human endothelial cells. Asymmetric dimethylarginine
   increases endothelial oxidative stress and potentiates monocyte binding.
   Asymmetric dimethylarginine may be an endogenous proatherogenic
   molecule. (C) 2000 by the American College of Cardiology.}},

Abstract = {{A low molecular weight fucan fraction extracted from the brown seaweed
   Ascophyllum nodosum was previously shown to exhibit dose-related venous
   antithrombotic activity with an ED80 of about 20 mg/kg, 2 h after a
   single subcutaneous injection HCII (Colliec et al. {[}1991] Thromb Res
   64:143-154; Mauray et al. {[}1995] Thromb Haemast 74:1280-1285). Its
   activity was comparable to that of a low molecular weight heparin
   (Dalteparin(R)). This fucan fraction is one of several, with a range of
   different structure parameters, prepared by degradation of the whole
   native fucan. These low molecular weight fractions were compared using a
   Wessler stasis thrombosis model in rabbits and by determination of their
   in vitro and ex vivo anticoagulant activities. Intravenous
   administrations of these fractions reduced thrombosis in a
   dose-dependent manner. Partial removal of sulfate groups and/or partial
   degradation lead to a significant decrease in their anticoagulant and
   antithrombotic activities. The integrity of the regular pattern of
   sulphation of the fucoidan is necessary for antithrombotic activity. (C)

Abstract = {{The study of activation and amplification mechanisms that characterize
   immune responses is a key contribution to immunomodulation. Many
   immunosuppressive drugs which target calcineurin inhibit lymphocyte

   is an unquestionned goal of clinical immunology. New strategies focus on
   inducing immune tolerance by interfering with structures involved in
   antigen recognition either on antigen presenting cells or on
   lymphocytes. Targetting the T cell receptor and associated structures
   (CD3, CD4, CD8) or antigen presenting structures (major
   histocompatibility complex class II molecules) has proved efficient in
   inducing tolerance. Altered peptides ligands has seemingly been
   developed in order to interfere with T cell activation through the T
   cell receptor. Other approaches include targetting costimulatory
   structures (CD28/B7, CD40/CD40 ligand) or regulatory circuits involving
   cytokines, chemokines and their receptors. The molecular
   characterization of activated and tolerant lymphocytes is an achievable
   goal that will help defining new targets of immunomodulation in the

Abstract = {{Glutamine synthetase (GS; EC 6.3.1.2), a key enzyme of glutamate
   metabolism, and another enzyme possessing high hydroxylamine-L-glutamine
   transferase activity comparable to that of GS and termed GS-like protein
   (GSLP) were purified from human brain concurrently, In two-dimensional
   electrophoresis, GS subunits migrate to at least six different positions
   (44 +/- 1 kDa, pI = 6.4-6.7), whereas GSLP subunits migrate to at least
   four different positions (54 +/- 1 kDa, pI = 5.9-6.2), Dependences of
   enzymatic activity in the transferase reaction on concentrations of Mn2+
   and Mg2+ for GS and GSLP are different. High immunological
   cross-reactivity between GS and GSLP was observed in ELISA.
   Nevertheless, antisera were raised to GS and GSLP, and a method was
   developed for the separate detection of GS and GSLP in brain extracts by
   enzyme-chemiluminescent amplified (ECL) immunoblotting. The distribution
   of GS and GSLP immunoreactivities between soluble protein and crude
   mitochondrial fractions indicates tighter association with the
   particulate fraction for GSLP than for GS. The results from activity
   measurements suggest that the hydroxylamine-L-glutamine transferase
   activity measured routinely in protein extracts from brain is the sum of
   GS and GSLP activities. Similarly, immunoreactivity evaluated by ELISA
   is a sum of immunoreactivities of GS and GSLP, The relative
   contributions of GS and GSLP to the total immunoreactivity can be
   evaluated by ECL-immunoblotting.}},

   31-day gradual decompression in a hypobaric chamber from sea level to
   8848 m equivalent altitude. Tests of visual reaction time, manual
   dexterity, and number ordination were used; anxiety responses and mood
   states were assessed using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory
   (STAI) and the `Profile of Mood States' (POMS), respectively. A
   significant positive correlation was found between the climbers'
   performance in reaction time and changes in state-type anxiety levels,
   suggesting that anxiety could lead to an improved reaction time. In
   addition, significant negative correlations were also found between the
   climbers' performance in psychomotor ability, mental efficiency, and
   reaction time, and several POMS factors, including Tension, Hostility,
   Confusion, and Fatigue. Overall, these data indicate, in agreement with
   previous studies, that anxiety may favour, or at least not alter, the
   processes of information of relatively simple tasks, such as reaction
   time, and further suggest that adverse changes in moods could modulate
   performance negatively. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{An NAD-dependent D-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.) was isolated
   and characterized from the halophilic Archaeon Haloferax mediterranei.
   The enzyme is a dimer with a molecular mass of 101.4 +/- 3.3 kDa. It is
   strictly NAD-dependent and exhibits its highest activity in 4 M NaCl.
   The enzyme is characterized by a broad substrate specificity
   2-ketoisocaproate and 2-ketobutyrate being the substrates with the
   higher V-max/K-m. When pyruvate and 2-ketobutyrate were the substrates
   the optimal pH was acidic (pH 5) meanwhile for 2-ketoisocaproate maximum
   activity was achieved at basic pH between 7.5 and 8.5. The optimum
   temperature was 52 degreesC and at 65 degreesC there was a pronounced
   activity decrease. This new enzyme can be used for the production of
   D-2-hydroxycarboxylic acid. (C) 2000 Societe francaise de biochimie et

Title = {{Discontinuous gas exchange and water loss in the keratin beetle Omorgus
   radula: further evidence against the water conservation hypothesis?}},
Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Discontinuous gas exchange cycles are demonstrated in Omorgus radula
   (Erichson) (Coleoptera, Trogidae) for the first time, thus extending
   evidence for such cycles to another family of beetles. The closed,
   flutter and open phases of the cycle were clearly distinguishable in
   this species, and the duration of these phases was 221 +/- 28, 1403 +/-
   148 and 755 +/- 43 s (mean +/- SE), respectively. No evidence for
   significant intraspecific mass scaling of VCO2 or any of the components
   of the cycle was found. Although the prolonged F-phase recorded here is
   unusual for many insects, it has previously been found in other
   scarabaeoid beetles, especially those from xeric environments. It has
   been suggested that such modulation of the discontinuous gas exchange
   cycle may result in a reduced VCO2 and, consequently, reduced water
   loss. In O. radula VCO2 (15.25 +/- 1.49 mul/h) was considerably lower
   than that predicted from its body mass (0.207 +/- 0.006 g). However, the
   small relative contribution of respiratory transpiration (6.5\%) to
   total water loss indicated that reduced VCO2 has little to do with water
   economy. Rather, it may be a consequence of generally low activity
   levels of these beetles. The low respiratory water loss, but distinct
   subterranean component in the adult life of O. radula, lend some
   credence to the hypothesis suggesting that regular use of subterranean
   habitats might have been responsible for the evolution of discontinuous
   gas exchange cycles. However, non-adaptive hypotheses can still not be
   discounted.}},

Abstract = {{This research examines the ability of six popular Web search engines,
   individually and collectively, to locate Web pages containing common
   marketing/management phrases. We propose and validate a model for search
   engine performance that is able to represent key patterns of coverage
   and overlap among the engines.
   The model enables us to estimate the typical additional benefit of using
   multiple search engines, depending on the particular set of engines
   being considered. It also provides an estimate of the number of relevant
   Web pages not found by any of the engines. For a typical
   marketing/management phrase we estimate that the ``best{''} search
   engine locates about 50\% of the pages, and all six engines together
   find about 90\% of the total.
   The model is also used to examine how properties of a Web page and
   characteristics of a phrase affect the probability that a given search
   engine will find a given page. For example, we find that the number of
   Web page links increases the prospect that each of the six search
   engines will find it. Finally, we summarize the relationship between
   major structural characteristics of a search engine and its performance
   in locating relevant Web pages.}},

Abstract = {{Previous interpretations of the Baton River area proposed a significant
   pre-Baton (Late Silurian-Early Devonian) tectonic event, during which
   Ordovician and Silurian sediments were folded, cleaved, and eroded
   before deposition of the Lower Devonian Baton Formation. This
   interpretation was based on an apparent lack of a penetrative cleavage
   in Baton sediments, and on the presence of a rudite at the base of Baton
   Formation in the Moran Creek/Skeet River area that was identified as a
   ``basal conglomerate{''}.
   Current studies show a pre-Baton event to be untenable and indicate that
   the Devonian was laid down in the same Takaka Terrane sedimentary basin
   as the underlying Ellis Formation and experienced the same deformation.
   Features of the Baton Formation rudite are consistent with a mass-flow
   rather than with a ``basal conglomerate{''} origin and the rudite is
   reinterpreted as a multistoried lobe of debris flows that laterally
   interfinger with mudstone. Baton Formation appears to conformably follow
   limestones or sandstones of Ellis Formation. The transition shows four
   sedimentary patterns. Pebbles in Ellis limestone and sandstone close to
   the base of the Baton Formation in Fowler Creek may represent a distal
   expression of the Moran Creek/Skeet River debris flows.
   Rocks preceding the Baton Formation are referred to as Ellis Formation
   rather than Hailes Quartzite as the lateral equivalency of these two
   formations is uncertain and under review. Fowler Formation, previously
   the highest part of the Ellis Group, is shown to be stratigraphically
   continuous with, and lithologically identical to, the Baton Formation,
   and is discarded. The base of Baton Formation appears to mark an abrupt
   increase in water depth with st change from mainly arenaceous shelf
   sedimentation to deeper water, fmer grained lithologies.
   Structural studies show that Baton Formation is as deformed as the older
   rocks, and no structures can be attributed to a pre-Baton event.}},

Abstract = {{Cytochrome P450 (CYP)-derived arachidonic acid metabolites, including
   epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETS) and 20-HETE, have been implicated in
   the regulation of renal function and vascular tone. Studying the
   function of specific CYP arachidonate metabolites has been hampered due
   to lack of selective inhibitors and difficulty in their solubilization.
   We have identified MS-PPOH as a potent and selective inhibitor of
   CYP-catalyzed arachidonate epoxidation in vitro. We used
   2-hydroxypropyl-beta -cyclodextrin as a vehicle in order to administer
   MS-PPOH in vivo. One hour after administration, MS-PPOH (5 mg, IV bolus)
   significantly inhibited arachidonic acid epoxidation in rat renal
   cortical microsomes (vehicle-282 +/- 12 pmol/mg/min, MS-PPOH-206 +/- 10
   pmol/mg/min, p < 0.05) but had no effect on 20-HETE formation
   (vehicle-383 +/- 32 pmol/mg/min, MS-PPOH-367 +/- 9 pmol/mg/min). The
   inhibitory effect lasts at least for 6 hours. There was no inhibition of
   20-HETE synthesis at any time point. We also examined the effect of
   MS-PPOH on renal excretiry function. Three hours after MS-PPOH
   administration to anesthetized rats, urine flow rate became
   significantly higher (vehicle-275 +/- 16 <mu>l/hour, MS-PPOH-406 +/- 44
   mul/hour, p ( 0.05). Sodium excretion rate was also significantly higher
   (vehicle-28.7 +/- 4 mu mol/hour, MS-PPOH-63.3 +/- 10 mu mol/hour, p (
   0.05) but potassium excretion rate was not affected (vehicle-65.5 +/- 5
   mu mol/hour, MS-PPOH-79.2 +/- 2 mu mol/hour). These results suggest that
   MS-PPOH may be useful as a selective inhibitor of CYP-catalyzed
   arachidonic acid epoxidation in vivo, and implicate EETs and
   anti-diuretic and anti-natriuretic in the regulation of renal function.}},

Abstract = {{Robust optimal control problems for dynamic systems must be solved if
   modeling inaccuracies cannot be avoided and/or unpredictable and
   unmeasurable influences are present. Here, the return of a future
   European space shuttle to Earth is considered. Four path constraints
   have to be obeyed to limit heating, dynamic pressure, load factor, and
   flight path angle at high velocities. For the air density associated
   with the aerodynamic forces and the constraints, only an
   altitude-dependent range can be predicted. The worst-case air density is
   analyzed via an antagonistic noncooperative two-person dynamic game. A
   closed-form solution of the game provides a robust optimal guidance
   scheme against all possible air density fluctuations. The value function
   solves the Isaacs nonlinear first-order partial differential equation
   with suitable interior and boundary conditions. The equation is solved
   with the method of characteristics in the relevant parts of the state
   space. A bundle of neighboring characteristic trajectories yields a
   large input/output data set and enables a guidance scheme synthesis with
   three-layer perceptrons. The difficult and computationally expensive
   perceptron training is done efficiently with the new SQP-training method
   FAUN. Simulations show the real-time capability and robustness of the
   reentry guidance scheme finally chosen.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is an excellent technique to coat
   complex substrates like fibers or inner surfaces of tubes. However, CVD
   often suffers from high coating temperatures which makes it impossible
   to coat temperature-sensitive materials like polymers, e.g. with
   titanium-based layers. A new plasma-assisted CVD (PACVD) process has
   been developed to coat polymers at very low temperatures with
   titanium-based layers. The coating temperature could be lowered to
   approximately 60 degreesC (140 degrees F), so that a variety of
   different polymers can be coated without undesired damaging. In this
   work, polyethylenetherephthalate (PET), polyethersulfone (PES),
   polyvinylchlorine (PVC), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyethylene
   (PE) and polypropylene (PP) have been used. Very smooth (R-a = 3 mm) and
   thin (5-100 nm) layers show a very good adherence (>10 N/mm(2)) when
   examined using tensile tests. It could be demonstrated that all kinds of
   geometries such as tubes or textile structures can be coated. The
   coating has the huge potential to improve the bio- and
   bloodcompatibility of polymers for medical devices. This could be shown
   by a significant higher cell vitality and growth of the cells on
   Ti(C,N)-coated polymers compared with uncoated polymers (using
   fibroblasts and endothelial cells). Moreover, the coagulation of blood
   is less effected if polymers are coated with the Ti(C,N) layers. It
   could be demonstrated, that the Ti(C,N)-coating is an effective
   diffusion barrier to prevent leaching of plasticizers or additives, e.g.
   from PVC which is advantageous for many medical devices as well as for a
   lot of other applications where PVC is used. Besides the medical
   applications many other improvements of polymers are possible by this
   new coating process. Examples are surfaces with a higher wettability,
   corrosion stability or electrical conductivity. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objective. Identification and quantification of strain in shoulder

   Methods. Mercury strain gauges were sutured in seven locations on

   head translations during laxity exams. Strain and humeral position were
   acquired during performance of Sulcus, Feagin, Apprehension, Load and
   Shift, Drawer, and Hawkins tests.
   Results. Anterior humeral head translation in neutral position was
   primarily constrained by the coracohumeral ligament. With the arm
   abducted, anterior middle and inferior ligaments also became active.
   External rotation and abduction activated inferior and middle capsules.
   Posterior capsule constrained motion for posterior tests in neutral and
   abduction. Superior and inferior capsular ligaments were active during
   inferior tests in neutral position. With abduction, inferior ligaments
   provided primary translation constraint.
   Conclusion. Study of kinematics and strain evaluation on cadavers can
   yield useful information on mechanisms of glenohumeral instability.}},

Abstract = {{Brain aging, Alzheimer disease and stroke share common elements of
   deficits in calcium regulation, declines in mitochondrial function,
   increases in generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), accumulated
   damage from ROS and immune system dysfunction. The problem is to
   distinguish less significant side reactions, such as gray hair, from
   aspects of aging that contribute to disease. Toward establishing cause
   and effect relationships, a neuron cell culture system is described that
   allows comparisons with age under uniform environmental conditions. This
   neuron culture model indicates that susceptibility to death by apoptosis
   and consequences of the inflammatory response from beta -amyloid are
   age-related and an inherent characteristic of the neurons. Further
   mechanistic investigations are possible. New therapeutic approaches are
   suggested that combine inhibition of calcium overloads (calcium channel
   blockers), reduced ROS damage (melatonin, N-acetyl-cysteine), and
   bolstered mitochondrial function and energy generation (creatine).
   Together with newly demonstrated capabilities for adult and aged neuron
   regeneration and multiplication, i.e. plasticity, these approaches offer
   new hope toward reversing age-related decrements and damage from

Abstract = {{The role of geometry in the mechanical performance of various
   configurations of joints and transitions in metal matrix composites
   (MMCs) was investigated, Three types of model joints were manufactured
   by pressure infiltration of molten Al-4.5\% Mg into preforms of
   continuous polycrystalline alumina fibers. This method of fabrication
   allows metal continuity to be achieved throughout the joint region,
   creating composite/monolith interfaces free of the gross defects that
   commonly limit joint strength. Test results indicate that changes in
   joint configuration affect the level of plastic flow at the
   composite/monolith interfaces, and suggest that increasing the level of
   plastic constraint in these regions enhances performance. The factors
   controlling interface behavior in the various joint configurations were
   investigated with finite element techniques, based on constitutive
   behavior measured experimentally. Using these methods, the evolution of
   the stress state which develops at the composite/monolith interfaces was
   probed, providing insight into the interplay between the state of stress
   and the failure mechanisms that limit interface performance. With this
   in mind, the relationship between key components of stress and the
   mechanical performance of the experimental specimens is discussed with
   respect to debonding and void growth at the composite/monolith

Abstract = {{Object. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of gamma
   knife radiosurgery (GKS) as the primary rather than secondary management
   for trigeminal neuralgia.
   Methods. Eighty-two patients underwent GKS as their first neurosurgical
   intervention (Group A), and 90 patients underwent GKS following a
   different procedure (Group B). All GKS patients were treated with a
   maximum dose of 75 Gy. The single 4-mm isocenter was placed close to the
   junction of the trigeminal nerve and the brainstem. Six-month follow up
   was available for 126 patients and 12-month follow up for 84 patients.
   Excellent (no pain and no medicine) or good (at least 50\% reduction in
   pain and less medicine) relief was more likely to occur in Group A than
   in Group B patients 6 and 12 months following GKS for trigeminal
   neuralgia (p = 0.058). Excellent or good results were also more likely
   in patients with trigeminal neuralgia without multiple sclerosis (MS) (p
   = 0.042). The number and type of procedures performed prior to GKS, the
   interval between the last procedure and GKS, and the interval from first
   symptom to GKS (within Groups A and B) did not affect 6-month outcome.
   The interval between first symptom and GKS was shorter in Group A
   patients without MS (87 months) than in Group B (148 months; p < 0.004).
   There were no significant differences between Group A and B patients
   with regard to sex, age, or laterality.
   Conclusions. Patients with trigeminal neuralgia who are treated with GKS
   as primary management have better pain relief than those treated with
   GKS as secondary management. Patients are more likely to have pain
   relief if they do not have MS.}},

   mathematical model of VZV transmission to predict the effect of

   model (RAS) was used which takes account of the increased potential for
   transmission within school aged groups. Various Vaccine efficacy
   scenarios, vaccine coverages and vaccination strategies were
   investigated and a sensitivity analysis of varicella incidence
   predictions to important parameters was performed. The model predicts
   that the overall (natural and breakthrough) incidence and morbidity of
   varicella would likely be reduced by mass vaccination of 12-month-old
   children. Furthermore, adding a catch-up campaign in the first year for
   1-11 year olds seems to be the most effective strategy to reduce both.

Abstract = {{Positron emission tomography allows a quantitative assessment of the
   impact of functional neurosurgery in Parkinson's disease (PD) by
   measuring regional cerebral flow and glucose and oxygen consumption as
   indicators of metabolic activity of specific brain regions. PET can also
   be used to study the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system, and therefore
   selves as a surrogate marker of the evolution of striatal grafts for PD.
   Pallidotomy has been associated with increased activation of premotor
   areas (supplementary motor area and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and
   reduced hyper-activity of the lentiform nucleus (augmented
   preoperatively); Pallidal (GPi) and subthalamic (STN) stimulation also
   increase activation of premotor areas but decrease activation of primary
   motor area. Suppression of unilateral tremor with thalamic stimulation
   is associated with a reduction in cerebellar blood flow. These main
   findings are in keeping with the general! notion that increased activity
   in the STN GPi projection is directly implicated in the pathophysiology
   of PD. Surgical blockage of these output nuclei leads to partial
   restoration of cortical physiology.}},

Abstract = {{In her pathbreaking book, Abortion and Woman's Choice, Rosalind Pollack
   Petchesky astutely observed that, in many societies, control over the
   methods and goals of reproduction is a critical site of contest,
   particularly between women and men. Yet the circumstances under which
   reproductive relations will be characterized by conflict, consensus, or
   some of both have seldom been systematically explored. In this paper, I
   therefore offer three examples of different structural contexts in which
   either women or men had the preponderance of power to influence key
   aspects of women's reproductive activities. I argue that while
   structural factors, notably the distribution of economic, political, and
   institutional resources, are fundamental, they do not only act directly
   but are experienced, interpreted, and made meaningful through specific
   cultural processes, particularly gender ideologies, norms about
   morality, and beliefs about how women should behave. It is together that
   these structural factors and cultural processes shape the climates and
   contexts within which women's reproductive activities are situated and
   take place.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The authors sought to evaluate the associations between
   depressive symptoms and social support in a sample drawn from a
   relatively understudied population - depressed elderly patients. The
   present study also used a multi-measure approach to assess both
   depressive symptomatology and social support, Methods: In this
   prospective study of 115 patients we examined: (1) the baseline
   relations among a self-report measure of depressive symptoms, two
   clinical assessments of depressive symptoms, and subjective and received
   social support, and (2) the ability of social support to predict changes
   in clinical assessments of depressive symptoms at 6 months and year.
   Education level, financial concerns, activities of daily living ratings,
   and gender were controlled for. Results: Baseline subjective support was
   negatively related to self-reports of depressive symptoms, but unrelated
   to clinical assessments at baseline or follow-up. Conversely, received
   support was unrelated to self-reported depressive symptoms, but
   positively related to both clinical assessments at baseline. However,
   higher ratings of received support at baseline predicted decreases in
   clinical ratings of depressive symptoms at 6 months and year.
   Limitations: These data were gathered in a primarily Caucasian sample,
   thus the findings may nor generalize to more diverse ethnic populations.
   potential confounding due to treatment mode and setting was not
   controlled in the present analyses. Conclusions: These results have
   important implications for interpreting clinical data in elderly
   depressed patients. Specifically, when depressive symptoms are assessed
   using clinician ratings, the most informative aspect of social support
   with respect to future clinical status appears to be received, rather
   than perceived, support measures. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Phase equilibria in Ti-rich corner of the Ti-Si-Sn-Al system were
   studied using differential thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction,
   microscopy, and electron microprobe analysis. Projections of solidus and
   liquidus surfaces, an isothermal section at 1300 degreesC and an
   isopleth at 9Si-1Sn (at.\%) were constructed. It was shown that in the
   concentration interval studied at the solidus and 1300 degreesC
   temperatures two two-phase Ti-5(Si,Sn,Al)(3) + {[}beta -Ti] and
   Ti-5(Si,Sn,Al)(3) + {[}alpha -Ti] regions are present. The liquidus
   surface is characterised by the regions of beta and Z primary
   crystallisation, resulting in bivariant L <-> beta + Ti-5(Si,Sn,Al)(3)
   eutectic. The character of horizontal and vertical sections is similar
   to that for the Ti-Si-Al system. (C) 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers.}},

Abstract = {{Estimation of frost resistance of ceramic building materials (bricks,
   tiles, etc) is a long and expensive procedure therefore it must be
   accurate as much as possible. The authors of this article during more
   than 30 years have experienced, that three-dimensional test of
   freezing-thawing does not give reliable estimation of frost resistance
   of materials comparably with the test based on one-side freezing-thawing
   of material.This is because of different process of water migration in
   pore-capillary ceramic structure resulting in local extra saturation by
   water. Investigations showed that nearby the exposed surface of testing
   material the water amount gradually increases in each subsequent
   one-side freezing-thawing cycle.Water migration flow feeds the ice
   grains by water and as far as freezing is continuing, ice grains
   increase both their volume and destructive pressure to material
   structure.These phenomena are illustrated by results of dielectric and
   dilatation measurements. Investigation showed also that incomplete
   thawing (a little above 0 degreesC instead of 15 degreesC) increases the
   damages by ice during the subsequent freezing cycle. Results allow more
   reliable and rapid prediction of frost resistance of building materials
   under conditions very close to natural operation conditions of exposed
   building walls.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Characteristics of patients who committed suicide were
   examined to provide a picture of the treatment they received before
   death and to determine whether and how the suicides could have been pre
   vented by the service system. Methods: The unnatural-deaths register was
   matched to the psychiatric case register in the state of Victoria in
   Australia to identify suicides by people with a history of public-sector
   psychiatric service use who committed suicide between July 1, 1989, and
   June 30, 1994. Data on patient and treatment characteristics were
   examined by three experienced clinicians, who made judgments about
   whether the suicide could have been prevented had the service system
   responded differently. Quantitative and qualitative data were
   descriptively analyzed. Results: A total of 629 psychiatric patients who
   had committed suicide were identified. Seventy-two percent of the
   patients were male, 62 percent were under 40 years old, and 51 percent
   were unmarried. They had a range of disorders, with the most common
   being schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (36 percent).
   Sixty-seven percent had previously attempted suicide. A total of 311
   patients (49 percent) received care within four weeks of death. Twenty
   percent of the suicides were considered preventable. Key factors
   associated with preventability were poor staff-patient relationships,
   incomplete assessments, poor assessment and treatment of depression and
   psychological problems, and poor continuity of care. Conclusions:
   Opportunities exist for the psychiatric service system to alter
   practices at several levels and thereby reduce patient suicides.}},

Abstract = {{Elliott, Rothenberg and Stock (1996), (ERS), present a `GLS' variant of
   the Dickey-Fuller (DF) unit root test. Their statistic is approximately
   point-optimal invariant at a chosen local alternative, and usually
   displays better finite sample power than the DF test. Following the
   usual efficiency motive for GLS estimation, the higher finite sample
   power of the ERS test has often been attributed to the greater accuracy
   of the estimate of the series' nonstochastic component under stationary
   alternatives close to the null. This paper shows that the CLS estimates
   of the non-stochastic component are not, in general, more accurate. The
   power gain arises from the fact that the GLS statistic's null
   distribution has a greater positive shift relative to the DF test, than
   its distribution under relevant alternatives, and this persists even
   when the GLS estimates of the non-stochastics have higher variance than
   the OLS estimates.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the analysis has been to investigate the determinants of
   the household's decisions regarding the purchase of meat in Great
   Britain. The approach, using a Box-Cox generalization of the `double

   whether or not to purchase the product (the participation decision) and
   then, for those households which do purchase, how much to buy (the
   expenditure decision). The determinants considered are socioeconomic
   variables, such as the total expenditure of the household, market
   prices, characteristics of the householder (age, gender, education, type
   of employment) and characteristics of the household (location, presence
   of children, etc.). By conducting the analysis over several years of
   survey data (1975-1993) it is possible to investigate whether the
   influence of these variables has changed over time. The bulk of the
   empirical analysis has concerned single adult households (with or
   without children).}},

Abstract = {{An important step in the analysis of dynamic light scattering data is
   the estimation of the correlation time distribution given the
   measurement of the autocorrelation time function. This is an inverse
   problem, and especially a so-called ill-posed inverse problem: The map
   from the correlation time distribution to the autocorrelation time data
   is singular, a unique inverse of this map does not exist. Such problems
   are usually treated by regularization methods. By those an estimator for
   the relaxation time spectrum is defined which differs from the usual
   Least Squares estimator in conceptual background as well as in numerical
   effort at its implementation.
   We discuss the regularization method from the Bayesian point of view.
   The choice of the additional prior functional is discussed and also two
   strategies for the determination of the so-called regularization
   parameter. After this more general introduction two aspects which are
   more specific for the light scattering are addressed: The influence of
   the model for the experimental errors on the quality of the estimation
   and the generalization of the regularization method to the multiangle
   scattering.
   The size of the experimental errors and their correlation enter
   significantly into the mathematical expression for the estimator of the
   correlation time distribution. They can be calculated either from the
   autocorrelation function using a model derived by Schatzel, or, on the
   other hand, they could be computed directly from the time series of the
   scattered light, if such a time series is stored during the experiment.
   We show by simulations that the direct method indeed leads to better
   results than the use of the model by Schatzel, but that already this use
   leads to an improvement compared to an analysis, in which the
   correlation of the experimental errors is neglected at all.
   The analysis of multi-angle data can easily be incorporated into the
   framework of regularization methods. At first thought one would combine
   the estimations of the relaxation time spectrum based on the
   measurements for the different angles by calculating the mean or some
   weighted mean of the estimates. We show that this does not lead to the
   best results, however. The estimation of the relaxation time spectrum
   from all the multi-angle data at once leads to better results than the
   intuitive combination.}},

   interruption of sulfinpyrazone and, as control, in the last 6 months of
   allopurinol.
   Results: Mean uricemia decreased with allopurinol (0.58 +/- 0.12 vs 0.41
   +/- 0.07 mmol/liter, p = 0.0001) as well as with sulfinpyrazone (0.51
   +/- 0.13 vs 0.40 +/- 0.12 mmol/liter, p 0.0001). Mean creatinine
   increased (171 +/- 42 and 164 +/- 35 mu mol/liter, p = 0.01) with
   allopurinol, whereas it tended to decrease with sulfinpyrazone (160 +/-
   35 and 154 +/- 48 mu mol/liter, p = NS). Mean urea did not change with
   allopurinol (14 +/- 5 vs 15 +/- 7 mmol/liter, p = NS), but fell with
   sulfinpyrazone (14.01 +/- 5 vs 12.60 +/- 5 mmol/liter, p = 0.0004). Mean
   CsA levels were constant with allopurinol (193 +/- 73 vs 188 +/- 65
   ng/ml, p = NS), although CsA dose was slightly reduced (2.7 +/- 0.8 vs
   2.6 +/- 0.8 mg/kg/day, p = 0.007). Conversely, CsA levels dropped with
   sulfinpyrazone (183 +/- 89 vs 121 +/- 63 ng/ml, p = 0.0001) despite an
   increase in CsA daily dose (2.6 +/- 0.9 vs 2.8 +/- 0.9 mg/kg/day, p =
   0.0001). Two subjects were treated for acute rejection. We observed no
   other side effects.
   Conclusions: In HT recipients sulfinpyrazone, as an alternative to
   allopurinol, is effective in achieving metabolic control of
   hyperuricemia. However, this drug reduced CsA levels, thus the risk of
   rejection is present.}},

Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Cell invasion by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi involves
   activation of host signaling pathways and the recruitment and fusion of
   lysosomes at the parasite entry site. A major signaling pathway
   regulating invasion of fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and myoblasts
   involves mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and requires the
   activity of a T. cruzi serine peptidase, oligopeptidase B (OPB).
   Deletion of the OPE gene results in a marked defect in trypomastigote
   virulence, consistent with a greatly reduced cell invasion capacity.
   Here we show that uptake by macrophages, on the other hand, is largely
   independent of OPE expression and sensitive to inhibition of by
   cytochalasin D, The residual invasion capacity of OPBnull
   trypomastigotes in fibroblasts still involves lysosome recruitment,
   although in a significantly delayed fashion. Transient elevations in
   intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were observed in host cells exposed to
   both wild-type and OPBnull trypomastigotes, but the signals triggered by
   the mutant parasites were less vigorous and delayed. The capacity of
   triggering elevation in host cell cyclic AMP (cAMP), however, was
   unaltered in OPBnull trypomastigotes. Modulation in cAMP levels
   preferentially affected the residual cell invasion capacity of OPBnull
   parasites, suggesting that this signaling pathway can play a dominant
   role in promoting cell invasion in the absence of the major OPB
   dependent pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Thorough nan-invasive cardiovascular studies were conducted in a series
   of ten gamma-sarcoglycanopathy Gypsy patients with the founder C283Y
   mutation in 13q12. Results were compared with those obtained in an
   age-matched group of normal boys and girls. The studies included
   electrocardiographic and echocardiographic evaluations using pulsed wave
   Doppler tissue imaging to assess regional diastolic function and
   myocardial velocities at various levels. This study confirms the
   significant electrocardiographic abnormalities described in previous
   studies. Furthermore, measurement of myocardial velocity at different
   levels demonstrated an abnormal relaxation pattern in the tricuspid
   annulus in four of the oldest patients, which strongly suggests
   intrinsic myocardial involvement of the right ventricle. To our
   knowledge, these specific studies have not been previously performed in
   a clinically and genetically homogeneous group of
   gamma-sarcoglycanopathy patients and suggest primary myocardial
   involvement probably due to gamma -sarcoglycan deficiency in cardiac
   muscle fibres. Our results could be of interest in the follow-up of
   these patients and the prevention and treatment of late cardiological
   complications. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To compare a standardized recommended procedure for drawing
   blood to measure blood Lipid and lipoprotein levels with the procedure
   commonly used in clinical practice. The aim was to see if
   hemoconcentration and spuriously elevated lipid levels could be avoided.
   Design: An open randomized crossover clinical trial.
   Setting: The University of Calgary.
   Patients: Twenty-five patients with dyslipidemia.
   Interventions: Blood drawing using a standardized procedure in which the
   patient remained seated for 5 minutes before blood collection and
   tourniquet use was minimized or avoided. Main outcome measures:
   Differences in lipid levels between the usual clinical procedure and the
   recommended procedure for drawing blood.
   Results: Prior to drawing blood, laboratories have sat patients for an
   average of 1.4 minutes (95\% CI, 0.9 to 1.9) and used a tourniquet in
   every patient. In the standardized procedure, patients rested for an
   average of 5.6 minutes (95\% CI 5.0 to 6.2), and a tourniquet was used
   briefly in only 3 of 23 patients. There were no differences in lipid and
   lipoprotein values and no clinically significant difference in
   hemoglobin or albumin levels or in the calculation of hemoconcentration.
   Conclusions: Efforts to rest patients and avoid tourniquet use when
   drawing blood for assessment of lipid levels are unlikely to be useful.}},

   rates of GP in the centres prior to any work on harmonization of data
   are reported. The subsequent process to standardize the definition of
   CP, inclusion/exclusion criteria, classification, and description of

   the effects of radiation and multiple cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs.
   Amifostine has demonstrated broad-spectrum cytoprotection against
   myelotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, xerostomia, and mucositis associated with
   various chemotherapy and radiation modalities. Amifostine has been
   evaluated in large comparative clinical trials in patients with advanced
   ovarian cancer, rectal cancer, and head and neck cancer, and in many
   phase 2 trials in patients with various neoplastic diseases. These
   trials have shown that amifostine delivers protection from the cytotoxic
   effects of cisplatin, cyclophosphamide. and radiation on various organs.
   Pretreatment with amifostine has also improved salivary gland tolerance
   of high-dose radioiodine treatment. Recent unique observations include
   improvement in cytopenia in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. This
   review summarizes preclinical and clinical data on amifostine and
   includes trials that evaluated the drug's chemoprotective and
   radioprotective effects and other potential uses in clinical oncology.

Abstract = {{Results from current space instrumentation have confirmed that the
   energy band between 10 keV and a few MeV is a very important
   astrophysical region. This is due mostly to the variety of emitting
   objects with different spatial distributions and variability time scales
   and, in particular, to the number of transient phenomena (e.g. gamma ray
   bursts) whose nature is still very unclear. In order to fulfil the
   observational requirements in this energy range (fine spectroscopy
   together with high angular resolution imaging over a wide-field of view)
   and taking into account the opportunities given by small/medium size
   missions, we have proposed to construct a compact wide-field telescope
   based on a thick (10 mm) CdTe position sensitive spectrometer. Herein we
   describe the detector concept, that consists of an array of CdTe
   crystals and is constructed by the replication of a basic linear module
   of 32 CdTe 2x2x10 mm micro-detectors with integrated front end
   electronics. as well as the functionality of the integrated front-end
   electronics that we are developing. Furthermore, we give an evaluation
   of the performance achievable with such a position sensitive
   spectrometer in term of spatial resolution, polarimetric capabilities

Abstract = {{Purpose: The relationship of both physical activity and predicted
   maximum oxygen consumption ((V) over dot O-2max) with the clustering of
   metabolic risk factors associated with the metabolic syndrome (MS) was
   examined within 711 employed middle-aged (46.9 +/- 7.8 yr) men. Methods:
   Metabolic markers included fasting glucose, triglycerides, high-density
   lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure, and BMI, defined by highest
   risk quintiles or clinically relevant risk thresholds. Results: The
   prevalence and age-adjusted odds ratios of all MS clusters were
   inversely graded across both higher physical activity index (PAT) and
   cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) categories. The age-adjusted odds ratio
   for the clustering of clinically relevant metabolic markers was 0.60
   (95\% CI 0.22-1.22) for subjects in the occasional/light PAI, 0.32 (95\%
   CI 0.12-0.82) for the moderate/moderately vigorous PAI, and 0.13 (95\%
   CI 0.02-1.02) for the vigorous PAI when compared with subjects in the
   sedentary PAI (P < 0.05 for trend). The corresponding age-adjusted odds
   ratio was 0.28 (95\% CI 0.14-0.57) for subjects in the moderate fitness
   category and 0.12 (95\% CI 0.05-0.32) for the highest fitness category
   compared with those in the lowest fitness category (P < 0.001 for
   trend). Higher levels of physical activity or CRF were also associated
   with significantly lower age-adjusted odds ratios for the MS after
   exclusion of obesity in the MS definition. Conclusion: Overall, these
   cross-sectional results suggest that higher physical activity and
   predicted (V) over dot O-2max levels are associated with a decreased
   clustering of risk factors associated with the MS in middle-aged men of
   higher social class.}},

Abstract = {{A new cell line of poorly differentiated human endometrial
   adenocarcinoma cells termed ``CAC-1{''} cells has been established.
   These cells are epithelial, as indicated by positive cytokeratin and
   negative vimentin staining. They are rounded and possess a high
   nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, desmosomes, surface microvilli,
   intercelular lumens, and pleomorphic nuclei containing multiple
   nucleoli. These cells have been in long-term culture for 2 years. Our
   previous studies demonstrated that moderately differentiated (RL95-2)
   cells differentiated in response to retinoic acid treatment, illustrated
   by their reorganization of actin filaments and cell enlargement (Carter
   et al., 1996; Anticancer Res. 16, 17-24). CAC-1 cells exhibited a
   similar response because they also organized actin filaments and
   enlarged in response to retinoic acid treatment. Concurrently, retinoic
   acid treatment caused a 40\% decrease in cell detachment in an in vitro
   detachment assay compared to controls. A slight lag in cell growth was
   observed when CAC-1 cells were treated with 1 muM 13-cis or all-trans
   retinoic acid during a 12-day growth curve. In addition, we examined the
   effects of retinoic acid on protein kinase C-alpha (PKC-(alpha)) and
   myristoylated alanine-rich C- kinase substrate (MARCKS). Treatment with
   retinoic acid caused cytoplasmic PKC-alpha to increase concomitant with
   a decrease in PKC-cu in the membrane. In contrast, MARCKS increased in
   the membrane in response to retinoic acid treatment. These data indicate
   that retinoid treatment causes inactivation of PKC-alpha, allowing
   MARCKS to relocalize to the membrane, where it can cross-link actin
   filaments. CAC-1 cells represent an ideal model for investigating the
   effects of retinoids on differentiation induction concomitant with actin
   reorganization. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, an optimization model that considers thermal and hydraulic
   interactions is developed for a cooling water system. It is a closed
   loop consisting of a cooling tower unit, circulation pump, blower and
   heat exchanger-pipe network. Aside from process disturbances, climatic
   fluctuations are considered. Model constraints include relations
   concerning tower performance, air flowrate requirement, make-up
   flowrate, circulating pump performance, heat load in each cooler,
   pressure drop constraints and climatic conditions. The objective
   function is operating cost minimization. Optimization variables are air
   flowrate, forced water withdrawal upstream the tower, and valve
   adjustment in each branch. It is found that the most significant
   operating cost is related to electricity. However, for cooled water
   temperatures lower than a specific target, there must be a forced
   withdrawal of circulating water and further makeup to enhance the
   cooling tower capacity. Additionally, the system is optimized along the
   months. The results corroborate the fact that the most important
   variable on cooling tower performance is not the air temperature itself
   but its humidity.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. During megakaryocyte differentiation, the immature
   megakaryocyte increases ifs ploidy to a 2(x) DNA content by a process
   called endomitosis. This leads to the formation of a giant cell, the
   mature megakaryocyte, which gives rise to platelets. We investigated the
   role of human-nuc (h-nuc), a gene involved ih septum formation in
   karyokynesis in yeast, during megakaryocytic polyploidization.
   Materials and Methods. Nocodazole and
   12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) were used to induce
   megakaryocytic differentiation in K562 cell line. The ploidy
   distribution and CD41 expression of treated K562 cells were evaluated by
   flow cytometry. Using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase
   chain reaction (RT-PCR), we analyzed the h-nuc mRNA expression on
   treated K562 cells.
   Results. Mature megakaryocyte-like polyploid cells were detected at day
   5-7 of treatment with nocodazole. TPA also had a similar effect on K562
   cells, but it was much weaker than that of nocodazole. The analysis of
   ploidy of nocodazole-treated K562 cells showed that nocodazole
   preferentially induced polyploidization of K562 cell line with a
   pronounced increase of the cells 8N at day 7 of culture. Expression of
   CD41, a differentiation-related phenotype, was significantly induced by
   TPA after 7 days of treatment, showing that functional maturation was
   mainly induced by TPA. In contrast, there was no significant increase in
   CD41 expression in nocodazole-treated K562 cells, suggesting that
   polyploidization and functional maturation are separately regulated
   during megakaryocytopoiesis. RT-PCR analysis indicated that h-nuc mRNA
   increased after 72 hours in the presence of nocodazole, preceding the
   induction of polyploidization.
   Conclusions. Our data indicate that h-nuc might play a role in
   polyploidization during megakaryocytic differentiation via inhibition of
   septum formation. (C) 2000 International Society for Experimental

Abstract = {{The hypothalamus plays an important role in the control of food intake
   in different species, but there is little relevant information for
   ruminants like sheep. In order to study the putative role of several
   hypothalamic nuclei in food intake in sheep, Fos expression, a marker of
   cellular activity, was compared by immunohistochemistry between fed and
   unfed ewes. The expression of Fos protein was stimulated in the
   supraoptic nucleus of fed ewes, whereas it was increased in the
   paraventricular nucleus of unfed animals. In the latter nucleus. Fos
   immunoreactivity was mainly localized close to the third ventricle, an
   area corresponding to the parvocellular system of the nucleus, but never
   in the magnocellular system. In the paraventricular nucleus, the number
   of corticotrophin releasing factor-immunoreactive neurons and the number
   of Fos/corticotrophin releasing factor double-labelled neurons were not
   affected by feeding or lack of feeding. The number of Fos-immunoreactive
   neurons was higher in the lateral septum, the infundibular, the
   ventromedial and in the dorsomedial nuclei of unfed ewes than in those
   of fed ewes. Our results show for the first time that the dorsomedial
   and ventromedial nuclei are involved in the control of feeding in sheep
   as in rodents. The supraoptic nucleus of sheep is activated by the same
   conditions as in rodents but, conversely, the paraventricular nucleus is
   activated in unfed sheep, whereas in rodents and primates, this nucleus
   is activated by satiety as well as by fasting. In sheep, unlike in
   rodents, corticotrophin releasing factor did not appear to be involved
   in short-term regulation of food intake.}},

Volume = {{147}},

Abstract = {{An experimental strategy has been developed for measuring multiple
   dipole-dipole interactions in inorganic compounds using the technique of
   rotational echo double resonance (REDOR) NMR. Geometry-independent
   information about the dipole couplings between the observe nuclear
   species S (arbitrary quantum number) and the heteronuclear species I
   (spin-1/2) can be conveniently obtained from the experimental curve of
   DeltaS/S-0 versus dipolar evolution time by limiting the analysis to the
   initial data range 0 < <Delta>S/S-0 < 0.30. Numerical simulations have
   been carried out on a three-spin system of type SI2 in order to assess
   the effect of the I-I homonuclear dipole-dipole coupling and the
   influence of experimental imperfections such as finite pulse length and
   misadjustments of the 180<degrees> pulses applied to the I-spin species.
   The simulations show further that within the initial data range the
   effects of such misadjustments can be internally compensated by a
   modified sequence having an additional 180 degrees pulse on the I
   channel in the middle of the dipolar evolution periods. Experimental
   Al-27\{P-31\} REDOR results on the multispin systems Al(PO3)(3), AlPO4,
   {[}AlPO4](12)(C3H7)(4)NF, and Na3PO4 confirm the general utility of this
   approach. Thus, for applications to unknown systems the compensation
   strategy obviates calibration procedures with model compounds. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Test weighing is the ``gold standard{''} for documenting lactogenesis
   stage II. However, this method is impractical for use in population
   studies. Maternal perception of the timing of the onset of lactation may
   be a useful proxy for lactogenesis stage II. This study seeks to
   validate maternal perception of the onset of lactation as a marker of
   lactogenesis stage II. Women (n = 60) were recruited after cesarean
   delivery. Beginning at 24 h postpartum (pp), the onset of lactation was
   assessed 3 times daily by both test weighing and maternal perception.
   Delayed onset of lactation was defined as follows: 1) milk transfer <
   9.2 g/feeding at 60 h pp and 2) maternal perception <greater than or
   equal to> 72 h pp. Misclassification analyses were conducted.
   Multivariate logistic regression, bivariate analyses and Cox survival
   analyses were used to evaluate the determinants and consequences of
   delayed onset of lactation, using both definitions. The sensitivity and
   specificity of delayed maternal perception as an indicator of delayed
   lactogenesis were 71.4 and 79.3\%, respectively. Four risk factors for
   low milk transfer were significant (P < 0.05) or nearly significant (P
   <less than or equal to> 0.08) predictors of delayed perception of the
   onset of lactation. The effects of low milk transfer and delayed
   maternal perception on breast-feeding duration were similarly modified
   by intended breast-feeding duration. The magnitude and directionality of
   the P coefficients for the milk transfer and perception variables were
   consistent. On the basis of these results, we conclude that maternal
   perception of the onset of lactation is a valid public health indicator
   of lactogenesis stage II.}},

Abstract = {{The dissolution of a drug into the biological environment can be
   enhanced by reducing the particle size of the drug. In this study the
   rapid expansion of supercritical solutions (RESS) process was employed
   to micronize racemic ibuprofen, and the dissolution rate of the
   micronized product in a buffered solution was examined. The chiral
   nonsteroidal antiinflammatory, racemic ibuprofen, was used as a model
   drug because its dissolution rate is limited by its poor solubility in
   water. The phase behavior of the ibuprofen-CO2 binary system was
   investigated prior to the solubility measurements being undertaken. The
   solubility of racemic ibuprofen in supercritical CO2 was measured using
   a dynamic apparatus at pressures between 80 and 220 bar and temperatures
   of 35, 40, and 45 degreesC. The solubility data was modeled using the
   Peng-Robinson equation of state with van der Waals mixing rules. The
   ratio of It and S isomers in the extract was found to be the same as
   that in the original material. The solubility of pure optical isomers of
   ibuprofen, namely, (S)-ibuprofen and (R)-ibuprofen, were also determined
   at 35 degreesC within the pressure range of 80-200 bar. It was found
   that (S)-ibuprofen exhibited solubility in CO2 similar to (R)-ibuprofen,
   and the solubility of the pure isomers was at least 60\% higher than
   that of the racemic ibuprofen at all pressures. The RESS experiments
   involved studying the effect of spraying distance, the pre-expansion
   pressure, and nozzle length on the particle size. The median particle
   size of ibuprofen precipitated by RESS was less than 2.5 mum. Although
   the particles obtained were aggregated, they were easily dispersed by
   ultrasonication in water. The pre-expansion pressure and nozzle length
   had no effect on the particle size and morphology within the range of
   operating conditions studied. An increase in spraying distance resulted
   in a slight decrease in particle size and degree of aggregation. The
   powder dissolution rate of racemic ibuprofen was enhanced as the
   particle size decreased. The degree of crystallinity of the processed
   ibuprofen was slightly decreased; as a result, the micronized product
   exhibited a higher disk intrinsic dissolution rate. The increase in
   dissolution rate of ibuprofen was hence due to both the reduction in
   particle size and the degree of crystallinity.}},

   for implementing this principle for softening materials such as
   concrete. Instead of using heuristic global optimization techniques, our
   strategies are a hybrid of local optimization methods with a
   path-finding approach to ensure a global optimum. With admissible nodal
   displacements being independent variables, it is easy to deal with the
   geometric (mesh) constraint conditions. The direct search optimization
   methods recover the localized solutions for a range of softening lattice
   models which are representative of the quasi-brittle structures. (C)

Abstract = {{Ketoconazole is an oral-antifungal agent that has been used worldwide in
   the treatment of some hormone-dependent human cancer. In this study, we
   demonstrated that ketoconazole (20 muM) induced various types of human
   cancer cell growth arrest in the G0/G1 phase. Our results revealed that
   ketoconazole-induced growth arrest was more profound in COLO 205 and Hep
   G2 (with wild-type p53) than in HT 29 (p53 His(273) mutant) and Hep 3B
   (with deleted p53) cells. The protein levels of p53, p21/Cip1, and
   p27/Kip1 were significantly elevated by ketoconazole (10 muM) treatment
   in COLO 205 but not in HT 29 cells. The ketoconazole-induced G0/G1 phase
   arrest in COLO 205 cells was attenuated by p53-specific antisense
   oligodeoxynucleotides (20 muM) treatment. These results suggested that
   the p53-associated signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of
   ketoconazole-induced cancer cell growth arrest. By Western blot
   analysis, we demonstrated that cyclin D3 and CDK4 protein but not other
   G0/G1 phase regulatory protein levels were decreased by
   ketoconazole-treatment in both COLO 205 and HT 29 cells. Our study
   provides the basis of molecular mechanisms for ketoconazole in growth
   inhibition of human cancer cells and such results may have significant
   applications for cancer chemotherapy. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Lasers have been established as a commercial tool for drilling holes in
   a variety of materials. The beam quality and temporal shape of the laser
   pulse have been identified as critical parameters to create high quality
   (deeper holes, minimum taper angle, and minimum recast layer) holes.
   However, little attention has been directed toward an analytic
   investigation of the effect of different temporal pulse shapes on these
   product variables. In this study, a leading-edge, sharp-spiked, and a
   rectangular Nd:YAG laser pulse were used to drill holes in stainless
   steel 304 to examine the effects of these temporally different laser
   pulses on the drilling process. It is found that holes drilled with the
   sharp-spiked laser pulse are significantly deeper than for the case of
   rectangular pulses. Also an optimum processing regime is identified to
   drill holes with minimum taper angle and recast layer. A mathematical
   model describing the drilling process is presented in this article for
   different temporal profiles of the pulsed laser beams. The model assumes
   one-dimensional heat conduction in the material and it incorporates the
   Stefan conditions at the solid-liquid and liquid-vapor interfaces. The
   predicted drill depth and recast layer thickness are larger than the
   experimental data but follow the same trend. (C) 2000 Laser Institute of

Abstract = {{Nearfield acoustical holography is a powerful tool for imaging of
   acoustic sources. In this article, the basic theory treating
   steady-state acoustic radiation with generalized holography has been
   discussed. By holographic imaging, the vibration characteristics of
   irregular objects, the Chinese ancient musical instrument, the one-tone
   chime stone and the two-tone chime stone provided by the Institute of
   Archaeology, the Museum of Hubei Province, have been researched. The
   results show that the ancient chime stone has two main vibration modes,
   which make up the base of sound produced by the instrument. As for the
   two-tone chime stone, it is not so long and wide as the single-tone
   chime stone, but thicker and smoother than the single-tone chime stone.
   When it is excited at different positions, although it radiates sounds
   of different frequencies, its vibration modes are similar. This may be
   related to its dimensions and shape. The research is helpful for
   studying the sound producing system and the radiated field
   characteristics of the chime stone.}},

   structures at the local level. The decline in mass direct action in
   civil society appears to be linked to public confidence in political
   society, i.e, in the political parties and elected councillors that
   provide mechanisms for local representation in representative democracy.
   The crisis facing civic organizations is in large part a crisis of
   adjustment, as civic activists redefine their roles in the new
   institutional context and accept that their roles will be more limited
   than in specific extraordinary periods in the past. What makes this task
   of redefinition so difficult is that civil and political society cannot
   be easily separated, but, rather, form a tangled web in the minds of
   civic activists land, we suspect, ordinary citizens also). The lesson of
   this South African case-study is that changing patterns of popular
   politics need to be located in a careful analysis of political society
   as well as civil society, and especially of the real and perceived links
   between them.}},

Title = {{Gas and iron content of galaxy clusters}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{364}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{423-442}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Up to now, many theoretical studies aimed at reproducing the total
   amount of iron and gas in the intra-cluster medium meet the embarrassing
   situation, in which if the iron content is reproduced, the gas is not.
   More precisely, at given iron mass, too little gas and too high Fe
   abundance in turn are obtained as compared to the observational data.
   Large dilution by primordial gas is then invoked to get rid of the
   difficulty. In this paper we present a new approach to this problem.
   Basic ingredients of the present analysis are: (i) The adoption of
   multi-zone models of elliptical galaxies in the framework of the
   super-nova driven galactic wind scheme. They yield a more realistic
   description of the galactic ejecta in which the effects of gradients in
   star formation and chemical enrichment are taken into account. (ii) The
   stellar initial mass function is let vary with the physical conditions
   of the star forming medium. More precisely, the typical mass scale of
   the initial mass function increases with the gas temperature. Since no
   cooling process exists decreasing the temperature of a galaxy's gas
   below the limit set by the current value of the cosmic background
   radiation, it immediately follows that the stellar initial mass function
   of proto-galaxies whose stellar activity began at high red-shift (when
   the CBR temperature was higher than the present-day mean temperature of
   molecular clouds) is different from the one in galaxies which did the
   same but at lower red-shift. Because of this, at given galaxy mass the
   ejecta are expected to depend on the red-shift. (iii) Finally, the basic
   assumption is made that at any time (red-shift) the mass distribution of
   protogalaxies follows the Press-Schechter law holding for Dark Matter,
   however with masses comprised between suitable minimum and maximum
   values, M-L(min) and M-L{*} respectively, that are also varying with
   time and/or red-shift. This is equivalent to assume a sort of
   continuously varying mass function for galaxies as well. When the same
   input physics (stellar initial mass function and galactic ejecta) is
   adopted, the new method recovers previous results in literature.
   However, when the above three ingredients are let work simultaneously
   the total amount of iron and gas are reasonably matched, a point of
   major difficulty in previous studies. The absolute abundance of Fe and
   abundance ratio {[}O/Fe] are fully compatible with the observational
   determinations. However, even in this case some dilution (up to about
   20\%) by primordial gas (never cycled through galaxies) seems to be
   required. This is less than the older estimates of 65\% to 90\%.
   Finally, a simple model for the evolution of the intra-cluster medium
   abundances as a function of the red-shift is presented and compared with
   the observational data for clusters at high red-shift (up to z similar
   or equal to 0.5).}},

Abstract = {{We consider signal and receiver design for space-time Viterbi

   sequence obtained can drastically reduce the channel estimation error:
   We also derive a simple lower bound on the achievable channel estimation
   error of any training sequence. Knowledge of this lower bound helps the
   search for min-norm training sequences in that it facilitates a measure
   of the goodness of the best sequence examined so far, For operation
   under the situation with unknown channel response lengths, we propose a
   simple method to select the memory length (tap number) in the Viterbi
   equalizer based on the SNR of the received signal, The resulting
   equalization performance is found to he comparable with the case where a
   preset, fixed memory length is used. However, the proposed method often
   results in use of a smaller tap number, which translates into a
   reduction ill the computational complexity, Simulation results show that

   reduction is of the order of 5\% to 25\% on the average, for typical

   circumference (MUAC) were taken from 2,016 children aged less than 5
   years (50.8\% male, 49.2\% female)in 1994, Children were characterized
   as severely malnourished if MUAC was <125 mm. Independent variables
   included various characteristics of children, households, and mothers.
   Average MUAC for all children was 130 mm; 33\% were severely
   malnourished. Of the severely-malnourished children, 54.2\% were female,
   and 45.8\% were male. The gender gap persisted in the multivariate
   situation, with female 1.44 times more likely to be severely
   malnourished. Other variables with a statistically significant
   relationship, included the age of children, acceptance of DPT1, and
   education of household heads. The persistence of such a gender

Abstract = {{We examined the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of atracurium
   besylate and its metabolites in children after orthotopic liver
   transplantation (OLT), as a suitable model for critically ill children.
   Ten children were studied after OLT on return to the intensive care unit
   (ICU). The mean (range) age was 36 (7-78) months, and weight 6-24.2 kg.
   Atracurium was started at induction of anaesthesia and adjusted in the
   ICU according to clinical need. Neuromuscular block was measured using
   accelerometry (TOFguard) and the train-of-four (TOF) ratio or count.
   Arterial plasma samples for atracurium and metabolites taken before,
   12-hourly during, and at frequent intervals after the infusion were
   analysed by HPLC. The mean (range) maximum infusion rate during
   steady-state conditions was 1.44 (0.48-3.13) mg kg(-1) h(-1) and the
   duration of infusion 36.9 (22.5-98.4) h. Tachyphylaxis was not observed.
   The mean terminal half-life (t(1/2)) for atracurium was 18.8 (12-32.3)
   min. The steady-state plasma clearance (CLss) was 13.9 (7.9-20.3) mi
   min(-1) kg(-1) and the terminal volume of distribution (V-Z) 390
   (124-551) ml kg(-1); both were higher than in adults after successful
   OLT. The maximum concentration (C-max) of laudanosine was 1190
   (400-1890) ng ml(-1) and t(1/2) was 3.9 (1.1-6.7) h. The renal clearance
   of laudanosine was 0.9 (0.1-2.5) ml min(-1) kg(-1) and increased with
   urine flow, but there was no significant relationship with serum
   creatinine. EEG spikes were confirmed in one child only; the
   corresponding laudanosine C-max was 720 ng ml(-1) Monoquaternary alcohol
   C-max was 986 (330-1770) ng ml(-1) and t(1/2) 42.9 (30-57.7) min. Mean
   recovery time on stopping the atracurium infusion to a TOF ratio >0.75
   was 23.6 (12-27) min. Atracurium is an effective and safe neuromuscular
   blocking agent in this population. Laudanosine concentrations are not
   excessive if graft function is satisfactory.}},

Abstract = {{The general theory of Ragone plots for energy storage devices (ESD) is
   discussed. Ragone plots provide the available energy of an ESD for
   constant active power request. The qualitative form of Ragone plots
   strongly depends on the type of storage (battery, capacitor, SMES,
   flywheel, etc.). For example, the energy decreases as a function of
   power for capacitive ESD, but increases for inductive ESD. Analytical
   results for a representative set of ideal ESD (battery, capacitor, and
   SMES) are compared. Furthermore, the effect of leakage and of the
   specific loss type (Coulomb, Stokes, and Newton friction) is discussed
   for inductive ESD. Finally, we address the problem of how composite ESD
   should be treated, and illustrate it for a battery with inductance. (C)

Abstract = {{Structural plasticity following focal neocortical damage in adult rats
   has recently been found to be sensitive to postinjury rehabilitative
   training. Experience on a complex motor skills task, the acrobatic task,
   after unilateral lesions of the forelimb representation region of the
   sensorimotor cortex (FLsmc) enhanced synaptic structural changes in the
   cortex contralateral and homotopic to the lesions. Using tissue from
   this previous study, the present study examined whether a heterotopic
   region of the sensorimotor cortex of either hemisphere, the hindlimb
   representation area (HLsmc), would undergo structural changes following
   unilateral FLsmc lesions and whether these changes would also be
   sensitive to postinjury training on the acrobatic task. Stereological
   methods for light and electron microscopy were used to assess structural
   changes in lesion or sham-operated rats following 28 days of
   postoperative acrobatic training or simple repetitive exercise (motor
   controls). In the HLsmc contralateral to the lesions of rats receiving
   acrobatic training, there was a subtle, but significant, increase in
   cortical volume and in layer II/III neuropil and dendritic volume per
   neuron in comparison to shams. In rats receiving simple exercise after
   the lesions, these changes were not significantly different from shams,
   Acrobatic training also prevented a loss of cortical volume in the HLsme
   adjacent to the lesion in comparison to shams. These data suggest that
   behavioral training following cortical injury facilitates structural
   plasticity in behaviorally relevant areas of the neocortex other than
   the homotopic cortex contralateral to the lesion. This structural
   plasticity might be relevant to the development of behavioral
   compensation after cortical injury, (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{We consider in this paper the coordinated replenishment dynamic

   the coordination required due to the presence of major and minor setup
   costs, a separate element of coordination made possible by the offer of

   programming formulation for the incremental discount version of the
   extended problem and a tighter reformulation of the problem based on
   variable redefinition are provided. These then serve as the basis for
   the development of a primal-dual based approach that yields a strong
   lower bound for our problem. This lower bound is then used in a branch
   and bound scheme to find an optimal solution to the problem.

Abstract = {{The temperature-dependent behavior of the yellow-band (YB) luminescence
   in n-type GaN epitaxial layers grown by metalorganic chemical-vapor
   deposition have been investigated. The YB luminescence peak position
   initially shows a blueshift in the temperature range from 5 to 40 K and
   then a redshift in the temperature range from 40 to 280 K. The
   temperature dependence of the peak intensity, as well as the integrated
   intensity. also shows an abrupt change at 40 K. above which the
   intensities increase with the temperature until they reach a maximum
   value at around 120 K and then decrease monotonically. The optical
   absorption spectrum associated with the transition related with the YB
   luminescence was observed at temperatures around 100 K and 150 K at
   which the intensity of the luminescence approached maximum values.
   According to the Lucovsky theory, the optical absorption related to the
   YB is best described by a transition from an impurity level to the
   conduction band. This result indicates that the YB luminescence is due
   to a transition from shallow to deep donor states.}},

Abstract = {{BACKROUND. Pandolfo III Malatesta (1370-1427) was a leading figure of
   the Italian Renaissance. He was a valiant soldier and horseman with a
   very active life style. Historical sources report that he died of a
   fever in 1427. The tomb, containing his mummified body, has recently
   been discovered in Fano (Marche, Central Italy).
   METHODS. After careful X-ray and videographic examination, autopsy was
   performed to diagnose possible pathologies. Samples of different tissues
   were collected and rehydrated by Sandison's method and submitted to
   routine histology processes. Sections of treated tissue were fixed on
   clean slides, stained with hematoxylin-eosin or Gardner's Trichromic and
   observed at light microscope.
   RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS. The autopsy showed good preservation of the
   skeletal muscles, cartilage, internal and external organs included
   prostate gland and penis. Macroscopic examination revealed stag-horn
   calculi (calcium urate) of the left kidney and a severe enlargement of
   the prostate, with calcifications detectable by X-ray and a large nodule
   protruding in the lumen of an ectatic urethra. Histology shows fibrous
   bands of connective and muscular tissue surrounding some circular and
   oblong lacunae, with no preservation of epithelial structures. The
   macroscopic and histological picture, showing clear prostatic nodular
   hyperplasia, makes this the first case described in paleopathology. (C)

Abstract = {{Portia fimbriata, an araneophagic jumping spider (Salticidae), makes
   undirected leaps (erratic leaping with no particular target bring
   evident) in the presence of chemical cues from Jacksonoides
   queenslandicus, another salticid and a common prey of P. fimbriata.
   Whether undirected leaping by P. fimbriata functions as hunting by
   speculation is investigated experimentally. Our first hypothesis, that
   undirected leaps provoke movement by J, queenslandicus, was investigated
   using living Fl fimbriata and three types of lures made from dead, dry
   arthropods (P. fimbriata, J. queenslandicus and Musca domestica). When a
   living P. fimbriata made undirected leaps or a spring-driven device made
   the lures suddenly move up and down, simulating undirected leaping, J.
   queenslandicus responded by waving its palps and starting to walk. There
   was no statistical evidence that the species from which the lure was
   made influenced J. queenslandicus' response in these tests. Our second
   hypothesis, that J. queenslandicus reveals its location to P. fimbriata
   by moving, was investigated by recording P: fimbriata's reaction to J.
   queenslandicus when J. queenslandicus reacted to lures simulating
   undirected leaping. In these tests, P. fimbriata responded by turning
   toward J. queenslandicus and waving its palps.}},

Abstract = {{Previously, we showed that development of myocardial necrotic lesions is
   associated with impaired endothelium-dependent coronary artery
   relaxation in young cardiomyopathic hamsters. Since active necrosis
   declines with aging, this study was designed to determine whether
   coronary artery endothelium-dependent relaxation to ACh is restored and
   to identify the mechanisms mediating this effect. Intraluminal diameter
   was recorded in coronary arteries (150-250 mum) from control (C, 297 +/-
   5 days old) and cardiomyopathic (M, 296 +/- 4 days old) hamsters.
   Relaxation to ACh (10(-9) -3 x 10(-5) M) was similar in vessels from C
   and M hamsters. However, mechanisms mediating relaxation to ACh were
   altered. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity with
   N-nitro-L-arginine (1 mM) had a greater inhibitory effect in vessels
   from C hamsters, indicating a reduction in NOS-dependent relaxation in
   vessels from M hamsters. Conversely, inhibition of large Ca2+-dependent
   K+ (BKCa) channels with charybdotoxin (CTX, 0.1 muM) had a greater
   inhibitory effect in vessels from M hamsters. In the presence of both
   N-nitro-L-arginine and CTX, relaxation to ACh was abolished in both
   groups. CTX (0.1 muM) produced a 50 +/- 4 and 30 +/- 3\% contraction of
   vessels from M and C hamsters, respectively, indicating an enhanced role
   for BKCa channels in regulation of coronary artery tone in M hamsters.
   Finally, vasodilatory cyclooxygenase products contributed to ACh-induced
   relaxation in vessels from M, but not C, hamsters. In conclusion,
   NOS-dependent relaxation of coronary small arteries is reduced in the
   late stage of cardiomyopathy. An increase in relaxation mediated by BKCa
   channels and vasodilatory cyclooxygenase products compensates for this
   effect.}},

Abstract = {{Using concepts from the Precaution Adoption Process Model, we identified

   stages with regard to their intention to obtain mammography screening.
   An independent survey company conducted telephone interviews with 2,507
   women aged 50 to 80 who were identified as underutilizers of mammography
   screening. Each underutilizer was assigned to one of three stages with
   regard to intention to get a mammogram: (a) definitely planning, (b)
   thinking about, and (c) not planning. Estimated actual risk of breast
   cancel; perceived risk to breast cancel; worry about breast cancel; and
   fear of learning from a mammogram that one has breast cancer were
   variables found to be significantly associated with intention to obtain
   a mammogram for several subgroups of underutilizing women. There are
   significant behavioral and psychosocial variables, beliefs and feelings
   about breast cancer and demographic characteristics that distinguish
   underutilizing women at various stages with regard to intention to
   obtain mammography screening. Our findings provide new information that
   could help the health care professional motivate women who are not

Abstract = {{The Eocene-Oligocene transition marks the passage from `greenhouse'
   conditions to an `icehouse' state, with progressive global cooling
   starting in the early middle Eocene. The late Eocene presents
   substantial evidence for extraterrestrial impacts whose effects on

   high-resolution, microfloral and faunal investigation has been carried
   out in a 4-m-thick segment of the Massignano Global Stratotype Section
   and Point for the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. The studied interval
   includes a late Eocene (35.7 +/- 0.4 Myr old) impactoclastic layer
   containing several cosmic signatures. The impact event recorded at
   Massignano had no abrupt, dramatic effects on marine biota in terms of
   extinction. However, significant quantitative changes in the calcareous
   plankton and dinoflagellate cyst assemblages occurred 60 kyr after the
   impact event. The observed pattern is intepreted as reflecting a
   long-term re-organization of water structure.}},

Abstract = {{The world is in the midst of a substantial urban transition, but the

   the South Pacific and these vulnerabilities affect human security. The
   biophysical vulnerabilities include the fragile environments of the
   island nations, limited land resources, shortages of basic resources,
   and the risks associated with global warming. The ability to respond to
   these problems is constrained by social vulnerabilities, notably weak
   economies, difficulties associated with land ownership, and
   institutional limitations. There is a need for institutional reform,
   improved planning, better urban resource management, and greater
   regional cooperation, if Pacific island nations are to respond
   effectively to rapid urbanization and global change.}},

   was found after only 6 months exposure to daylight. The identified
   terpenoid compounds which resulted more stable to oxidation and

Abstract = {{Here we report on the role of natural (lakes) and artificial barriers
   (dams) in regulating dissolved silicate (DSi) concentrations in rivers
   from Sweden and Finland. Concentrations of DSi and total phosphorus in
   rivers were strongly affected by the presence of lakes and reservoirs
   dong the aquatic continuum, with riverine DSi concentrations decreasing
   as the percentage of area occupied by lakes and reservoirs increased.
   Rivers with <2\% lake and reservoir area in their watershed averaged 164
   <mu>M, whereas DSI in rivers containing greater than 100/o lake and
   reservoir area averaged 46 muM. The relationship between percentage lake
   area and DSi concentration was best fit by an exponential function (r(2)
   = 0.79, P < 0.001), because once lake and reservoir area exceeds 100/o,
   minimum DSi concentrations are reached. Because lakes and reservoirs act
   to reduce watershed DSi concentrations through diatom growth and
   sedimentation, our results support the hypothesis that further declines
   in the delivery of DSi to the coastal ocean should be expected as new
   dams are constructed on rivers. These reductions in DSi transport to the
   coastal zone with dam construction will have important repercussions on
   diatom growth and coastal food webs.}},

   They also appeared more likely to be living with both biological
   parents, less likely to have a family member on welfare, and more likely
   to have a job when compared with the other teenagers. They described the
   church as being central to their lives and as having multiple functions,

   appears to be first order in nature. Quantum oscillations, which are
   observed for T<T-N when B parallel to {[}100] and B parallel to {[}001],
   reveal an anisotropic Fermi surface. The temperature dependence of the

Abstract = {{Mutants of the bacterium Acinetobacter sp, strain ADP1 were selected to
   grow on benzoate without the BenM transcriptional activator. In the wild
   type, BenM responds to benzoate and cis,cis-muconate to activate
   expression of the benABCDE operon, which is involved in benzoate
   catabolism. This operon encodes enzymes that convert benzoate to
   catechol, a compound subsequently degraded by cat gene-encoded enzymes.
   In this report, four spontaneous mutants were found to carry catB
   mutations that enabled BenM-independent growth on benzoate, catB encodes
   muconate cycloisomerase, an enzyme required for benzoate catabolism. Its
   substrate, cis,cis-muconate, is enzymatically produced from catechol by
   the catA-encoded catechol 1,2-dioxygenase. Muconate cycloisomerase was
   purified to homogeneity from the wild type and the catB mutants. Each
   purified enzyme was active, although there were differences in the
   catalytic properties of the wild type and variant muconate
   cycloisomerases. Strains with a chromosomal benA::lacZ transcriptional
   fusion were constructed and used to investigate how catB mutations
   affect growth on benzoate, All of the catB mutations increased
   cis,cis-muconate-activated ben gene expression in strains lacking BenM,
   A model is presented in which the catB mutations reduce muconate
   cycloisomerase activity during growth on benzoate, thereby increasing
   intracellular cis, cis-muconate concentrations. This, in turn, may allow
   CatM, an activator similar to BenM in sequence and function, to activate
   ben gene transcription. CatM normally responds to cis,cis-muconate to
   activate cat gene expression. Consistent with this model, muconate
   cycloisomerase specific activities in cell extracts of benzoate-grown
   catB mutants were low relative to that of the wild type. Moreover, the
   catechol 1,2-dioxygenase activities of the mutants were elevated, which
   may result from CatM responding to the altered intracellular levels of
   cis,cis-muconate and increasing catA expression. Collectively, these
   results support the important role of metabolite concentrations in
   controlling benzoate degradation via a complex transcriptional
   regulatory circuit.}},

   little or no change in mean levels. Using data from 2,274 men and women
   in their 40s retested after 6 to 9 years, the present study examined two
   hypotheses: (a) that retest correlations should be no higher than about
   .60 and (b) that there should be small decreases in Neuroticism,
   Extraversion, and Openness, and small increases in Agreeableness and
   Conscientiousness. The study also explored the effects of recalled life
   events on subsequent personality scores. Results did not support the
   first hypothesis; uncorrected retest correlations uniformly exceeded
   .60. This was true for all personality traits, including facets of
   Agreeableness and Conscientiousness not previously included in
   longitudinal studies. The hypothesized decreases in Neuroticism,
   Extraversion, and Openness were found, but Conscientiousness showed a
   small decrease instead of the predicted increase. Life events in general
   showed very little influence on the levels of personality traits,

Abstract = {{Platinum based electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction were
   prepared by electrodeposition of Pt particles in a polyaniline film
   acting as a convenient matrix to achieve low Pt loadings (from 11 to 600
   mug cm(-2)). Using a rotating disc electrode or a rotating ring disc
   electrode allowed us to separate the different contributions in the
   overall reaction : diffusion of molecular oxygen in the electrolyte
   solution, diffusion inside the PAni film, adsorption process, and
   electron transfer. Koutecky-Levich analysis made possible to evaluate
   the kinetics parameters (total number of exchanged electrons, limiting
   current density, Tafel slope and exchange current density). These
   parameters vary with the Pt loading, displaying a steep increase at
   around 200 mug.cm(-2), above which the behavior of bulk platinum is
   found. At lower Pt loadings, the kinetics is controlled by a Temkin
   isotherm, and a large amount of hydrogen peroxide is formed. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{We model convertible bond calls under asymmetric information where,
   unlike Harris and Raviv (1985), we consider a nonzero call price and a
   call notice period. In the model, the use of underwriters conveys
   negative information. Consequently, the stock price decline is greater
   for underwritten calls than for nortunderwritten calls. Furthermore,
   underwritten calls are made earlier and when the conversion option is
   less deep in the money. Underwriting commissions and the stock price
   decline associated with a call are negatively related to the extent that
   the conversion option is in the money before the call. Empirical
   evidence in this paper and Singh, Cowan, and Nayar (1991) are consistent
   with the model's predictions.}},

Abstract = {{A series of platinum-tin catalysts supported on carbon have been
   prepared from organometallic precursors using surface organometallic
   chemistry (SOMC). The catalysts were characterized using chemisorption,
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis
   (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), anti cyclic voltammetry.
   The addition of tin to Pt/C suppresses chemisorption of both hydrogen
   and carbon monoxide, with a rapid decrease on addition of just a small
   amount of tin, leveling off to give a plateau at higher lending. TEM,
   EDX. and XPS provide evidence that the platinum and tin occur together
   on the support and that on exposure to air the catalysts consist mainly
   of metallic platinum in association with tin oxide. A catalyst prepared
   using SOMC and another of similar loading prepared using conventional
   precipitation were compared for thr electro-oxidation of adsorbed carbon
   monoxide using cyclic voltammetry. The catalyst prepared using SOMC
   showed enhanced activity with a larger decrease in the onset potential
   of carbon monoxide oxidation compared to Pt/C. Comparison of a range of
   carbon support platinum-tin catalysts with different loading prepared
   using SOMC showed a decrease in the onset potential for the catalyst at
   low loading with no further significant decrease in potential on
   addition of further tin. The peak intensities, however changed
   significantly with an increase in loading. (C) 2000 The Electrochemical

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL BULLETIN}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{199}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Videotaped recordings of adult lobsters of different molt stages were
   analyzed. The escape response of adults was compared with that of
   juveniles recorded in an earlier study.
   Juvenile lobsters always respond to a threat with escape behavior
   irrespective of their molt stage, but in adults the probability of
   eliciting a response was a function of molt stage: more hard-shelled
   (intermolt stage C) and (premolt stage D) animals tailflipped than did
   soft-shelled (postmolt stages A and B) animals.
   The number, frequency, and duration of tailflips, and the average
   distance swum by animals in each molt stage were measured for the entire
   escape response, for the initial power swim, and for the subsequent
   swims. These measurements were used to compute several parameters:
   velocity, acceleration, force, and work; average distance traveled in a
   tailflip for each kilogram of body weight (distance/kg/tailflip); and
   average distance traveled for each bodylength (distance/bodylength).
   Among adults, intermolt (stage C) lobsters traveled significantly
   farther and faster than postmolt animals (stages A and B). Among
   juveniles, late postmolt (stage B) animals traveled farther. Among
   adults, although the total number of tailflips and the duration of the
   response were not significantly different among molt stages, the number
   of tailflips/second (frequency) and distance traveled/kg/tailflip were
   greater for intermolt animals. In juvenile intermolts, how ever,
   frequency and distance/kg/tailflip were markedly lower than in the
   premolt stages. Although values were lower than intermolts and premolts,
   postmolt adults sustained their swimming frequency,
   distance/kg/tailflip, and distance/bodylength for the entire escape
   distance (as did postmolt juveniles). These parameters then dropped off
   sharply for both adult and juvenile intermolt and premolt animals in the
   second half of the escape distance.
   Post-threat behaviors reveal that stage D animals have the highest
   aggression index and often attack the presented stimulus, whereas stage
   A animals are the least likely to approach the stimulus and typically
   back away in a non-aggressive posture.
   Thus, although effects of the molt cycle on adult and juvenile escape
   behavior are similar in some ways, other physical characteristics of
   adults, such as weight, allometry, and physiology, seem to become
   important in determining the likelihood of escape behavior and the
   characteristics of the escape swim in each molt stage.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives-This study examined the issue of confidentiality in relation
   to i) undergraduate curriculum content in physiotherapy, and ii) the
   awareness, experiences and attitudes of clinical physiotherapists.
   Design-Postal survey of universities and focus group interviews with
   physiotherapists.
   Setting-Twenty-free universities in the UK and Ireland and 44 therapists
   in five hospitals in southern England.
   Results-The survey of universities indicated that legal and ethnical
   aspects of confidentiality featured in virtually all preregistration
   courses that responded. However, whereas its inclusion was rated as
   extremely important, the degree of coverage of confidentiality varied
   considerably between courses. Within the focus groups, 35 informants
   recollected coverage of confidentiality in their preregistration
   education, and 12 in postregistration in-service training; in neither
   case was this coverage in great detail. Informants identified
   environmental factors and working practices as barriers to preserving
   confidentiality. Disclosure to others also gave rise to difficulties.
   Informants were only aware in general terms of the relevant sections of
   the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy's Rules of Professional Conduct.
   Conclusions-Aspects of hospital-based physiotherapy practice were seen
   to create specific problems in relation to confidentiality. More
   detailed sources of education and guidance on this issue appear to be
   required.}},

Abstract = {{The ribonucleoside analog ribavirin (1-beta

   vitro use of ribavirin triphosphate by a model viral RNA polymerase,

   templates incorporation of cytidine and uridine with equal efficiency.
   Ribavirin reduces infectious poliovirus production to as little as
   0.00001\% in cell culture. The antiviral activity of ribavirin
   correlates directly with its mutagenic activity. These data indicate
   that ribavirin forces the virus into `error catastrophe'. Thus,

Abstract = {{To explore the possible involvement of spinal K-opioid receptor in
   modulating morphine withdrawal syndrome, rats were made dependent on
   morphine by multiple injections of morphine HCl for 5 days. They were
   then given intrathecal administration (i.t.) of a kappa -opioid receptor
   agonist
   trans-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N{[}2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-cyclohexyl]-benzenace
   tamide hydrochloride (U-50,488H, 2.5-10 mug) or its antagonist
   nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI, 1.25-5 mug), followed by intraperitoneal
   administration (i.p.) of naloxone (0.5 mg/kg), and the withdrawal
   syndrome was scored for 60 min. U-50,488H produced a dose-dependent
   suppression, whereas nor-BNI a dose-dependent potentiation in withdrawal
   syndrome. The latter result implies that an endogenous kappa receptor
   agonist, most probably dynorphin, exerts a tonic suppressive effect on
   morphine syndrome at spinal level. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland

Abstract = {{Using a second quantized formulation, an approximate diatomics in

   effects of this approximation, the DIM one electron operator is
   constructed so that the true ab initio first-order density matrix and
   total energy are reproduced at the Hartree-Fock level. The resulting
   model was extensively tested for a variety of basis sets for its
   capability of capturing both the dynamic and nondynamic components of
   the electron correlation energy as well as the energies of excited
   electronic states. A modified method in which the DIM one-electron
   operator is formed from the initial extended Huckel guess of the
   Hartree-Fock orbitals was also found to produce excellent results.}},

Title = {{Expression and action of neurotropin-3 and nerve growth factor in
   embryonic and early postnatal rat testis development}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1617-1628}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The current study examines the expression and potential actions of
   neurotropin-3 (NT3), nerve growth factor (NGF), and their receptors
   during morphological sex determination (seminiferous cord formation) and
   perinatal rat testis development. The expression of neurotropins and
   their receptors was analyzed with immunohistochemistry. Cellular
   localization of neurotropin ligand and receptor proteins changed during
   embryonic testis development. Neurotropin-3 was localized to Sertoli
   cells at Embryonic Day 14 (E14), was present in gonocytes at Postnatal
   Day 0 (PO), and after birth became localized to the interstitium and
   Sertoli cells (P3-P5). The expression of trk C (the high affinity
   receptor for NT3) was localized to mesonephric ducts and cells
   surrounding the cords (E14-E18). In addition, Sertoli cells and
   preperitubular cells surrounding the cords at E14 also stained for trk
   C. Neurotropin-3 was expressed in gonocytes and Sertoli cells at P0-P5.
   Nerve growth factor was detected in Sertoli cells at E14, was clearly in
   Sertoli and interstitial cells at E16 and E18, and in Sertoli, germ, and
   interstitial cells from P0-P5. The expression of trk A (the high
   affinity receptor for NGF) was located in Sertoli and interstitial cells
   at E16-P5. To determine the actions of neurotropins during embryonic and
   perinatal testis development, experiments were conducted on E13 and PO
   testis. Antisense oligonucleotide experiments with NT3 were used on E13
   testis organ cultures to determine effects on seminiferous cord
   formation. Cord formation was inhibited in 40\% of the organ cultures
   treated with the antisense NT3 oligonucleotides, while no inhibition was
   observed with sense oligonucleotides. In PO testis cultures, both NT3
   and NGF alone and in combination stimulated thymidine incorporation into
   DNA. Therefore, the neurotropins are involved in embryonic morphological
   events (cord formation; NT3) and in growth of the perinatal testis (PO;
   NT3 and NGF). To define further the growth effects of neurotropins on
   testis development, expression of transforming growth factor alpha and
   beta (TCF alpha and TGF beta) were examined in response to neurotropins.
   The PO testis cultures were treated with neurotropins, and expression of
   mRNA for TGF alpha and TGF beta was analyzed utilizing a quantitative
   reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay. Nerve growth
   factor and NT3 alone or in combination inhibited expression of mRNA for
   TGF alpha while NT3 increased mRNA expression of epidermal growth factor
   receptor. The combination treatment of neurotropins inhibited expression
   of TGF beta1 and increased expression of TGF beta3. In summary,
   observations suggest that NT3, NGF, trk A, and trk C are localized to
   cells critical to seminiferous cord formation and appear to be important
   regulators of morphological sex determination. In addition to these
   morphological effects, both NT3 and NGF stimulate PO testis growth and
   may elicit their action through altering the expression of locally
   produced growth factors such as TGF alpha and TGF beta. Taken together
   these results suggest that neurotropins are regulators of paracrine
   cell-cell interactions that result in morphological sex determination
   and perinatal testis growth.}},

Abstract = {{Gut contents of 138 northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus) and
   75 red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), which had been trapped from
   November to February in the boreal forest of northeastern Alberta, were
   examined to determine which fungi were consumed as food during the
   winter months in this habitat. Spores of epigeous Boletales,
   Russulaceae, and Cortinariaceae were most frequent and numerous.
   Hypogeous ascomycetes (unidentified species of Elaphomyces and Tuber)
   and basidiomycetes (unidentified species of Gautieria, Hymenogaster,
   Hysterangium, and Rhizopogon) were sometimes present in substantial
   amounts but were not as frequent as the remains of epigeous fungi. Guts
   sometimes contained remains of the tough or carbonaceous sporocarps of
   unidentified species of the Hymenochaetales, Diatrypaceae, Xylariaceae,
   and Bankeraceae. The spores of some rust fungi (e.g., Phragmidium
   fusiforme) along with the conidia (e.g., Helicoma sp.) and ascospores of
   microfungi (e.g., Sordariaceae) were also detected. Lichen tissues were
   absent, and this contrasts with previous suggestions that lichens are a
   winter food of sciurids in regions with substantial snowfall. A parallel
   analysis of 110 faecal pellets from northern flying squirrels collected
   in the same area from June to August confirms that fungi are important
   in its summer diet.}},

Abstract = {{The temperature-induced variations in Fourier transform near-infrared

   arising from the presence of two OH conformers have been observed.
   Fourier self-deconvoluted (FSD) and second-derivative spectra also
   confirmed the splitting of the monomer band into two components. It has
   been demonstrated that positions of the peaks appearing in the
   two-dimensional contour maps correlating the first- and second-overtone
   regions can be applied for determination of anharmonicity constants. The
   results presented in this paper suggest that the rule saying that the

Abstract = {{Background. To improve the provision of information to their
   radiotherapy patients, the authors examined whether the timing of given
   written information has an effect on anxiety and satisfaction. Methods.
   Two sources of information were used: 1) a booklet with a description of
   radiotherapy procedures and the sensations patients can experience; 2)
   teaching sheets with treatment, site-related information. 68 patients
   were randomized to a simultaneous- information group (n = 31) and a
   stepwise- information group (n = 37). The patients were being treated
   for cancers of the breast, lung, head, and neck or the pelvic region.
   The authors analyzed the impacts of several variables on patient
   learning, including anxiety, age, gender, support, referral, stage of
   illness, and diagnosis. Assessments were recorded before the simulation
   procedure and during the second and last weeks of treatment. Results.
   The stepwise-information group was significantly less anxious before
   simulation (p = 0.02) and more satisfied (p = 0.001). Of the variables
   studied, only the support variable was associated with high state
   anxiety (p < 0.0001). Conclusions. Provision of patient information in a
   stepwise format leads to less treatment-related anxiety and greater
   patient satisfaction among radiation therapy patient undergoing
   simulation.}},

Abstract = {{A new technique for the resection of cranial tumours and subsequent
   reconstruction using stereolithographic (SL) biomodelling and customized
   cranioplastic implants has been developed. The technique is based on a
   custom model of the tumour and surrounding skull from which the
   resection of the tumour and shape of the cranioplasty can be determined.
   A patient with a hyperostotic fronto-orbital meningioma was selected. CT
   was performed and SL biomodels manufactured. The surgeon marked the
   resection margin on the biomodel and a customized resection template was
   fashioned. The tumour was then resected from the biomodel and a
   customized acrylic implant was manufactured to reconstruct the defect.
   At surgery the tumour was exposed in a routine fashion and the template
   used to mark the resection margin. Once resected, the defect was
   reconstructed with the custom cranioplastic implant. The technique
   facilitated accurate surgical resection of the tumour and subsequent
   reconstruction. The surgeon reported several advantages of the technique
   including increased confidence, reduced operating time (at least 1 h),
   excellent cosmetic results, accuracy, and simplicity. The patient
   reported that the opportunity to see the biomodel, template and implant
   improved her understanding of the procedure.}},

Abstract = {{Suppose given a realization of a Poisson process on the line: call the
   points `germs' because at a given instant `grains' start growing around
   every germ, stopping for any particular grain when it touches another
   grain. When all growth stops a fraction e(-1) of the line remains
   uncovered. Let n germs be thrown uniformly and independently onto the
   circumference of a circle, and let grains grow under a similar protocol.
   Then the expected fraction of the circle remaining uncovered is the nth
   partial sum of the usual series for e(-1). These results, which sharpen
   inequalities obtained earlier, have one-sided analogues: the grains on
   the positive axis alone do not cover the origin with probability
   e(-1/2), and the conditional probability that the origin is uncovered by
   these positive grains, given that the germs n and n + 1 coincide, is the
   nth partial sum of the series for e(-1/2). Despite the close similarity
   of these results to the rencontre, or matching, problem, we have no
   inclusion-exclusion derivation of them. We give explicitly the
   distributions for the length of a contiguous block of grains and the
   number of grains in such a block, and for the length of a grain. The
   points of the line not covered by any grain constitute a Kingman-type
   regenerative phenomenon for which the associated p-function p(t) gives
   the conditional probability that a point at distance t from an uncovered
   point is also uncovered. These functions enable us to identify a
   continuous-time Markov chain on the integers for which p(t) is a
   diagonal transition probability. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

   pharmacokinetics and metabolism of perazine in rats}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to search for possible effects of imipramine
   and amitriptyline on the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of perazine at
   steady state in rats. Perazine (10 mg kg(-1). i.p.) was administered to
   rats twice daily for two weeks, alone or jointly with imipramine or
   amitriptyline (10 mg kg(-1) i.p.). Concentrations of perazine and its
   two main metabolites (5-sulphoxide and N-desmethylperazine) in the
   plasma and brain were measured at 30 min (C-max), 6 h and 12 h (slow
   disposition phase) after the last dose of the drugs. Liver microsomes
   were prepared 24 h after withdrawal of the drugs.
   Amitriptyline increased the plasma and brain concentrations of perazine
   (up to 300\% of the control) and N-desmethylperazine, while not
   affecting those of 5-sulphoxide. Imipramine only tended to increase the
   neuroleptic concentration in the plasma and brain. Studies with control
   liver microsomes showed that amitriptyline and imipramine added to the
   incubation mixture in-vitro, competitively inhibited N-demethylation
   (K-i (inhibition constant) = 16 muM and 164 muM, respectively) and
   5-sulphoxidation (K-i = 57 muM and 86 muM, respectively) of perazine,
   amitriptyline being a more potent inhibitor of perazine metabolism,
   especially with respect to N-demethylation, Studies with microsomes of
   rats treated chronically with perazine or tricyclic antidepressants, or
   both, did not show significant differences in the rate of perazine
   metabolism between perazine- and perazine+antidepressant-treated rats.
   The data obtained were compared with the results of analogous
   experiments with promazine and thioridazine.
   It was concluded that elevations of perazine concentration were caused
   by direct inhibition of the neuroleptic metabolism by the
   antidepressants. Similar interactions, possibly leading to exacerbation
   of the pharmacological action of perazine, may be expected in man. Since
   the interactions between phenothiazines and tricyclic antidepressants
   may proceed in two directions, reduced doses of both the neuroleptic and
   the antidepressant are recommended when the drugs are administered
   jointly.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional along-the-channel mass and heat transfer model for a
   proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is described. The model is
   used for calculation of cell performance (i.e., cell voltage against
   current density), ohmic resistance and water profile in the membrane,
   current distribution and variation of temperature along the gas
   channels. The following fuel cell regions are considered: gas channels,
   electrode backings and active layers at the anode and cathode side, and
   a proton exchange membrane. The model includes mass transfer in the gas
   channels and electrode gas backings, water transport in the membrane,
   electrode kinetics and heat transfer. Temperature in the cell is assumed
   to vary only along the gas channels, which means that it is the same at
   the anode and cathode and in the solid phase at a specified value of the
   channel coordinate. Electrode kinetics are considered only at the
   cathode, where major losses occur, whereas the anode potential is
   assumed to be equal to its equilibrium value. An agglomerate approach is
   used for the description of the active layer of the cathode. Simulations
   are carried out for different humidities of inlet gases, several
   different stoichiometric amounts of reactants and cooling media (air,
   water) with different heat transfer coefficients. Analysis of the
   results showed that the best performance of the PEMFC was obtained for
   well-humidified gases at conditions close to isothermal and at a
   stoichiometry of gases only somewhat higher than that corresponding to
   complete reactant consumption.}},

Abstract = {{what motivates a person's desire to punish actors who commit

   a further danger to society. Research participants in two experiments
   assigned punishments to actors whose offenses were varied with respect
   to the moral seriousness of the offense and the likelihood that the

   the punishment as the seriousness of the offense increased, but their
   sentences were not affected by variations in the likelihood of
   committing future offences, suggesting that just deserts was the primary
   sentencing motive. Only in a case in which a brain tumor was identified
   as the cause of an actor's violent action, a case that does not fit the

   show a desire to incarcerate the actor in order to prevent future harms

Abstract = {{The potential environmental risks due to gene flow from genetically

   concern. Of particular interest is gene flow from GM oilseed rape
   (Brassica napus) into its wild parental species B. rapa and B. oleracea,
   with which it forms spontaneous hybrids. The rate of hybridization is
   best determined empirically under a wide variety of field conditions. A
   procedure for quantifying hybrid formation using remote sensing over a
   large area of southern England is described. Satellite sensor images
   were used to identify localities where gene flow was most likely by
   searching for oilseed rape fields adjacent to regions where the parent
   plants occur, namely rivers and cliff-tops. These sites were visited and
   screened for hybrids. A single hybrid was observed in an area of over 16
   000 km(2). We use these data to suggest a strategy to minimise gene flow
   following commercial scale release of GM B. napus across Europe and
   propose a procedure that may allow post-release containment.}},

Abstract = {{B6C3F1 mice were treated with 0, 100, 500, 1500, or 6000 ppm
   di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) in the diet for up to 104 weeks. Blood
   and urine were analyzed at Weeks 26, 52, 78, and 104 from 10 animals per
   sex per group. Body weights and food consumption were measured weekly
   for the first 16 weeks, then monthly thereafter. Survival was reduced
   for mice receiving 6000 ppm DEHP. Overall weight gains were
   significantly lower for the 6000-ppm male group, but there was no
   difference among female groups. Food consumption was not affected by
   exposure. No biologically significant changes in clinical chemistry,
   hematology, or urinalysis were observed. After 104 weeks of exposure,
   kidney weights for the 500- and 1500-ppm male, and 6000-ppm male/female
   groups were significantly lower than for the controls. Significantly
   higher liver weight was seen for the 500-, 1500-, and 6000-ppm male
   groups and the 6000-ppm female group of mice. Testis weights for the
   500-, 1500-, and 6000-ppm males were significantly lower than for the
   controls. Uterine weights for the 6000-ppm group were significantly
   lower than for the controls. All organs were examined for
   histopathology. The incidence of hepatocellular lesions has been
   reported separately (R. M. David et al., 1999. Toxicol. Sci. 50,
   195-205). Tumors were observed at greater than or equal to 500-ppm
   dosages, where peroxisome proliferation was significantly increased. A
   NOEL for both tumors and peroxisome proliferation was 100 ppm. In the
   study presented here, bilateral hypospermia in the testes of male mice,
   hepatocyte pigmentation and cytoplasmic eosinophilia in the liver, and
   chronic progressive nephropathy of male and female mice were observed at
   6000 ppm. Hypospermia and chronic progressive nephropathy were also
   observed at 1500 ppm, where peroxisome proliferation was 2.7-6.8-fold
   higher than controls. Many lesions observed in rats were not seen in
   mice. A dose level of 500 ppm (98.5-116.8 mg/kg/day) was identified as a
   no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for noncarcinogenic effects.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical and practical issues that impact on the development of
   (especially) three-dimensional vector finite-element (FEM) programs are
   discussed. The theory of vector elements is briefly reviewed, and some
   troublesome aspects are highlighted: in particular, the interpretation
   of the degrees of freedom. The choice of element shape is briefly
   addressed, as is the evaluation of the elemental matrices. Several
   useful references are provided in this context. Data structures
   appropriate for a three-dimensional code are outlined, as is the issue
   of establishing mesh interconnectivity. The topics of mesh generation
   and linear algebra are very briefly considered. The paper concludes with
   some comments on post-processing, in particular, the computation of
   fields within the FE mesh.}},

Abstract = {{Solubilization of heavy metals from Fe oxyhydroxides in the presence of
   sodium ascorbate as a reducing agent were investigated as a function of
   pH. Amorphous iron hydroxide (HFO) and goethite were synthesized in the
   presence of Pb, Cd, and Zn, using two different processes, i.e.,
   favoring either metal adsorption (ADS) or metal substitution
   (coprecipitation, COP). Characterization of solids showed that there
   were no structural differences among the three kinds of HFO. However in
   the case of goethite, it seemed that metal cations were located within
   the structure of COP goethite, but partially adsorbed in ADS goethite.
   Results evidenced that, under reductive conditions, the solubilization
   risk is greater for PB, than for Cd (Cd substituted in the structure)
   from the coprecipitation process. In the adsorption process, Cd was
   removed more than Pb (greater complexation constant of Pb). Moreover,
   irrespective of the crystalline state, solids may be partly dissolved,
   and release of metals could occur. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The type of regimen used might result in mobilization of phenotypically
   and functionally different CD34(+) cells. We compared the phenotype of
   CD34(+) cells in leukapheresis products of three homogeneous groups: I,
   healthy individuals treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
   (G-CSF) alone (n = 13); II, patients mobilized with G-CSF following
   chemotherapy (n = 16): and III, patients mobilized with G-CSF after
   high-dose chemotherapeutic pretreatment (n = 24). Multiparameter flow
   cytometry was performed for CD34(+) subpopulation analysis and focused
   on adhesion molecules, differentiation markers and megakaryocytic
   markers relevant for stem cell homing, with special reference to the
   importance of L-selectin expression. Regimens I and II led to higher
   numbers of mobilized CD34(+) cells (mean 468 x 10(6) and 491 x 10(6)
   CD34(+) cells per leukapheresis procedure respectively) than regimen IU
   (mean 41 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells per leukapheresis procedure). Both the
   expression of L-selectin and CD54 on CD34(+) cells was significantly
   lower in group III, as was the percentage of megakaryocytic (CD41(+))
   progenitors. A higher percentage of primitive (CD38(-) and/or HLA DR-)
   CD34(+) cells was found in group III, correlating with a higher
   clonogenicity of the CD34(+) cells. However, when comparing the CD34(+)
   subpopulations that were also positive for L-selectin, there was no
   significant difference between the three regimens. A similar approach
   for the megakaryocytic CD34(+) population resulted in an even worse
   quality of regimen III: 5.1\% of CD34(+) being CD41(+)/L-selectin(+)
   compared with 9.2\% and 8.9\% in regimens I and II respectively. We
   concluded that the phenotypes of the CD34(+) cells in the G-CSF (group
   I) and G-CSF-chemotherapy (group II) regimens are similar, whereas the
   phenotype of the CD34(+) cells mobilized in the high-dose regimen (group
   III) displayed features that might negatively influence homing of the
   cells. Future studies will be directed towards regimens that will lead
   to the mobilization of a higher amount of CD34(+) cells with a
   phenotypically favourable phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To evaluate results of revision stapedectomy with and without

   STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective review of 356 revision
   stapedectomy operations performed at the House Ear Clinic, a tertiary
   neurotologic private practice, between 1983 and 1995.
   RESULTS: A postoperative gap of less than or equal to 10 dB was obtained
   in 60\% of cases. Results were similar with and without the use of a
   laser. Sensorineural hearing loss of >10 dB occurred in 7.7\%, with 3
   (1.4\%) ears with profound heating loss. A poorer outcome was related to
   incus necrosis, multiple revisions, and indications for surgery other
   than conductive hearing loss.
   CONCLUSION: Revision stapedectomy can provide good gap closure in 60\%
   of cases, with small risk of sensorineural hearing loss.
   SIGNIFICANCE: Although not as satisfactory as primary stapedectomy,
   revision stapedectomy can be offered to patients with reasonable
   expectations for good gap closure.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic variation of the two largest Modiolus capax (Conrad, 1837)
   populations that occur on the west coast of the Gulf of California was
   studied by the allozyme analysis of eight polymorphisms of twelve
   isozyme loci. Genetic variation was examined in about 200 mussels
   collected from three levels of the intertidal zone and from three
   sublittoral demes. Two loci (LAP{*} and GPI{*}) displayed particularly
   high allelic diversity (18 and 19 alleles, respectively), many of which
   were rare (p < 0.1). Heterozygote deficiency was a common feature across
   all loci, probably explained by the Wahlund effect. The genetic
   structure of the population was analyzed using Wright's F-statistics,
   and its significance was assessed by permutation and numerical
   resampling methods. There was a lower degree of genetic divergence among
   intertidal levels (F-ST = 0.042) than among sublittoral demes (F-ST =
   0.080), yet both values were significant. Comparisions between grouped
   genotype frequencies for each extreme locality (San Felipe vs La Pat)
   revealed a low but significant level of genetic divergence (F-ST =
   0.049), which suggests genetic flow over vast geographic distances
   (approximately 1100 km), but slight local genetic divergence due to
   physical or biological factors acting over the larval dispersal and

Abstract = {{Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) deficiency is generally considered as a cause
   of the autosomal recessive form of dopa-responsive dystonia, also known
   as Segawa disease. Clinical hallmarks comprise parkinsonian and other
   extrapyramidal symptoms. Biochemically the defect leads to the defective
   synthesis of catecholamines, in particular dopamine. The diagnosis
   relies on a characteristic pattern of biogenic amine metabolites
   exclusively in the CSF and can be confirmed by establishing a mutation
   in the TH gene. Here we present a patient meeting all diagnostic
   criteria, including a new homozygous mutation (926T >C) with confirmed
   parental heterozygosity, extrapyramidal symptoms, but atypical other
   symptoms with periodic neurological episodes observed every 4 days and
   unresponsive to dopa treatment. The CSF biochemical abnormalities were
   severe. Uncharacteristically, a strongly abnormal urinary catecholamine
   metabolite pattern was also consistently observed. The atypical
   presentation of this patient shows that the clinical and metabolic
   phenotype of TH deficiency is more variable than formerly thought, and
   that the condition should no longer be considered as a treatable
   disorder per se.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to explore the scope and Limitations of chiral
   docking/protecting groups as chiral auxiliaries in the biohydroxylation
   of unactivated methylene groups. As a model compound, cyclopentanone 1
   was reacted with a range of enantiomerically pure amino alcohols 2a-n as
   well as 7a and b, varying substituents R-1 and R-2. The resulting chiral
   spirooxazolidines 3a-n as well as 8a and b were exposed to the fungus
   Beauveria bassiana ATCC 7159 and the resultant hydroxylated products
   were characterised. Introducing chirality into the substrate before the
   fermentation was found to have a major effect on the course of the
   biohydroxylation relative to the achiral analogue 3a (Table 1, entry 1).
   The nature of R-1/R-2 influenced both the product yield and the optical
   purity of the products (e.g. Table 1, entry 2). In addition, the
   absolute configuration of the final product 6 could be dictated solely
   by the nature of the docking/protecting group used (compare entry 8 with
   entry 9). Concerning the chain length of R-1/R-2, it was found that
   hydroxylation only took place in the cyclopentane ring when the
   heterocyclic ring was substituted with a methyl, ethyl or isopropyl
   (entries 2-5, 8, 9, 15, and 16). With increasing chain length, where
   R1/R2 are propyl, isobutyl or sec-butyl groups, a mixture of products
   was obtained in which the hydroxyl group was either on the cyclopentane
   ring or on the sidechain (entries 10-14).}},

Abstract = {{The collagen gel sandwich culture of hepatocytes has been proposed as
   one of the most suitable culture models available for biotransformation
   studies of xenobiotics. It is a complex model which imitates the cascade
   of enzymatic events of in vivo biotransformation and allows
   investigation of biological endpoints under realistic conditions. The
   biotransformation of trichloroethylene (TRI) has been studied in this
   model using rat hepatocytes. Headspace gas chromatographic measurements
   revealed that hepatocytes, cultured for 4 days in this in vitro system,
   metabolised TRI into the major oxidative metabolites trichloroacetic
   acid (TCA) and trichloroethanol (TCE). Cultured hepatocytes were exposed
   either to TRI, or to TCA and TCE. Endpoints studied were albumin
   secretion and the cytochrome P450 (CYP)-dependent enzymatic activities
   ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), pentoxyresorufin O-depentylase
   (PROD) and N-nitrosodimethylamine demethylase (NDMA). The results show
   that both the parent compound and its metabolites exert specific effects
   on different CYP-dependent mono-oxygenase activities, as seen in vivo.
   It is suggested that collagen gel sandwich cultures represent a useful
   in vitro model for the investigation of metabolism-linked toxicity
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper sets forth general conditions on the existence, boundedness,
   and proper gains of a control for stabilizing a nonlinear plant state
   trajectory to a sliding manifold denoted by S contained in the state
   space as characterized by a smooth quadratic Lyapunov function, V. To
   state such conditions we define a time-varying (possibly discontinuous
   in time) state-dependent decision manifold by considering the
   time-derivative of the quadratic Lyapunov function. The decision
   manifold disconnects the control space. At each instant of time,
   stability is achieved by choosing a control in an appropriate half space
   defined by the decision manifold so that the derivative of the Lyapunov
   function is negative definite. If the decision manifold moves
   continuously, then there is no need for a discontinuous (classical VSC)
   controller unless robustness in the presence of matched disturbances is
   desired. If the decision manifold is discontinuous, then the need for a
   discontinuous control is clear. The formulation unifies the various VSC
   control strategies found in the literature under a single umbrella and
   suggests new structures. The formulation also provides a simple
   geometric understanding of the effect of norm bounded but not
   necessarily matched disturbances and parameter variations on the system.
   Two examples illustrate the design aspects of the formulation.

Journal = {{URBAN STUDIES}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{2581-2602}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Property cycles are varied in terms of their amplitude, their
   periodicity and the impact they exert on the wider economy. In periods
   of domestic macroeconomic stability, property cycles tend to be
   endogenous-i.e. caused by disequilibria in the sector-and they are
   relatively subdued. In periods of domestic macroeconomic instability,
   property cycles tend to be exogenous-i.e. caused by various conditions
   in the macroeconomy-and sometimes feature exceptional fluctuations. The
   exceptional cycles, with heightened amplitudes and longer periodicity,
   exert relatively deep and protracted impact on the wider economy. But,
   the international `non-system' which has developed since the breakdown
   of Bretton Woods has placed the property sector in a wider context in
   the sense that, in addition to influences of domestic macroeconomic
   conditions, major property cycles are now influenced by various
   conditions in the international economy. The post-Bretton-Woods period
   is characterised with deregulation, integration of diverse economies,
   structural/spatial changes and the very high and still growing capital
   mobility supported by the rapid progress of financial technology in a
   multipolar world economy. Two important consequences of these changes
   have had direct and indirect impacts on property markets. First,
   deregulation and the ensuing intensification of competition between the
   banking sector and capital markets narrowed margins and led to excessive
   lending to the property sector. But, the overinvestment in the property
   sector in the upturn was unsustainable and turned into non-performing
   loans in the inevitable downturn, thus increasing risks to the banking
   sector and threatening the stability of financial systems. This has
   drastically curtailed the ability of the banking sector to provide
   capital to finance recovery. Secondly, rapid and voluminous movement of
   international finance capital increased liquidity in domestic markets
   and led to rises in asset prices, including property. So, the two-way
   interdependence between the property sector and the macroeconomy has
   become more significant in the post-Bretton-Woods period. Accordingly
   the IMF and the World Bank, through their adjusted policies, are now
   playing increasingly important roles in international property
   development, albeit in an indirect way. The purpose of this article is
   to examine the post-1980 international property cycles in the context of
   the `non-system' global economy with particular reference to some Asian
   examples.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate limits to the beneficial effects of drying treatments in
   a genebank, new tests are required to detect changes in seed vigour
   prior to, and during, seed storage in cold rooms at minus 20 +/- 2
   degreesC. A stress integrated germination test (SIG T) which includes
   brief imbibition in 0.2 M NaCl at 30 degreesC during 6-12 h germination,
   was applied to monitor germination of lentil, hulled wheat, white
   cabbage, and grass pea seeds, which had been uniformly dried from
   12.2-11.3 to 3.5-2.9\% ton FW basis) moisture content and stored for 21
   days at 35 degreesC. The modified test proved able to amplify
   deterioration symptoms by reducing germination in dried lentil and white
   cabbage seeds, which apparently keep high viability during short-term
   storage. The increase of seed leakage electrical conductivity, measured
   at 24 h imbibition, confirms this trend. Assessment of the original seed
   vigour before any drying treatment may be considered as a prerequisite
   for a better evaluation of a critical moisture range-below which seeds
   are adversely affected in terms of germination-and the related storage
   temperature reduction, to ensure a reliable ex situ germplasm
   conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Rta, mainly encoded by open reading frame 50 (ORF50), is the product of
   an immediate-early gene of human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8)/Kaposi's
   sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. Rta is a transcriptional activator that
   is both necessary and sufficient to disrupt viral latency and activate
   the expression of downstream viral lytic genes. We report that
   ectopically expressed Rta protein could also activate the rta promoter
   on a reporter plasmid up to 144-fold, both in latently infected B cells
   and in uninfected epithelial cells, and that th is activation was
   dose-dependent. Furthermore, by analysing the 5' untranslated region
   using ribonuclease protection assays, we demonstrated that transfection
   of an Rta expression plasmid into latently infected cells activated the
   expression of rta transcripts from endogenous viral genomes. We propose
   that auto-activation of the immediate-early gene, rta, is an important
   strategy for HHV-8 to effectively respond to environmental stimuli and
   maximally activate the virus lytic cycle.}},

Abstract = {{For a new leader, the process of entering and establishing a position of
   leadership in a complex organization presents a major challenge. This
   challenge seems particularly acute when authority, goals and technology
   are ambiguous, as in many professional service organizations. In this
   paper, we integrate ideas from the literature on socialization and role
   theory as well as that on executive succession processes to view new
   leader integration as a mutual adjustment process between two
   trajectories - that of the organization and that of the new leader. It
   is argued that this may lead to four possible types of integration
   outcomes: assimilation, transformation, accommodation and parallelism.
   Drawing on a case study of a large hospital, the paper identifies
   several mechanisms that can be mobilized by the new leader to enhance
   his or her room for manoeuvre as the integration process evolves. The
   mechanisms can be classified as collaborative or affirmative, with each
   type having different risks and advantages. The case analysis further
   reveals that leader integration processes may be differentiated between
   different activity domains, dynamic over time las the use of one type of
   integration approach alters the potential for another later), and
   interactive across different activity domains las events in one part of
   the organization have consequences for those occurring in another).}},

   directly and colocalize in lamellipodia. Fibroblasts expressing NHE1

   impaired organization of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers, and an

   occupying an interstitial site in the host. Our results indicate that Be
   gets trapped inside the Li cage, while Mg remains on the surface of the
   cluster. Mg-induced geometries become three-dimensional earlier at n=4
   as compared to the Be system. In spite of a distinct arrangement of
   atoms in both cases the character of the wave functions in the d

Abstract = {{Objective: To compare endovaginal with pelvic phased array coil magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) in detection of Stage I cervical carcinoma by
   correlating the findings with histopathology. Patients and Methods:
   Forty consecutive patients with Stage I cervical carcinoma confirmed
   histologically were studied using an endovaginal coil alone immediately
   followed by a pelvic phased array coil. T1-W transverse and T2-W FSE
   sagittal images made with each coil were analyzed independently by two
   radiologists noting the presence and size of a mass within the cervix
   and any parametrial extension or involvement of adjacent organs. Tumor
   volumes were measured using the electronic calliper to compute tumor
   area on each slice and multiplying by the slice thickness. Thirty
   patients underwent radical hysterectomy, one a trachylectomy, one simple
   hysterectomy and four extended cone biopsies. Four patients had
   radiotherapy to the primary tumor. Following surgery, histopathologic
   findings were recorded and tumor volumes measured. Results: Tumor
   volumes ranged from 0-106 cm(3) (median 1.4 cm(3), mean 9 +/- 19.4
   cm(3)). Thirty-six patients had correlation of the primary site with the
   surgical specimen. Agreement between observers was excellent for both
   endovaginal (k = 0.90) and pelvic phased array (k = 0.96) techniques.
   Combined sensitivity and specificity for both observers of endovaginal
   MR imaging for detection of tumor was 96 k and 70 k, respectively; for
   pelvic phased array imaging sensitivity was substantially less at 54\%.
   Specificity was higher at 83.7\%, probably because small abnormalities
   were seldom visible. In patients treated surgically, early parametrial
   involvement in four women on endovaginal MRI was confirmed
   histologically in two. Pelvic phased array imaging showed early
   parametrial involvement in four women and was confirmed in one.
   Conclusion: Endovaginal MRI adds substantially to information from
   pelvic phased array images in the preoperative assessment of patients
   with early cervical cancer. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider the important class of directed acyclic graphs
   (DAGs), and present the results of a comparative study on four popular
   drawing algorithms specifically developed for them. The study has been
   performed within a general experimental setting consisting of two large
   test suites of DAGs and a set of quality measures. The focus of the
   experiments has been the practical behavior of the algorithms with a
   geometric foundation compared to that of the algorithms with a
   topological foundation. The four algorithms exhibit various trade-offs
   with respect to the quality measures considered, and none of them
   clearly outperforms the others. Our analysis has motivated the
   development of a new hybrid strategy for drawing DAGs that performs
   quite well in practice.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were performed to evaluate the mechanical and water barrier
   properties of corn-protein-based materials that were compression molded
   from thermoplastic resins. The influence of varying concentrations of
   water, glycerol, and octanoic acid was studied. At 0\% relative
   humidity, the material exhibited a linear elastic deformation and a
   brittle fracture at any glycerol or octanoic acid content. Raising
   relative humidity from 0\% to 97.3\%, progressively decreased the
   tensile strength (from 24.1 to 2.2 MPa and 19.4 to 1.0 MPa), and the
   modulus of elasticity (from 1.67 to 0.03 GPa and 1.87 to 0.13 GPa),
   respectively, for the octanoic acid- or glycerol-plasticized materials.
   Increasing water content did not increase the tensile strain at break of
   the glycerol-plasticized material, whereas this parameter changed from
   1.6 to 52.3\% for octanoic-acid-plasticized material. This last material
   was waterproof during 21 h and its water transmission rate was then 0.05
   mu mol m m(-2) s(-1). Differences in water absorption were related to
   plasticizer solubility and material structure.}},

Abstract = {{Cerebral ischaemia is eventually observed during; neurosurgical
   procedures and in several clinical entities that may cause severe
   neurological deficits and even death. Because it is a severe and complex
   problem, several studies have been done aiming to elucidate the
   mechanisms of the ischemic phenomenon and aiming to abolish or to
   diminish its effects, using drugs that protect the neurons from
   ischaemia-induced damage. Several neurotransmitters play a role in
   cerebral ischaemia with emphasis to glutamate by its high concentration
   in the central nervous system. The purpose of this study was to evaluate
   the effect of local cerebral ischaemia in the rat through the dosage of
   the glutamate and morphological findings, and to evaluate a possible
   protective erect of the ketoprofen to ischemic neurons. Thirty-six rats
   Wistar were divided into four groups. The first was a control group, the
   second a sham group and the animals of the third and fourth groups were
   submitted to induced cerebral ischaemia through selective obstruction of
   the middle cerebral artery during 15, 30 and 45 minutes. Animals of the
   fourth group were previously treated with ketoprofen 15 minutes before
   the ischaemia. The ischaemia was evaluated through the histopathological
   examination and through dosage of the extracellular glutamate in vitro.
   The histopathological examination showed that there was no difference
   between the animals of the control and of the sham groups. In the
   animals submitted to ischemia histopathological alterations appeared at
   30 minutes and become more intense at 45 minutes of ischaemia. The main
   findings were interstitial edema, chromatinic disorganization,
   vacuolization and nuclear desintegration. The animals treated with
   ketoprofen showed similar alterations, but they were less intense.
   Decrease in the dosage of glutamate in the parietal cortex of the
   animals submitted to ischaemia started at 30 minutes and became more
   intense at 45 minutes of ischaemia and was similar for animals
   previously treated or not with ketoprofen, indicating that this drug
   seems not to interfere with the metabolism of the glutamate at the
   synapses. The morphological findings in the parietal colter of the
   animals submitted to ischaemia. previously treated or not with
   ketoprofen, suggest that this drugs has neuroprotective effect.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the results of 24-h Hotter monitoring performed on
   healthy U.S. Air Force aircrew with asymptomatic ectopy on resting
   electrocardiograms (ECG). Methods: A historical review of the USAF
   Central ECG Library database was conducted on all Hotter studies
   completed for evaluation of ECG ectopy between 1 Jan 86 and 31 Dec 97.
   Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed to
   determine the association between ectopy and the aeromedical
   dispositions of aircrew evaluated for incidental ECC ectopy. Results:
   During this period, 147,571 resting ECGs were submitted to the
   Aeromedical Consultation Service (ACS) for interpretation. The mean age
   of the subjects was 35 yr (range 19 to 57 yr). There were 480 24-h
   Hotter studies performed for ECG ectopy. Of these, 49\% had normal or
   normal variant findings; another 11\% were found acceptable for flying
   after normal treadmill testing and echocardiography. ACS evaluation was
   required for the remaining 40\% of subjects. Overall, 4\% were
   permanently disqualified, and 17\% were lost to follow-up. Excluding
   subjects lost to follow-up, 95\% of aircrew were returned to flying
   status (with or without a waiver). Conclusions: When controlled for age,
   no significant difference of aeromedical outcome was seen when comparing
   supraventricular and ventricular ectopy. Of the subjects, 51\% had
   abnormal Hotter studies, but the vast majority were returned to flying.
   Results of this study provide information useful in further defining
   aircrew medical evaluation protocols for evaluation of asymptomatic ECC
   ectopy with Holter monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Five experiments demonstrate that context has a powerful effect on the
   ease with which people can name (Experiments 1-3) or categorize
   (Experiments 4-5) a stimulus while ignoring another stimulus, irrelevant
   or conflicting with the target. Selectivity of attention to the target
   dimension was gauged through Stroop and Garner effects. When the
   stimulus values along the target dimension and the to-be-ignored
   dimension were correlated over the experimental trials, large effects of
   Stroop and Garner influenced performance. However, when random
   allocation of values created zero dimensional correlation, the Stroop
   effects vanished. These results imply that when the nominally irrelevant
   dimension is in fact correlated with the relevant dimension,
   participants then attend to the irrelevant dimension and thus open
   themselves up to Stroop interference. Another variable of context, the
   relative salience of the constituent dimensions, also affected
   performance with the more discriminable dimension disrupting selective
   attention to the less discriminable dimension. The results demonstrate
   the importance of context in engendering the failure of selective
   attention and challenge traditional automaticity accounts of the Stroop
   effect.}},

Abstract = {{We use new models for present-day Pacific-North America motion to
   evaluate the tectonics of offshore regions west of the Californias.
   Vandenburg in coastal Alta California moves at the Pacific plate
   velocity within uncertainties (similar to1 mm/yr) after correcting for
   strain accumulation on the San Andreas and San Gregorio-Hosgri faults
   with a model that includes a viscoelastic lower crust. Modeled and
   measured velocities at coastal sites in Baja California south of the
   Agua Blanca fault, a region that most previous models consider Pacific
   plate, differ by 3-8 mm/yr, with coastal sites moving slower that the
   Pacific plate. We interpret these discrepancies in terms of strain
   accumulation on known on-shore faults, combined with right lateral slip
   at a rate of 3-4 mm/yr on additional faults offshore peninsular Baja
   California in the Pacific. Offshore seismicity, offset Quaternary
   features along the west coast of Baja California, and a discrepancy
   between the magnetically determined spreading rate in the Gulf Rise and
   the total plate rate from a geological model provide independent
   evidence for a ``Baja California shear zone.{''}.}},

Abstract = {{Stability and compressibility of several nonmolecular (polymeric) COP
   solids in structures analogous to those of SiO2 have been investigated
   with ab initio density-functional theory. Contrary to the recent,
   experimental reports of a ``superhard{''} high-pressure tridymite form
   of CO2, we find that metastable tetrahedrally bonded CO2 polymorphs,
   such as tridymite, cristobalite, and quartz, are relatively
   compressible, with bulk moduli K of only 1/2 to 1/3 of the reported
   experimental value. In addition, theory finds that the experimentally
   reported lattice parameters are not stable fur CO2 P2(1)2(1)2(1)
   tridymite. Finally, none of the calculated x-ray spectra of the fully
   relaxed structures of CO2 polymorphs obtained from theory agrees with
   the experiments. The significant discrepancy between experiments and
   density-functional theory suggests that further studies on nonmolecular
   CO2 solids are necessary, and that the assumptions that
   density-functional theory can describe these materials correctly, or
   that the framework of the new nonmolecular CO2 solids contains only CO4
   tetrahedra, must be re-examined.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the conditions under which plastic responses to density
   are adaptive in natural populations of Impatiens capensis and determined
   whether plasticity has evolved differently in different selective
   environments. Previous studies showed that a population that evolved in
   a sunny site exhibited greater plasticity in response to density than
   did a population that evolved in a woodland site. Using replicate inbred
   lines in a reciprocal transplant that included a density manipulation,
   we asked whether such population differentiation was consistent with the
   hypothesis of adaptive divergence. We hypothesized that plasticity would
   be more strongly favored in the sunny site than in the woodland site;
   consequently, we predicted that selection would be more strongly density
   dependent in the sunny site, favoring the phenotype that was expressed
   at each density. Selection on internode length and flowering date was
   consistent with the hypothesis of adaptive divergence in plasticity. Few
   costs or benefits of plasticity were detected independently from the
   expressed phenotype, so plasticity was selected primarily through
   selection on the phenotype. Correlations between phenotypes and their
   plasticity varied with the environment and would cause indirect
   selection on plasticity to be environment dependent. We showed that an
   appropriate plastic response even to a rare environment can greatly
   increase genotypic fitness when that environment is favorable. Selection
   on the measured characters contributed to local adaptation and fully
   accounted for fitness differences between populations in all treatments
   except the woodland site at natural density.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical model of a fractured basalt vadose zone has been developed

   pattern geometry and fracture connectivity within a single basalt Row of
   the Snake River Plain basalt affect water infiltration. The
   two-dimensional numerical model extends from the ground surface to a
   perched water body 20 m below and uses an unconventional
   quasi-deterministic approach with explicit but highly simplified
   representation of major fractures and other important hydrogeologic
   features. The model adequately reproduces the majority of the field
   observation and provides insights into the infiltration process that
   cannot be obtained by data collection alone, demonstrating its value as

Abstract = {{Background The purpose of this study was to evaluate an undernutrition
   risk score (URS) developed by the Dietetic Department of an acute
   tertiary referral hospital in Dublin with the aim that the URS could be
   used by nursing staff to identify surgical patients at risk of
   malnutrition on admission.
   Methods Forty surgical patients (16 males and 24 females) were
   recruited, within 5 days of admission. A standard objective nutritional
   assessment was carried out on each patient. This consisted of a 3-day
   diet history, anthropometric indices including: weight, armspan,
   mid-upper arm circumference, mid-arm muscle circumference and hand grip
   dynamometry. A nutrition risk index (NRI) screening tool was also used
   by a single observer to categorize patients as having low, moderate or
   severe risk of malnutrition. The indices used for the NRI were serum
   albumin and percentage weight loss. The URS assessed patients with
   respect to changes in weight and appetite, gut function and disease
   status and was completed by nursing staff by interview for each of the
   patients recruited.
   Results The URS was successful in detecting 71.4\% (n = 10) of surgical
   patients who were classified as being at some risk (moderate/severe) for
   undernutrition by the NRI. However, 11.8\% (n = 4) of the patients who
   were categorized by the NRI as being at moderate risk for undernutrition
   were classified as being at low risk by the nursing staff using the URS.
   The URS was found to be most sensitive in the detection of those at low
   or severe risk for undernutrition and least sensitive for those at
   moderate risk.
   Conclusion The undernutrition risk score in this study provided an
   accurate and consequently useful screening tool that could be used for
   surgical patients who are capable of feeding themselves independently.}},

Abstract = {{Topological optimization is used to systematically design mechanical

   problems are then solved using a method of moving asymptotes. The design
   domain is modelled as a plane-stress solid, and is actuated by harmonic
   excitation without the inclusion of damping. To model the actuator and
   workpiece, their stiffness is included and idealized as rod elements in
   the finite-element analysis. To show the capability of the design
   methodology, an elliptic amplifier and a magnification mechanism, used
   in a dot-matrix printer head, are reinvented using topological
   optimization. The dynamic effects on the optimum topology are also

Abstract = {{Objective: To explore long-term cardiac phenotype in transgenic (TG)
   mice with 300-fold overexpression of beta (2)-adrenergic receptors (AR).
   Methods: Echocardiography was performed serially on a cohort of
   wild-type and TG mice (n=26 each) between 4 and 15 months of age.
   Survival was monitored and autopsy and histological examinations were
   performed. Results: Heart rate was higher in TG than in wild-type mice
   throughout the study period. The left ventricular dimensions and
   fractional shortening were similar between TG and wild-type groups
   during 4-6 months. Starting at 9 months, however, TG mice showed
   progressive reduction in fractional shortening and systolic wall
   thickening, and increase in left ventricular dimensions and left
   ventricular mass, indicating onset of heart failure, left ventricular
   hypertrophy and remodeling. Abnormal waveforms in the electrocardigram
   and episodes of ventricular ectopic beats were also observed in TG mice.
   Death of TG mice started at 8.5 months, and the cumulative mortality was
   81\% by 15 months (P<0.0001 vs. 4\% in wild-type mice). The majority of
   deaths were due to severe heart failure, indicated by cardiac
   dilatation, lung congestion, pleural effusion and atrial thrombus. Left
   ventricular sections showed widespread interstitial fibrosis, loss of
   myocytes and myocyte hypertrophy in TG mice. Conclusions: A high level
   of <beta>(2)AR overexpression results in cardiomyopathy and heart
   failure. The onset was slower and the expression levels of receptors
   required are much higher than previously described for the beta (1)AR
   overexpression. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science BN. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Career work, a term coined by Dubois, is the process of determining what
   one's path through life will be, how that journey will be made, and how
   to manage the demands of one's life and work along the way. At each
   stage of career work, cultural, work, personal, and interpersonal value
   systems influence us.
   There are seven stages. Stage 1: Exploration includes a person's
   earliest dreams of ``what I want to be when I grow up{''} as well as the
   revisions since then.
   Stage 2: Personal assessment asks people to assess and understand their
   abilities, traits, interests, learning and work styles, work-environment
   preferences, and values.
   Stage 3: Analysis involves analyzing information and options from the
   personal assessment stage.
   Stage 4: Decision making prompts people to review career work goals and
   then to submit them to a decisionmaking process.
   Stage 5: Planning turns each goal into a career work project by writing
   a plan similar to a detailed project management plan.
   Stage 6: implementation or development is often referred to as ``working
   your plan.{''} The order of work depends on the complexity of each goal
   and the relationships among the goals.
   Stage 7: Life-work management is the stage in which people attempt to
   balance all of life's elements while they pursue remaining goals or cope
   with unanticipated challenges.
   In order for people to do their career work effectively, they must
   possess and appropriately use a variety of competencies, personal
   characteristics that underlie successful performance. Dubois lists and
   defines 20 competencies.
   The author also spells out ways in which leaders in organizations can
   better understand their employees' career work and take steps to help
   the process-for the benefit of the organization, its leaders, and
   employees.}},

Journal = {{PLANT PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{124}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1648-1657}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In contrast with other cells generated by the root apical meristem in
   Arabidopsis, pericycle cells adjacent to the protoxylem poles of the
   vascular cylinder continue to cycle without interruption during passage
   through the elongation and differentiation zones. However, only some of
   the dividing pericycle cells are committed to the asymmetric, formative
   divisions that give rise to lateral root primordia (LRPs). This was
   demonstrated by direct observation and mapping of mitotic figures,
   cell-length measurements, and the histochemical analysis of a cyclin-GUS
   fusion protein in pericycle cells. The estimated duration of a pericycle
   cell cycle in the root apical meristem was similar to the interval
   between cell displacement from the meristem and the initiation of LRP
   formation. Developmentally controlled LRP initiation occurs early, 3 to
   8 mm from the root tip. Thus the first growth control point in lateral
   root formation is defined by the initiation of primordia in stochastic
   patterns by cells passing through the elongation and young
   differentiation zones, up to where lateral roots begin to emerge from
   the primary root. Therefore, the first growth control point is not
   restricted to a narrow developmental window. We propose that late LRP
   initiation is developmentally unrelated to the root apical meristem and
   is operated by a second growth control point that can be activated by
   environmental cues. The observation that pericycle cells divide and
   lateral root primordia form without intervening mitotic quiescence
   suggests that lateral organ formation in roots and shoots might not be
   as fundamentally different as previously thought.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Vertebrate tissues use multiple junctional types to establish and
   maintain tissue architecture, including gap junctions for cytoplasmic
   connectivity and tight junctions (TJs) for paracellular and/or cell
   polarity barriers. The integral membrane proteins of gap junctions are
   connexins, whereas TJs are a complex between occludin and members of a
   recently characterized multigene family, the claudins. In normal brain,
   astrocytes are coupled by gap junctions composed primarily of connexin43
   (Cx43), whereas TJs have not been detected in these cells. We now show
   that treatment of primary human astrocytes with the cytokine
   interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) causes rapid induction of claudin-1, with
   an expression pattern reciprocal to loss of Cx43. Treatment also led to
   protracted downregulation of occludin but no change in expression of
   zonula occludens proteins ZO-1 and -2. Immunofluorescence staining
   localized claudin-1 to cell membranes in IL-1 beta -treated astrocytes,
   whereas freeze-fracture replicas showed strand-like arrays of
   intramembranous particles in treated cells resembling rudimentary TJ
   assemblies. We conclude that in human astrocytes, IL-1 beta regulates
   expression of the claudin multigene family and that gap and tight
   junction proteins are inversely regulated by this proinflammatory
   cytokine. We suggest that in pathological conditions of the human CNS,
   elevated IL-1 beta expression fundamentally alters
   astrocyte-to-astrocyte connectivity.}},

Abstract = {{The oxygen heterocyclic compounds (coumarins, psoralens and
   polymethoxylated flavones) present in the nonvolatile residue of the
   essential oils of Mandarin, Sweet Orange, Bitter Orange, Bergamot and
   Grapefruit were analysed with an HPLC/API/MS system equipped with an
   APcI probe in positive mode. The use of hyphenated techniques, such as
   LC/MS provides a great information about the content and nature of
   constituents of natural complex matrices, such as essential oils. In
   this work, MS spectra were recorded at different voltages, to obtain
   structural information in addition to molecular weight information. The
   different response of the compounds identified has been also evaluated.
   The method allowed the confirmation of the identification of the main
   components of the fraction, previously reported for the different oils.
   MS characteristics of coumarins, psoralens and polymethoxylated flavones
   with different substitution patterns were determined on the basis of the
   response obtained with the APcI interface. Interface parameters were
   optimised to obtain a contemporaneous response for all the three classes
   of components. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Memories of sex-atypical behavior and interests in childhood usually
   differ between homosexual and heterosexual people, However variation
   within these broad groups has not previously been explored in detail,
   especially among women. We utilized data from a postal survey of a
   nationwide sample of Australian adult twins (n = 4,901, age range: 19-52
   years). Among men, 15.2\% reported homosexual behavior (ever), 11.5\%
   said they had been sexually attracted to the same sex, and 6.4\% said
   they were not heterosexual; the corresponding figures for women were 79,
   10.6, and 3.5\%. A continuous measure of childhood gender nonconformity
   (CGN) was sensitive to slight variations in homosexual attraction and
   behavior In particular among both men and women who identified as
   heterosexual, there were significant differences between ``complete{''}
   heterosexuals and those who admitted to only one or a few same-sex
   behaviors but no homosexual attraction. Among men, CGN scores
   distinguished between heterosexuals who admitted to same-sex behavior
   only and those who admitted to some homosexual attraction. The sexual
   subgroups also differed on a measure of gender atypicality in adulthood.
   Implications for developmental theories of sexuality are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The following case report describes hereditary angioedema (HAE) in a
   juvenile male patient presenting with femoral fracture. The clincal
   characteristics, pathophysiological changes, diagnostics and management
   of anaesthesia for patients with hereditary angioedema will be
   discussed. Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant
   disorder, which is caused by congenital deficiency of functional
   C1-Inhibitor (C1-INH). Patients are suffering from episodic and painless
   edema of the skin (face and limbs) and mucous membranes of the
   respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts (the latter causing abdominal
   cramps due to edema of the intestine). Life-threatening airway
   obstruction may occur when patients develop laryngeal edema. It is
   important to differentiate HAE from the more frequent allergic
   angioedema because of differences in the pharmacological treatment of
   acute attacks of HAE. C1-INH-concentrate is effective in both treatment
   of acute attacks and prevention of edema, especially in children,
   juveniles and young women.}},

Abstract = {{Sedimentary microscopic charcoal in lacustrine environments has received
   much attention, although this has been concerned largely with the
   deposition of modern charcoal or with distributions through time based
   on single profiles. Lake sediments are dynamic entities, however, and
   the phenomenon of sediment focusing, for example, will lead to the
   redistribution of pollen, spores and charcoal. The process may not
   always result in greatly altered fossil assemblage in percentage terms,
   but values for individual indicators, or their absolute values, may be
   affected strongly. This is investigated using multiple microscopic
   charcoal profiles covering many thousands of years from Black Loch,
   Fife, eastern Scotland. Relative and absolute measures of charcoal
   depiction are considered as a prelude to discussion of microscopic
   charcoal taphonomy in the context of a small lake, fire ecology and
   human impacts. The charcoal measures (concentrations, influx and
   charcoal to pollen ratios) all follow similar patterns, though with very
   different numerical values. Two cores have charcoal influx values of
   similar orders of magnitude for much of the Holocene, whereas quantities
   in two other cores vary by a factor of similar to 16 after 1000 cal BP.
   The differences between influx measures for total pollen and charcoal
   indicate that focusing effects between the two indicators are
   dissimilar. Correlations with pollen and spore taxa are explored and
   demonstrate the problems of discrepant data between profiles.
   Charcoal-pollen patterns for specific cultural periods are examined for
   one profile and they provide data suggesting that a direct
   fire-vegetation relationship for the site is unproven. The need to adopt
   a multi-causal approach to inference is emphasised. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Title = {{On the symmetry of tsumcorite group minerals based on the new species
   rappoldite and zincgartrellite}},
Journal = {{MINERALOGICAL MAGAZINE}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1109-1126}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Rappoldite, the Go-analogue of helmutwinklerite, and zincgartrellite,
   the Zn-dominant analogue of gartrellite, are two new members of the
   tsumcorite group. Both minerals are triclinic, their structures are
   closely related to the parent structure, i.e. the `tsumcorite type'
   (C2/m, Z = 2). The lower symmetry is caused by two different
   crystal-chemical requirements. Order phenomena of the hydrogen bonds
   cause the `helmutwinklerite type' (PI, Z = 4), ordering of Cu2+ and Fe3+
   is responsible for the `gartrellite type' (P (1) over bar, Z = I).
   Rappoldite was found on samples from the Rappold mine near Schneeberg,
   Saxony, Germany. The new species forms red to red-brown prismatic and
   tabular crystals up to 1 mm long. D-calc. = 5.28 g/cm(3). 2V(z) =
   85(5)degrees, n(x) = 1.85 (calc.), n(y) = 1.87(2) and n(z) = 1.90(2);
   dispersion is distinct with r > v; orientation is Y similar to parallel
   to {[}(1) over bar 20] and X similar to parallel to c. The empirical
   formula derived from electron microprobe analyses is
   (Pb1.01Ca0.01)(Sigma1.02)(Co0.99Ni0.62Zn0.35Fe0.02)(Sigma1.98){[}(AsO4)(
   1.99)(SO4)(0.01)](Sigma2.00){[}(OH)(0.02)(H2O)(1.98)](Sigma2.00) or
   Pb(Co,Ni)(2)(AsO4)(2). 2H(2)O. Single-crystal X-ray studies showed
   average C2/m symmetry. Weak superstructure reflections are responsible
   for triclinic symmetry and enlarged cell metrics (refined from powder
   data): a = 11.190(2) Angstrom, b = 10.548(2) Angstrom, c = 7.593(1)
   Angstrom, alpha = 100.38(1)degrees beta = 109.59(2)degrees gamma =
   98.96(1)degrees, V = 807.6 Angstrom (3), Z = 4. The superstructure
   results from the hydrogen-bond scheme, but faint streaks indicate some
   disorder. All investigated rappoldite crystals are twinned by reflection
   on (2 (3) over bar0) which corresponds to the mirror plane of the
   average C2/m cell. Helmutwinklerite is isotypic with rappoldite and
   probably also with pure thometzekite; sulphatian thometzekite is
   monoclinic.
   Zincgartrellite forms green-yellow rosette-like aggregates on samples
   from the Tsumeb mine, Namibia. The D-calc. = 5.30 g/cm(3). 2V(x) =
   87(5)degrees, n(x) = 1.91(2), n(y) = 1.94 (calc.) and n(z) = 1.97(2).
   Electron-microprobe analyses and Mossbauer data yielded the empirical
   formula
   (Pb0.97Ca0.04)(Sigma1.01)(Zn0.91Cu0.51Fe0.59Al0.03)(Sigma2.04){[}(AsO4)(
   1.96)(SO4)(0.01)](Sigma1.97){[}(OH)(0.81)(H2O)(1.31)](Sigma2.12) or
   Pb(Zn,Fe,Cu)(2)(AsO4)(2)(H2O,OH)(2). The structural formula is
   Pb(ZnxFe1-x)(ZnxCu1-x(AsO4)(2)(OH)(1-x) (H2O)(1+x) With 0.4 < x < 0.8.
   Gartrellite is defined by x < 0.4. Helmutwinklerite has x near to 1 and
   is defined by a cell with fourfold volume. Single-crystal X-ray studies
   of zincgartrellite proved space group P<(1)over bar> caused by ordering
   of Fe3+ and Cu at one atomic site. Cell parameters (refined from powder
   data): a = 5.550(1) Angstrom, b = 5.620(1) Angstrom, c = 7.621(1)
   Angstrom, alpha = 68.59(1), beta = 69.17(1), gamma = 69.51(1)degrees, V

Abstract = {{Objective: To estimate the 16-week prevalence of Down syndrome in the
   United States from 1974 to 1997 and to determine the efficacy of
   maternal age cutoffs and triple screens for detecting it antenatally.
   Methods: Using natality statistics for the United States from 1974 to
   1997 of maternal-age-specific live births to women 13-49 years old, we
   evaluated advanced maternal age (35-49 years at delivery) and the triple
   serum test (maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein, hCG, and unconjugated
   estriol) as screening tests for Down syndrome. Efficacy was evaluated
   using sensitivity, false-positive rate, positive predictive value, and
   likelihood ratio (likelihood ratio = sensitivity/false-positive rate).
   Results: In 1974, the estimated second-trimester prevalence of Down
   syndrome was one in 740, but by 1997 that had increased to one in 504.
   The proportion of Down syndrome fetuses at 16 weeks' gestation in women
   35-49 years old increased from 28.5\% in 1974 to 47.3\% in 1997.
   However, live births to women 35-49 years old increased more rapidly
   from 4.7\% in 1974 to 12.6\% in 1997. The likelihood ratio for maternal
   age to identify an affected pregnancy decreased during the study period
   and was substantially lower than that using the serum test.
   Conclusion: A maternal age cutoff of 35 years in the 1990s resulted in
   high false-positive rates and was less efficacious based on likelihood
   ratio and positive predictive value. Serum testing of all pregnant women
   would reduce the number of amniocenteses and decrease procedure-related
   losses. (Obstet Gynecol 2000;96:979-85. (C) 2000 by The American College

Abstract = {{Although automobile refueling represents the major source of benzene
   exposure among the non-smoking public, few data are available regarding
   such exposures and the associated uptake of benzene. We repeatedly
   measured benzene exposure and uptake (via benzene in exhaled breath)
   among 39 self-service customers using self-administered monitoring, a
   technique rarely used to obtain measurements from the general public
   (130 sets of measurements were obtained). Benzene exposures averaged 2.9
   mg/m(3) (SD = 5.8 mg/m(3); median duration = 3 min) with a range of <
   0.076-36 mg/m(3), and postexposure breath levels averaged 160 <mu>g/m(3)
   (SD = 260 mug/m(3)) with a range of < 3.2-1,400 <mu>g/m(3).
   Log-transformed exposures and breath levels were significantly
   correlated (r = 0.77, p < 0.0001). We used mixed-effects statistical
   models to gauge the relative influences of environmental and
   subject-specific factors on benzene exposure and breath levels and to
   investigate the importance of various covariates obtained by
   questionnaire. Model fitting yielded three significant predictors of
   benzene exposure, namely, fuel octane grade (p = 0.0011), duration of
   exposure (p = 0.0054), and season of the year (p = 0.032). Likewise,
   another model yielded three significant predictors of benzene
   concentration in breath, specifically, benzene exposure (p = 0.0001),
   preexposure breath concentration (p = 0.0008), and duration of exposure
   (p = 0.038). Variability in benzene concentrations was remarkable, with
   95\% of the estimated values falling within a 274-fold range, and was
   comprised entirely of the within-person component of variance
   (representing exposures of the same subject at different times of
   refueling). The corresponding range for benzene concentrations in breath
   was 41-fold and was comprised primarily of the within-person variance
   component (74\% of the total variance). Our results indicate that
   environmental rather than interindividual differences are primarily
   responsible for benzene exposure and uptake during automobile refueling.
   The study also demonstrates that self-administered monitoring can be
   efficiently used to measure environmental exposures and biomarkers among
   the general public.}},

Abstract = {{The past participle in 13th century Italian is interestingly different
   from its modern equivalent in a number of ways: the medieval absolute
   participle clauses could be formed out of predicate types that are more
   or less excluded from the equivalent modern construction, above all
   unergatives but also verbs like stare `stay'/'remain,' and the absolute
   participle could be of both active and passive voice. Moreover, the 13th
   century participle clause allowed for considerable variation in word
   order, whereas participial agreement was highly regular. These
   differences in interpretation(especially those related to voice), word
   order and agrement extend to complex construction involving a past
   participle, above all the sequence have + participle + object. It
   appears that such constructions were ambiguous between a resultative
   reading and a past tense reading. The semantics of the past participle
   morto `dead' deserves particular attention because, in certain aspectual
   contexts, it takes on the meaning of ucciso `killed.' As for the present
   participle, 13th century Italian seems to be closer to modern use: we
   have only a few sure examples of a truly verbal use of the present
   participle, and its adverbial uses are essentially limited to fixed
   expressions.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Mechanisms regulating the expression of angiogenic factors
   in tu mor cells are largely unknown. High expression of the neurotrophin

   Procedure. To investigate the biological effects of TrkA and TrkB
   expression on angiogenesis in NE, we examined the expression of
   angiogenic factors in the human NE cell line SY5Y and its TrkA and TrkB
   transfectants. Results. In comparison to parental SY5Y cells, mRNA and
   protein levels of angiogenic factors were significantly reduced in
   SY5Y-TrkA cells, whereas SY5Y-TrkB cells did not demonstrate a
   significant change. Conditioned medium (CM) of parental SY5Y and
   SY5Y-TrkB cells induced endothelial cell proliferation, but this effect
   was completely absent in SY5Y-TrkA cells. TrkA expression also resulted
   in severely impaired tumorigenicity in a mouse xenograft model, and was
   associated with reduced angiogenic factor expression and less
   vascularization of tumors, as determined by immunohistochemistry and an
   in vivo Matrigel assay. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Graft copolymerization of ethyl acrylate on starch and methyl

   concentrations of eerie ion initiator in agueous media at 29 degreesC.
   The dependence of the extent of graft polymer formation (graft
   level,molecular weight and number of grafted chains per anhydroglucose
   unit suggests that termination of graft copolymerization occurs mainly
   by reactions of eerie ion with growing graft chains. The extent of the
   chain transfer constant was found to be 9.43 x 10(-5) for poly (ethyl
   acrylate) and 5.67 x 10(5) for poly (methyl methacrylate), indicating in
   the former that the product of the transfer reaction takes no further
   part in the polymerization and in the latter the extent of termination
   reaction by eerie ion as well as interchain propagation involving eerie
   ion. The influence of polarity and solubility of the monomers in the
   medium as well as the degree of graftability of the substrates are
   suggested to be responsible for the differences in the extent of graft

Abstract = {{Migration of nitrate to groundwater has become a serious threat in many

   laboratory tests studying the nitrate gradient developed in response to
   an electrical potential. Two systems were tested; the first had no flow

   electrical current, A solution of sodium nitrate in sandy soil was used
   in both systems. The tests showed that the electro-kinetic process
   effectively concentrated and retained nitrate close to the anode, The
   movement of NO; through the soil column was significantly influenced by
   the development of a pH gradient. Statistical analysis was performed to
   determine best-fit equations relating the nitrate gradient to the
   electrical input and pH gradient, A simple one-dimensional finite
   difference model was used to predict the pH gradient developed during
   the electro-kinetic process. The experimental measurements closely
   agreed with the predicted spatial and temporal distribution of the
   nitrate gradient for both closed and open system configurations. (C)

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Several importance measures are identified for possible use in the
   performance assessment of a high-level nuclear waste repository. These
   importance measures are based on concepts of importance used in system
   reliability analysis, but the concepts are modified and adapted to the
   special characteristics of the repository and similar passive systems.
   In particular, the importance measures proposed here are based on risk
   (in comparison to traditional importance measures which are based on
   frequency of failure) and are intended to be more suitable to systems
   comprised of components whose behavior is most easily and naturally
   represented as continuous, rather than binary. These importance measures
   appear to be able to evaluate systems comprised of both
   continuous-behavior and binary-behavior components. Three separate
   examples are provided to illustrate the concepts and behavior of these
   importance measures. The first example demonstrates various formulations
   for the importance measures and their implementation for a simple
   radiation safety system comprised of a radiation source and three
   shields. The second example demonstrates use of these importance
   measures for a system comprised of components modeled with binary
   behavior and components modeled with continuous behavior. The third
   example investigates the use of these importance measures for a proposed
   repository system, using a total system model and code currently under
   development. Currently, these concepts and formulations of importance
   are undergoing further evaluation for a repository system to determine
   to what degree they provide useful insights and to determine which
   formulations are most useful. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Cerebral hemorrhages are subject to a heavy short- and long-term case
   fatality. A study of prognostic factors and of relative survival based
   on the data of a population registry is of great value to study patients
   having a hematoma of all ages, irrespective of the method of care. We
   have listed 183 patients having a cerebral hemorrhage between 1 January
   1985 and 31 December 1996 and living in the city of Dijon, France.
   Eighteen clinical and CT-scanning variables have been studied. We have
   found four predictive factors of death at one month from cerebral
   hemorrhages. These are, in decreasing order: the existence of
   consciousness disorders at the initial clinical examination (OR = 5.80 p
   < 0.0001); an intraventricular hemorrhage (OR = 5.60, p < 0.0001); a
   hematoma volume over If; cubic centimeters (OR = 3.53, p = 0.027);
   lastly, in male patients an age over 70 years (OR = 4.90, p = 0.039).
   With regard to long-term survival, the existence of consciousness
   disorders remains the principal predictive factor of case fatality in
   both crude and relative survival (OR = 5.52, p < 0.0001, in crude
   survival versus OR = 22.2 in relative survival, p < 0.0001) followed by
   age over 70 years (OR = 3.71, p < 0.0001 in crude survival and OR = 2.41
   in relative survival, p = 0.086). The existence of consciousness
   disorders at the initial examination following a cerebral hemorrhage
   would seem to be the principal worst prognostic factor of short- and
   long-term survival and of relative survival, age and sex having less

Abstract = {{Lakes are ideal in defining the processes that govern the behavior of
   heavy metals in sediments: they are closed systems with well-known
   characteristics (input, outputs) and contain a memory for dynamic bottom
   processes (erosion, accumulation, and transportation). Lakes integrate
   and represent environmental conditions, in contrast with the wide
   variability in the water column and in open marine systems.
   Lake Mariute is one of four shallow, brackish-water lakes adjoining the
   Mediterranean coast near Alexandria, Egypt. Eleven bottom-sediment
   samples were collected from different sites within Lake Mariute. Flame
   Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS) was used to determine Co, Cu, Pb,
   Fe, Ni, and Zn concentrations in sediments and X-ray diffraction was
   used to determine carbonate-and clay-mineral percentages in analyzed
   samples.
   The carbonate minerals observed in this study are low- magnesian calcite
   and aragonite. The clay minerals observed in this study - smectite and
   illite were-identified by their characteristic basal X- ray diffraction
   maxima, i. e. ``peaks{''} or ``reflections.{''}
   Low - magnesium calcite and aragonite are common carbonate minerals in
   modem environments and reflect the choice of most skeletal organisms in
   tropical seas for their hard parts. The occurrence of both low-magnesium
   calcite and aragonite and the absence of high-magnesium calcite indicate
   a slight influx of fresh, vadose or vadose- phreatic water. The
   diagenetic removal of magnesium from high-magnesium calcite, thereby
   generating low-magnesium calcite, may explain the complete absence of
   high-magnesium calcite in the analyzed samples.
   The distribution of trace elements in the sediments, e.g., Co, Fe, Cu,
   and Pb is related to the carbonate mineralogy. This helps in the
   interpretation of the diagenetic history of the deposits, which have
   been studied from both mineralogical and geochemical perspectives and
   which suggest possible mechanisms for the various diagenetic changes.
   Trace-metal concentrations found at different sampling sites vary
   greatly from one site to another. The bottom sediments of Lake Mariute
   contain heavy metals in concentrations, which exceed United States
   Environmental Protection Agency criteria for contaminated lake water and
   sediments,
   Radioactive dating analysis shows that two of the eleven stations have a
   detectable component of cesium 137 particles, indicating that some of
   the sediment was deposited after 1950.}},

Abstract = {{In the avian hindbrain, the loss of premigratory neural crest cells from
   rhombomeres 3 and 5 (r3, r5) through programmed cell death contributes
   to the patterning of emigrant crest cells into three discrete streams.
   Programmed cell death is induced by the upregulation of Bmp4 and Msx2 in
   r3 and r5. We show that cSFRP2, a WNT antagonist, is expressed in the
   even-numbered rhombomeres and that over-expression of cSfrp2 inhibits
   Bmp4 expression in r3 and r5, preventing programmed cell death. By
   contrast, depleting cSFRP2 function in r4 results in elevated levels of
   Msx2 expression and ectopic programmed cell death, as does
   overexpression of Wnt1. We propose that programmed cell death in the
   rhombencephalic neural crest is modulated by pre-patterned cSfrp2
   expression and a WNT-BMP signalling loop.}},

Abstract = {{Proper evaluation of the neurogenic bladder remains the cornerstone for
   accurate management of the neurologically impaired patient. Due to the
   inherent progressive nature of many neurologic disorders causing bladder
   dysfunction and lack of targeted medical therapy, much work has been
   done and needs to be done to advance the management of this
   often-difficult patient population. This article reviews the latest
   advances in managing the neurogenic bladder. For ease of review, the
   neurogenic bladder can be divided into 2 basic categories: first,
   bladders that fail to empty successfully and, second, those that fail to
   store urine adequately. Therapy should be based on these categories
   because poor therapeutic results are seen when a standard treatment is
   prescribed for the wrong bladder condition. Given the success of other
   specialties (physical medicine and rehabilitation, orthopedics, and
   neurology) at improving and prolonging the lives of the neurologically
   impaired patient, the urologist has an increasing responsibility to
   evaluate and treat the neurogenic bladder effectively over a life span
   that is approaching that of the normal population. UROLOGY 56 (Suppl

Abstract = {{A convenience sample of 13 adolescents who had undergone epilepsy
   surgery and their mothers reported their perceptions of change in areas
   affecting quality of life (physical, affect/behavior, social,
   cognition/academics, and family). A mixed method approach was used, with
   self-report and maternal-report narratives (qualitative measures), as
   well as neuropsychological profiles (quantitative measures). The results
   demonstrate that change after epilepsy surgery is multifaceted, and that
   adolescent and maternal perceptions are notably different. Whereas most
   adolescents experienced positive changes, mothers simultaneously
   reported many more negative changes along with positive changes.
   Furthermore, mothers frequently described aspects of their adolescent's
   life that continued to be of concern, whereas adolescents did not. The
   findings strongly suggest that the processes involved in postsurgical
   adjustment are complex. The development of a theoretical model is
   essential to help build an understanding of factors that contribute to
   positive and negative outcomes. c 2000 Academic Press}},

Abstract = {{The detection of reaction-times (RTs) to a target Kanizsa-type square
   (an illusory square defined by the collinear arrangement of 90 degrees
   corner junctions) within a matrix of distracter junctions are expedited
   when the target display is preceded by a 40-Hz flickering display of
   premask crosses presented prior to, and at the locations subsequently
   occupied by the junctions of the target display. Priming effects were
   obtained when four crosses (which together matched the Gestalt
   arrangement of the target) were presented at the display locations
   subsequently occupied by the junctions forming the target Kanizsa square
   (Elliott and Muller, 1998; Elliott and Muller, 2000). The present study
   was conducted with the aim of replicating the 40-Hz RT priming effects,
   while simultaneously recording the observers EEG in order to establish
   the presence and location of Gestalt priming in the brain. The
   statistical pattern obtained in the RT data corresponded well with
   previous studies and was matched by the pattern of target P300 latencies
   across bilateral central and posterior electrodes. Planned analyses
   focused upon the evoked 40-Hz activity that co-occurs with the P300,
   revealing a more specific pattern of 40-Hz priming over the visual
   cortex. A subsequent series of cross-correlational analyses examined the
   cortical distribution and timing of Gestalt-prime generation during and
   subsequent to premask-display presentation. Correlations were revealed
   between stimulus related 40-Hz activity over a range of cortical loci,
   including the right temporal lobe, which is considered important for
   figure coding. Taken together, these findings not only support the role
   of a distributed 40-Hz mechanism during Gestalt-figure priming, but also
   suggest that patterns of oscillatory brain activity may be directly
   influenced by, and interpretable in terms of equivalent temporal
   patterns of stimulus activity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Millimeter and submillimeter-wave observations provide important
   information for the studies of atmospheric chemistry and astrochemistry
   (molecular clouds, stars formation, galactic study, comets and
   cosmology). But, these observations depend strongly on instrumentation
   techniques and on the site quality. New techniques or higher detector
   performances result in unprecedented observations and, sometimes, the
   observational needs drive developments of new detector technologies, for
   example, superconducting junctions (SIS mixers) because of their high
   sensitivity in heterodyne detection in the millimeter and submillimeter
   wave range (100-700 GHz), HEB (Hot Electron Bolometer) mixers which are
   being developed by several groups for application in THz observations.
   For the submillimetre wavelengths heterodyne receivers, the local
   oscillator (LO) is still a critical element. So far, solid state
   fundamental sources are often not powerful enough for most of the
   applications at millimetre or submillimetre wavelengths: large efforts
   using new planar components (HBV) and integrated circuits, or new
   technics (laser mixing) are now in progress, in a few groups.
   The new large projects as SOFIA, FIRST, ALMA,... for astronomy; SMILES,
   EOS-MLSI... for aeronomy and other projects for the planetary science
   (ROSETTA, Mars Explorer,...), will benefit of the new developments. (C)

Abstract = {{Pain is a serious secondary problem for many persons with cerebral palsy
   (CP). Cognitive-behavioral models of pain hypothesize that how patients
   cope with painful episodes plays an important role in their adjustment
   to chronic pain. The utility of this model, however, has never been
   tested in persons with CP-related pain. Fifty adults with CP and chronic
   pain were interviewed to assess pain experience, the interference of
   pain on activities (BPI), depressive symptoms (CES-D), and coping
   strategies used for the pain (CSQ and CPCI). The results indicated that
   pain-contingent rest and catastrophizing were both significantly
   associated with pain interference and depressive symptoms even when
   controlling for pain severity. These findings support a
   cognitive-behavioral model of chronic pain as it might be applied to
   persons with CP. The results also support the need for research to
   determine if, and to what extent, cognitive-behavioral interventions
   that provide training in specific coping responses reduce depressive
   symptoms and pain interference in persons with CP. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Ground water at the Norman Landfill Research Site is contaminated by a
   leachate plume emanating from a closed, unlined landfill formerly
   operated by the city of Norman, Oklahoma. Ground water contaminated by
   the leachate plume is known to be elevated in the concentration of many
   organic and inorganic constituents. Specific conductance, alkalinity,
   chloride, dissolved organic carbon. boron, sodium, strontium, and
   deuterium in ground water are considered to be indicators of the
   leachate plume at this site. Leaf samples of broad-leafed cottonwood,
   Populus deltoides, were collected from 57 sites around the closed
   landfill. Cottonwood, a phreatophyte or ``well plant,{''} functions as a
   surrogate well and serves as a ground water quality sampler The leaf
   samples were combusted to ash and analyzed by instrumental neutron
   activation for 35 elements and by prompt-gamma instrumental neutron
   activation for boron. A monitoring well was located within a few meters
   of a sampled cottonwood tree at 15 of the 57 sites, and ground water
   samples were collected from these monitoring wells simultaneously with a
   leaf sample. The chemical analyses of the ground mater and leaf samples
   from these 15 sites indicated that boron, bromine. sodium, and strontium
   concentrations in leaves were significantly correlated with
   leachate-indicator constituents in ground water. A point-plot map of
   selected percentiles indicated high concentrations of boron, bromine,
   and sodium in leaf ash from sites downgradient of the most recent
   landfill and from older landfills nearby
   Data from leaf analysis greatly extended the known areal extent of the
   leachate plume previously determined from a network of monitoring wells
   and geophysical surveys. This phyto-geochemical study provided a
   cost-effective method for assessing the extent of a leachate plume from
   an old landfill. Such a method may be useful as a preliminary sampling
   tool to guide the design of hydrogeochemical and geophysical studies.}},

Abstract = {{We provide a diagnosis for the Liolaemus elongatus group which currently
   includes six species (including the species described herein) of
   midsized, long-tailed, primarily saxicolous lizards. Most of these

   where they principally occur at elevations above 1000 m. Here we
   describe Liolaemus heliodermis, a new species belonging to this group
   from the region where the Cumbres Calchaquies and the Sierra del
   Aconquija mountain ranges converge in northwestern Tucuman Province. The
   new species differs from all other members of the elongatus group in
   several meristic characters and in the distinct coloration of the males:
   black heads with vibrant yellow torsos. Liolaemus heliodermis is the
   most northerly distributed member of the elongatus group and is the only
   member of the group known to occur in Tucuman Province. Preliminary data

Abstract = {{This paper both describes and discusses landslides and other ground
   effects induced by the September-October 1997 seismic sequence? which
   struck the Umbria and Marche regions (Central Italy). Three main events
   occurred on 26 September at 00:33 and 09:40 GMT and 14 October with
   magnitude M-w equal to 5.8, 6.0 and 5.4, respectively; furthermore
   hundreds of minor but significant events were also recorded. The authors
   examined an area of some 700 km(2) around the epicentre (Colfiorito).
   Primary and secondary effects were observed, including surface faulting
   phenomena. landslides, ground fractures, compaction and various
   hydrological phenomena. Surface evidence of faulting reactivation was
   found along the well-known capable faults, to a total length of ca. 30
   km. Landslides, which were the most recurrent among the phenomena
   induced, consisted mainly of rock falls and subordinately of rotational
   and translational slides, which were generally mobilised by the inertia
   forces during the seismic motion. The percentage of reactivated old
   landslides decreased as the distance from the epicentral zone increased;
   a similar decrease had been observed for the 1980 Irpinia earthquake
   (Southern Italy). The ground fracture distribution was consistent with
   the regional structural setting and the general pattern of macroseismic
   field. Numerous episodes of hydrological changes were observed within
   the most severely damaged area. All this evidence confirms the relevance
   of the study of ground surface effects for achieving a more complete
   evaluation of seismic hazard. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In order to evaluate the role of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia
   pneumoniae in reactive airway disease, 71 children aged 2-14 yrs with an
   acute episode of wheezing and 80 age-matched healthy children were
   studied.
   Sera for the determination of specific antibody levels and
   nasopharyngeal aspirates for the detection of M. pneumoniae and C.
   pneumoniae deoxyribonucleic acid were obtained on admission and after
   4-6 weeks. All children with wheezing received a standard therapy with
   inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators for 5-7 days; when
   antibiotic was added on the basis of the judgment of the paediatrician
   in charge, clarithromycin 15 mg . kg body weight(-1). day for 10 days
   was used.
   Acute M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae infections were detected
   significantly more often in children with wheezing than in controls. In
   patients infected with one of the two pathogens, a history of recurrent
   wheezing was significantly more frequent than in those without either
   infection. During a 3-month follow-up period, among
   nonantibiotic-treated children, those with acute M. pneumoniae and/or C.
   pneumoniae infection showed a significantly higher recurrence of
   wheezing than those without acute M. pneumoniae and/or C. pneumoniae
   infection (p=0.03).
   These results highlight the apparently significant relationship of
   Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae with wheezing in
   children, particularly in subjects with a history of recurrent episodes,
   and the possible improvement in the course of reactive airway disease
   within paediatric patients with acute Mycoplasma pneumoniae and/or

Abstract = {{The hyaluronic acid binding serine protease (PHBSP), an enzyme with the
   ability to activate the coagulation factor FVII and the plasminogen
   activator precursors and to inactivate factor VIII and factor V, could
   be isolated from human plasma in the presence of 6 M urea as a
   single-chain zymogen, whereas under native conditions only its activated
   two-chain form was obtained. The total yield of proenzyme (proPHBSP) was
   5-6 mg/l, corresponding to a concentration of at least 80-100 nM in
   plasma. Upon removal of urea, even in the absence of charged surfaces a
   rapid development of amidolytic activity was observed that correlated
   with the appearance of the two-chain enzyme. The highest activation rate
   was observed at pH 6. ProPHBSP processing was concentration-dependent
   following a second order kinetic and was accelerated by catalytic
   amounts of active PHBSP, indicating an intermolecular autocatalytic
   activation. Charged macromolecules like poly-L-lysine, heparin, and
   dextran sulfate strongly accelerated the autoactivation, suggesting that
   in vivo proPHBSP activation might be a surface-bound process. The
   intrinsic activity of the proenzyme was determined to be 0.25-0.3\%,
   most likely due to traces of PHBSP. The presence of physiological
   concentrations of known plasma inhibitors of PHBSP, like alpha (2)
   antiplasmin and C1 esterase inhibitor, but not antithrombin III/heparin,
   slowed down zymogen processing. Our in vitro data suggest that the
   autoactivation of proPHBSP during plasma fractionation is induced by the
   removal of inhibitors of PHBSP and is accelerated by charged surfaces of
   the chromatographic resins.}},

Abstract = {{The aptitude for symbolization, characteristic of man, is revealed not
   only in artistic representations and funerary practices. It is exhibited
   by every manifestation of human activity or representation of natural
   phenomena that assumes or refers to a meaning. We can recognize
   functional symbolism (tool-making, habitative or food technology),
   social symbolism, (language and social communication) and spiritual
   symbolism (funerary practices and artistic expressions). On, the basis
   of these concepts, research into symbolism in prehistoric man allows us
   to recognize forms of symbolism already in the manifestations of the
   most ancient humans, starting with Homo habilis (or rudolfensis).
   Toolmaking, social organization and organization of the territory are
   oriented toward survival and the life of the family group. They attest
   to symbolic behaviors and constitute symbolic systems by means of which
   man expresses himself: lives and transmits his symbolic world. The
   diverse forms of symbolism are discussed with reference to the different

Abstract = {{This article traces attempts to regulate dress during the French
   Revolution. It places them within a broader policy on consumption shaped
   by two contradictory notions: that consumers had a right to freedom of
   choice, and that goods had formative and didactic qualities - that is,
   that what you owned shaped what you were, and therefore consumers'
   purchases should be regulated for the good of society. The article
   traces the roots of these ideas to the eighteenth-century `luxury
   debate', and shows how the Revolution's failure to regulate dress
   discredited the notion of the formative power of goods and allowed
   modern freedom of choice.}},

Abstract = {{To assess the role of angiotensin II in the sensitivity of the
   baroreflex control of heart rate (HR) in normotensive rats (N = 6) and
   chronically hypertensive rats (IK1C, 2 months, N = 7), reflex changes of
   HR were evaluated before and after (15 min) the administration of a
   selective angiotensin II receptor antagonist (losartan, 10 mg/kg, iv).
   Baseline values of mean arterial pressure (MAP) were higher in
   hypertensive rats (195 +/- 6 mmHg) than in normotensive rats (110 +/- 2
   mmHg). Losartan administration promoted a decrease in MAP only in
   hypertensive rats (16\%), with no changes in HR. During the control
   period, the sensitivity of the bradycardic and tachycardic responses to
   acute MAP changes were depressed in hypertensive rats (similar to 70\%
   and similar to 65\%, respectively) and remained unchanged after losartan
   administration. Plasma renin activity was similar in the two groups, The
   present study demonstrates that acute blockade of AT1 receptors with
   losartan lowers the MAP in chronic renal hypertensive rats without
   reversal of baroreflex hyposensitivity, suggesting that the impairment
   of baroreflex control of HR is not dependent on an increased angiotensin
   II level.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to review the extended experience of a single
   maternal-fetal medicine practice with delayed-interval delivery.
   STUDY DESIGN: We completed a retrospective review of our maternal-fetal
   medicine practice database from January 1991 through March 1999.
   Patients were derived from both primary and consultative practices. All
   patients were managed with tocolysis, antibiotics, and cerclage after
   delivery of the first fetus(es). Retained siblings were investigated by
   amniocentesis to exclude intra-amniotic infection.
   RESULTS: Twenty-four consecutive patients had attempted delayed-interval
   delivery. Exclusion criteria for delayed-interval delivery included
   monochorionicity, abruptio placentae, severe preeclampsia, and the need
   for hysterotomy The mean latency interval was 36 days, with a range of 3
   to 123 days. Additionally, patients with previous cerclage(s) had
   significantly shorter mean latency intervals than patients without
   previous cerclage(s). Patients with long latency intervals (greater than
   or equal to 49 days) had earlier births of the first fetus.
   CONCLUSION: Selected multichorionic pregnancies may benefit from
   delayed-interval delivery. Patients with previous cervical cerclage(s)
   during the index pregnancy are less likely to achieve significant
   latency intervals. Even modest intervals between births of siblings at
   critical gestational ages can improve neonatal survival and decrease
   neonatal morbidity.}},

   This paper shows that whenever the parties to an organization can

   can be greatly reduced. Moreover, it might not be possible to prevent
   collusion and renegotiation in equilibrium. Indeed, if collusion is
   observable but not verifiable, then the organization's optimal incentive
   scheme will always be renegotiated. If, instead, collusion is not
   observable to the principal, both collusion and renegotiation will occur
   in equilibrium with positive probability. The occurrence of collusion
   and renegotiation should therefore not be taken as evidence of the

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{6187-6196}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The present paper proposes an approach to obtaining the activation
   energy distribution for chemisorption of oxygen onto carbon surfaces,
   while simultaneously allowing for the activation energy dependence of
   the pre-exponential factor of the rate constant. Prior studies in this
   area have considered this factor to be uniform, thereby biasing
   estimated distributions. The results show that the derived activation
   energy distribution is not sensitive to the chemisorption mechanism
   because of the step function like property of the coverage. The
   activation energy distribution is essentially uniform for some carbons,
   and has two or possibly more discrete stages, suggestive of at least two
   types of sites, each with its own uniform distribution. The
   pre-exponential factors of the reactions are determined directly from
   the experimental data, and are found not to be constant as assumed in
   earlier work, but correlated with the activation energy. The latter
   results empirically follow an exponential function, supporting some
   earlier statistical and experimental work. The activation energy
   distribution obtained in the present paper permits improved correlation
   of chemisorption data in comparison to earlier studies. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The pounder for dynamic compaction is conventionally built to have a

   improve the efficiency of dynamic compaction has been investigated, and
   the results are presented in this paper. Both a conical-based pounder
   and a hat-based pounder were used in an extensive programme of
   laboratory dynamic compaction tests. An air pluviation technique was
   used to prepare dry sand specimens, 60 cm in diameter and 50 cm high, to
   have initial relative densities of 30\% and 40\%. Wet sand specimens
   with an initial relative density of 60\% were prepared from the dry sand
   specimens. A total of 14 dynamic compaction tests were performed. The
   results of each test include dimensions of the crater, heave around the
   crater, and cone penetration resistance at 13 penetration locations. It
   is found from the test results that the efficiency of dynamic
   compaction,vith the conical-based pounder depends on both the grain size
   characteristics and the volume change behaviour of the sand. The
   conical-based pounder is more effective in the Mai-Liao fine sand,vith

Abstract = {{The involvement of nitric oxide (NO) in macrophage (M phi) fungicidal

   between the length of time in culture and virulence of S. schenckii,
   conidia isolated from 12-day mycelial cultures (Ss-12) were less
   virulent to mice than conidia from 7-day cultures (Ss-7) or yeast cells.
   Indicative of NO production, infected animals showed a significant
   increase in serum levels of nitrite that was lower in mice infected with
   Ss-12 than in mice infected with Ss-7 or yeast. Stimulation of murine M
   phi with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) induced NO production and
   inhibition of fungal growth. The cytotoxic activity of M phi against
   Ss-12 was significantly greater than against Ss-7 or yeast cells, the
   highly virulent fungal forms. The addition of NO synthase inhibitors
   abrogated M phi cytotoxic activity against all fungal forms. The
   phagocytic activity of M phi against Ss-7 was significantly lower than
   against Ss-12 or yeast cells. Although the ingestion of fungal cells
   triggered the oxidative burst in M phi, the fungicidal activity was not
   altered in the presence of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase. In
   addition, Ss-12 and yeast cells were more susceptible than Ss-7 to the
   direct fungicidal activity of the NO donors
   S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (SNAP), S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO)
   and 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1). The results of this study indicate
   that NO is a key cytotoxic mediator involved in the murine M phi defence

   cells may be related to a differential susceptibility to NO.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em. Thell, 2n = 6X = 42, AABBDD)
   breeding programs aim to reorganize genotypes to achieve better yields,
   environmental adaptation and food quality. The necessary
   interdisciplinarity for breeding purposes requires an accurate choice of
   the most appropriate cellular and/or molecular strategies available to
   be integrated with agronomic approaches in order to overcome the genetic
   limitation of each cultivated species, at each agroecosystem.
   Cytogenetics has given a great contribution to wheat genetic studies and
   breeding, due to viability of chromosomal variants because of homoeology
   among genomes in this allohexaploid species and the genus Triticum. The
   level of development of cytogenetic techniques achieved over the last 60
   years has set wheat apart from other cereal crops in terms of
   possibilities to introduce genetic material from other species.
   Cytogenetic approaches have been extensively used in chromosomal mapping
   and/or resistance gene transference from tribe Triticeae-related
   species. Monosomic analysis, entire chromosomes engineered through
   single additions and/or substitutions, reciprocal translocation through
   radiation or manipulation of homoeologous pairing, as well as synthesis
   of new amphiploids to allow homologous recombination by chiasmata
   evolved considerably since the past decades. The association of tissue
   culture and molecular biology techniques provides bread wheat breeding
   programs with a powerful set of biotechnological tools. However,
   knowledge on genetic system components, cytotaxonomical relationships,
   cytogenetic structure and evolutionary history of wheat species cannot
   be neglected. This information indicates the appropriate strategy to
   avoid isolation mechanisms in interspecific or intergeneric crosses,
   according to the genome constitution of the species the desired gene is
   to be transferred from. The development of amphiploids as ``bridge{''}
   species is one of the available procedures to facilitate gene flow
   between wheat and related species. Since the environment at the center
   of origin of wheat in Southern Asia is quite different from subtropical
   environments, Brazilian breeding programs overcome more challenges to
   adapt wheat crop to biotic and abiotic stresses than some other
   countries. The germplasm bank of Embrapa Trigo has about 1000 registered
   entries of Triticum relatives, Aegilops, Secale and Agropyron species
   supplied from several germplasm banks distributed over the world which
   were multiplied and/or selected for naturally occurring or artificially
   inoculated fungal diseases. Since Aegilops squarrosa L. entries showed
   very good performance, the genetic variability observed in this species
   was firstly exploited. It is reported here the strategy used for
   transferring useful genes from Ae. squarrosa (DI), 2n = 14): crossing
   with tetraploid species (AABB, 2n = 28), rescue and in vitro culture of
   immature embryos for regeneration of the trihaploid (ABD, 2n = 21)
   hybrid, and colchicine treatment for genome duplication resulting in the
   artificial synthesis of hexaploid wheat lines (AABBDD, 2n = 42).
   Results of 10,739 artificial pollinations involving 28 cross
   combinations amongst eight T durum L., T dicoccum and T cartlicum
   tetraploid entries used as female parents and ten selected Ae. squarrosa
   sources of resistance as male parents are presented here. Immature
   embryos from 18 cross combinations were recovered and cultured in vitro.
   Green plantlets from 13 combinations were regenerated. Fertile
   amphiploids were recovered only from crosses among entries of tetraploid
   T durum and diploid Ae. squarrosa. They originated 11 fertile synthetic
   amphiploid lines from seven different combinations. Useful stem and leaf
   rust as well as powdery mildew resistance for future use in breeding
   programs were obtained.}},

   increasing quality, safety and applicability of percutaneous procedures,
   by giving scientific keys aimed at improving related functions of
   teaching or planning in this field and enhancing competence and prestige
   of Spanish interventional cardiologists.
   The purpose of the document is to describe the importance of current
   interventional cardiology, to identify quality references and to
   establish minimum acceptable requirements for assessing and maintaining
   the competence of practicing or providing advanced training in this
   discipline. To achieve this goal, a search for a gold standard of the
   different techniques of general interventional practice was carried out,
   and predictors of postprocedural outcome were analyzed, as well as their
   relation with different kinds of circumstances.
   This analysis identified coronary angioplasty as the standard on which
   recommendations regarding competence in overall interventional
   cardiology standards of quality and assessment and maintenance of
   proficiency must be based. On the other hand, the strong influence of
   experience and knowledge of results has been documented, especially in
   high-risk or high-complexity settings. On this basis, the report
   establishes specific recommendations about proficiency for practice and
   advanced training. It also suggests that interventional cardiology
   should be considered as a subspecialty, of cardiology requiring specific
   credentials.}},

Abstract = {{In monogamous species, an abiding relationship between a specific adult
   male and a specific adult female is a defining feature of the social
   system. The interactions between these individuals are influenced by
   many factors, including not only the history of their relationship (for
   example, development of a mutual bond), but also the immediate effects
   of the prevailing social context (for example, presence and sex of
   extra-pair conspecifics). In this study we examined the effects of an
   existing bond and of social context on interactions between adult
   heterosexual pairs of the monogamous titi monkeys (Callicebus moloch).
   Twelve adult males and 12 adult females were tested with their cagemates
   and with an unfamiliar partner of the opposite sex in five social
   contexts: (1) mated male-female pair; (2) unfamiliar pair; (3) single
   female; (4) single male; and (5) empty stimulus cage. Results show that
   mated pairs were more affiliative than unfamiliar pairs and
   differentiated social contexts more sharply. Males were more responsive
   to context than females. Distance between mates was less and physical
   contact was more frequent in the presence of male-female pairs or a
   single male, than in the presence of a single female or an empty cage.
   These findings suggest that the presence and sex of strangers have a
   stronger influence on male-female interactions when the pair has an
   existing relationship.}},

Abstract = {{The attenuation relationship presented by Boore et al. (1997) has been
   evaluated and customized with respect to southern California
   strong-motion data (for peak ground acceleration (PGA) and 0.3-, 1.0-,
   and 3.0-sec period spectral acceleration). This study was motivated by
   the recent availability of a new site-classification map by Wills et al.
   (2000), which distinguishes seven different site categories for
   California based on the 1994 NEHRP classification. With few exceptions,
   each of the five site types represented in the southern California
   strong-motion database exhibit distinct amplification factors,
   supporting use of the Wills et al. (2000) map for microzonation
   purposes. Following other studies, a basin-depth term was also found to
   be significant and therefore added to the relationship. Sites near the
   center of the LA Basin exhibit shaking levels up to a factor of 2
   greater, on average, than otherwise equivalent sites near the edge.
   Relative to Boore et al. (1997), the other primary difference here is
   that PGA exhibits less variation among the Wills et al. (2000) site
   types. In fact, the PGA amplification implied by the basin-depth effect
   is greater than that implied by site classification. The model does nor
   explicitly account for nonlinear sediment effects, which, if important,
   will most likely influence rock-site PGA predictions the most. Evidence
   for a magnitude-dependent variability, or prediction uncertainty, is
   also found and included as an option.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Assessment of predictors for initiating prophylactic
   antithrombotic prescribing for patients newly diagnosed with ischaemic
   heart disease (IHD) and the impact of the introduction of national
   guidelines.
   Design and setting: A retrospective case-control study was performed
   using pharmacy prescription data from 120,000 Dutch patients over a
   5-year period. IHD patients were identified using as a marker multiple
   nitrate prescriptions {[}anatomical-chemical-therapeutic (ATC) code
   C01D] indicating chronic use. Initiation of antithrombotic therapy was
   likewise identified using ATC codes B01AA and B01AC (oral anticoagulants
   and thrombocyte aggregation inhibitors), prescribed within 6 months
   following the first nitrate prescription. Statistically significant (P <
   0.05) predictors were assessed using multivariable analysis considering
   patient, prescriber and medication characteristics.
   Results: Of the 2598 patients who met specified inclusion criteria for
   newly diagnosed IHD, approximately 35\% was not prescribed any type of
   antithrombotic therapy. Male patients {[}odds ratio (OR) 2.4, 95\%
   confidence interval (CI) 2.0-2.9], patients with cardiovascular (other
   than IHD) and diabetic co-morbidity (OR 6.4, 95\% CI 4.8-7.9 and OR 1.6,
   95\% CI 1.1-2.1, respectively) and patients using isosorbide mononitrate
   rather than isosorbide dinitrate as anti-ischaemic main therapy (OR 2.1,
   95\% CI 1.3-2.5) were most likely to be prescribed antithrombotic
   therapy. Furthermore, initiating antithrombotic prescribing was more
   likely after the introduction of national guidelines (OR 1.4, 95\% CI
   1.1-1.7).
   Conclusions: Initiating antithrombotic prescribing in newly diagnosed
   II-ID patients can be predicted by patient gender, certain co-morbidity
   and main type of nitrate therapy. The introduction of national
   guidelines has resulted in an increase of prophylactic antithrombotic
   prescribing in accordance with their contents.}},

Abstract = {{Many computationally intensive problems in engineering and science give
   rise to the solution of large, sparse, linear systems of equations. Fast

   level of performance. This paper presents the design, implementation,
   and interface of a library of Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines for
   sparse matrices (PSBLAS) which is specifically tailored to
   distributed-memory computers. PSBLAS enables easy, efficient, and
   portable implementations of parallel iterative solvers for linear
   systems. The interface keeps in view a Single Program Multiple Data
   programming model on distributed-memory machines. However, the
   architecture of the library does not exclude an implementation in

Abstract = {{Allele frequencies were determined at 14 microsatellite loci in 284
   female and 50 male rainbow trout that were sampled throughout the
   spawning season from a commercial trout farm. Phenotypic selection has
   expanded the spawning season of the broodstock from 2 weeks to 8 months.
   Females maturing in different seasons showed significantly different
   allelic distributions (P<0<bullet>001) at all loci. The spawning time
   for the majority of females sampled could be predicted based on their
   genotypic information {[}chromosome segment sharing coefficient (CSSC)
   values]. CSSC analyses assigned 100, 56, 76 and 68\% of summer, fall,
   winter, and spring spawning females, respectively to the season from
   which their gametes were actually collected. Alternatively, only 38 and
   14\% of summer and spring spawning XY males respectively, were assigned
   to the correct season. Loci linked to thermal tolerance and spawning
   time quantitative trait loci (QTL) showed significantly greater
   heterogeneity (higher average D-s values) in allele frequencies than
   those not known to be linked to QTL based on previous work. Thus,
   phenotypic selection for spawning time has led to concomitant changes in
   allele frequencies at markers of QTL. This suggests that the QTL
   detected in our previous work have detectable effects in fish from other
   genetic backgrounds. (C) 2000 The Fisheries Society of the British

Abstract = {{Federal land managers in the western United States are interested in the
   potential of prescribed fire as a tool to decrease fuel loads, increase
   vegetational heterogeneity, and increase faunal diversity in various
   ecosystems. I tested whether implementation of a prescribed fire program
   by the US Forest Service in a watershed in the central Great Basin had
   significant effects on butterfly species richness and composition. I
   monitored butterfly communities during the first two years after
   implementation in five to seven burn units and controls in the
   watershed. To estimate baseline spatial and temporal variation in
   butterfly communities in the greater ecosystem, I also monitored
   butterflies in five untreated canyons outside the project area.
   Butterfly species richness and butterfly species composition (measured
   as community similarity) did not differ significantly between burn units
   and controls. Geographic location had statistically significant effects
   on species richness. Butterfly species composition of individual
   locations varied over time, as did the magnitude of that variation.
   These results emphasize that standardized, repeatable monitoring
   protocols are vital for evaluating the effects of experimental
   management treatments and for predicting and assessing the effects of
   future management strategies and environmental changes.}},

Abstract = {{The phytoestrogen and principal isoflavone in soy, genistein, has
   adverse effects on reproductive physiology in rodents. Since physiology
   and behavior are both sensitive to perturbations by estrogens, genistein
   may produce behavioral alterations as well. This paper reports one
   aspect of a study in wh ich several adult rodent behaviors will be
   assessed following long term multigenerational dietary exposure to
   genistein. Since maternal care may affect offspring behaviors in
   adulthood, it is important to determine the potential for genistein to
   affect maternal behavior. Here, rats (FU generation) were fed soy-free
   diets containing 0, 5, 100, or 500 ppm genistein (approx. 0, 0.4, 8, and
   40 mg/kg/day for an adult) beginning on postnatal day (PND) 42. Two
   generations of offspring (F1 and F2) were continued on these diets and
   all treatment groups of the F3 generation were returned to 0 ppm at
   weaning (PND 22). In the first 3 weeks after parturition (for each
   generation), darns were assessed on 6 occasions for the presence of the
   arched back posture with at least one pup nursing. Data were analyzed by
   3 way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with generation,
   treatment, and postnatal day as factors, and p<0.05 required for
   significance There were no significant interactions among treatment,
   generation, or day, and no overall effects of treatment or generation.
   As expected, there was a significant overall effect of day, with animals
   nursing less on later days (p<0.0001). As assessed here, these results
   suggest that lifelong and multigenerational exposure to dietary
   genistein has no severe effects on nursing behavior in rodents. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The IgMk rheumatoid factors (RF) of type II mixed cryoglobulinaemia (MC)
   react, in 95\% of cases, with MoAbs against the cross-reactive idiotypes
   (CRI) Cc1 or Lc1 (corresponding to the products of the V(H)1 and V(H)4
   genes). MC is closely associated with HCV infection, a virus which
   infects lymphocytes and may replicate in B cells. It has been suggested
   that HCV may induce clonal selection of B cells producing monoclonal
   IgMk RF in type II MC. To verify whether HCV is enriched in B cells, and
   in the subsets expressing Cc1 and Lc1 CRI, we studied peripheral blood
   lymphocytes from eight patients with MC and HCV RNA-positive sera. Seven
   patients had RF reacting with anti-Cc1, the other with anti-Lc1 CRI.
   Total lymphocytes, T cells, B cells, and Cc1(+) or Lc1(+), Cc1(-) or
   Lc1(-) B cells were purified using MoAb-coated magnetic beads.
   Lymphocyte subsets were then diluted to give a range of 1 x 10(6)-1 x
   10(3) cells and tested for HCV RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase
   chain reaction. HCV was found exclusively in B cells in seven out of
   eight patients. In three patients HCV was enriched in the Cc1(+) cells.
   In one of these patients, HCV was found exclusively in Cc1(+) cells,
   with Cc1(-) cells being HCV-. The data indicate that B cells from type
   II MC patients are almost constantly infected by HCV. In selected cases,
   B cell subsets expressing IgMk RF CRI are the prevalent cell type
   infected by HCV. Our data suggest HCV involvement in B cell
   dysregulation leading to cryoprecipitable IgMk RF production.}},

Abstract = {{During the past two decades, the progress in computerized treatment
   planning systems has led to more accurate imaging and therapy by using
   the gamma knife, especially with the smallest collimators (4 mm).
   However, the ionization chambers that have been used to calibrate the
   gamma knife are not useful with the smallest collimators because the
   chambers are too big compared with the irradiated volume. Therefore, it
   is important to develop more suitable dosimeters. This study proposes a
   new dosimeter method.
   The FriXyGel method proposed here is based on a phantom dosimeter, an
   acquisition chain, and dedicated software. This dosimeter uses an
   agarose gel into which a ferrous sulphate solution (Fricke solution) and
   a metal ion indicator (xylenol orange) are incorporated. The absorbed
   dose is detected through measurements of visible light transmission,
   imaged by means of a charge-coupled device camera provided with a
   suitable optical filter. Gel layers are imaged before and after
   irradiation, and the differences in light absorption are related to the
   absorbed dose. By choosing convenient thickness of gel layers and by
   building up a phantom with different gel slices, it is possible to
   obtain a three-dimensional (3D) representation of the absorbed dose.
   The final 3D representation is reached after several mathematical
   processes have been applied to the images. The first step identifies and
   reduces all factors that could alter the original data, such as
   nonuniformity in illumination. Then, after calibration procedures, it is
   possible to obtain absorbed dose values and to discover their 3D
   representation. This goal has been reached by developing appropriate
   software that performs all the calculations necessary for spatial
   representation routines and prompt comparison with theoretical
   calculations.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to provide data on lipid distribution and
   to investigate the association between hypercholesterolemia and other
   factors.
   A cross-sectional survey of insured subjects in an Health Center of
   Guadeloupe in 1999. Data from a consecutive series of 1 010 individuals
   aged 18 years and older, collected during a 3 month-period, were used.
   Standardized interviews and measurements of blood lipid abnormalities
   and other cardiovascular risk factors were carried out.
   Overall, 27\% had elevated total cholesterol (TC) levels above 200
   mg/dL, 11.7\% had TC levels above 240mg/dL, 18.1\% had LDL-C levels
   above 160 mg/dL, 12.5\% had HDL-C below 35 mg/dL and 2.7\% had
   triglyceride levels above 200 mg/d L. Isolated low HDL-C was found in
   22\% of the subjects and 10.8\% had both TC above 240 mg/dL and LDL-C
   above 160 mg/dL. Only 22\% of the subjects with high TC were aware of
   their diagnosis and 5\% were treated.
   The risk of having hypercholesterolemia above 200 mg/dL was
   independently and significantly higher in case of hypertension, age
   above 45 in men or 55 in women, body mass index above 30 and familial
   history of dyslipidemia.
   These findings document the first report on dyslipidemia in Guadeloupe.
   It showed that the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia and
   hypertriglyceridemia was lower than in developed countries, but markedly
   higher than in Africa. Modifications of lifestyle and adapted
   therapeutics are necessary to decrease cardiovascular mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Background Little is known about the ability of preregistration house
   officers (PRHOs) to perform basic clinical skills just prior to entering
   the medical register.
   Objectives To find out whether PRHOs have deficiencies in basic clinical
   skills and to determine if the PRHOs themselves or their consultants are
   aware of them.
   Method All 40 PRHOs at the Chelsea and Westminster and Whittington
   Hospitals were invited to undertake a 17 station OSCE of basic clinical
   skills. Each station was marked by one examiner completing an overall
   global score after completing an itemised checklist. An adequate station
   performance was the acquisition of a pass/borderline pass grade. Prior
   to the OSCE, a questionnaire was given to each PRHO asking them to rate
   their own abilities (on a 5-point scale) in the skills tested. A similar
   questionnaire was sent to the educational supervisors of each PRHO
   asking them to rate their house officer's ability in each of the same
   skills.
   Results Twenty-two PRHOs participated. Each PRHO failed to perform
   adequately a mean of 24 OSCE stations (SD 1.8, range 1-8). There were no
   significant correlations between OSCE performance and either self- or
   educational supervisor ratings. The supervisor felt unable to give an
   opinion on PRHO abilities in 18\% of the skills assessed.
   Discussion This study suggests that PRHOs may have deficiencies in basic
   clinical skills at the time they enter the medical register. Neither the
   PRHOs themselves nor their consultants identified these deficiencies. A
   large regional study with sufficient power is required to explore the
   generalizability of these concerns in more detail.}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is the ribonucleoprotein enzyme that cleaves
   5'-leader sequences from precursor-tRNAs. Bacterial and eukaryal RNase P
   RNAs differ fundamentally in that the former, but not the latter, are
   capable of catalyzing pre-tRNA maturation in vitro in the absence of
   proteins. An explanation of these functional differences will be
   assisted by a detailed comparison of bacterial and eukaryal RNase P RNA
   structures. However, the structures of eukaryal RNase P RNAs remain
   poorly characterized, compared to their bacterial and archaeal homologs.
   Hence, we have taken a phylogenetic-comparative approach to refine the
   secondary structures of eukaryal RNase P RNAs. To this end, 20 new RNase
   P RNA sequences have been determined from species of ascomycetous fungi
   representative of the genera Arxiozyma, Clavispora, Kluyveromyces,
   Pichia, Saccharomyces, Saccharomycopsis, Torulaspora, Wickerhamia, and
   Zygosaccharomyces. Phylogenetic-comparative analysis of these and other
   sequences refines previous eukaryal RNase P RNA secondary structure
   models. Patterns of sequence conservation and length variation refine
   the minimum-consensus model of the core eukaryal RNA structure. In
   comparison to bacterial RNase P RNAs, the eukaryal homologs lack RNA
   structural elements thought to be critical for both substrate binding
   and catalysis. Nonetheless, the eukaryal RNA retains the main features
   of the catalytic core of the bacterial RNase P. This indicates that the
   eukaryal RNA remains intrinsically a ribozyme.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen monitoring with a Hirst like pollen trap for 30 years in Basel,
   Switzerland allows understanding of the behaviour of the different
   plants producing allergenic pollens. It becomes evident that in this
   time period the different tree pollen like Hazel and Birch increased,
   whereas in the control, the observed amount of a herb pollen like
   Artemisa did not change. Moreover, it was observed that in the different
   trees flowering took place earlier namely at the beginning of the year.
   This was especially impressive for Hazel, where flowering was shifted
   ofmore than one month.
   These aerobiological observations were supported and confirmed by some
   epidemiological studies, showing that tree pollen allergy has become
   more important in the last years compared to grass pollen allergy and
   herb pollen allergy.
   The reason for the increase of tree pollen counts and the shift in the
   flowering time depends on the observed increase of the annual
   temperature, an increased input of nutrients like CO2 or NOx but
   probably also a real increase of certain trees, like birch for example,
   in parks and avenues.}},

Abstract = {{The Mauna Kea silversword, Augyroxiphium sandwicense ssp. sandwicense,
   has experienced both a severe population crash associated with an
   increase in alien ungulate populations on Mauna Kea, and a population
   bottleneck associated with reintroduction. In this paper, we address the
   genetic consequences of both demographic events using eight
   microsatellite loci. The population crash was not accompanied by a
   significant reduction in number of alleles or heterozygosity. However,
   the population bottleneck was accompanied by significant reductions in
   observed number of alleles, effective number of alleles, and expected
   heterozygosity, though not in observed heterozygosity. The effective
   size of the population bottleneck was calculated using both observed
   heterozygosities and allele frequency variances. Both methods
   corroborated the historical census size of the population bottleneck of
   at most three individuals. The results suggest that: (i) small
   populations, even those that result from severe reductions in historical
   population size and extent, are not necessarily genetically depauperate;
   and (ii) species reintroduction plans need to be conceived and
   implemented carefully, with due consideration to the genetic impact of
   sampling for reintroduction.}},

Abstract = {{Controlled trials were conducted to determine if treatment with the
   benzimidazole compound, omeprazole, would prevent gastric ulceration
   associated with feed withdrawal. Pigs were fed ad libitum, fasted for 24
   h, or fasted for 48 h, and within each of these 3 groups the effect of
   no medication (controls), of 20 mg or 40 mg of omeprazole was evaluated
   on the pH of gastric fluid and the presence or absence of lesions in the
   pars esophagea. Medication with 40 mg of omeprazole resulted in
   significantly higher gastric pH 24 h after treatment compared with
   untreated pigs or pigs medicated with 20 mg of omeprazole. Fasting for
   24 h or for 48 h, resulted in more pigs developing ulcers (15 of 25)
   than pigs allowed free access to feed (1 out of 10) (P = 0.01). The
   results of this trial suggest that omeprazole was effective in
   preventing some, but not all, of the tissue damage in the pars esophagea
   related to feed withdrawal. In addition to hydrochloric acid, possibly
   other components, such as bile acids in the fluid gastric contents, are
   important in causing epithelial injury.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To evaluate the prognosis of left ventricular (LV) aneurysms
   with normal global function caused by myocarditis.
   Background: LV aneurysms may result from idiopathic or viral
   myocarditis. The prognosis of inflammatory LV aneurysms when associated
   with a normal cardiac function is unknown.
   Methods: Among 353 patients with a histologic diagnosis of myocarditis,
   12 (3.3\%) had single or multiple localized LV aneurysms (length, 10.6
   +/- 3.1 mm; width, 7.4 +/- 4.2 mm) with normal cardiac function.
   Presenting symptoms were ventricular tachycardia (VT) in nine patients
   and unexplained chest pain in three. All patients underwent laboratory
   tests and noninvasive and invasive cardiac examinations, including
   biventricular endomyocardial biopsy.
   Results: In all patients, LV endomyocardial biopsy specimen showed a
   lymphocytic myocarditis with focal intense myocytolysis or damage of
   intramural vessels, whereas light ventricular biopsy was diagnostic for
   myocarditis only in three. Serologic study suggested a viral infection
   in 3 patients and an immunologic disorder in 2, although it was negative
   in 7. Treatment included antiarrhythmics in 9 patients with VT, beta
   -blockers in 1 with chest pain, and immunosuppression (prednisone and
   azathioprine for 5 months) in 4 with active myocarditis (2 with chest
   pain and 2 with VT). At intermediate-term follow-up (mean, 53 months;
   range, 12 to 120 months), LV function was persistently normal in all
   patients, with an LV aneurysm occlusion being observed in two patients.
   All patients were asymptomatic, with no VT recurrence or major clinical
   events. None required implantable electrical devices or a surgical
   intervention.
   Conclusions: LV aneurysms with normal global function caused by
   myocarditis are an uncommon benign entity in which major therapeutic
   regimens are usually unnecessary.}},

Abstract = {{Glucose transport in skeletal muscle is stimulated by two distinct
   stimuli, insulin and exercise, The mechanism by which exercise
   stimulates glucose transport is not known, although it is distinct from
   the insulin-mediated pathway Recently, it has been shown that
   AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated by exercise in skeletal
   muscle, whereas pharmacological activation of AMPK by
   5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside (AICAR) leads to increased
   glucose transport. It has been postulated, therefore, that AMPK may be
   the link between exercise and glucose transport. To address this, we
   have examined the signaling pathway involved in the stimulation of
   glucose uptake after activation of AMPK. Here we show that activation of
   AMPK: by AICAR in rat muscle and mouse H-2K(b) muscle cells activates
   glucose transport approximately twofold. AMPK in H-2H(b) cells is also
   activated by hyperosmotic stress and the mitochondrial uncoupling agent,
   dinitrophenol, both of which lead to increased glucose transport. In
   contrast, insulin, which activates glucose transport two- to- threefold
   in both rat muscle and H-2K(b) cells, has no effect on AMPK activity. A
   previous study has shown that AMPK phosphorylates and activates
   endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS). me show here that NOS activity
   in H-2Kb cells is activated after stimulation of AMPK by AICAR.
   Treatment of H-2Hb cells or rat muscle with NOS inhibitors completely
   blocks the increase in glucose transport after activation of AMPK. In
   addition, an inhibitor of guanylate cyclase also blocks activation of
   glucose transport by AICAR in 8-2K(b) cells. These results indicate that
   activation of AMPK in muscle cells stimulates glucose transport by
   activation of NOS coupled to downstream signaling components, including
   cyclic GMP.}},

Abstract = {{TCR- but not CD2-triggered IL-2 production is p56(lck) dependent. To
   test the hypothesis that p59(fyn), a second src-family protein tyrosine
   kinase (PTK) expressed in T lymphocytes, might be an essential upstream
   component of the CD2 signaling pathway, we generated human (h) CD2
   transgenic (tg) fyn(+/+) and fyn(-/-) mice. Clustering of hCD2 molecules
   on resting peripheral T lymphocytes results in Ca2+ mobilization,
   activation of MARK and cellular proliferation. In contrast, in the
   absence of p59(fyn), these CD2-initiated activities are markedly
   reduced, while TCR-triggered proliferation is unaffected. Several CD2
   pathway components regulated by p59(fyn) have been identified including
   phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLC-gamma1), Vav, protein kinase C-theta isoform
   (PKC-theta), docking protein (Dok), focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and
   Pyk2. Decreased inducible PKC-theta catalytic activity and Vav
   phosphorylation likely account for diminished p38 and JNK activation in
   hCD2tg fyn(-/-) mice. Moreover, deficiency in fyn-dependent PLC-gamma1
   catalytic activity may contribute to reduced PKC-alpha -dependent ERK
   activation. Of note, CD2-dependent Dok but not linker from activated T
   cells (LAT) tyrosine phosphorylation requires p59(fyn). Furthermore,
   that FAK and Pyk2 are target substrates implies that p59(fyn) may be an
   important regulator of T cell adhesion as well. Collectively, these data
   identify p59(fyn) as a key PTK in CD2-mediated activation of mature T
   lymphocytes.}},

   three different amino acids (GluNa, Arg, and Ala), known as amphoteric
   electrolytes, were examined in contrast to those of the simple
   electrolytes (KCI and LiCI). From an analysis of the data of the volume
   flux and salt Aux, although preferential amino acid transport across the
   charged mosaic membrane was observed, the extent of the permeability was
   less than that of simple salt. Among amino acids, GluNa with almost
   complete dissociation indicated the maximum permeability. A conductance
   study indicated that the transport behaviors were dependent on the ionic
   states in aqueous solution. It was inferred that amino acids with
   apparent zero net charges have transport behaviors different from a
   nonelectrolyte, such as sucrose.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in the understanding of acute coronary syndromes have occurred
   rapidly in the last 5 years and have dramatically changed the way
   patients are evaluated, diagnosed, and managed. Medical advances, such
   as antiplatelet and antithrombin agents and growing databases on
   interventional outcomes have created a new world of therapeutic options
   for the spectrum of ischemic heart disease. As more options become
   available, nurses are under increasing pressure to stay abreast of what
   these options have to offer patients, and which patients benefit most
   from each therapeutic approach. The purpose of this article is to review
   the newest therapies for acute coronary syndromes, including GP IIb/IIIa
   inhibitors, low molecular weight heparins, and direct thrombin
   inhibitors, and discuss indications and contraindications for each of
   these therapies. Changes in diagnostic approach using troponin T and I
   are also presented.}},

Abstract = {{We develop an algorithm for computing all generators of relative power
   integral bases in quartic extensions K of number fields M. For this
   purpose we use the main ideas of our previously derived algorithm for
   solving index form equations in quartic fields (I. Gaal, A. Petho, and
   M. Pohst, 1993, J. Symbolic Comput. 16, 563-584, 1996, J. Number Theory
   57, 90-104). In this way we reduce the problem to the resolution of a
   cubic and several corresponding quartic relative Thue equations over M.
   These equations determine the generators of power integral bases of K
   over M up to translation by integers of M and multiplication by unit
   factors of M. The new method is based on our ability to solve relative
   Thue equations efficiently by the algorithm in (I. Gaal and M. Pohst,
   2000, Math. Comp., to appear).
   In the case K is an octic field with a quadratic subfield M we can also
   consider the absolute index of elements of K, having relative index 1
   over M. In order to determine all generators of power integral bases of
   K (over Q) we determine the corresponding translating elements and unit
   factors properly. This is done by solving. an equation similar to an
   inhomogeneous Thue equation. We illustrate our algorithms with detailed
   examples. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{To increase understanding of roosting habitat of Mexican Spotted Owls
   (Strix occidentalis lucida) and factors that influence use of roosting
   habitat, we sampled habitat characteristics at 1790 sites used for
   roosting by 28 radio-marked Mexican Spotted Owls in three study areas in
   Arizona and New Mexico. We explored potential patterns of variation in
   roost-site characteristics by estimating similarity among all possible
   pairs of roost sites and summarizing patterns in these similarity
   estimates using a linear model. Factors in the model included owl
   identity and season. We conducted these analyses within study areas,
   because habitat characteristics differed among study areas. We used a
   repeated-measures model which assumed that similarity estimates computed
   between roost sites of the same owl or pairs of owls were correlated.
   This model significantly improved model goodness-of-fit over a null
   model assuming no such correlation structure. Similarity estimates were
   relatively high (0.744-0.775) in all three study areas, suggesting
   consistent patterns of selection among owls within areas. Owl and season
   effects were relatively small but detectable in all study areas, with
   the relative magnitude of these effects differing among areas. The
   seasonal effect was greatest in the area dominated by pine-oak forest
   and relatively slight in two areas where owls roosted primarily in
   mixed-conifer forest. Relative to areas where owls roosted in
   mixed-conifer forest, roosts in pine-oak forest occurred on moderate
   slopes, on southwest to northwest aspects, and were less concentrated on
   lower portions of slopes. We suspected that much of this difference
   reflected differences in stand-development processes in different forest
   types. This suggested that land managers should incorporate knowledge of
   such patterns in different forest types and topographic locations in
   planning decisions involving management of Spotted Owl habitat.}},

   To address this issue 30 infants with DS (13 female, 17 male) were

   intensity and duration of distress reactions were coded in 15-s

   ratings of infants' social interactive behaviors (contact maintenance,
   proximity seeking, distance interaction, resistance, and avoidance) were
   made for each episode and used to assess the quality of infants'
   attachment relationships. The data indicated that there are high rates

Abstract = {{Cr doping in Strontium Barium Niobate (SBN) crystals is found to enhance
   the photorefractive response. Absorption bands around 650 nm and below
   600 nm can be attributed to Cr in SBN crystals. In addition to XPS
   experimental results, the appearance of broad R line absorptions at low
   temperature confirms that most Cr ions are in the Cr3+ charge state in
   the SBN crystals. Luminescence bands around 765 nm were observed with
   different peak positions in nominally pure and in Cr-doped SBN crystals.
   The positions of the maxima in the excitation spectra in SBN:Cr,
   coinciding with the absorption bands, indicate that. this emission band
   comes from the excitation of Cr3+ ions. Two thermoluminescence (TL)
   peaks are found in SBN:Cr and nominally pure SBN crystals: one at 88 K
   and the other around 220 K. The identical spectral distribution of the
   two TL bands points to the same recombination process following the
   liberation of two light-induced electron trapping centers: Nb4+ polarons
   and VIS-centers created at low temperatures. A model of the thermal
   recovery process involved is proposed. The thermal activation energy for

Abstract = {{ZrO2 films have been prepared by RF reactive sputtering using different
   substrate-target distances and RF powers. The films have been
   characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy

   have been found in the films. All the films show a random orientation.
   The crystallite size increases as the substrate-target distance
   decreases and the RF power increases. It has been found that the
   residual stress of the films is mainly caused by the intrinsic stress.
   Also, the influence of substrate-target distance and RF power on the

Abstract = {{Previously, we demonstrated that in vitro treatment of B16F10 murine
   melanoma cells with interleukin-2 (IL-2) enhances proliferation and
   metastasis. To further investigate the role played by IL-2 in human
   melanomas, we studied the expression of IL-2/IL-2 receptor and the
   effect of IL-2 on the proliferation of melanoma cell lines derived from
   primary (A375 and RMS cell lines) and metastatic (Hs294T cell line)
   tumours, We found a constitutive expression of cytoplasmic IL-2 and
   alpha, beta and gamma -subunits of the IL-2R on the surface of the three
   melanoma cell lines. The presence of IL-2 in the culture increased the
   proliferation rate in A375 and RMS cell lines, but no effect was
   observed in Hs294T metastatic cells, Biologically active IL-2 could be
   found in the supernatant of the three melanoma cell lines, particularly
   in A375 and RMS cells, in which an inhibition of the proliferation rate
   was observed when IL-2 was blocked. Moreover, the combination of
   anti-IL-2R beta and anti-IL-2R gamma blocking antibodies induced a
   significant down-regulation of cell proliferation in the three melanoma
   cell lines, and the combination of anti-IL-2R alpha, anti-IL-2R beta and
   anti-IL-2R gamma blocking antibodies inhibited IL-2-mediated growth
   stimulation in A375 and Hs294T cell lines. In RMS cells, a more
   significant effect was observed when only IL-2R gamma was blocked.
   Finally, exogenous IL-2 modulated the IL-2 endogenously produced by
   melanoma cells. These data show that IL-2 mag modulate the growth of
   melanoma cells through autocrine or/and paracrine mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the prevalence of the use of herbs among adults and
   children in Jamaica in 1996 Two concurrent surveys were conducted in
   randomly selected urban and rural areas: among adults and among
   caretakers of young children. From over 90\% of the selected households,
   all caretakers of children under 6 years and one randomly selected adult
   (18 years or older) were interviewed using structured questionnaires.
   The 457 adults reportedly used 156 types of herbs: a mean of 6 +/- 3
   (mean +/- standard deviation) by the urban adults, and 10 6 by the rural
   adults (t-test, p < 0.001). Almost 100\% of respondents had at sometime
   used herbs for teas or for treating illnesses. The most common method of
   preparation was by infusion or boiling in water, then adding sugar Urban
   respondents, women and those who were employed were more likely to buy
   medicines than to use herbal remedies. One hundred and sixty-seven
   caretakers of 203 children under 6 years were interviewed. The mean
   number of herbs given to each child was between 2 and 3. The most common
   herbs were introduced within the first 6 months of life. Many caretaker
   factors were associated with herbal use. Public health implications
   include the potential toxicity of some herbs, the possibility that
   herbal teas given to young children may displace more nutritious foods
   and delay presentation to healthcare facilities. The findings will allow
   policy makers to target those most likely to use herbal preparations or
   to give them to young children, and target herbs to be analyzed for
   toxic or beneficial properties.}},

Abstract = {{Concurrent Engineering (CE) approaches heavily rely on efficient and
   reliable communications among people involved in the design,
   engineering, industrialisation and even manufacturing of products. One
   important aspect of Concurrent Engineering concerns common resolution of
   product design problems within a CE integrated team. This involves
   exchange of technical messages (information) and capitalisation of
   relevant knowledge. The aim in this case is to keep track of problem
   solving process and solutions, to learn from experience and to avoid
   making the same mistakes twice. In this paper, an approach is proposed
   and a simple groupware tool working on a network of PC's is proposed.
   The tool supports description of technical problems, message exchange
   among users, monitoring of the problem solving process and documentation
   of technical solutions. It also provides facilities to structure and
   archive knowledge learned during this process. The tool has been
   developed and evaluated at Aerospatiale Matra, especially to feed back
   to design teams with manufacturing knowledge in the context of product
   change requests. Finally, a method to capitalise knowledge and know-how
   contents in relation to the tool is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the effectiveness of a brief 2 min pre-session
   stimulus preference assessment in predicting the levels of responding of
   four students with profound multiple disabilities during a 5-minute
   experimental session immediately following the assessment. During the
   pre-session assessment, students were presented with four stimuli
   selected from a pool of stimuli identified as either preferred (2
   stimuli) or neutral (2 stimuli)from a previous preference assessment.
   The duration of the student's target behavior (smiling or laughing) was
   recorded. The stimulus with the longest duration was considered
   ``preferred{''} and the stimulus with the shortest duration was
   considered ``neutral{''} An alternating treatments design (ATD) was then
   used to evaluate the prediction of student responding based on the
   pre-session assessment immediately prior to an experimental session.
   Either the preferred, neutral, or both stimuli were presented within the
   context of a social interaction and the duration of the student's target
   behavior (smiling or laughing) was recorded. Teacher behavior, time of
   day, position of the child, materials, and activities, were controlled.
   Results indicate that the 2 min pre-session assessment had predictive
   value, that is, there were higher levels of student responding during
   the condition when the preferred stimulus was wed than when the neutral
   stimulus was used across all four students.}},

Abstract = {{Activin (beta (A)beta (A), beta (A)beta (B), and beta (B)beta (b)) is a
   dimeric growth factor with diverse biological activities in vertebrate
   reproduction. Activin exerts its actions by binding to its specific type
   II and type I receptors. The activity of activin is regulated by
   follistatin, its binding protein, and the antagonists inhibin and
   antivin. All major components of the activin-inhibin-follistatin system
   have been identified in fish except the alpha subunit of inhibin. Using
   goldfish as a model, we have demonstrated that activin is expressed in
   the pituitary and the recombinant goldfish activin B has novel inverse
   effects on the expression of GTH beta subunits. Activin increases the
   mRNA level of GTH-I beta while significantly suppressing the expression
   of GTH-II beta. We have also demonstrated the expression of activin and
   its receptors in the goldfish and zebrafish ovary. Using an in vitro
   ovarian follicle incubation as the system, we have investigated the
   involvement of the activin system in the process of final oocyte
   maturation. Our evidence clearly indicates that activin has potent
   effect of promoting final oocyte maturation, and that it may play a role
   in mediating the stimulatory effect of pituitary gonadotropin in the
   event of oocyte maturation.}},

Abstract = {{Cordierite has the ideal formula (Mg,Fe)(2)Al4Si5O18.x(H2O,CO2), but it
   must contain some Fe3+ to account for its blue color and strong
   pleochroism. The site occupation and concentration of Fe3+ in two
   Mg-rich natural cordierites have been investigated by EPR and Fe-57
   Mossbauer spectroscopy. In addition, powder IR spectroscopy, X-ray
   diffraction, and TEM examination were used to characterize the samples.
   Single-crystal and powder EPR spectra indicate that Fe3+ is located on
   T(1)1 in natural cordierites and not in the channels. The amount in
   Mg-rich cordierites is very small with an upper limit set by Mossbauer
   spectroscopy giving less than 0.004 cations per formula unit (pfu). Fe3+
   in cordierite can, therefore, be considered insignificant for most
   petrologic calculations. Heat-treating cordierite in air at 1,000
   degreesC for 2 days causes an oxidation and/or loss of Fe2+ on T(1)1,
   together with an expulsion of Na+ from the channels, whereas heating at
   the Fe-FeO buffer produces little Fe3+ in cordierite. Heating at 1,000
   degreesC removes all class I H2O, but small amounts of class II H2O
   remain as shown by the IR measurements. No evidence for channel Fe2+ or
   Fe3+ in the heat-treated samples was found. The blue color in cordierite
   arises from a broad absorption band (E//b and weaker with Ella) around
   18,000 cm(-1) originating from charge-transfer between Fe2+ in the
   octahedron and Fe3+ in the edge-shared T(1)1 tetrahedron. It therefore
   appears that all natural cordierites contain some tetrahedral Fe3+. The
   brown color of samples heated in air may be due to the formation of very
   small amounts of submicroscopic magnetite and possibly hematite. These
   inclusions in cordierite can only be identified through TEM study.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution patterns of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were determined in four benthic
   invertebrate species of western Lake Erie, USA, to assess and compare
   the processes governing the exposure dynamics of these two classes of
   contaminants. Significant differences in the sum of 17 PAH compounds
   were observed among the four species, with mayflies containing the
   highest PAH body burden, followed by dreissenid mussels, amphipods, and
   crayfish. For PCBs, mayflies contained significantly higher
   concentrations of the sum of 39 PCB congeners than the other organisms,
   and dreissenids had higher levels than crayfish. No significant
   differences were found in the Sigma PCB levels between dreissenids and
   amphipods or between amphipods and crayfish. For PCBs, the relationship
   between biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs) and log K-ow
   followed a parabolic pattern indicative of selective bioaccumulation. In
   contrast, BSAFs for PAHs were inversely related to log K-ow, suggesting
   that metabolism of the higher K-ow compounds was occurring. These
   results support the conclusion that mayflies and dreissenids play major
   roles in the transfer of PAHs and PCBs to upper trophic levels, and they
   demonstrate that the exposure dynamics of PAHs and PCBs are different in
   the benthic components of aquatic food webs.}},

Abstract = {{The inflammatory cytokine makeup of healing wounds helps delineate thr:
   phases of the repair process. As an example, during the lag phase
   (inflammatory phase) of repair, elevated levels of IL-8, a chemokine,
   participate in the activation and chemotaxis of neutrophils. During the
   normal proliferative and remodeling phases of repair, IL-8 levels are
   minimal. Healing burn wounds often have small, open, slow-to-heal areas,
   which have been shown to contain elevated levels of IL-8. Does a Limited
   exposure of IL-8 to fibroblasts in vitro at the concentrations measured
   in these unhealed sites cause altered cell behavior? To study this
   possibility the fibroblast-populated collagen lattice (FPCL) model, an
   in vitro model of wound contraction, was used to investigate fibroblast
   response to IL-8. As previously reported, the chronic exposure of
   fibroblasts to IL-8 at 30 ng/ml within FPCLs significantly inhibited
   FPCL contraction. Fibroblasts in monolayer culture were incubated with
   IL-8 for 3 days. In the absence of IL-8, FPCLs were manufactured with
   these preexposed cells and it was found that FPCL contraction was
   inhibited. Fibroblasts retained their reduced capacity of reorganizing
   collagen fibrils when previously exposed to IL-8. Treating fibroblasts
   in monolayer with IL-8 for only 1 h prior to their incorporation into
   collagen lattices caused inhibition of FPCL contraction. The speculation
   is that in vivo open areas in reepithelialized healed burns are the
   consequence of the local population of fibroblasts having been exposed
   to elevated levels of IL-8. Such an earlier exposure triggers a memory
   in this population of fibroblasts that alters their capacity to lay down
   an extracellular matrix that optimizes the migration of epidermal cells.

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In a previous paper we proposed a new model for turbulent flows, called
   the fractal model (FM), which is applicable both to RANS and LES
   formulations. Here, the model is extended to the reactive case with the
   goal of simulating turbulent flames, both premixed and non-premixed.
   FM is a subgrid model that describes the physics of the small scales of
   turbulence building on the phenomenological concept of vortex cascade
   and on fractal theory. The physics of the small scales is summarized by
   a turbulent `viscosity' mu (t) to be added to the molecular one. mu (t)
   is zero where the flow is laminar and, in particular, goes to zero at
   solid walls.
   The fundamental assumption in treating combustion in this work is that
   chemical reactions take place only at the dissipative scales of
   turbulence, i.e. near the so-called `fine structures' (the eddy
   dissipation concept). FM predicts the growth of dissipative scales due
   to heat release; therefore, it enables a local DNS in the hot regions of
   the flow where the dissipative scale may grow up to the cell dimension.
   FM can also estimate the volume fraction gamma{*} occupied by the `fine
   structures'; this quantity is critical for modelling the reaction rate,
   and therefore the source terms in the energy and species equations. FM
   can also estimate the local surface of the reactive `fine structures',
   that is, the local flame front area. It also takes into account,
   although in approximate manner, the formation of islands of unburnt
   mixture. In this paper, the model tin the isotropic formulation (IFM))
   is used in conjunction with a time-dependent LES (but with the
   Limitations of an isotropic model) approach and is validated through a
   three-dimensional axisymmetric diffusion flame studied experimentally by
   Correa and Gulati and numerically by many researchers. The
   time-dependent results obtained are in good agreement with the
   experiments. Moreover, the IFM solution offers a possible explanation
   for the stabilization process of this flame, which undergoes local
   stretching of the order of 46 000 s(-1).}},

Abstract = {{We have used X-ray fiber diffraction to probe the structure of fibers of
   tau and tau fragments. Fibers of fragments from the microtubule: binding
   domain had a cross beta -structure that closely resembles that reported
   both for neurofibrillary tangles found in Alzheimer's disease brain and
   for fibrous lesions from other protein folding diseases. In contrast,
   fibers of full-length tau had a different, more complex structure.
   Despite major differences at the molecular level, all fiber types
   exhibited very similar morphology by electron microscopy. These results
   have a number of implications for understanding the etiology of
   Alzheimers and other tauopathic diseases. The morphology of the peptide
   fibers suggests that the region in tau corresponding to the peptides
   plays a critical role in the nucleation of fiber assembly. The
   dramatically different structure of the full length tau fibers suggests
   that some region in tan has enough inherent structure to interfere with
   the formation of cross beta -fibers. Additionally, the similar
   appearance by electron microscopy of fibrils with varying molecular
   structure suggests that different molecular arrangements may exist in
   other samples of fibers formed from tau.}},

Abstract = {{The structural changes that occur during the transformation of a
   Ca-deficient apatite, prepared by a wet chemical method, to beta -TCp
   were investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of as-prepared
   samples and samples calcined at temperatures between 500 and 1100
   degreesC showed that the transformation occurs over the temperature
   range 710-740 degreesC, under non-equilibrium conditions. The change in
   crystallite size with increasing calcination/sintering temperature was
   studied by XRD using the Scherrer formula. Fourier transform infra-red
   (FTIR) analysis indicated considerable structural change in samples
   above and below this temperature range. Changes were observed in the
   hydroxyl, carbonate and phosphate bands as the calcination temperature
   was increased from 500 to 1100 degreesC. Even once a single beta -TCP
   phase is obtained at 740 degreesC there remains a considerable amount of
   structural change at temperatures between 740 and 1100 degreesC. This
   effect was illustrated by an unusual change in the lattice parameters of
   the beta -TCP structure and significant changes in the phosphate bands
   of FTIR spectra as the calcination temperature was increased. The
   results obtained in this study show that the combined experimental
   techniques of XRD and FTIR are excellent complimentary methods for
   characterizing structural changes that occur during phase
   transformations. (C) 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers.}},

Abstract = {{Children with functional phonological disorders have been said to
   exhibit certain phonological characteristics that uniquely differentiate
   them from those with normal sound development. In this paper, one such
   defining characteristic was examined by considering the phonological
   system and subsequent treatment of a child, aged 4;5, who presented with
   a non-ambient ingressive substitution pattern. Following conventional
   assessment and treatment procedures, the child's ingressive error
   pattern was largely unaffected, thereby motivating an alternate account
   of the data as a case of complementary distribution. Specifically,
   ingressive substitutions occurred post-vocalically, but never
   word-initially; whereas, egressive substitutions occurred
   word-initially, but never post-vocalically. Comparisons are drawn
   between this and another case of an ingressive substitution pattern in
   functional phonological disorders. Together, the results of these
   studies are considered relative to the suggestion that there are
   defining characteristics of this population. A general conclusion which
   emerges is that apparent differences between normal and disordered
   populations are traceable to performance factors, but do not also
   implicate linguistic competence.}},

Abstract = {{We report the generation of stable cell lines obtained by spontaneous
   immortalization of primary cultures of porcine granulosa cells. Three
   hundred stable cell lines were obtained from three independent
   immortalization trials. Two of these cell lines retained the
   steroidogenic capabilities characteristic of granulosa cells, such as de
   novo synthesis of progesterone and conversion of androstenedione into
   estradiol-17 beta. All the stable cell lines expressed the P450arom and
   3 beta HSD genes, confirming their granulosa origin. Moreover, the
   steroidogenic stable granulosa cells also expressed StAR and P450scc
   genes. Stable cells were developed in cultures using Medium 199
   supplemented with 5\% newborn calf serum (NBCS). The surviving cells
   overcame the senescent phase and entered a stage of continuous growth
   for over one hundred generations. No stable colonies were obtained from
   cultures grown in MEM or DMEM or media supplemented with 10\% NBCS or 5
   and 10\% fetal calf serum (FCS). Medium 199 is a formulation richer in
   nutrients compared to MEM or DM EM and the cell growth capability of
   NBCS is lower than that of FCS, probably due to deficiency of growth
   factors. We speculate that spontaneous immortalization of granulosa
   cells may be facilitated by using a rich culture formulation
   supplemented with low concentrations of serum deficient in growth
   factors. We have validated the stable cell lines for studying the effect
   of hormonal steroids on granulosa cell steroidogenesis and the
   expression of the steroidogenic genes. Therefore, we believe that they
   are useful models to study the molecular mechanism involved in granulosa
   cell differentiation and steroidogenesis. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Since we previously reported that angiotensin-(1-7) {[}Ang-(1-7)]
   increases or inhibits norepinephrine (NE) release in rat atria or
   hypothalamus, respectively, the present work was undertaken to
   investigate the effect of the heptapeptide on NE neuronal uptake and
   metabolism in atria and hypothalamus isolated from rats.
   2. Ang II (1-10 muM) caused a decrease in neuronal NE uptake in both
   atria and hypothalami isolated from rats. On the contrary, tissues
   incubated with {[}H-3]NE in the presence of 0.1-10 muM Ang-(1-7) showed
   no modification in {[}H-3]NE content with respect to the control group,
   suggesting that the heptapeptide did not modify {[}H-3]NE neuronal
   uptake.
   3. To study the effect of the heptapeptide on NE catabolism,
   monoamine-oxidase (MAO) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)
   activities were determined. Pretreatment of the tissue with Ang-(1-7)
   (0.1-1.0 muM) showed a tendency to diminish MAO activity in rat atria,
   while no significant changes were observed in hypothalamic MAO activity.
   Moreover, the heptapeptide (0.1-1.0 muM) did not affect central COMT
   activity with respect to the control group.
   4. Present results allow us to conclude that Ang-(1-7) interacts with
   noradrenergic neurotransmission by increasing or inhibiting NE release
   at the peripheral and central levels, respectively, without affecting
   either the neurotransmitter neuronal uptake or catabolism.}},

Abstract = {{The winter distribution. seasonal vertical migration, and reproduction
   of Calanus finmarchicus in relation to water masses and chlorophyll tr
   were investigated southwest of Iceland between Nov ember 1996 and June
   1997 as part of the TASC programme. During winter (November/December.
   January/February) overwintering C. finmarchicus were generally located
   beyond the shelf (5000-30000 individuals m(-2)); by contrast,
   overwintering animals were usually scarce on the banks (<800-2000
   individuals m(-2)). In the Iceland Basin, overwintering C. finmarchicus
   resided mainly from <similar to>400 m depth to the bottom (>2000 m) at
   temperatures of similar to3-8 degreesC, whereas in the Irminger Basin
   the distribution was mainly similar to 200-1800 m in waters of similar
   to3-6 degreesC. During winter, most of the stock Ras present as C5
   (84-86\%), with a smaller proportion as C4 (12-14\%) and females
   (1-2\%). Overwintering animals resided mainly in water of Atlantic
   origin, but some animals were found in Labrador Sea Water and
   Iceland-Scotland Ridge Overflow Water. Ascent to upper layers probably
   took place mainly during March and April, and continued until May. On
   the basis of the horizontal and vertical distribution of overwintering
   animals and the general surface current pattern, the banks seem to be
   repopulated mainly from the south. By April the spring growth of the
   phytoplankton was about to begin on the banks, and C. finmarchicus had
   started to lay eggs (0-7 eggs female(-1) d(-1). Maximum individual rates
   of egg production (2-46 eggs female(-1) d(-1)) were observed in June. at
   the time of maximum phytoplankton biomass accumulation. During April,
   the population's average rate of egg production on the banks ( similar
   to 1000 eggs m(-2) d(-1)) was rather similar to that in the open ocean
   (similar to 600 eggs m(-2) d(-1)), whereas during June it was

Abstract = {{During the last decade GPR has developed rapidly: instruments have
   become more compact and more digital, the field of application has
   broadened from non-destructive testing to humanitarian demining. Studies
   have been carried out to analyse the full information content of the
   backscattered wavefield trying to go beyond the time and amplitude
   analysis. In recent years, many researchers have focused on the
   possibility of applying holographic acquisition and processing to GPR
   data. This paper proposes a theoretical outline of a holographic
   acquisition and processing techniques; a block diagram of the proposed
   holographic radar; the outlines of the design and the realisation of a
   custom-built full-scale test-site and the results of the first
   simulations carried out with newly developed software. The basic rules
   for an optimum choice of the main acquisition parameters are also given
   together with a discussion of the main advantages and disadvantages of
   the proposed techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The apparently deleterious effect of aging on dual-task performance is
   well established, but there is Little agreement about the source of this
   effect. Studies of the psychological refractory period (PRP) indicate
   that young adults can flexibly control dual-task performance through
   task-coordination strategies. Thus, the performance of older adults
   might differ from young adults because older adults use different
   task-coordination strategies. To test this hypothesis, the
   executive-process interactive control (EPIC) architecture was applied to
   quantify the reaction time data from two PRP experiments conducted with
   young (age 18-26) and older (age 60-70) adults. The results show that
   participants' ability to coordinate the processing of two tasks did not
   decline with age. However, dual-task time costs were greater in the
   older adults. Three sources for this increase were found: generalized
   slowing, process-specific slowing, and the use of more cautious
   task-coordination strategies by the older adults.}},

Abstract = {{The main aim of this study was to identify significant relationships
   between selected anthropometric and kinematic variables and ball release
   speed. Nine collegiate fast-medium bowlers (mean +/- s: age 21.0 +/- 0.9
   years, body mass 77.2 +/- 8.1 kg, height 1.83 +/- 0.1 m) were filmed and
   reconstructed three-dimensionally. Ball release speeds were measured by
   a previously validated Speedchek(TM) Personal Sports Radar (Tribar
   Industries, Canada). Relationships between selected anthropometric
   variables and ball release speed and between kinematic variables and
   ball release speed were investigated using Pearson's product-moment
   correlation coefficients (r). A significant relationship was found
   between the horizontal velocity during the pre-delivery stride (r =
   0.728, P< 0.05) and ball release speed (31.5 +/- 1.9 m.s(-1)). We
   believe that the high correlation was due to the bowlers using
   techniques that allowed them to contribute more of the horizontal
   velocity created during the run-up to ball release speed. We also found
   that the angular velocity (40.6 +/- 3.4 rad.s(-1)) of the right humerus
   had a low correlation (r= 0.358, P> 0.05) with ball release speed.
   Although the action of the wrist was nor analysed because of an
   inadequate frame rate, we found high correlations between ball release
   speed and shoulder-wrist length (661 +/- 31 mm; r= 0.626, P< 0.05) and
   ball release speed and total arm length (860 +/- 36 mm; r= 0.583, P<
   0.05). We conclude that the variance in release speed within this group
   may be accounted for by the difference in radial length between the axis
   of rotation at the glenohumeral joint and the release point.}},

Abstract = {{During 1998 an experimental gillnet fishing survey was carried out in a
   Mexican Central Pacific inshore zone. One-hundred and thirty fish
   species belonging to 51 families and 18 orders were identified. The most
   abundant species were Microlepidotus brevipinnis (29.0\% of the total
   abundance) and Caranx caninus (19.2\%), followed by C. caballus (6.3\%),
   Kyphosus analogus (4.3\%) and C. sexfasciatus (3.4\%). Thermal SST
   anomalies showed the existence of two periods. The first, from January
   to April with positive anomalies, defines the end of an El Nino episode.
   The second period, from May to December, constitutes the beginning of
   the La Nina episode. The typical seasonality in a non-anomalous year
   continued for a large percentage of the inshore fish community, and the
   effects of the anomalous event consisted of changes in seasonality of
   occurrence in some individual species and the unusual abundance of some
   uncommon species. The species richness was higher during the El Nine-La
   Nina event than in a non-anomalous year, and therefore the event could
   be considered an interannual environmental mechanism that favours fish
   diversity in inshore waters. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Antimicrotubule agent-induced apoptosis was examined in the
   proliferating human colon cancer cell line HT29-D4. G2/M arrest and
   subsequent apoptosis were dose-dependent, both observed with 100 nM
   paclitaxel or docetaxel and 10 nM vinorelbine. Bcl-x(1), phosphorylation
   was observed simultaneously with mitotic block, then caspase-3 cleavage
   and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase degradation were detected 48 hr later.
   By using both enzymatic assay and immunoblot detection of cleaved
   fragments, we showed that caspase-8, a central component of the
   CD95-induced apoptotic pathway, was significantly activated during
   paclitaxel exposure, contemporary to apoptosis occurrence. Caspase-8
   activation and apoptosis were independent of CD95 ligation and evidenced
   only for concentrations inducing Bcl-x(L), phosphorylation and a
   decrease in mitochondria permeability. Similar results were obtained
   with docetaxel and vinca alkaloids. Thus, antimitotic drugs may induce
   apoptosis via caspase-8 activation independently of CD95/CD95-L.
   Caspase-8 may be a common mediator of anticancer drug-induced apoptosis
   that could represent a promising target for future therapies. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{A new approach based on sliding control is presented for modeling and
   simulation of thermo-fluid systems described by differential-algebraic
   equations (DAEs). The dynamics of thermo-fluid systems are often
   complicated by momentum interactions that occur on a time scale that is
   orders of magnitude faster than the time scale of interest. To address
   this problem the momentum equation is often modeled using algebraic
   steady state approximations. This will, in general, result in a model
   described by nonlinear DAEs for which few control methods are currently
   applicable. In this paper, the modeling problem is addressed using an
   approach that systematically constructs an explicit state space
   approximation of the DAEs. The state space model can in turn be used
   with existing control methods. This procedure, known as realization, is
   achieved by solving an associated nonlinear control problem by combining
   boundary layer sliding control with the singular perturbation method.
   The necessary criteria for key properties such as convergence,
   stability, and controllability are established. Further, the new
   approach is illustrated using a vapor compression cycle example. This
   demonstrates significant advantages over directly modeling momentum
   interactions. {[}S0022-0434(00)00904-7].}},

Abstract = {{Pheromones are an important class of environmental cues that affect the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in a variety of vertebrate species,
   including humans. When male mice contact female-soiled bedding, or
   urine, they display a reflexive luteinizing hormone (LH) surge within 30
   min, Aside from the requirement that males have gonads to show this
   response, the physiological mechanisms that underlie this pituitary
   response are unknown. In this experiment, we asked if female pheromones
   acted at the level of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) gene
   expression to affect this hormone response. In addition, we also
   examined the contribution of one of the oestrogen receptors (ER alpha)
   by studying this neuroendocrine reflex in wild-type and oestrogen
   receptor-cc knockout (ER alpha KO) males. Both ER alpha KO and wild-type
   males showed the expected LH surge, 45 and 90 min after contact with
   female pheromones. Males housed in clean bedding or bedding soiled by
   another adult male did not display the LH elevation. Interestingly, this
   dramatic change in LH concentrations was not accompanied by any
   alterations in GnRH mRNA expression or levels of primary transcript in
   the preoptic area-anterior hypothalamus. The one exception to this was a
   significant increase in GnRH mRNA expression in tissue collected from
   wild-type males exposed to bedding from another male. This is
   particularly intriguing since LH was not elevated in these males. These
   data replicate and extend our previous finding that ER alpha KO males do
   exhibit an LH surge in response to female pheromones. Thus, this
   neuroendocrine response is regulated by a steroid receptor other than ER
   alpha and does not require alterations in GnRH mRNA expression.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of bandwidth efficient data transmission in multiple antenna
   orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) systems is considered.
   Contrary to the mono-sensor systems, the effects of frequency-selective
   fading may be compensated in the multiple antenna systems due to the
   space diversity without using a wireless overhead. A modulation scheme
   that improves the reliability of data transmission in fading multipath
   environments and performs an accurate channel equalization with no
   excess bandwidth neither substantial training is proposed, The ne cv
   scheme exploits a frequency domain spreading along with the standard
   OFDM modulation. This modulation yields an improved error rate; its
   structure is also exploited to estimate the equalizer. The problem of
   reliable channel equalization in such systems is shown to be essentially
   different in single and multiple antenna scenarios. For the multiple
   antenna scenario, a new approach to to robust equalization is proposed,
   and its performance is analyzed. The numerical study confirms the
   efficiency of the new method in such bandwidth-expensive applications as
   wireless networks.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatitis delta virus infection sometimes causes severe and fulminant
   hepatitis as a coinfection or superinfection along with the hepatitis B
   virus. To elucidate the underlying mechanism of injury caused by
   hepatitis delta virus, we examined whether two isoforms of the hepatitis
   delta antigen (HDAg) had any effect on five well defined intracellular
   signal transduction pathways: serum response factor (SRF)-, serum
   response element (SRE)-, nuclear factor kappaB-, activator protein 1-,
   and cyclic AMP response element-dependent pathways. Reporter assays
   revealed that large HDAg (LIDDAg) activated the SRF- and SRE-dependent
   pathways. In contrast, small HDAg (LHDAg) did not activate any of five
   pathways. LHDAg enhanced the transcriptional ability of SRF without
   changing its DNA binding affinity in an electrophoretic mobility shift
   assay. In addition, LHDAg activated a rat SM22 alpha promoter containing
   SRF binding site and a human c-fos promoter containing SRE. In
   conclusion, LHDAg, but not SHDAg, enhances SRF-associated
   transcriptions. Despite structural similarities be tween the two HDAgs,
   there are significant differences in their effects on intracellular
   signal transduction pathways. These results may provide clues that will
   aid in the clarification of functional differences between LHDAg and
   SHDAg and the pathogenesis of delta hepatitis.}},

Abstract = {{The Hyriidae (Mollusca: Bivalvia: Unionoida) have a disjunct
   distribution, occurring on South America, Australia, and New Zealand.
   Most previous macroevolutionary studies of the Hyriidae pre-dated
   widespread acceptance of both continental drift and phylogenetic
   systematics. For this study, we applied molecular phylogenetic
   techniques to test the hypothesis that the observed disjunction of
   Australasian hyriids across the Tasman Sea is due to the disintegration
   of Gondwanaland (>80 million years ago). We sequenced a fragment of 288
   rDNA for representative hyriid Velesunionini (Australia), Hyridellini
   (Australia and New Zealand), and Hyriinae (South America) and for
   outgroups belonging to the unionoid families Margaritiferidae and
   Unionidae. The topology of the single 288 tree {[}i.e.,
   (Margaritiferidae, Unionidae, (Velesunionini, (Hyridellini, Hyriinae)))]
   recovered by both maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood did not
   support a monophyletic Australasian clade, and the branch lengths were
   consistent with Mesozoic vicariance. We also acquired COI sequences for
   the Australian subset of mussels to corroborate the 28S branch lengths.
   Our results suggest that (1) the Hyriidae pre-date the break up of
   Gondwanaland and (2) the New Zealand Hyridellini are relies rather than
   colonizers. Alternative long-distance dispersal hypotheses are discussed
   in the context of our results, historical geology, and mussel life
   history.}},

Abstract = {{Staple closure is a popular method of skin closure for patients
   undergoing knee replacement surgery. There are no guidelines regarding
   spacing of staples and some concern exists with regard to wound
   oxygenation in knees subject to early movement. We compared cutaneous
   wound characteristics in terms of blood oxygenation and blood content,
   using two types of skin closure. Staples or 4/0 subcuticular vicryl were
   used. We found favourable blood perfusion characteristics when using
   stapled closure. Our results also suggest that optimum wound oxygenation
   requires staple spacing of 6 mm or more. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Autoradiography was used to investigate the cellular sites of
   irreversible binding of H-3-labelled 7,12-dimethylbenz{[}a]anthracene
   (DMBA) and benzo{[}a]pyrene (B{[}a]P) in mice. Autoradiograms obtained
   from solvent-extracted tape-sections revealed an even distribution of
   DMBA- and B{[}a]P-derived radioactivity in control mice lacking sites of
   selective binding in the tissues. In mice pretreated with a cytochrome
   P4501A (CYP1A) inducer, beta -naphthoflavone (BNF) or 3,3',4,4',
   5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126), a noticeable accumulation of bound
   radioactivity was observed in the pulmonary alveolar region. Increased
   labelling was also observed in heart tissue of induced mice. As
   demonstrated by microautoradiography of tissues from CYP1A-induced mice
   treated with H-3-DMBA or H-3-B{[}a]P in vivo, irreversible binding in
   lung tissue was present in endothelial cells of arteries and veins, in
   the alveolar septal walls, and in type 2 pneumocytes. In heart tissue,
   binding was confined to endothelial cells of arteries, capillaries and
   veins. In liver, binding was found in the hepatocytes as well as in
   endothelial cells of the portal veins, whereas no binding was seen in
   endothelial cells of the sinusoids, central veins, or arteries. These
   findings were confirmed in vitro using H-3-DMBA-exposed precision-cut
   slices, indicating that reactive intermediates of DMBA and B(a)P were
   formed in situ. The addition of the CYP1A inhibitor ellipticine
   abolished binding in the target endothelial cells. Increased endothelial
   binding in the lungs and liver of CYP1A-induced mice was concomitant
   with increased 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and DMBA
   hydroxylase activity. In heart, endothelial binding was positively
   correlated with EROD, but not with DMBA hydroxylase. The results suggest
   that endothelial cells may be targets for CYP-dependent activation of
   such toxicants as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Consequently, the
   possibility that chemically induced endothelial dysfunction is a risk
   factor in the aetiology of cardiovascular disease demands consideration.}},

Abstract = {{A sodium pump inhibitor (digitalis-like factor), isolated from the
   peritoneal dialysate of volume-expanded, hypertensive patients with
   kidney failure who were treated with this; dialysis modality, was
   further purified and characterized by means of supercritical fluid
   chromatography, a separation technique whose application to
   very-low-concentration biomolecules is new. Previous studies suggested
   that after high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification,
   this inhibitor was the only factor correlated with volume status and
   blood pressure in these patients. When this same HPLC fraction was
   furthered purified on 2-dimensional supercritical fluid chromatography,
   a single peak coeluted with {[}Na,K]ATPase inhibitory activity. When
   split specimens were used, there was a strict correlation between the
   peak area, measured by flame ionization detection, and activity (n = 10,
   R = 0.98, P = 0.00001). Inhibitory activity after supercritical fluid
   chromatography was still correlated with the degree of volume expansion
   of donor patients (P = 0.01). After HPLC purification, this
   volume-sensitive inhibitor was chemically labile. With further
   purification on supercritical fluid chromatography, the active peak was
   still labile with comparable half-life. Supercritical fluid
   chromatography coupled with flame ionization detection provided an
   estimate of the amount of the inhibitor present, Again using split
   specimens, we determined that the labile digitalis-like factor was
   approximate to 30-fold more effective than ouabain in inhibiting renal
   {[}Na,K]ATPase activity and greater than or equal to 500 times more
   effective than ouabain in causing vascular smooth muscle contraction.
   The data suggest that we have purified to homogeneity a labile
   digitalis-like factor that is readily distinguished from ouabain or
   bufalin, based on chromatographic characteristics, chemical lability,
   and a much lower effective concentration for its biological activity.}},

Abstract = {{Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disorder
   involving at least hormonal, environmental, and genetic factors.
   Familial aggregation, a 2\%-3\% sibling recurrence rate, monozygotic
   twin concordance >20\%, association with several candidate genes, as
   well as the results of five genome scans support a genetic component. We
   present here the results of a genome scan of 126 pedigrees multiplex for
   SLE, including 469 sibling pairs (affected and unaffected) and 175
   affected relative pairs. Using the revised multipoint Haseman-Elston
   regression technique for concordant and discordant sibling pairs and a
   conditional logistic regression technique for affected relative pairs,
   we identify a novel linkage to chromosome 4p16-15.2 (P = .0003 and LOD =
   3.84) and present evidence of an epistatic interaction between
   chromosome 4p16-15.2 and chromosome 5p15 in our European American
   families. We confirm the evidence of linkage to chromosome 4p16-15.2 in
   European American families using data from an independent pedigree
   collection. In addition, our data support the published results of three
   independent studies for nine purportedly linked regions and agree with
   the previously published results from a subset of these data for three
   regions. In summary, results from two new analytical techniques
   establish and confirm linkage with SLE at 4p16-15.2, indicate epistasis
   between 4p16-15.2 and 5p15, and confirm other linkage effects with SLE
   that have been reported elsewhere.}},

Abstract = {{We aimed to identify determinants of condom usage and unsafe sex in
   women having sex with a new partner. One hundred women attending either
   a genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic or a family planning clinic
   participated in the study. Respondents were interviewed about last 3 new
   male partners, from the beginning of the sexual relationship through its
   development, if any. Data analysis was primarily qualitative,
   quantitative analysis was conducted where appropriate. Alternative
   contraceptive use was the most commonly reported determinant of condom
   usage overall. The most commonly reported determinant of condom use for
   prophylaxis was the woman's perception of her partner and the risks he
   presented. Models of risky sexual behaviour have focused on the
   individual's generalized estimation of risks of acquiring STDs. Existing
   models are poor predictors of risky sexual behaviour. We propose that it
   is the perceived risk presented by a particular individual partner, not
   global risk, which influences behaviour. An individual risk model is put

Abstract = {{An integrated computational tool named the Production Planning Model
   (ProdMod) has been developed to simulate the operation of the entire
   high-level-waste complex (HLW) at the Savannah River Site (SRS) over its
   full life cycle. ProdMod is used to guide SRS management in operating
   the waste complex in an economically efficient and environmentally sound
   manner. SRS HLW operations are modeled using coupled algebraic
   equations. The dynamic nature of plant processes is modeled in the form
   of a linear construct in which the time dependence is implicit. Batch
   processes are modeled in discrete event-space, while continuous
   processes are modeled in time-space. The ProdMod methodology maps
   between event-space and time-space such that the inherent mathematical
   discontinuities in batch process simulation are avoided without
   sacrificing any of the necessary detail in the batch recipe steps.
   Modeling the processes separately in event-space and time-space using
   linear constructs, and then coupling the two spaces, has accelerated the
   speed of simulation compared to a typical dynamic simulation. The
   ProdMod simulator models have been validated against operating data and
   other computer codes. Case studies have demonstrated the usefulness of
   the ProdMod simulator in developing strategies that demonstrate
   significant cost savings in operating the SRS HLW complex and in
   verifying the feasibility of newly proposed processes.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed the effect of plant patch shape and surrounding vegetation

   and on the density of their aphid prey Brevicoryne brassicae (L.).
   Between spring 1997 and fall 1999, we set up square and I-shaped patches
   of Brassica oleracea Plenck surrounded by Medicago sativa L. or Allium
   porrum L. Medicago sativa is frequently used by coccinellids, whereas A.
   porrum is not. We used a factorial (2 x 2) randomized block design, and
   evaluated the density of coccinellids and aphids every 10 d. We also
   evaluated emigration and immigration of adult coccinellids through
   mark-recapture experiments. We quantified the population increase of
   aphids, and the final live mass of plants. All insects were more
   abundant in patches surrounded by A. porrum than in those surrounded by
   nl. sativa, and coccinellids were occasionally more dense in square
   patches than in I-shaped ones. Coccinellids emigrated less from square
   patches, either surrounded by A. porrum or M. sativa, and immigrated
   more to patches surrounded by A. porrum. Aphids showed a higher
   population increase, and plants of B. oleracea ended up being heavier in
   patches surrounded by ii. porrum, particularly in I-shaped patches.
   Surrounding vegetation and plant patch shape seem to have a direct
   effect oil the density of coccinellids by modifying their immigration
   and emigration patterns, but also seem to have an indirect effect by
   changing plant growth and its effect on herbivore recruitment.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the functional implications of postnatal changes in
   the expression of the mitochondrial transporter protein,
   2-oxoglutarate-malate carrier (OMC). Online C-13 nuclear magnetic
   resonance (C-13 NMR) measurements of isotope kinetics in hearts from
   neonate (3-4 days) and adult rabbits provided tricarboxylic acid cycle
   flux rates and flux rates through OMC. Neonate and adult hearts
   oxidizing 2.5 mM {[}2,4-C-13(2)]butyrate were subjected to either normal
   or high cytosolic redox state (2.5 mM lactate) conditions to evaluate
   the recruitment of malate-aspartate activity and the resulting OMC flux.
   During development from neonate (3-4 days) to adult, mitochondrial
   protein density in the heart increased from 19 +/- 3\% to 31 +/- 2\%,
   whereas OMC expression decreased by 65\% per mitochondrial protein
   content (P < 0.05). Correspondingly, OMC flux was lower in adults hearts
   than in neonates by 73\% (neonate = 7.4 +/- 0.4, adult = 2.0 +/- 0.1
   <mu>mol/min per 100 mg mitochondrial protein; P < 0.05). Despite clear
   changes in OMC content and flux, the responsiveness of the
   malate-aspartate shuttle to increased cytosolic NADH was similar in both
   adults and neonates with an approximate threefold increase in OMC flux
   (in densitometric units/100 mg mitochondrial protein: neonate = 25.8 +/-
   2.5, adult = 6.0 +/- 0.2; P < 0.05). The C-13 NMR data demonstrate that
   OMC activity is a principal component of the rate of labeling of
   glutamate.}},

Abstract = {{A suitable concentration of clove oil for anaesthetizing eight common
   Australian intertidal fishes was 40 mg l(-1). Induction and recovery
   times at this concentration varied markedly interspecifically, although
   were <3 and 5 min, respectively for all but Enneapterygius rufopileus.
   The number of species in clove oil samples was remarkably similar to
   bilge pumping samples in both small and large pools, although the number
   of individuals was significantly lower than bilge pumping in large
   pools. Number of species and individuals recorded by visual census
   differed from clove oil and bilge pumping methods in both large and
   small pools. Failure to detect all fish in pools by clove oil sampling
   and visual census was due to the secretive behaviour of many species and
   the tendency for such species as Bathygobius cocosensis not to emerge
   from under rocks during induction to anaesthesia. Complete draining of
   pools by bilge pumping, although time consuming, was a more accurate
   method of sampling rockpool fish assemblages than clove oil. However,
   clove oil is an effective stand-alone sampling method because the number
   of fish and individuals are remarkably similar to samples obtained by
   bilge pumping. Clove oil is a favourable anaesthetic for temperate
   Australian intertidal fishes as mortality is extremely low, it is
   inexpensive and user-safe, and induction and recovery times are short,
   although still sufficient to record biological information and
   identifications of fish whilst under anaesthesia. (C) 2000 The Fisheries

Abstract = {{We present data on optical properties for stoichiometric (MgO . Al2O3)
   and non-stoichiometric (MgO . 2Al(2)O(3)) spinel crystals: (1) nominally
   pure; (2) doped with transition metals Mn, Cr, and Fe to a concentration
   of 0.01 wt\%; (3) irradiated with neutrons to a fluence of 1.8x10(21)
   m(-2); (4) post-annealed at 650 K. The temperature during neutron
   irradiation was 350 K. Optical absorption and thermoluminescence
   measurements were performed on irradiated and annealed samples at room
   temperature. Results of absorption measurements show spectra with the
   following features: (1) a prominent band at 2.33 eV (for stoichiometric
   spinel); (2) overlapping bands attributed to hole centers (3.17 eV); (3)
   optical centers on antisite defects (3.78 and 4.14 eV); (4) F+-;and
   F-centers (4.75 and 5.3 eV); (5) bands related to defect complexes. For
   nominally pure samples, the efficiency of optical center formation in
   stoichiometric spinel is half that in non-stoichiometric spinel. Doped
   crystals exhibit high efficiencies for defect creation, independent of
   spinel composition. All dopants enhance the efficiency of defect
   creation in spinel. Doping with Mn has the least effect on increasing
   the number of radiation-induced stable defects. Apparently, impurities
   in spinel serve as centers for stabilization of irradiation-induced
   interstitials or vacancies. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   investigating the joint local influence of the observations, we also
   obtain the elliptical norm of the empirical influence function as a

Abstract = {{A new azobenzene-containing gelator for low-molar-mass liquid crystals
   (LCs) was synthesized. It can effectively gel nematic LCs such as E7
   through the formation of a hydrogen-bonded network. Moreover, an
   intriguing self-assembly process was observed. When thin films of the
   E7/gelator mixture, cast on CaF2 crystal windows or glass slides, are
   cooled from the isotropic phase, at temperatures below but close to the
   sol-gel phase transition, aggregation of the gelator starts from the
   edge of the film, and the fiberlike aggregates grow predominantly normal
   to the edge, leading to the formation of an oriented network at the
   macroscopic scale in the liquid gel state. On further cooling through
   the phase transition from liquid gel to nematic gel, the aligned
   fiberlike aggregates induce a long-range molecular orientation of E7, in
   the direction perpendicular to the fibers. The end result of this is a
   self-assembled anisotropic LC gel formed in the absence of any external
   effects such as surface treatment for the substrates or irradiation for
   the azobenzene groups on the gelator molecules.}},

Abstract = {{A remnant meningioma of WHO grade I that is located at the base of the
   skull and is treated with radiotherapy has to be followed up for at
   least 5-10 years to evaluate the treatment effect and detect recurrence.
   The tumour has to grow considerably to show detectable volume increase
   on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Owing
   to the location at the base of the skull, a small increase in tumour
   volume may be hazardous. It is thus important to find a method to
   evaluate treatment effects earlier and potentially detect those tumours
   that have a tendency to grow. Nineteen patients with intracranial
   meningiomas were given irradiation with the 180-MeV proton beam at the
   Svedberg Laboratory, Uppsala, Sweden. The fractionation schedule used
   was in general a total dose of 24 Gy in four consecutive daily 6-Gy
   fractions. Serial C-11-L-methionine PET examinations were used to
   evaluate the effect of stereotactic proton beam treatment. The
   radioactivity uptake in the tumour was evaluated as the ratio to the
   uptake in normal brain tissue. The follow-up period thus far is 36
   months. In 15 of the 19 patients, C-11-L-methionine uptake was reduced
   36 months after irradiation compared with the pre-treatment uptake of
   the tracer. In the total patient group the average reduction was 19.4\%.
   Our results reveal that proton beam irradiation of meningiomas had an
   inhibitory effect on the methionine uptake in the meningiomas, although
   tumour size remained unchanged. The combination of unchanged tumour
   morphology and a reduction in methionine uptake after irradiation
   suggests that C-11-L-methionine PET might enable earlier evaluation of
   the treatment effect than is possible with CT or MRI.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a rapid-turnover culture system where the life span of
   a human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected cell is controlled by
   periodic addition of a cytotoxic agent, mitomycin C. These mitomycin
   C-exposed cells are cocultured with a constant number of uninfected
   cells as new targets for the virus. Passage of the virus-infected cells
   under these conditions led to the emergence of a viral variant that was
   able to replicate efficiently in this culture system. After biologic and
   molecular cloning, we were able to identify a single frameshift mutation
   in the vpu open reading frame that was sufficient for growth of the
   mutant virus in the rapid-turnover assay. This virus variant spread more
   efficiently by cell-to-cell transfer than the parental virus did.
   Electron micrographs of cells infected with the Delta vpu virus revealed
   a large number of mature viral capsids attached to the plasma membrane.
   The presence of these mature virus particles on the cell surface led to
   enhanced fusion and formation of giant syncytia with uninfected cells.
   Enhanced cell-to-cell transfer of the Delta vpu virus provides an
   explanation for the survival of this mutant virus in the rapid-turnover
   culture system. The in vitro rapid-turnover culture system is a good
   representation of the in vivo turnover kinetics of infected cells and
   their continual replacement by host lymphopoietic mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the study reported in this paper was to identify stress
   factors in the early stage of acute traumatic hand injury. Stress
   factors were defined as circumstances which the hand-injured patients
   experienced as problems in the actual situation. A total of 20 patients,
   treated as inpatients at the Department of Hand Surgery in Orebro
   Medical Centre Hospital, Sweden, were interviewed 8-20 days after the
   day of the accident. The analyses of the interviews followed the first
   step in the analytical process described in a modified model of grounded
   theory. The trauma experience was one of the stress factors in the early
   stage. Single acute traumatic stress symptoms, mostly involuntary
   recollection and re-experience of the trauma, were found in a fourth of
   the hand-injured patients. All patients reported impaired functioning
   caused by their hand, irrespective of injury. Practical problems with
   daily activities and being dependent on help from others for solving
   practical problems were stress factors caused by functional impairment.
   Before the accident most of the hand-injured had been very active, also
   working a lot with their hands in their leisure-time. Involuntary
   inactivity was a big problem for some of them. Other stress factors in
   the early stage were uncertainty about function in the future and pain.
   The appearance of the hand was a minor problem before the first
   follow-up visit. Probably because the hand was hidden in a bandage.
   However, some hand-injured felt discomfort in seeing the hand when the
   dressing was changed at the first follow-up visit.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous porous media with low permeability lenses can produce
   contaminant plumes with extended tails, Highly asymmetric breakthrough
   curves cannot be described well by an advection-dispersion equation
   (ADE) with a uniform velocity and dispersion coefficient. The character
   of such a solute plume depends on many factors, including plume size,
   the geometry and arrangement of the low permeability inclusions, and the
   transport through such regions. We develop an inclusion Peclet number
   that effectively characterizes the relative importance of advection and
   diffusion for transport within a low permeability lens. This inclusion
   Peclet number is a function of the far-field velocity, the effective
   diffusion coefficient, the length scale of the inclusion, and the ratio
   of the permeability of the lens to that of the surrounding matrix. We
   investigate the effects of a single, elliptical inclusion on the arrival
   of a solute at a downgradient control plane with numerical pal-tide
   tracking. Effects specific to advection or diffusion dominance within
   the inclusion are subtle: diffusion gives rise to more distributed
   tailing whereas advection produces behavior that is more abrupt. These
   slight differences are nor enough to allow one to determine the dominant
   process within the inclusion by observing the first three temporal
   moments alone. The time scale for the dominant transport process within
   the inclusion is the primary factor affecting the contaminant tailing.
   For high inclusion Peclet numbers (when advection dominates), the
   characteristic time varies with the permeability contrast, the far-field
   velocity, and the size and geometry of the inclusion. For low inclusion
   Peclet numbers (when diffusion dominates), the characteristic time
   varies with the size of the inclusion and the effective diffusion
   coefficient. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Early graft failure, graft rejection, and autoimmune recurrence remain
   unresolved issues in islet xenotransplantation in type I diabetes. The
   first aim of this study was to examine the existence of early graft
   failure in spontaneously diabetic antoimmune NOD mice after rat islet
   transplantation under technically controlled circumstances. The second
   aim was to examine the mediators of this early xenograft dysfunction.
   First, we demonstrated a higher percentage of early xenograft failure
   (48\%) in spontaneonsly diabetic NOD mice as compared with chemically
   diabetic old NOD (13\%, P < 0.05) and C57B1/6 (7\%, P < 0.01) mice. In
   addition, in spontaneously diabetic NOD mice, xenogeneic islets
   displayed early graft failure more frequently than allogeneic (23\%, P
   less than or equal to 0.05) or isogeneic islets (7\%, P < 0.01). No
   early graft failure was observed in allotransplantation or
   isotransplantation in chemically diabetic mice. Reverse
   transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of cytokine mRNA in
   islet xenografts 8 h after transplantation showed higher levels of
   interleukin (IL)-1 mRNA in autoimmune diabetic mice compared with
   chemically diabetic old NOD mice (1.40 +/- 0.32 vs. 0.90 +/- 0.14 IL-1

Abstract = {{In order to give further insight into the potential role of PKC in the
   beneficial effects of ischemic preconditioning, we have characterized
   the production of diacylglycerol, the endogenous activator of PKC, and
   its molecular species composition in ischemic control and preconditioned
   hearts. Preconditioning was induced by 1 cycle of 5 min of ischemia
   followed by 5 min of reperfusion. In control and preconditioned groups,
   hearts were harvested under deep anesthesia at baseline (preischemia)
   and at 2, 5 and 10 min into the sustained coronary artery occlusion,
   i.e., preceding myocyte death. Diacylglycerol content and fatty acid
   composition were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and
   high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), respectively. Myocardial
   diacylglycerol content was increased at 2 min into the sustained
   ischemia in the control group (481 +/- 34 vs 292 +/- 64 ng.mg(-1) at
   baseline; p < 0.05),but was comparable to the baseline value at 5 and 10
   min. In the preconditioned group, diacylglycerol production remained
   unchanged throughout the 10-min test ischemia (317 +/- 17 at 2 min vs
   312 +/- 38 ng.mg(-1) at baseline; p = NS). A detailed analysis of the
   molecular species composition at the time of 2 min revealed a reduced
   contribution of phosphatidylinositol to diacylglycerol production in
   preconditioned myocardium (global correlation coefficient 0.57 vs 0.66
   in control myocardium) with a trend toward an enrichment of
   diacylgrycerol composition with some species originating from
   phosphatidylcholine. Thus, our study revealed that brief preconditioning
   ischemia: (1) prevents the increase of diacylglycerol content in the
   early minutes of the sustained ischemia, and (2) emphasizes the
   contribution of phosphatidylcholine in diacylglycerol formation to the
   detriment of that of phosphatidylinositol.}},

Abstract = {{In our previous works on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of lithium
   metasilicate (Li2SiO3), it has been shown that the long time behavior of
   the lithium ions in Li2SiO3 has been characterized by the component
   showing the enhanced diffusion (Levy flight) due to cooperative jumps.
   It has also been confirmed that the contribution of such component
   decreases by interception of the paths in the mixed alkali silicate
   (LiKSiO3). Namely, cooperative jumps of like ions are much decreased in
   number owing to the interception of the path for unlike alkali-metal
   ions. In the present work, we have performed a Monte Carlo simulation
   using a cubic lattice in order to establish the role of the cooperative
   jumps in the transport properties in a mixed alkali glass. Fixed
   particles (blockage) were introduced instead of the interception of the
   jump paths for unlike alkali-metal ions. Two types of cooperative
   motions (a pull type and a push type) were taken into account.
   Low-dimensionality of the jump path caused by blockage resulted in a
   decrease of a diffusion coefficient of the particles. The effect of
   blockage is enhanced when the cooperative motions were introduced.}},

   ``zigzag{''} manner around the helical axis with an axial rise of 2.2
   nm. Two repeating units give rise to the observed 4.3-nm helical repeat,
   which is practically identical to the pitch of the one-start helix
   formed. Additionally, an axially repeating pattern with a 27-nm spacing
   was found on rotary-shadowed fimbriae. Mass-per-length determination of
   unstained F18 fimbriae by STEM revealed the axially repeating unit to

Abstract = {{The treatment of teeth using veneer restorations combines aesthetic and
   functional improvements with a low destructive technique. Different
   kinds of tooth preparation techniques are described in the literature
   for this kind of restoration. This in vitro study aimed to examine the
   influence of the incisal preparation on the loadability of teeth
   restored with porcelain laminate veneers. Thirty-six selected mandibular
   incisors were randomly assigned to three groups with 12 teeth per group.
   In the first group, only the facial surface was prepared. In the second
   group, the preparation included a rounded incisal edge and a distinct
   chamfer lingually. The third group served as an unprepared control.
   Empress(R) veneers were then fabricated and cemented with a low viscous
   luting composite material. After 120 days storage in Ringer's solution,
   the specimens were loaded incisally to the point of failure. Statistical
   analysis of the results showed significant differences between the
   series (P = 0.0103). Group 2 (with preparation of the incisal edge)
   exhibited the lowest fracture resistance (466 +/- 99 N) (N, mean
   forces). When prepared only facially, the teeth restored with Empress(R)
   veneers reached the strength of unprepared teeth. Compared with the
   biting force described for incisors in the literature, the in vitro
   loadability reached in this investigation seems to jusitify the clinical
   use of both preparation designs tested.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce models for the runaway coevolution of female mating

   there is direct selection on the preference, but that it is still
   possible if there is a sufficiently large phenotypic correlation between
   the female's preference and the male's trait among mated pairs.
   Comparison of three preference functions introduced by Lande (1981)
   shows that open-ended preferences are particularly prone to a runaway,
   and that absolute preferences require very large differences between
   females in their preferences. We analyze the causes of the runaway seen

Abstract = {{Parasite communities of perch were studied in a natural lake
   (Vetamajarvi) and two reservoirs (the Kyrkosjarvi and Liikapuro
   reservoirs) located in Western Finland. All water bodies studied are
   small, shallow and humic. However, the reservoirs are more acidic than
   the lake (pH 5.9 and 5.3 vs. 6.4). Altogether, 18 parasite species were
   found, but the component communities were reduced in the harsh
   conditions of the reservoirs (12 and six species) as compared with the
   lake (17 species). In addition, the mean number of metazoan parasite
   specimens per fish was markedly lower in the reservoirs (64.3 and 14.3
   specimens) than in the lake (116.1 specimens). Our prediction on the
   depauperation of parasite communities in reservoirs as compared with the
   lake was confirmed. Many ectoparasite groups were rare and most of the
   digenean parasites using molluscs as their intermediate host were absent
   from the reservoirs due to the inability of molluscs to tolerate the
   acidic water. The only digenean parasite found in the less acidic
   reservoir was Bunodera luciopercae. There were also species that
   preferred reservoirs as was expected. The protozoan ciliate Capriniana
   piscium benefiting acidic water and Acanthocephalus lucii, due to the
   abundance of its intermediate host, were most prevalent in the reservoir
   conditions. (C) 2000 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc. Published

Abstract = {{The biological role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
   (PPAR gamma) was investigated by gene targeting and case-control study
   of the Pro12Ala PPAR gamma2 polymorphism. Homozygous PPAR gamma
   -deficient embryos died at 10.5-11.5 days post conception (dpc) due to
   placental dysfunction. Heterozygous PPAR gamma -deficient mice were
   protected from the development of insulin resistance due to adipocyte
   hypertrophy under a high-fat diet, whose phenotypes were abrogated by
   PPAR gamma agonist treatment. Heterozygous PPAR gamma -deficient mice
   showed overexpression and hypersecretion of leptin despite the smaller
   size of adipocytes and decreased fat mass, which may explain these
   phenotypes at least in part. This study reveals a hitherto unpredicted
   role for PPAR gamma in high-fat diet-induced obesity due to adipocyte
   hypertrophy and insulin resistance, which requires both alleles of PPAR
   gamma. A Pro12Ala polymorphism has been detected in the human PPAR
   gamma2 gene. Since this amino acid substitution may cause a reduction in
   the transcriptional activity of PPAR gamma, this polymorphism may be
   associated with decreased insulin resistance and decreased risk of type
   2 diabetes. To investigate this hypothesis, we performed a case-control
   study of the Pro12Ala PPAR gamma2 polymorphism. In an obese group,
   subjects with Ala12 were more insulin sensitive than those without. The
   frequency of Ala12 was significantly lower in the diabetic group,
   suggesting that this polymorphism protects against type 2 diabetes.
   These results revealed that in both mice and humans, PPAR gamma is a
   thrifty gene mediating type 2 diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{This study used intracellular recording of excitatory junction
   potentials (EJPs) and focal extracellular recording of excitatory
   junction currents (EJCs) to investigate the effects of agents that
   modulate intracellular cAMP levels on sympathetic neuroeffector
   transmission in the guinea-pig vas deferens. In this tissue,
   postjunctional electrical activity is produced by neurally released ATP.
   The adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin (0.5-5 muM) increased the
   amplitude of all EJPs evoked by trains of 20 stimuli at 1 Hz. Forskolin
   (5 muM) also increased the probability of recording EJCs without
   changing the amplitude distributions of spontaneous EJP and EJCs,
   indicating that this agent does not change the postjunctional
   sensitivity to spontaneously released quanta of ATP. EJP amplitudes were
   also increased by 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (10 muM), 8-bromo-cyclic GMP (10
   muM), the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (100
   and 1000 muM) and the beta -adrenoceptor agonist, isoprenaline (1 muM).
   The selective protein kinase A inhibitors, H-89 (10 muM) and the Rp
   isomer of adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate (Rp-cAMPS, 100
   muM), and the broad spectrum protein kinase inhibitors,
   {[}1-(5-isoquinolinesulphonyl)-3-methylpiperazine-diHCl (H-7, 100 muM)
   and staurosporine (1 muM), did not block the facilitatory effects of
   forskolin on EJP amplitude. In addition, the effects of forskolin were
   not blocked by the cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel blocker, spermine
   (50 muM).
   These results suggest that elevating intracellular cAMP levels increases
   ATP release in the guinea-pig vas deferens by a mechanism which does not
   involve activation of protein kinases A or G.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: An increasing number of women with cirrhosis are conceiving and
   carrying their pregnancies to term. However, the maternal mortality rate
   remains high (10 - 61 \%). This case report describes the management of
   a parturient with esophageal varices and thrombocytopenia. She was also
   a Jehovah's Witness.
   Clinical features: A 25-yr-old Jehovah's Witness parturient with portal
   hypertension and esophageal varices secondary to cryptogenic cirrhosis
   was referred to our obstetrical unit at eight weeks gestation. In
   addition she was thrombocytopenic with platelet counts ranging from
   42,000-67,000.mul(-1). Her esophageal varices were banded
   prophyladically on three occasions during her pregnancy. Magnetic
   resonance imaging at 32 wk gestation showed extensive caput medusa and
   dominant midline varix. Therefore, the planned mode of delivery was
   changed from Cesarean section which could result in massive hemorrhage,
   to elective induction of labour with an assisted second stage. The
   patient refused any blood product transfusion except acute hemodilution
   and cell saving if necessary during labour and delivery. Despite
   elaborate preparations for a planned vaginal delivery, she underwent an
   unanticipated rapid labour. Spinal analgesia was provided to facilitate
   smooth assisted vacuum delivery.
   Conclusion: Multidisciplinary care is the key for a successful outcome
   in parturients with cirrhosis. Periodic examination and banding of
   esophageal varices is recommended during pregnancy. Active consideration
   should be given to availing of the benefits of regional anesthesia.}},

Title = {{Hydrogeology of a coal-seam gas exploration area, southeastern British
   Columbia, Canada: Part 1. Groundwater flow systems}},
Journal = {{HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{608-622}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Discovery of high contents of methane gas in coals of the Mist Mountain
   Formation in the Elk River valley, southeastern British Columbia,
   Canada, has led to increased exploration activity for coal-seam gas
   (CSG). CSG production requires groundwater abstraction to depressurize
   the coal beds and to facilitate methane flow to the production wells.
   Groundwater abstraction will have hydrodynamic effects on the now
   system, and an understanding of the groundwater flow system is needed to
   evaluate these effects. The purpose of this paper is to describe the
   groundwater flow system in the area by means of a groundwater flow model
   and interpretation of hydrochemical and isotopic analyses of groundwater
   and surface water.
   Groundwater flow for the Weary Creek exploration area is modeled in two
   vertical sections. The model domains, based on classic upland-lowland
   conceptual flow models, are approximately 10,000 m long and 4,000 m
   deep. Each consists of a fixed water-table boundary and no-flow
   boundaries along the traces of major faults. Steady-state groundwater
   flow is calibrated to hydraulic-head, streamflow, and
   groundwater-recharge data. Simulated steady-state velocity fields define
   regional and local flow components consistent with the conceptual model.
   The results are consistent with regional trends in delta H-2, delta
   O-18, tritium, and TDS, which define two distinct groundwater groups (A
   and B) and a third of intermediate composition. An active, shallow,
   local now component (group A) is recharged in beds cropping out along
   subdued ridges; this component discharges as seeps along lower and
   mid-slope positions in the southern part of the study area. The waters
   are tritiated, relatively enriched in delta H-2 and delta O-18, and have
   low TDS. A deeper regional flow component (group B), which originates at
   a higher altitude and which discharges to the Elk River valley bottom,
   is characterized by non-tritiated groundwater with relatively depleted
   delta H-2 and delta O-18, and higher TDS.
   Groundwater contributes less than 10\% of the total direct flow to the
   Elk River, as indicated by flow measurements and by the absence of group
   A and group B characteristics in the river water. Thus it is
   hypothesized that groundwater extraction during CSG production will have
   little impact on the river. The groundwater flow model developed in this
   work is used in a companion gaper to further test this hypothesis.}},

   developing countries}},
Journal = {{PUBLIC HEALTH NUTRITION}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{375-383}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the impact of contaminant iron and geophagy on
   iron intake and status of persons living in developing countries.
   Design: Literature for review was identified by searching Medline and
   Agricola, from appropriate other texts and from three reports from the
   Opportunities for Micronutrient Interventions (OMNI) Project of USAID.
   Setting: The dietary intake of iron by people living in developing
   countries is generally high but iron deficiency remains prevalent. This
   apparent paradox is because the iron being consumed is predominantly in
   the non-haem form, which is poorly absorbed. Some of this non-haem iron
   is from contamination of food with iron from soil, dust and water; iron
   leaching into food during storage and cooking; contamination during food
   processing such as milling; and the practice of geophagy.
   Results: Although the contribution of contaminant iron to overall iron
   intake is well documented, its absorption and thus its impact on iron
   status is not. To be available for absorption, contaminant iron must
   join the common non-haem pool, i.e. be exchangeable. The absorption of
   exchangeable contaminant iron is subject to the same interactions with
   other constituents in the diet as the non-haem iron that is intrinsic to
   food. The limited available evidence suggests wide variation in
   exchangeability. In situations where a significant fraction of the
   contaminating iron joins the pool, the impact on iron status could be
   substantial. Without a simple method for predicting exchangeability, the
   impact of contaminant iron on iron status in any particular situation is
   uncertain.
   Conclusions: Interventions known to increase the absorption of iron
   intrinsic to foods will also increase absorption of any contaminant iron
   that has joined the common pool. Any positive effect of geophagy
   resulting from an increased intake of iron is highly unlikely, due to
   inhibiting constituents contained in soils and clays. The efficacy of
   approaches designed to increase the intake of contaminant iron remains
   encouraging but uncertain. An approach using multiple interventions will
   continue to be essential to reduce iron deficiency anaemia.}},

Abstract = {{Estimating regeneration establishment is hampered by the difficulty in
   collecting regeneration data and random impacts in the occurrence of
   regeneration. Artificial neural networks represent a computational
   methodology widely used to uncover the structure of a large val icr) of
   data. in general, one may recommend the application of neural networks
   in areas characterized by noise, poorly under stood intrinsic structure,
   and changing characteristics. Each of those characteristics is present
   in predicting regeneration establishment within uneven aged mixed
   species stands. In this paper ne describe a design and estimation
   procedure to predict regeneration establishment using data, from the
   experimental forest, University of Agriculture in Vienna, Austria. The
   result of the study is that the number of juvenile trees per unit area,
   the relative percentage of individuals by tree species and the mean
   regeneration height can be predicted with neural networks. The
   prediction results are more accurate than the results from the
   conventional statistical approach based on regression analyses.}},

Abstract = {{Muscle catabolism is an important component of the metabolic response to
   stress and injury, including sepsis and burn injury.,Muscle wasting and
   weakness in catabolic patients may adversely affect the outcome in these
   patients owing to delayed ambulation and involvement of respiratory
   muscles. An understanding of the regulation of muscle protein breakdown
   during sepsis and following injury therefore is of great importance from
   a clinical standpoint and is essential for the development of new
   therapeutic modalities to prevent protein loss from muscle tissue.
   Studies in experimental animals and in patients have provided evidence
   that the myofibrillar proteins actin and myosin are particularly
   sensitive to the effects of sepsis and injury. Glucocorticoids,
   interleukin-l, and tumor necrosis factor participate in the regulation
   of muscle protein breakdown. Most muscle proteins are degraded by the
   ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent proteolytic pathway. Because the
   proteasome does not degrade intact myofibrils, a calcium-dependent
   Z-band disintegration and release of myofilaments from the myofibrils
   may be an important initial step of muscle breakdown during sepsis and
   other catabolic conditions. Continued studies to define mechanisms of
   the catabolic response to stress and injury are important for improving
   the metabolic care of patients with muscle catabolism.}},

Abstract = {{Background: When managing neonatal jaundice, despite continual
   improvement of diagnostic tests and increasing knowledge regarding its
   pathogenesis, there is no single test or imaging modality that can
   reliably define biliary atresia. Early diagnosis is essential for a
   better surgical outcome. In many situations, mini-laparotomy and
   operative cholangiography may be needed to settle the definitive
   diagnosis, with the risk of having negative exploration in those
   high-risk patients with medical etiology. The use of laparoscopy may
   help in avoiding unnecessary exploration for such group of patients.
   Methods: Thirty-three patients aged between 1 and 4 months with
   conjugated hyperbilirubinemia were the subject for this study. All had a
   HIDA scan result suggestive of biliary atresia. They underwent a
   diagnostic laparoscopy before surgical exploration. When the gallbladder
   was not visualized we proceeded to laparotomy. In patients with a good
   size gallbladder visualized at laparoscopy, a laparoscopic-guided
   cholangiogram was then performed, and laparoscopic liver biopsy done for
   those who had patent biliary tree.
   Results: Two groups of patients were identified: the first group (21
   patients) showed small atretic gallbladder; 18 patients had biliary
   atresia with complete intra- and extrahepatic atresia; these patients
   underwent a Kasai hepatic-portoenterostomy. Two patients showed a patent
   gallbladder and common bile duct with atresia of the common hepatic and
   intrahepatic ducts, and they underwent a portocholecystostomy. The last
   patient showed left-sided gallbladder arising from the left lobe of the
   liver that was missed during laparoscopy, and operative cholangiogram
   showed hypoplastic biliary ducts. The second group included 12 patients
   with good-sized gallbladder, and Laparoscopic-guided percutaneous
   cholangiogram showed normal communicating patent biliary system,
   hypoplastic in 2, and they underwent laparoscopic liver biopsy. No
   mortality related to the laparoscopic procedure was encountered in this
   series, and one patient with hypoplastic gallbladder had adhesive
   intestinal obstruction on the fifth day after laparoscopy necessitating
   exploration.
   Conclusion: Laparoscopy with laparoscopic-guided cholangiography may be
   a very useful tool used in accurately diagnosing infants with conjugated
   hyperbilirubinemia, and in avoiding unnecessary laparotomies performed
   on these critical babies. J Pediatr Surg 35:1706-1709. Copyright (C)

   isolate its productivity effects across a sample of UK building

Abstract = {{Electrophysiological data suggest that alterations in the function of
   one glutamate receptor subtype may affect the function of other
   subtypes. Further, previous studies have demonstrated that NMDA receptor
   antagonists affect NMDA and kainate receptor expression in rat
   hippocampus. In order to address the mutual regulation of NMDA, AMPA,
   and kainate receptor expression in rat hippocampus, we conducted two
   experiments examining the effects of NMDA and non-NMDA glutamate
   receptor modulators on NMDA, AMPA, and kainate receptor expression using
   in situ hybridization and receptor autoradiography. NMDA receptor
   expression was preferentially affected by systemic treatments, as all
   drugs significantly altered {[}H-3]MK-801 binding, and several drugs
   increased {[}H-3]ifenprodil binding. GYKI52466 and aniracetam treatments
   resulted in changes in both {[}H-3]ifenprodil binding and NR2B mRNA
   levels, consistent with the association of this subunit and binding site
   in vitro. There were more modest effects on AMPA and kainate receptor
   expression, even by direct antagonists. Together, these data suggest
   that ionotropic glutamate receptors interact at the level of expression.
   These data also suggest that drug regimens targeting one ionotropic
   glutamate receptor subtype may indirectly affect other subtypes,
   potentially producing unwanted side effects. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The copper metallochaperone Cox17 is proposed to shuttle Cu(I) ions to
   the mitochondrion for the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase, The Cu(I)
   ions are liganded by cysteinyl thiolates, Mutational analysis on the
   yeast Cox17 reveals three of the seven cysteinyl residues to be critical
   for Cox17 function, and these three residues are present in a
   Cys-Cys-Xaa-Cys sequence motif. Single substitution of any of these
   three cysteines with serines results in a nonfunctional cytochrome
   oxidase complex. Cells harboring such a mutation fail to grow on
   nonfermentable carbon sources and have no cytochrome c oxidase activity
   in isolated mitochondria, Wild-type Cox17 purified as untagged protein
   binds three Cu(I) ions/molecule. Mutant proteins lacking only one of
   these critical Cys residues retain the ability to bind three Cu(I) ions
   and are imported within the mitochondria, In contrast, Cox17 molecules
   with a double Cys --> Ser mutation exhibit no Cu(I) binding but are
   still localized to the mitochondria, Thus, mitochondrial uptake of Cox17
   is not restricted to the Cu(I) conformer of Cox17, COX17 was originally
   cloned by virtue of complementation of a mutant containing a
   nonfunctional Cys --> Tyr substitution at codon 57, The mutant C57Y
   Cox17 fails to accumulate within the mitochondria but retains the
   ability to bind three Cu(I) ions. A C57S Cox17 variant is functional,
   and a quadruple Cox17 mutant with C16S/C36S/C47S/C57S substitutions
   binds three Cu(I) ions. Thus, only three cysteinyl residues are
   important for the ligation of three Cu(I) ions. A novel mode of Cu(I)
   binding is predicted.}},

   essential to minimize all spurious pulses including signals induced by

   discharges in the various proportional counter components. Studies have
   shown that this discharge effect occurs mainly at interfaces and in
   microscopic voids between dielectric surfaces, on contaminated surfaces,

Abstract = {{Three carcinogenesis modelling groups have both jointly and separately
   applied a multi-step carcinogenesis model with clonal expansion to one
   data set of lung tumours in rats exposed to radon (CEA, France). This
   study was designed to investigate the differences in modelling approach
   and fitting procedures used by the three groups in detail, and to
   explore possible discrepancies in the results. Using the same model
   assumptions and a (linear) radiation dependence on the first model step
   only, the three groups arrived at identical best fits, proving that the
   mathematical formalisms and fitting procedures do not lead to different
   results. However, when each group was allowed to find its own preferred
   fit for this data set, all three found a significantly better, but
   different fit to the data. All solutions indicated radiation to be an
   initiating agent and found additional radiation action necessary. The
   character of this additional radiation dependence, however, could not be
   unambiguously pinpointed. Tumour incidence data were described equally
   well when radiation dependence was taken into account in clonal
   expansion ({''}promotion{''}) or in the second mutational step
   ({''}transformation{''}); extension to three model stages also resulted
   in an adequate description. The study showed that, although the three
   groups used one carcinogenesis model in principle, different model
   assumptions and/or different methods of finding the ``best fit{''} could
   result in different descriptions of experimental data. This implies that
   on statistical grounds, different interpretations can be given for the
   action that radiation had in this data set. Different data, i.e. other
   data sets with age-dependent tumour data and/or information from
   cellular radiobiology experiments, are needed to specifically pin down
   the radiation dependence in the multi-step carcinogenesis process.}},

Abstract = {{Using weekly data on Canadian and U.S. T-bill and T-bond yields over the
   1982 to 1996 period, we find evidence in support of the generalized
   interest parity model (i.e., co-movement) for T-bond term structures but
   not for T-bill term structures. This evidence is robust to the
   introduction of fractional cointegration. However structural breaks
   induced by political uncertainty surrounding Quebec separation and
   Canada's move to Zero inflation had larger impacts on the T-bill term
   structure than on the T-bond term structure. This paper highlights the
   importance of accounting for structural breaks, and how a failure to do
   so may affect statistical analyses undertaken by both financial
   economists and practitioners. As an example, we discuss the implications
   for portfolio management. In particular; incorrect conclusions that
   Canadian and U.S. T-bill markets are not cointegrated can result in a
   less than optimal amount of diversification, thus affecting the
   performance of portfolio managers.}},

Abstract = {{The suppression of anger has been associated with the development of

   management style (anger-in and anger-out) and ambulatory blood pressure
   (ABP) in patients with repented clinic diastolic blood pressures (DBPs)
   between 90-105 mmHg, unmedicated and with no known coronary artery
   disease. A total of 128 men (46.0 years) and 66 women (46.6 years)
   participated. Fourteen percent of men and 35\% of women were classified
   as having ``white coat{''} hypertension (daytime DBP <85 mmHg). Mean
   awake and sleep DBP and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were evaluated in
   a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Anger-in and anger-oct
   scores were categorized into low, medium, and high t-scores (<50, 50-59,
   greater than or equal to 60). Results indicated that in women,
   increasing anger-in is associated with greater SBPs while awake and
   sleeping, whereas no effect was found for DBP, nor any effect in men. No
   significant association was found between gender anger-out, and ABP. The
   clinical diagnostic status of white coat hypertension was not
   differentially associated with anger-in or anger-out in men and women.
   In conclusion in a sample of mild unmedicated adults with hypertension,
   suppression of anger is associated with greater ambulatory SEP in women,

Abstract = {{Accumulation of C-14 in various tissues and organs was studied in three
   different groups of 0.8-kg Atlantic salmon Salmo salar force-fed with
   C-14(1)-glucose in order to evaluate if metabolism of glucose depended
   on adaptation to dietary carbohydrate level. The salmon had been fed
   diets supplemented with 0, 100 and 200 g maize dextrin kg(-1) for 10
   months before the experiment. The fish were force-fed 6.65 x 10(4) Bq of
   C-14(1) glucose kg(-1) BW, in gelatin capsules. Fish for analysis were
   obtained 16 h later. C-14 was measured in blood plasma, gill, kidney,
   liver and white muscle, and in lipid extract of liver.
   The liver contained most C-14, followed by heart, blood plasma, gill and
   liver lipid extract, while kidney and muscle contained the least C-14
   per gram or millilitre tissue. The muscle contained most radioactivity,
   on an estimated total tissue basis, followed by liver, blood plasma,
   gill, liver lipid extract, kidney and heart tissue. Thirty-eight per
   cent of the orally administered C-14 was recovered in the salmon adapted
   to the diet without dextrin after 16 h. This was significantly (P <
   0.05) higher than the 30\% and 32\% recovered in the salmon adapted to
   diets with 10\% and 20\% dextrin. This effect on adaptation to dietary
   dextrin level in glucose uptake or metabolism was supported by a trend
   (P < 0.10) toward higher radioactivity per gram or millilitre of each
   individual tissue in the fish adapted to the diet without dextrin, when
   compared with the other two adaptation regimes.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a spatially localized inhomogeneity into the
   two-dimensional complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. We observe that this
   can produce two types of target wave patterns: stationary and breathing.
   In both cases, far from the target center, the field variables
   correspond to an outward propagating periodic traveling wave. In the
   breathing case, however, the region in the vicinity of the target center
   experiences a periodic temporal modulation at a frequency, in addition
   to that of the wave frequency of the faraway outward waves. Thus at a
   fixed point near the target, the breathing case yields a quasiperiodic
   time variation of the field. We investigate the transition between
   stationary and breathing targets, and note the existence of hysteresis.
   We also discuss the competition between the two types of target waves

Abstract = {{The prevalence of antibiotic resistance amongst Gram-positive cocci from
   25 UK hospitals was studied over an 8 month period in 1999. A total of
   3770 isolates were tested by the sentinel laboratories using the Etest;
   these bacteria comprised 1000 pneumococci, 1005 Staphylococcus aureus,
   769 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) and 996 enterococci. To
   ensure quality, 10\% of the isolates were retested centrally, as were
   any found to express unusual resistance patterns. The prevalence of
   penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant
   enterococci and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) varied widely
   amongst the sentinel laboratories. The resistance rates to methicillin
   among S. aureus and CNS were 19.2 and 38.9\%, respectively, with MRSA
   rates in individual sentinel sites ranging from 0 to 43\%. No
   glycopeptide resistance was seen in S. aureus, but 6.5\% of CNS isolates
   were teicoplanin resistant and 0.5\% were vancomycin resistant.
   Vancomycin resistance was much more frequent among Enterococcus faecium
   (24.1\%) than E. faecalis (0.5\%) (P < 0.05), with most resistant
   isolates carrying vanA. The rate of penicillin resistance in pneumococci
   was 8.9\%, and this resistance was predominantly intermediate (7.9\%),
   with only six hospitals reporting isolates with high level resistance.
   The prevalence of erythromycin resistance among pneumococci was 12.3\%,
   with the majority of resistant isolates having the macrolide efflux
   mechanism mediated by mefE. All the organisms tested were susceptible to
   linezolid with MICs in the range 0.12-4 mg/L. The modal MICs of
   linezolid were 1 mg/L for CNS and pneumococci, and 2 mg/L for S. aureus
   and enterococci. Linezolid was the most potent agent tested against
   Gram-positive cocci, including multiresistant strains, and as such may
   prove a valuable therapeutic option for the management of Gram-positive
   infections in hospitals.}},

Abstract = {{This study connects broad issues of classroom control and the
   disciplining of pupils by teachers with a detailed examination of the
   way teachers deal with an implied accusation that they have been
   bullying. The analysis of interviews develops with reference to
   discursive psychology and Derrida's development of deconstruction.
   Billig's (1992) insights into ways that participants' accounts can
   neutralize threats to established social arrangements are employed in
   relating detailed analytic points to the broader power relations between
   teacher and pupil. Interviews were conducted with Scottish secondary
   school teachers, and subjected to close textual analysis. This resulted
   in the development of three themes: (1) Subjectivity Construction, in
   which the functional role of the construction of mental entities is
   examined; (2) Normalizing Techniques, identifying strategies whereby
   intimidation can be constructed as normal; and (3) Figuration, examining
   the utility of figurative language-metaphors, maxims, and so on. These
   themes display the subtlety and complexity of teachers' strategies for
   distancing themselves from being held accountable for reported
   intimidation. To conclude, three broader features of the study are
   discussed: the contribution to discursive psychology that Derrida's
   deconstructive philosophy can make; the respecification of psychology
   and subjectivity as participants' resources for action; and the
   contribution that this type of detailed study can make to issues of
   power and social critique.}},

Abstract = {{The present study examined the solution quality and information

   cognitive efforts. As expected, expert financial planners produced
   higher quality solutions than did novices. However, trained novices
   (individuals who attended a six hour educational intervention) were
   found to produce solutions that were twice as good as those generated by
   experts. A variety of analyses were conducted that focused on both the
   types of information individuals selected to solve the problems, and the
   efficiency with which they processed task information, in an effort to
   explain group differences in solution quality. Findings are discussed in

Abstract = {{The rncS gene of Bacillus subtilis encodes Bs-RNase III, a
   narrow-specificity endoribonuclease. Previous attempts to disrupt rncS
   were unsuccessful. Here, a strain was constructed in which Bs-RNase III
   expression was dependent upon transcription of rncS from a
   temperature-sensitive plasmid. Growth of this strain at the
   non-permissive temperature resulted in 90-95\% cell death, and virtually
   all the cells that survived retained the rncS-expressing plasmid. Thus,
   we conclude that rncS is essential in B. subtilis. The rncS conditional
   strain also revealed that Bs-RNase III participates in the processing of
   ribosomal RNA, in addition to processing small cytoplasmic RNA, a member
   of the signal recognition particle RNA family. Most significantly, a
   rare rncS null strain was isolated that will aid further study of the
   critical role Bs-RNase III plays in B. subtilis.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Patients with severe scleritis who do not respond to
   high-dose corticosteroid therapy, or who require a daily corticosteroid
   maintenance dose higher than 30 mg prednisone should be treated by other
   immunosuppressants.
   Patients and methods. In five patients with various types of severe
   anterior scleritis a long-term high-dose steroid treatment failed to
   control scleral inflammation. They therefore received cyclosporin (CsA).
   Follow up was 16-26 months.
   Results. Sceral inflammation and ocular complications were controlled in
   all patients by a regimen of systemic CsA combined with a low
   maintenance steroid dose below the Cushing threshold. We observed no
   side effects under CsA serum levels of 120-150 ng/ml. In only one
   patient was scleral inflammation totally and lastingly eliminated.
   Conclusions. Systemic CsA therapy is of definite therapeutic value in
   the symptomatic management of steroid refractory severe anterior
   scleritis without associated systemic disease. Complete healing,
   however, is achieved only in a minority of cases.}},

Abstract = {{It is well established that biofeedback and operant learning procedures
   can be used to enable humans to gain voluntary control over bodily
   functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, or muscle tension.
   Similarly, individuals can acquire control over their brain activity. In
   a typical training paradigm, visual feedback of slow cortical potential
   shifts is provided online on a computer monitor, and the desired changes
   of cortical behavior are reinforced. The efficacy of this approach has
   been demonstrated in numerous studies by Birbaumer and colleagues. The
   present paper presents two applications of slow cortical potential
   self-control. 1) Epilepsy patients show an increased brain potential
   negativity both before and during a seizure. A feedback paradigm has
   been used, teaching patients to produce positive potential shifts. A
   recent long-term study in 41 epileptic patients has demonstrated that
   the frequency of seizures dan be reduced if patients are able to control
   their cortical potentials in the absence of feedback. 2) In recent
   years, self-control of slow cortical potentials has been applied to
   communication, creating a direct interface between brain and computer in
   completely paralyzed individuals. Birbaumer and co-workers developed a
   `Thought Translation Device' (TTD) using self-regulation of slow
   cortical potentials to generate a binary signal. This response can be
   used to choose letters and words from a selection menu. Thus the TTD has
   enabled three completely paralyzed patients diagnosed with amyotrophic
   lateral sclerosis to communicate solely with their brain potentials.}},

Title = {{Player simulation and general adversary structures in perfect multiparty

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CRYPTOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{31-60}},

Abstract = {{The goal of secure multiparty computation is to transform a given
   protocol involving a trusted party into a protocol without need for the
   trusted party, by simulating the party among the players. Indeed, by the
   same means, one can simulate an arbitrary player in any given protocol.
   We formally define what it means to simulate a player by a multiparty
   protocol among a set of (new) players, and we derive the resilience of
   the new protocol as a function of the resiliences of the original
   protocol and the protocol used for the simulation.
   In contrast to all previous protocols that specify the tolerable
   adversaries by the number of corruptible players (a threshold), we
   consider general adversaries characterized by an adversary structure, a
   set of subsets of the player set, where the adversary may corrupt the
   players of one set in the structure. Recursively applying the simulation
   technique to standard threshold multiparty protocols results in
   protocols secure against general adversaries.
   The classical results in unconditional multiparty computation among a
   set of n players state that, in the passive model, any adversary that
   corrupts less than n/2 players can be tolerated, and in the active
   model, any adversary that corrupts less than n/3 players can be
   tolerated. Strictly generalizing these results we prove that, in the
   passive model, every function (more generally, every cooperation
   specified by involving a trusted party) can be computed securely with
   respect to a given adversary structure if and only if no two sets in the
   adversary structure cover the full set of players, and, in the active
   model, if and only if no three sets cover the full set of players. The
   complexities of the protocols are polynomial in the number of maximal
   adverse player sets in the adversary structure.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, we developed a system for the generation of influenza A virus

   the establishment of a different transcription system for the expression
   of virus-like RNAs, allowing the intracellular synthesis of noncapped
   positive-sense cRNA and 5'-capped mRNA from one template. Cotransfection
   of eight RNA pol I-pol II tandem promoter plasmids containing the cDNA
   of A/WSN/33 (H1N1) resulted in the generation of infectious influenza A
   virus, albeit with a lower yield than the bidirectional system. Our
   approach of producing either vRNA and mRNA or cRNA and mRNA
   intracellularly from a minimum set of plasmids should be useful for the

   Adjacent fens consist mostly of groundwater, ranging from similar to

   peatland, mixing relations suggest an additional Sr source that may be
   peat mineralization. Distinct Sr-87/Sr-86 and {[}Ca]/{[}Sr] ratios for

   for the information was assessed. Sixty-nine people (55-83 years) each
   listened to three stories (speech rates 175, 115, and 75 wpm), and read
   a fourth. Participants recalled more and recognised more accurately from
   the slowed speech. More higher order information (main points) than
   lower order information (details) was recalled, but this did not
   interact with speech rate. However, there was a speech-rate by
   recognition-error type interaction, suggesting that memory for higher
   order information (meaning) was enhanced by giving more time for
   processing at natural boundaries, and lower level information (surface
   structure) was forgotten when working memory was taxed. Although
   previous research has found a memory advantage for read text over heard
   text, we found an advantage for heard information at the slower rates.
   In conclusion, slowing speech rate at syntactic boundaries considerably
   benefited memory for heard information.}},

Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To explore resource-oriented, gender-sensitive approaches in
   general practice by identifying what men perceive to be their personal
   health resources.
   Methods. A key question was developed to invite men to tell their GPs
   about personal health resources during ordinary visits. The answers of
   39 consecutive male patients (aged 19-84 years) visiting two female GPs
   were audio taped and analysed, qualitatively inspired by Giorgi's
   phenomenological approach, supported by theories on salutogenesis,
   patient-centredness and gender perspectives. The main outcome measures
   were personal qualities and strategies considered by men to be their
   health resources.
   Results. Men considered that the following were personal health
   resources: optimism, good self-esteem, job satisfaction, ability to cope
   with stress at work, leisure activities and relaxation with friends
   producing energy, and fitness and lifestyle activities.
   Conclusion. A key question can give a doctor access to men's thoughts
   about their strong points. Self-assessed personal health resources can
   be identified and mobilized by the GP and support a salutogenic
   approach, which contrasts with the tendency of contemporary medical
   practice to focus on risk. Asking people about their own ideas may
   reveal that coping patterns are more complex than reflected in
   prevailing research.}},

Abstract = {{Lack of tumor specificity remains a major problem with chemotherapies in
   that side effects prevent the delivery of dosages of drugs that are
   required to eliminate tumors. In this report, we describe the isolation
   of a 12-mer peptide (HN-1), with similar to1\% of the mass of typical
   antibodies, that meets several criteria for targeted drug delivery into
   a solid tumor. First, internalization of HN-1 by human head and neck
   squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) cells suggests that HN-1 is capable of
   translocating drugs across cell membranes, Second, HN-1 appears to be
   HNSCC-specific, given its reduced uptake by nonmalignant human oral
   keratinocytes and other types of human cells, its preferential binding
   to primary HNSCC, and its Localization to HNSCC-derived xenografts,
   Third, the presence of HN-1 within HNSCC xenografts suggests that it is
   capable of penetrating tumor tissues. Our results establish the utility
   of tumor-specific peptides for targeted drug delivery into solid tumors.}},

   S- and N-type cell lines express TRAIL-R2, FADD, and caspases-3 and -10,
   only S-type cells express caspase-8. Reduced levers of caspase-8 protein
   were also observed in a stage IV NE tumor when compared to a
   ganglioneuroma. The caspase-8 gene is not deleted in either N-type NE
   cell lines or high-stage tumors, and expression can be induced by
   demethylation. Conclusions. Therefore, caspase-8 expression is silenced
   in malignant NE, which correlates to tumor severity and resistance to

Abstract = {{The proportion of alpha -linolenic acid (18:3) among the total fatty
   acids in root tissue increases as the growth temperature decreases.
   Endoplasmic reticulum omega -3 fatty acid desaturase is responsible for
   the production of most of the 18:3 in root tissue. In this study, the
   effect of temperature on expression of the TaFAD3 gene, which encodes
   endoplasmic reticulum omega -3 desaturase in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.
   cv. Chihoku), was analysed at the mRNA and protein levels. In wheat root
   tips grown at 30 and 10 degreesC, the proportions of 18:3 among total
   fatty acids were 22\% and 55\%, respectively. The level of TaFAD3
   protein in microsomal preparations of the root tips grown at 10 degreesC
   was approximately 7.5 times higher than that of the root tips grown at
   30 degreesC. The increased level of TaFAD3 protein at the lower
   temperature was accompanied by enhanced association of TaFAD3 mRNA with
   polyribosomes. In contrast, the level of TaFAD3 mRNA in root tips grown
   at 10 degreesC was slightly higher than in those grown at 30 degreesC.
   These results suggest that, in root tips, the increase in the 18:3 level
   at low temperature is achieved directly by an increase in the amount of
   TaFAD3 protein, and that temperature-dependent translational regulation
   of the TaFAD3 gene, rather than its transcriptional regulation,
   contributes to modulation of the TaFAD3 protein accumulation.}},

   equator. We construct a model of the proton and electron distribution
   functions from spacecraft data and use the HOTRAY code to calculate the
   path-integrated growth and decay of the waves over a range of L shells
   from L = 2 to L = 7. instability calculations show that the waves are
   excited at very large angles of propagation with respect to the magnetic
   field, psi approximate to 89 degrees, at the harmonics of the proton
   gyrofrequency Omega (H+) up to the lower hybrid resonance frequency
   omega (LHR) by a proton ring distribution at energies of the order of 10
   keV. As a ``rule of thumb{''}, we find that growth is possible for omega
   > 30 Omega (H+) when the ring velocity exceeds the Alfven speed nu (R) >
   nu (A), and for omega < 30Omega>(H+) when nu (R) > 2 nu (A) For
   propagation in the meridian plane, waves generated just outside the
   plasmapause grow with large amplification as they propagate away from
   the Earth but eventually lose energy to plasma sheet electrons at
   energies of a few keV by Landau damping. The waves grow to large
   amplification at frequencies just below omega (LHR) For inward
   propagation we find that waves generated just outside the plasmapause
   can propagate to L approximate to 2 with very little attenuation,
   suggesting that waves observed well inside the plasmasphere could
   originate from a source region just outside the plasmapause. Strong wave
   growth only occurs for large angles of propagation, and thus the waves
   are confined to within a few degrees of the magnetic equator. Waves
   generated near geostationary orbit and which propagate toward the Earth
   are absorbed by Doppler-shifted cyclotron resonance when they propagate
   into a region where nu (R) nu>(A). Cyclotron resonant absorption causes
   pitch angle scattering and heating transverse to the ambient magnetic
   field. The amount of absorption, and hence transverse proton heating,
   increases significantly as the thermal proton temperature is increased
   up to 100 eV, suggesting a feedback process. Ray tracing shows that
   transverse heating of the thermal proton distribution is most likely to
   occur just outside the plasmapause where nu (A) is large. Since proton
   ring distributions are formed during magnetic storms at ring current
   energies, we suggest that fast magnetosonic waves provide an additional
   energy loss process for ring current decay.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To evaluate the association between infection with Mycoplasma
   fermentans (Mf) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other inflammatory
   arthritides.
   Methods. Screening of synovial fluid samples (SF) for Mf was done by
   culture and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 38 and 34 RA patients,
   respectively, 8 undifferentiated arthritis (UDA), 9 reactive arthritis
   (ReA), and in 40 other arthritides. The prevalence of antibodies to Mf
   in these SF was determined by both ELISA and immunoblotting (IB).
   Antibodies were measured also in sera of 88 RA patients, 28 ReA, 14 UDA,
   71 other arthritides, and in 102 healthy blood donors.
   Results. All SF were culture-negative for Mf, while 7 SF were positive
   by PCR (6/34 RA and 1/8 UDA). SF from patients with other arthritides
   and ReA were PCR-negative. The prevalence of anti-Mf antibodies in SF of
   RA patients was significantly higher than in SF of other arthritides (p
   = 0.01). In 47\% (17/38) of all RA (including the 6 PCR-positive
   patients), the level of antibodies to Mf in their SF was higher than
   that in sera, compared to 7.5\% (3/40) in other arthritides (p =
   0.0002). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of serum
   antibodies to Mf between patients with RA, other arthritides, and
   healthy controls. By IB with Mf sonicate, binding to Mf peptides P107,
   P48, and P29 was detected in SF of 7/11 RA patients but not in 11
   patients with traumatic arthritis. Specific binding to Mf membrane
   lipoproteins was also more prevalent in SF of RA patients than in other
   arthritides (p = 0.038).
   Conclusion. The finding that both Mf DNA and specific antibodies to Mf
   were present in the SF of RA patients suggests that in some RA patients
   Mf may play a role in initiating or perpetuating synovitis.}},

Abstract = {{Ten Spagnum fuscum peat samples collected from different depths of a
   core including the layer affected by the 1908 Tunguska explosion in the
   Tunguska area of Central Siberia, Russia, were analyzed by ICP-MS to
   determine the concentrations of Pd, Rh, Ru, Co, REE, Y, Sr, and Sc. The
   analytical results indicate that the Pd and Rh concentrations in the
   event- and lower layers were 14.0-19.9, and 1.23-1.56 ppb, respectively,
   about 3-9 times and 3 times higher than the background values in the
   normal layers. In addition, the patterns of CI-chondrite-normalized REE
   in the event layers were much flatter than in the normal layers, and
   differed from those in the nearby traps. Hence, it can be inferred from
   the characteristics of the elemental geochemistry that the explosion was
   probably associated with extraterrestrial material, and which, most
   probably, was a small comet core the dust fraction of which was
   chemically similar to carbonaceous chondrites (CI). In terms of the Pd
   and REE excess fluxes in the explosion area, it can be estimated that
   the celestial body that exploded over Tunguska in 1908 weighed more than
   10(6) t, corresponding to a radius of > 60 m. If the celestial body was
   a comet, then its total mass was more than 2 x 10(7) t, and it had > 160

Abstract = {{APPROXIMATELY thirty years ago, G. Craven and C. Mok presented their
   theory of evanescent dominant-mode waveguide bandpass filters.(1) The
   theory derives the equivalent ladder network from the lowpass prototype
   through an iterative technique, and is accurate for narrow-to-moderate
   bandwidths up to 20 percent. In 1989, J. Howard and W. Lin repeated
   Craven and Mok's work using the well-known ``Q{''} technique where the
   individual resonator quality factors (Qs) are used in the design of
   evanescent waveguide-bandpass filters.(2) The advantage of this method
   is that the Q of the individual lumped-type filter resonators can be
   compared to their evanescent-mode counterparts. This permits further
   improvement of the evanescent-mode bandpass filter's performance. The
   techniques previously mentioned require an iterative method to arrive at
   the required evanescent-waveguide obstacle positions.}},

Abstract = {{The lipooligosaccharide (LOS) of Haemophilus somnus undergoes antigenic
   phase variation, which may facilitate evasion from the bovine host
   immune response and/or colonization and dissemination. However, LOS
   antigenic diversity in H, somnus has not been adequately investigated.
   In this study, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific to various LOS
   epitopes were used to investigate antigenic variation and stability in
   LOS from H, somnus strains and phase variants. Clinical isolates of H.
   somnus exhibited intrastrain, as well as interstrain, antigenic
   heterogeneity in LOS when probed with MAbs to outer core oligosaccharide
   epitopes in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), However,
   epitopes reactive with MAbs directed predominately to the inner core
   heptose region were highly conserved. At least one epitope, which was
   expressed in few strains, was identified. One LOS component affected by
   phase variation was identified as phosphorylcholine (PCho), which is
   linked to the primary glucose residue. Inhibition ELISA, immunoblotting,
   and electrospray-mass spectrometry were used to confirm that MAb 5F5.9
   recognized PCho, LOS reactivity with MAb 5F5.9 was associated with loss
   of most of the outer core oligosaccharide, indicating that reactivity
   with PCho was affected by phase variation of the glycose residues in
   this region. Our results indicate that outer core epitopes of H. somnus
   LOS exhibit a high degree of random, phase-variable antigenic
   heterogeneity and that such heterogeneity must be considered in the
   design of vaccines and diagnostic tests.}},

Title = {{Effect of saikosaponin, a triterpene saponin, on apoptosis in
   lymphocytes: association with c-myc, p53, and bcl-2 mRNA}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1 The mechanisms involved in the apoptotic effect of saikosaponin-d. a
   triterpene saponin from Bupleurum falcatum L., were studied in human CEM
   lymphocytes and compared with those of dexamethasone (3 x 10(-7) M).
   2 Saikosaponin-d (10(-8) to 10(-5) M) inhibited the serum-stimulated
   {[}H-3]-thymidine incorporation in a concentration-dependent manner.
   Dexamethasone also inhibited serum-stimulated {[}H-3]-thymidine
   incorporation.
   3 Cell viability was unaffected by saikosaponin-d until 10(-5)-10(-4) M.
   Dexamethasone significantly reduced the number of viable cells.
   4 Following saikosaponin-d (10(-5)-10(-4) M) treatment. flow cytometry
   analysis of propidium iodide-stained cells showed a significant increase
   in the percentage of cells in the apoptotic region. Dexamethasone also
   significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells. The
   supravital exposure to propidium iodide and annexin V labelling
   demonstrated that saikosaponin-d (10(-5)-10(-4) M) induced apoptosis as
   well as necrosis.
   5 The apoptotic effect of saikosaponin-d (3 x 10(-6)-10(-4) M) was also
   demonstrated by TUNEL analysis and DNA laddering. The percentage of
   apoptotic cells induced by saikosaponin-d (3 x 10(-6)-10(-5) M) was
   unaffected by the presence of Z-VAD-FMK, indicating that
   saikosaponin-d-induced apoptosis may not be mediated by caspase
   activity. However, the percentage of apoptotic cells induced by
   dexamethasone was significantly reduced by the presence of Z-VAD-FMK.
   6 Levels of c-myc, p53, and bcl-2 mRNA were analysed by the reverse
   transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Levels of c-myc and p53 mRNA
   were significantly increased, while the level of bcl-2 mRNA was
   decreased, by saikosaponin-d (10(-5) M) treatment. Dexamethasone did not
   significantly change the expression of these genes.
   7 It is suggested that the apoptotic effect of saikosaponin-d may be
   partly mediated by increases in c-myc and p53 mRNA levels accompanied by
   a decrease in bcl-2 mRNA level.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection is
   associated with a shift in the target cell population, driven by
   variability in coreceptor utilization resulting from diversity in env.
   To elucidate the potential consequences of these changes for
   Env-mediated fusion over the course of AIDS, we examined the biological
   properties of serial viral isolates and determined coreceptor
   utilization by the products of env cloned from two individuals, followed
   from the detection of seroconversion throughout the course of their
   infection. One had a typical course, and the other had an accelerated
   progression. Early isolates were non-syncytium inducing, and the
   corresponding Env exclusively utilized CCR5, whereas Env from late
   phases of infection showed restricted utilization of CXCR4 in both
   patients. Env from subject SC24, who had a standard progression,
   demonstrated multitropism, manifested by utilization of CCR3, CXCR4, and
   CCR5 in the intervening period. In contrast, Env from patient SC51, who
   experienced early conversion to the syncytium-inducing phenotype,
   developed dualtropic coreceptor utilization of CCR5 and CXCR4. Genetic
   analysis of env from each isolate revealed that those with an X4
   phenotype formed a distinct subcluster within each subject. Analysis of
   chimeras constructed from R5 and multispecific env from patient SC24
   demonstrated that while the V3 domain played a dominant role in
   determining coreceptor utilization, sequences in the V4-V5 region also
   contributed to the latter phenotype. Immunoprecipitation experiments
   confirmed that the hybrid Env proteins were expressed at similar levels.
   These experiments demonstrate that progression from the R5 to X4
   phenotype may occur through a multi- or dual-tropic intermediate and
   that multiple domains contribute to this process.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluates the possible impact of carbon taxes on the most
   important sector of a newly industrialized economy. Changes in the
   energy consumption pattern and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions
   are analyzed for the entire manufacturing sector as well as four
   energy-intensive industries of Taiwan. A carbon tax is imposed as a
   predetermined, fixed tax on each type of energy according to its carbon
   content. Simulations are performed, using a two-stage translog price
   model, for a reference case and for four different levels of carbon
   taxes. The results indicate that a high tax is expected to stabilize CO2
   emissions to the 1990 level by the year 2005 while maintaining a 5\%
   growth rate in the manufacturing sector. Reductions in energy
   consumption and CO2 emissions resulting from such taxes are substantial,
   and are sensitive to the tax level. Prices of energy aggregates increase
   due to a carbon tax and are directly related to the increase in the
   level of the carbon tax. Industries react differently to the tax in
   choosing their energy mix. Specifically, a decrease in the share
   allocated to coal inputs and an increase in the shares of oil, natural
   gas, and noncarbon energy inputs in its energy mix is observed in the
   electricity generation sector.}},

Abstract = {{Two main troponin I genes, cardiac (cTnI) and slow skeletal (ssTnI), are
   expressed in the mammalian heart under the control of a developmentally
   regulated program, ssTnI is expressed first in embryonic and fetal
   heart, and is then downregulated by an unknown mechanism after birth.
   Unlike other contractile protein genes, ssTnI is not re-expressed during
   hypertrophy or end-stage heart failure in rats and humans, In the
   present study, we also show that ssTnI re-expression does not occur in
   hypertrophic mouse heart. To investigate ssTnI downregulation further,
   cTnI knockout mice were used to examine a possible role for thyroid
   hormone, Northern blot analysis of euthyroid animals showed a
   time-dependent loss of ssTnI mRNA that was similar for wild-type,
   heterozygous and homozygous cTnI mutant mice. In cTnI null mice made
   hyperthyroid by L-thyroxine, the duration of ssTnI expression assessed
   by both mRNA and protein content was abbreviated compared with the
   euthyroid group, Hyperthyroid cTnI null mice also died significantly
   earlier than euthyroids (postnatal day 14 v day 18), In cTnI null mice
   made hypothyroid by addition of phenylthiouracil to the drinking water,
   ssTnI expression was prolonged and mice survived until day 20 or 21,
   Overall, the results indicate that inactivation of the ssTnI gene occurs
   even in the absence of cTnI mRNA and protein indicating that these are
   not critical signals for ssTnI down regulation in the heart. In
   contrast, thyroid hormone influences the time course of ssTnI expression
   and the life span of cTnI null mice probably through a transcriptional
   regulation of ssTnI in the heart. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{This study reevaluates the persuasive impact of emotional visual appeals
   within politics and examines two different explanations for their
   effects. One possibility is that the effects of emotive visual images
   are essentially superficial in nature, consistent with the view that
   feelings aroused by an affective image are transferred somewhat
   mechanically to a political candidate or cause with which it is paired.
   This transfer-of-affect explanation suggests that emotional appeals may
   work best among the least informed voters or those paying the least
   attention to a persuasive political message. The second possibility is
   that emotional appeals work via passionate reason, in which affective
   responses to an emotive image are integrated with, and potentially bias,
   reasoned thought about the accompanying message. This integrated
   approach leads to the counterintuitive prediction that individuals who
   are most highly involved in an issue (and who know the most about it)
   are most influenced by emotional imagery. This prediction arises from
   growing evidence that people highly involved in value-laden social
   issues generate the strongest emotional responses to issue-related
   persuasive appeals. These two models were tested in a study in which
   undergraduate students were presented with a picture of a cute or an
   ugly animal and a flyer from an organization advocating a pro- or
   anti-environment stance with respect to preserving the animal's habitat.
   The responses showed that emotive imagery was most persuasive among the
   most involved environment supporters, providing clear evidence of
   passionate reasoning.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To compare the new hydroxyethyl starch HES 130/0.4 (Voluven(R))
   and the standard HES 200/0.5 (pentastarch) regarding effectiveness for
   plasma volume substitution and safety of large volumes in heart surgery.
   Methods: Fifty-nine patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass
   grafting were enrolled in a prospective, randomised, double-blind,
   parallel-group, multicentre, clinical, phase III study, Hydroxyethyl
   starch was used as the exclusive artificial colloid for acute
   normovolemic hemodilution, priming of the heart lung machine, and for
   intra- and postoperative plasma volume substitution from induction of
   anesthesia until 16 hr after the end of surgery. Efficacy was evaluated
   by comparing the amount of colloid infused, hemodynamics, and colloid
   osmotic pressure (COP). Safety endpoints were blood loss, the use of
   allogeneic blood products, coagulation variables, and adverse events.
   Results: Effectiveness, as assessed by the total amount of infused HES
   volumes within the treatment period, was similar between HES 130/0.4 and
   HES 200/0.5 (2550 mL +/- 561 mL vs 2466 mL +/- 516 mL). Also, no
   differences were found for the use of other colloids (pasteurised
   plasma), hemodynamics, and COP In HES 130/0.4 patients, the
   postoperative increase of von-Willebrand factor (vWF) was higher (P <
   0.01), blood loss was lower, and less packed red blood cells were
   transfused.
   Conclusion: Hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 is an effective plasma volume
   expander in heart surgery and may be used as the sole artificial colloid
   to cover the perioperative period. We found a reduced influence of HES
   130/0.4 on the physiologic postoperative increase of vWF.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic spectra of phenanthrene (P), 1-methyl phenanthrene (1-MeP),
   2-methyl phenanthrene (2-MeP) and their monopositive ions are
   investigated experimentally as well as theoretically. The ions were
   produced by photo-oxidation of the hydrocarbons in boric acid matrix.
   The electronic absorption spectrum of 2-methyl phenanthrene cation
   (2-MeP+) is entirely new. For the interpretation of the electronic
   spectra of neutral and ionized MePs, semi-empirical AM1 (Austin Model 1)
   calculations are carried out for the first time. The bathochromic shifts
   in the spectral bands of the neutral and ionized MePs are attributed to
   `conjugative' effect. The present experiments reveal that the 448 nm
   band of 1-methyl phenanthrene cation (1-MeP+) and the 486 nm band of
   2-MeP+ show close matching with the respective 450 nm and 488 nm
   `diffuse interstellar bands'. This suggests the possibility of the
   existence of such ionic species in the interstellar matter. (C) 2000
