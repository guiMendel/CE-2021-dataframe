Abstract = {{Stochastic switching between alternative phenotypic states is a common
   cellular survival strategy during unforeseen environmental fluctuations.
   Cells can switch between different subpopulations that proliferate at
   different rates in different environments. Optimal population growth is
   typically assumed to occur when phenotypic switching rates match
   environmental switching rates. However, it is not well understood how
   this optimum behaves as a function of the growth rates of phenotypically
   different cells. In this study, we use mathematical and computational
   models to test how the actual parameters associated with optimal
   population growth differ from those assumed to be optimal. We find that
   the predicted optimum is practically always valid if the environmental
   durations are long. However, the regime of validity narrows as
   environmental durations shorten, especially if subpopulation growth rate
   differences differ from each other (are asymmetric) in two environments.
   Furthermore, we study the fate of mutants with switching rates
   previously predicted to be optimal. We find that mutants which match
   their phenotypic switching rates with the environmental ones can only
   sweep the population if the assumed optimum is valid, but not otherwise.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by bandwidth allocation under interference constraints in
   radio networks, we define and investigate an optimization problem that
   combines the classical flow and edge coloring problems in graphs. Let G
   = (V, E) be a graph with a demand function b : V -> Z(+) and a gateway g
   is an element of V \textbackslash{} V-s, where V-s = \{v is an element
   of V : b(v) > 0\} is the set of source nodes. A flow phi(u) of a source
   node u is a multiset of b(u) paths in G from u tog. A flow phi on G is a
   set with one flow for each source node. Every flow phi defines a
   multigraph G(phi) with vertex set V and all edges in the paths in phi. A
   distance-d edge coloring of a flow is an edge coloring of Go such that
   two edges with the same color are at distance at least d in G. The
   distance-d flow coloring problem (FCPd) is the problem of obtaining a
   flow phi on G with a distance-d edge coloring where the number of used
   colors is minimum. For any fixed d >= 3, we prove that FCPd is NP-hard
   even on a bipartite graph with just one source node. For d = 2, we also
   prove NP-hardness on a bipartite graph with multiples sources. Ford = 1,
   we show that the problem is polynomial in 3-connected graphs and
   bipartite graphs. Finally, we show that a list version of the problem is
   inapproximable in polynomial time by a factor of 0(log n) even on
   n-vertex paths, for any d >= 1. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{516-528}},

Abstract = {{Factors related to sleeping site selection in terrestrial and
   semi-arboreal mammals vary depending on the environmental conditions
   they live in and the suite of species they interact with. These factors
   include proximity to food resources and availability of suitable sites
   that offer protection from severe weather and from risk of predation. We
   explored habitat characteristics which may influence sleeping site
   selection of masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and binturongs
   (Arctictis binturong) and assessed whether selection was related to food
   resources and/or reduction of predation risk. Most of the sleeping sites
   were in trees close to canopy level (c. 19-24 m). A majority of the
   sites consisted of tangled structures created by vines, leaves and/or
   woody climbers and moderate to high levels of canopy cover which
   typically concealed sleeping animals from below and above. However,
   selection of sleeping sites did not appear to be related to density of
   fruiting stems within the sites, probably because fruits may have been
   available in similar quantities across home ranges. Although sleeping
   site selection varied among individuals, selection appeared to reflect
   choices for habitat characteristics at both sleeping trees and sleeping
   sites to enhance concealment. While enhanced concealment may have
   multiple benefits, we postulate that it is mostly likely intended to
   reduce predation risk.}},

Title = {{Coalescence of exceptional points and phase diagrams for one-dimensional
   PT-symmetric photonic crystals}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 31}},
Abstract = {{Non-Hermitian systems with parity-time- (PT)- symmetric complex
   potentials can exhibit a phase transition when the degree of
   non-Hermiticity is increased. Two eigenstates coalesce at a transition
   point, which is known as the exceptional point (EP) for a discrete
   spectrum and spectral singularity for a continuous spectrum. The
   existence of an EP is known to give rise to a great variety of novel
   behaviors in various fields of physics. In this work, we study the
   complex band structures of one-dimensional photonic crystals with
   PT-symmetric complex potentials by setting up a Hamiltonian using the
   Bloch states of the photonic crystal without loss or gain as a basis. As
   a function of the degree of non-Hermiticity, two types of PT symmetry
   transitions are found. One is that a PT-broken phase can reenter into a
   PT-exact phase at a higher degree of non-Hermiticity. The other is that
   two EPs, one originating from the Brillouin zone center and the other
   from the Brillouin zone boundary, can coalesce at some k point in the
   interior of the Brillouin zone and create a singularity of higher order.
   Furthermore, we can induce a band inversion by tuning the filling ratio
   of the photonic crystal, and we find that the geometric phases of the
   bands before and after the inversion are independent of the amount of
   non-Hermiticity as long as the PT-exact phase is not broken. The
   standard concept of topological transition can hence be extended to
   non-Hermitian systems.}},

Abstract = {{Rotational spectra of weakly bound complexes of chlorofluoromethane
   (CH2ClF) and difluoromethane (CH2F2) with propyne (HCCCH3) have been

   CH/pi contacts, as well as secondary contacts between one or both
   halogen atoms and the methyl group of propyne. A detailed structural
   determination for CH2F2 center dot center dot center dot propyne has
   been made by study of the normal, one deuterated and four C-13
   substituted isotopologues, with the second lowest energy configuration

Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 31}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Electroencephalography (EEG) microstates and brain network
   are altered in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and discussed as
   potential biomarkers for AD. Microstates correspond to defined states of
   brain activity, and their connectivity patterns may change accordingly.
   Little is known about alteration of connectivity in microstates,
   especially in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment with
   stable or improving cognition within 30 months (aMCI).
   Methods: Thirty-five outpatients with aMCI or mild dementia (mean age 77
   +/- 7 years, 47 \% male, Mini Mental State Examination score >= 24) had
   comprehensive neuropsychological and clinical examinations. Subjects
   with cognitive decline over 30 months were allocated to the AD group,
   subjects with stable or improving cognition to the MCI-stable group.
   Results of neuropsychological testing at baseline were summarized in six
   domain scores. Resting state EEG was recorded with 256 electrodes and
   analyzed using TAPEEG. Five microstates were defined and individual data
   fitted. After phase transformation, the phase lag index (PLI) was
   calculated for the five microstates in every subject. Networks were
   reduced to 22 nodes for statistical analysis.
   Results: The domain score for verbal learning and memory and the
   microstate segmented PLI between the left centro-lateral and
   parieto-occipital regions in the theta band at baseline differentiated
   significantly between the groups. In the present sample, they separated
   in a logistic regression model with a 100 \% positive predictive value,
   60 \% negative predictive value, 100 \% specificity and 77 \%
   sensitivity between AD and MCI-stable.
   Conclusions: Combining neuropsychological and quantitative EEG test
   results allows differentiation between subjects with aMCI remaining
   stable and subjects with aMCI deteriorating over 30 months.}},

Abstract = {{We have produced nanoparticulate Pd-Au (88-12 at.\%) thin films using,
   for the first time, spark ablation and inertial deposition on glass
   substrates. Films having thicknesses that range from ca. 150 to 200 nm
   exhibit high enough contrast (i.e., range of optical transmittance) and
   negligible hysteresis during H-2 adsorption/desorption cycles, thereby
   providing an almost one-to-one relation between applied H-2 pressure and
   transmittance. Films having thicknesses larger than 200 nm exhibit
   hysteresis, which can be attributed to the cracks formed by the higher
   mechanical stresses associated with phase transition of the film during
   H-2 absorption and/or desorption. All samples exhibit a reasonably
   stable response upon cycling at room temperature. Their response times
   are less than 30s, which are considerably shorter compared to those of
   their counterparts produced by sputtering. Considering that the method
   used to produce the nanoparticulate films is simple and inexpensive, the
   findings reported in this paper open new opportunities for the design,
   optimization and production of optical H-2 gas sensors. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In this paper we present the development of a nanostructured hyper thin
   film sensor for the measurement of humidity in ppm level using the micro
   sized interdigitated electrode capacitive structure. The sensor
   electrode has been fabricated using the optical lithography technique on
   the oxide sensing film deposited on the quartz substrate. The nanoporous
   metal oxide thin film of gamma-Al2O3 has been fabricated by simple
   sol-gel drop coating method. The electrical characteristics of the
   sensor have been determined in the moisture range from 175 to 625 ppm by
   Agilent 4294A impedance analyzer at 1 kHz, 50 kHz and 100 kHz
   respectively. The sensor has excellent yield ratio because of complete
   avoidance of shorting problem of the electrode. The response time is
   very fast (T-r = 12 s) in comparison to the conventional commercial
   parallel plate gold electrode capacitive thin film aluminum oxide
   sensor. The proposed sensor can be useful for measuring moisture
   dispersion inside electronic gadgets and packages where the performance
   of the devices is deteriorated due to moisture entrapment. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Molybdenum disulfide, MoS2, is a very versatile material used in several
   applications of science and engineering. In particular, when supported
   on alumina, it is a widely used catalyst for hydrotreating processes in
   petroleum refineries. Stringent environmental norms and uncertainty in
   import of low sulfur crude oil put pressure on refiners worldwide to
   develop more efficient catalysts to meet the demand of clean fuel. The
   hydrodesulfurization of thiophene and dibenzothiophene on both
   unpromoted and nickel-promoted MoS2 catalyst is analyzed using a
   multiscale approach including classical molecular dynamics (MD) and
   density functional theory (DFT). MD simulations are performed on a
   hydrocarbon mixture containing sulfur compounds to determine relative
   positions of thiophene and dibenzothiophene molecules with respect to
   the MoS2 catalytic surface previous to possible reactions that are then
   studied with DFT. The sample box contains a total of 57 515 atoms and is
   able to represent a realistic size of the nanocatalyst process. Under
   typical hydrodesulfurization conditions, vacancies are needed for
   adsorption of sulfur compounds and therefore activation of hydrogen
   becomes an important step. In addition, complexes of MoS2 with graphene
   and boron nitride, BN, surfaces are also analyzed. MoS2 graphene
   complexes show improvement in the efficiency of adsorption of thiophene
   on the catalyst edge. Both hydrogenation and direct desulfurization
   pathways are presented on pristine MoS2 clusters as well as under
   typical hydrodesulfurization conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A novel biosensor has been constructed based on SnO2/graphene
   nanocomposite modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and was employed
   for the simultaneous determination of epinephrine (EP) and uric acid
   (UA) in the presence of common interferent ascorbic acid (AA) at
   physiological pH (7.0). SnO2/graphene composites were synthesized by a
   simple one-pot chemical reduction method. Physico-chemical analyses such
   as X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that the crystalline
   SnO2 nanoparticles were finely dispersed on the surface of graphene. The
   SnO2/graphene modified GCE exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic activity
   toward the oxidation of EP and UA when compared to the GO and SnO2
   modified GCEs. Under the optimal conditions, the oxidation peak currents
   increased linearly with concentration over the wide range of 0.5-200 mu
   M and 0.1-200 mu M with the detection limits of 0.017 mu M and 0.28 mu M
   for EP and UA, respectively. The proposed modified electrode displayed
   high selectivity, good stability and reproducibility, and was
   successfully applied for the determination of epinephrine in epinephrine
   hydrochloride injection and uric acid in human urine samples. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Previous studies have demonstrated the involvement of nerve repellent
   factors in regulation of the imbalanced innervation of endometriosis.
   This prospective study aims to explore the role of Sema 3A in regulating
   aberrant sympathetic innervation in peritoneal and deep infiltrating
   endometriosis. Ectopic endometriotic lesion were collected from patients
   with peritoneal endometriosis (n = 24) and deep infiltrating
   endometriosis of uterosacral ligament (n = 20) undergoing surgery for
   endometriosis. Eutopic endometrial samples were collected from patients
   with endometriosis (n = 22) or without endometriosis (n = 26). Healthy
   peritoneum (n = 13) from the lateral pelvic wall and healthy uterosacral
   ligament (n = 13) were obtained from patients who had no surgical and
   histological proof of endometriosis during hysterectomy for uterine
   fibroids. Firstly, we studied the immunostaining of Sema 3A, Plexin A1
   and NRP-1 in all the tissues described above. Then we studied the nerve
   fiber density (NFD) of endometriosis-associated (sympathetic) nerve and
   para-endometriotic (sympathetic) nerve by double immunofluorescence
   staining. Finally we analyzed the relationship between expression of
   Sema 3A in stromal cells of endometriotic lesion and the aberrant
   innervation of endometriosis. Semi-quantitative immunostaining
   demonstrated that (1) Higher immunostaining of Sema 3A were found in the
   eutopic endometrial glandular epithelial cells from patients with
   endometriosis (p = 0.041) than those without endometriosis; (2) Sema 3A
   immunostaining was higher in glandular epithelial cells of peritoneal
   endometriosis (P<0.001) and deep infiltrating endometriotic lesions of
   uterosacral ligament (P = 0.028) compared with glandular epithelial
   cells of the endometrium from women with endometriosis, while its
   expression in ectopic stormal cells in both groups were significantly
   lower than that from eutopic endometrium of women without endometirosis
   (P<0.001, P<0.001, respectively). NFDs of Anti-TH (+)
   endometriosis-associated sympathetic nerve of peritoneal endometriosis
   (p<0.001) and deep endometriosis of uterosacral ligament (p<0.001) were
   significantly lower than NFDs of para-endometriotic sympathetic nerve.
   Our results suggest that Sema 3A may contribute to the regulation of
   aberrant sympathetic innervation in peritoneal and deep infiltrating
   endometriosis.}},

Title = {{The Modified painDETECT Questionnaire for Patients with Hip or Knee
   Osteoarthritis: Translation into Dutch, Cross-Cultural Adaptation and
   Reliability Assessment}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing amount of evidence that alteration in pain processing
   by the peripheral and central nervous system play a role in
   osteoarthritis pain, leading to neuropathic-like symptoms. It is
   essential to identify knee and hip osteoarthritis patients with a
   neuropathic pain profile in order to offer such patients education and
   additional treatment options besides conventional pain treatment. The
   painDETECT Questionnaire is a self-report questionnaire developed to
   discriminate between nociceptive and neuropathic pain. This
   questionnaire was modified to fit patients suffering from knee
   osteoarthritis. The aim of this study was to translate and
   cross-culturally adapt the modified painDETECT Questionnaire to the
   Dutch language and to provide a modified version to fit patients with
   hip osteoarthritis. Reliability for internal consistency, repeatability
   and floor and ceiling effects were subsequently assessed. A total of 278
   patients were included in the reliability study and 123 patients in the
   repeatability analysis. The Dutch modified painDETECT Questionnaire
   shows good internal consistency and small relative measurement errors,
   represented by a good intra-class correlation coefficient. Absolute
   measurement error, represented by the Standard Error of Measurement, was
   acceptable. However, a measurement bias might be present when it comes
   to repeatability. To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide a
   Dutch modified painDETECT Questionnaire to fit hip and knee
   osteoarthritis patients and to assess internal consistency, reliability
   and agreement. International guidelines were followed in the translation
   process and this study has ample sample size with an adequate time
   interval for repeatability. Based on this study, the Dutch modified
   painDETECT Questionnaire seems to be fit as a discriminative tool to
   identify knee and hip osteoarthritis patients with a neuropathic pain
   profile. Whether it is also suitable as an evaluative tool to record
   changes over time or after an intervention remains open to further
   investigation.}},

Title = {{Dynamics of simple gene-network motifs subject to extrinsic fluctuations}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 31}},
Abstract = {{Cellular processes do not follow deterministic rules; even in identical
   environments genetically identical cells can make random choices leading
   to different phenotypes. This randomness originates from fluctuations
   present in the biomolecular interaction networks. Most previous work has
   been focused on the intrinsic noise (IN) of these networks. Yet,
   especially for high-copy-number biomolecules, extrinsic or environmental
   noise (EN) has been experimentally shown to dominate the variation.
   Here, we develop an analytical formalism that allows for calculation of
   the effect of EN on gene-expression motifs. We introduce a method for
   modeling bounded EN as an auxiliary species in the master equation. The
   method is fully generic and is not limited to systems with small EN
   magnitudes. We focus our study on motifs that can be viewed as the
   building blocks of genetic switches: a nonregulated gene, a
   self-inhibiting gene, and a self-promoting gene. The role of the EN
   properties (magnitude, correlation time, and distribution) on the
   statistics of interest are systematically investigated, and the effect
   of fluctuations in different reaction rates is compared. Due to its
   analytical nature, our formalism can be used to quantify the effect of
   EN on the dynamics of biochemical networks and can also be used to
   improve the interpretation of data from single-cell gene-expression
   experiments.}},

Title = {{Catalytic properties, functional attributes and industrial applications
   of beta-glucosidases}},
Journal = {{3 BIOTECH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 31}},
Abstract = {{beta-Glucosidases are diverse group of enzymes with great functional
   importance to biological systems. These are grouped in multiple
   glycoside hydrolase families based on their catalytic and sequence
   characteristics. Most studies carried out on beta-glucosidases are
   focused on their industrial applications rather than their endogenous
   function in the target organisms. beta-Glucosidases performed many
   functions in bacteria as they are components of large complexes called
   cellulosomes and are responsible for the hydrolysis of short chain
   oligosaccharides and cellobiose. In plants, beta-glucosidases are
   involved in processes like formation of required intermediates for cell
   wall lignification, degradation of endosperm's cell wall during
   germination and in plant defense against biotic stresses. Mammalian
   beta-glucosidases are thought to play roles in metabolism of glycolipids
   and dietary glucosides, and signaling functions. These enzymes have
   diverse biotechnological applications in food, surfactant, biofuel, and
   agricultural industries. The search for novel and improved
   beta-glucosidase is still continued to fulfills demand of an
   industrially suitable enzyme. In this review, a comprehensive overview
   on detailed functional roles of beta-glucosidases in different
   organisms, their industrial applications, and recent cloning and
   expression studies with biochemical characterization of such enzymes is
   presented for the better understanding and efficient use of diverse
   beta-glucosidases.}},

Title = {{Stem Cells in Aggregate Form to Enhance Chondrogenesis in Hydrogels}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 31}},
Abstract = {{There are a variety of exciting hydrogel technologies being explored for
   cartilage regenerative medicine. Our overall goal is to explore whether
   using stem cells in an aggregate form may be advantageous in these
   applications. 3D stem cell aggregates hold great promise as they may
   recapitulate the in vivo skeletal tissue condensation, a property that
   is not typically observed in 2D culture. We considered two different
   stem cell sources, human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly cells (hWJCs,
   currently being used in clinical trials) and rat bone marrow-derived
   mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs). The objective of the current study was
   to compare the influence of cell phenotype, aggregate size, and
   aggregate number on chondrogenic differentiation in a generic hydrogel
   (agarose) platform. Despite being differing cell sources, both rBMSC and
   hWJC aggregates were consistent in outperforming cell suspension control
   groups in biosynthesis and chondrogenesis. Higher cell density impacted
   biosynthesis favorably, and the number of aggregates positively
   influenced chondrogenesis. Therefore, we recommend that investigators
   employing hydrogels consider using cells in an aggregate form for
   enhanced chondrogenic performance.}},

Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 31}},
Abstract = {{We present methods for efficient characterization of an optical coherent
   state vertical bar alpha >. We choose measurement settings adaptively
   and stochastically, based on data while it is collected. Our algorithm
   divides the estimation into two distinct steps: (i) before the first
   detection of a vacuum state, the probability of choosing a measurement
   setting is proportional to detecting vacuum with the setting, which
   makes using too similar measurement settings twice unlikely; and (ii)
   after the first detection of vacuum, we focus measurements in the region
   where vacuum is most likely to be detected. In step (i) {[}(ii)] the
   detection of vacuum (a photon) has a significantly larger effect on the
   shape of the posterior probability distribution of a. Compared to
   nonadaptive schemes, our method makes the number of measurement shots
   required to achieve a certain level of accuracy smaller approximately by
   a factor proportional to the area describing the initial uncertainty of
   a in phase space. While this algorithm is not directly robust against
   readout errors, we make it such by introducing repeated measurements in
   step (i).}},

Abstract = {{Fragilaria longifusiformis (Hains \& Sebring) Siver et al. is a
   planktonic diatom distributed widely aroud the world, with rare

   that the valve face ornamentations, inconspicuous under light
   microscopy, hinder the accurate identification of the species, leading
   to misidentification with other similar species of Fragilaria Lyngbye,
   Synedra Ehrenberg or Nitzschia Hassall. The goals of this study were to
   illustrate the morphological variability of the southern Brazilian
   specimens, with and without plastids, detail the ultrastructure of the
   taxon and confirm the geographic distribution of populations in regional
   reservoirs and rivers. Phytoplankton sampling was carried out from 2007
   to 2011. The morphological characteristics of Brazilian populations of
   F. longifusiformis match the original circumscription of this species,

Abstract = {{High sensitivity and selectivity play critical roles in practical
   applications of glucose biosensors. In this study, we reported a novel
   glucose biosensor based on three-dimensional (3D) structured biosensing
   film, which consisted of silver nanowires (AgNWs) network and Prussian
   blue nanocubes (PBNCs). 3D AgNWs network was successfully built on the
   electrode surface with assistance of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs),
   while PBNCs were in situ prepared on the network through aerosol
   deposition approach and glucose oxidase (GOx) was immobilized onto the
   surface of PBNCs/AgNWs film with glutaraldehyde cross-linking method.
   Owing to an enhanced surface area, high conductivity and synergistic
   electrocatalytic activity of fabricated PBNCs/AgNWs film, an
   ultrasensitive glucose biosensor with high selectivity was constructed.
   As a result, the as-prepared biosensor exhibited an ultrahigh
   sensitivity of 359.0 mA M-1 cm(-2) with a linear range from 0.01 to 0.9
   mM, an outstanding anti-interference ability at a low potential of -0.05
   V, as well as excellent stability and reproducibility. It is believed
   that the proposed 3D sensing film would have widespread applications in
   biological sensing and quantitative biochemical analysis. (C) 2015

Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Some crude oils with high water cut have the capability to flow below
   the oil gel point, while the oil particles adhere to the pipe wall in
   the form of paste, also called ``wall sticking{''}. Wall sticking is a
   serious problem during the pipeline transportation, leading to partial
   or total blockage of the pipeline and energy wastage. In this paper, a
   series of laboratory flow loop experiments were conducted to observe the
   wall sticking characteristics of crude oil with high water cut, high
   viscosity and high gel point at low transportation temperatures. The
   effects of shear stress and water cut on the wall sticking rate and
   occurrence temperature were investigated. Experimental results indicated
   that the wall sticking rate and occurrence temperature were lower under
   stronger shear stress and higher water cut conditions. A criterion of
   wall sticking occurrence temperature (WSOT) and a regression model of
   wall sticking rate were then established. Finally, the software was
   developed to calculate the pressure drop along the pipelines of crude
   oils with high water-cut. It was able to predict the wall sticking
   thickness of gelled oil and then calculate the pressure drop along the
   pipelines. A typical case study indicated that the prediction results
   obtained from the software were in agreement with actual measured
   values.}},

Abstract = {{The largest genus of seed-free vascular plants Selaginella alone
   constitutes the family Selaginellaceae, the largest of the lycophyte
   families. The genus is estimated to contain ca. 800 species distributed
   on all continents except Antarctica, with the highest species diversity
   in tropical and subtropical regions. The monophyly of Selaginella has
   rarely been doubted, in contrast its infrageneric classification has
   been contentious. In the present study, based on chloroplast and nuclear
   DNA evidence, macromorphology, spore features, and/or distribution
   information, Selaginella is classified into six subgenera: S. subg.
   Selaginella, S. subg. Boreoselaginella, S. subg. Pulviniella, S. subg.
   Ericetorum, S. subg. Heterostachys, and S. subg. Stachygynandrum. The
   latter three subgenera are further classified into six, five, and seven
   sections, respectively. All of these infrageneric divisions, identified
   with molecular data, are supported by non-molecular features. A key to
   infrageneric taxa is given. Thirty-seven infrageneric taxa published in
   earlier literature are lectotypified and classified into those
   infrageneric taxa here recognized. A nomenclatural account of each
   infrageneric taxon is given.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to investigate whether cognitive impairment is more
   pronounced in people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia compared
   with those who respond well to first-line antipsychotic medication.
   Fifty-one patients with schizophrenia were assigned to one of three
   groups dependent on their clinical history: (i) 16 people who had
   responded well to first-line antipsychotic medication, (ii) 20 people
   who were treatment-resistant but responding to clozapine monotherapy,
   (iii) 15 people who were ultra-treatment-resistant/clozapine-resistant
   but responding to antipsychotic polypharmacy. Twenty-two controls were
   also recruited. Groups were matched for age, sex, disease duration and
   psychopathology. All participants undertook a computerised battery of
   neuropsychological tests that assessed multiple cognitive domains. Raw
   data were converted to z-scores, and test performance was compared
   between groups. People with schizophrenia performed significantly worse
   than controls in the majority of neuropsychological tests, with verbal
   memory, sustained attention, and sensorimotor the most commonly impaired
   domains. No significant differences in performance between people deemed
   to be treatment-resistant or ultra-treatment-resistant, and those who
   responded well to first-line antipsychotic medication were observed.
   There was no significant relationship between antipsychotic dose and
   scores on any of the neuropsychological tests. Cognitive impairment is a
   central feature of schizophrenia, but our results suggest that
   treatment-resistance may not be associated with more severe deficits.

Title = {{Differential association of lead on length by zinc status in two-year
   old Mexican children}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Blood lead levels have decreased in Mexico since leaded fuel
   was banned in 1997, but other sources remain, including the use of
   lead-glazed ceramics for food storage and preparation. Zinc deficiency
   is present in almost 30 \% of children aged 1-2 years. Previous studies
   have documented negative associations of both lead exposure and zinc
   deficiency with stature, but have not considered the joint effects.
   Given that the prevalence of stunting in pre-school aged children was
   13.6 \% in 2012, the aim of this study was to evaluate if the
   relationship between blood lead and child stature was modified by zinc
   status.
   Methods: Anthropometry, dietary energy intake, serum zinc and blood lead
   were measured in 291 children aged 24 months from an ongoing birth
   cohort study in Mexico City. Child stature was represented by recumbent
   length as appropriate for this age group. The association between blood
   lead (BPb) and length-for-age Z score (LAZ) was evaluated using a model
   stratified by zinc status measured by standard criteria and adjusted
   for: birth length, breastfeeding practices, energy intake, maternal
   height and education.
   Results: Median (IQR) BPb was: 0.17 (0.12-0.26) mu mol/L and 17 \% of
   the sample had zinc deficiency (<9.9 mu mol/L). BPb was inversely
   associated with LAZ in the overall sample (beta = -0.19, p = 0.02). In
   stratified models, this negative association was more than three times
   higher and statistically significant only in the zinc deficient group
   (beta = -0.43, p = 0.04) compared to the zinc replete group (beta =
   -0.12, p = 0.22) (BPb{*}zinc status, p-for-interaction = 0.04).
   Conclusions: Zinc adequacy is a key factor that may attenuate the
   negative association of lead on stature in young children.}},

Abstract = {{The study presents a direct process for surface patterning of multilayer
   graphene on the glass substrate as a biosensing device. In contrast to
   lithography with etching, the proposed process provides simultaneous
   surface patterning of multilayer graphene through nanosecond laser
   irradiation. In this study, the multilayer graphene was prepared by a
   screen printing process. Additionally, the wavelength of the laser beam
   was 355 nm. To perform the effective laser process with the small heat
   affected zone, the surface patterns on the sensing devices could be
   directly fabricated using the laser with optimal control of the pulse
   overlap at a fluence threshold of 0.63 J/cm(2). The unique patterning of
   the laser-ablated surface exhibits their electrical and hydrophilic
   characteristics. The hydrophilic surface of graphene-based sensing
   devices was achieved in the process with the pulse overlap of 90\%.
   Furthermore, the sensing devices for controlling the electrical response
   of glucose by using glucose oxidase can be used in sensors in commercial
   medical applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A high strength of polyving alcohol/polyacrylic acid double network gel
   (PVA/PAA gel) adsorbent was successfully prepared by a simple two-step
   method in this study. The gel adsorbent possessed the advantages of low
   cost and high adsorptivity for heavy metals in solution. The maximum
   uptake capacities of PVA/PAA gel were 194.99 mg/g for Pb(II) and 115.88
   mg/g for Cd(II) inferred from the Langmuir model at 303 K. At the
   concentration levels of Pb(II) < 150 mg/L and Cd(II)< 100 mg/L, the
   Pb(II) and Cd(II) could be completely adsorbed, showing a great
   potential of removing heavy metals from wastewater. Simultaneously, the
   PVA/PAA gel adsorbent exhibited an excellent reusability. Even in the
   fifth cycle, the removal efficiencies of both Pb(II) and Cd(II) remained
   nearly 100\%. Significantly, the gel adsorbent displayed a satisfactory
   performance of removing heavy metals in actual industrial effluent. The
   results reveal that the double network gel can be considered as a
   potential candidate for practical application. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

   tomography: a randomized clinical trial}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF INTENSIVE CARE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Early after intubation, a layer of biofilm covers the inner
   lumen of the endotracheal tube (ETT). Cleaning the ETT might prevent
   airways colonization by pathogens, reduce resistance to airflow, and
   decrease sudden ETT obstruction. We investigated the effectiveness of a
   cleaning closed suction system in maintaining the endotracheal tube free
   from secretions.
   Methods: We conducted a single center, randomized controlled trial, in
   the general intensive care unit of a tertiary-level university hospital.
   We enrolled 40 adult critically ill patients expected to remain
   intubated for more than 48 h, within 24 h from intubation. Patients were
   randomized to receive three ETT cleaning maneuvers/day using a novel
   device (Airway Medix Closed Suction System T, cleaning group) or to
   standard care (no ETT cleaning, standard closed suction, control group).
   After extubation, the amount of secretions in the ETTs was measured by
   micro-computed tomography.
   Results: The volume of secretions in the ETTs from the cleaning group
   was lower than controls (0.081 {[}0.021-0.306] vs. 0.568 {[}0.162-0.756]
   mL, p = 0.001), corresponding to a cross-sectional area reduction six
   times lower (1{[}0-3] vs. 6 {[}2-10] \%, p = 0.001). In a subset of 16
   patients, the resistance to airflow tended to be lower after 1 day of
   treatment (p = 0.063) and was lower after 2 days (0.024), while no
   difference was present at enrollment (p = 0.922). ETT colonization did
   not differ between the two groups.
   Conclusions: The use of a novel cleaning closed suction system proved to
   be effective in reducing secretions present in the ETT after extubation,
   possibly reducing resistance to airflow during intubation.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoparticulate delivery systems have recently been under consideration
   for topical ophthalmic drug delivery. Brimonidine base-loaded solid
   lipid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carrier formulations were
   prepared using glyceryl monostearate as solid lipid and were evaluated

   121 degrees C for 15 min. The objective of this work was to evaluate the
   effect of autoclaving on the physical appearance, particle size,
   polydispersity index, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency and particle
   morphology of the prepared formulations, compared to non-autoclaved
   ones. Results showed that, autoclaving at 121 degrees C for 15 min
   allowed the production of physically stable formulations in nanometric
   range, below 500 nm suitable for ophthalmic application. Moreover, the
   autoclaved samples appeared to be superior to non-autoclaved ones, due
   to their increased zeta potential values, indicating a better physical
   stability. As well as, increased amount of brimonidine base entrapped in
   the tested formulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of anthropogenic organic complexants (citrate, EDTA and
   DTPA from 0.005 to 0.1 M) on the solubility of nickel(II), thorium(IV)
   and uranium (U(IV) and U(VI)) has been studied. Experiments were carried
   out in 95\%-saturated Ca(OH)(2) solutions, representing the high pH
   conditions anticipated in the near field of a cementitious intermediate
   level radioactive waste repository. Results showed that Ni(II)
   solubility increased by 2-4 orders of magnitude in the presence of EDTA
   and DTPA and from 3 to 4 orders of magnitude in the case of citrate.
   Citrate had the greatest effect on the solubility of Th(IV) and
   U(IV)/(VI). XRD and SEM analyses indicate that the precipitates are
   largely amorphous; only in the case of Ni(II), is there some evidence of
   incipient crystallinity, in the form of Ni(OH)(2) (theophrastite). A
   study of the effect of calcium suggests that U(VI) and Ni(II) may form
   metal-citrate-OH complexes stabilised by Ca2+. Thermodynamic modelling
   underestimates the concentrations in solution in the presence of the
   ligands for all the elements considered here. Further investigation of
   the behaviour of organic ligands under hyperalkaline conditions is
   important because of the use of the thermodynamic constants in preparing
   the safety case for the geological disposal of radioactive wastes. (C)

   (NP) formulations and free mTHPP, with EC50 values ranging from 0.2 to
   1.3 mu M. PLA based NP were not as effective in all performed tests as
   other formulations. Nanoparticulate embedded mTHPP remained
   photodynamically active and resulted in caspase-3 activation even at low
   concentrations of 250 nM. PLGA based NP exhibited highest caspase-3
   activation.
   For all formulations an effective intracellular accumulation of mTHPP
   was observed, whereby for mTHPP-Eudragit (R) E-NP a 200-fold drug
   accumulation was shown.
   Polymer based nanoparticles were shown to be an effective and highly
   active transport vehicle for the photosensitizer mTHPP in vitro.
   Problems like low solubility of free drug can be circumvented by
   successful embedding into nanoparticulate carrier systems, maintaining
   therapeutic effects of the photosensitizer. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The foreign body reaction is the major cause of the dysfunction and
   relatively short lifetime associated with implanted glucose biosensors.
   An effective strategy to maintain sensor functionality is to apply
   biocompatible coatings that elute drug to counter the negative tissue
   reactions. This has been achieved using dexamethasone releasing
   poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres embedded in a
   polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel coating. Accordingly, the biosensor
   lifetime relies on the duration and dose of drug release from the
   coating. To achieve long-term drug release mixed populations of
   microspheres have been used. In the current study, microspheres were
   prepared by blending low (25 KDa) and high (113 KDa) molecular weight
   PLGA at different mass ratios to overcome problems associated with
   mixing multiple populations of microspheres. ``Real-time{''} in vitro
   studies demonstrated dexamethasone release for approximately 5 months.
   An accelerated method with discriminatory ability was developed to
   shorten drug release to less than 2 weeks. An in vivo pharmacodynamics
   study demonstrated efficacy against the foreign body reaction for 4.5
   months. Such composite coatings composed of PLGA microspheres prepared
   using polymer blends could potentially be used to ensure long-term
   performance of glucose sensors. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks aim at rapidly exhausting
   the communication and computational power of a network target by
   flooding it with large volumes of malicious traffic. In order to be
   effective, a DDoS defense mechanism should detect and mitigate threats
   quickly, while allowing legitimate users access to the attack's target.
   Nevertheless, defense mechanisms proposed in the literature tend not to
   address detection and mitigation challenges jointly, but rather focus
   solely on the detection or the mitigation facet. At the same time, they
   usually overlook the limitations of centralized defense frameworks that,
   when deployed physically close to a possible target, become ineffective
   if DDoS attacks are able to saturate the target's incoming links.
   This paper presents STONE, a framework with expert system functionality
   that provides effective and joint DDoS detection and mitigation. STONE
   characterizes regular network traffic of a service by aggregating it
   into common prefixes of IP addresses, and detecting attacks when the
   aggregated traffic deviates from the regular one. Upon detection of an
   attack, STONE allows traffic from known sources to access the service
   while discarding suspicious one. STONE relies on the data streaming
   processing paradigm in order to characterize and detect anomalies in
   real time. We implemented STONE on top of StreamCloud, an elastic and
   parallel-distributed stream processing engine. The evaluation, conducted
   on real network traces, shows that STONE detects DDoS attacks rapidly,
   provides minimal degradation of legitimate traffic while mitigating a
   threat, and also exhibits a processing throughput that scales linearly
   with the number of nodes used to deploy and run it. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The nanostructures formed by inorganic nanoparticles together with
   organic molecules especially biomolecules have attracted increasing
   attention from both industries and researching fields due to their
   unique hybrid properties. In this paper, we systemically studied the
   interactions between amphiphilic polymer coated silver nanoparticles and
   bovine serum albumins by employing the fluorescence quenching approach
   in combination with the Stern-Volmer and Hill equations. The binding
   affinity was determined to 1.30 x 10(7) M-1 and the interaction was
   spontaneously driven by mainly the van der Waals force and hydrogen-bond
   mediated interactions, and negatively cooperative from the point of view
   of thermodynamics. With the non-uniform coating of amphiphilic polymer,
   the silver nanoparticles can form protein coronas which can become
   discrete protein-nanoparticle conjugates when controlling their molar
   ratios of mixing. The protein's conformational changes upon binding
   nanoparticles was also studied by using the three-dimensional
   fluorescence spectroscopy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Major challenge in automatic image annotation is bridging the semantic
   gap between the computable low-level image features and the human-like
   interpretation of images. The interpretation includes concepts on
   different levels of abstraction that cannot be simply mapped to features
   but require additional reasoning with general and domain-specific
   knowledge. The problem is even more complex since knowledge in context
   of image interpretation is often incomplete, imprecise, uncertain and
   ambiguous in nature. Thus, in this paper we propose a fuzzy-knowledge
   based intelligent system for image annotation, which is able to deal
   with uncertain and ambiguous knowledge and can annotate images with
   concepts on different levels of abstraction that is more human-like. The
   main contributions are associated with an original approach of using a
   fuzzy knowledge-representation scheme based on the Fuzzy Petri Net
   (KRFPN) formalism. The acquisition of knowledge is facilitated in a way
   that besides the general knowledge provided by the expert, the
   computable facts and rules about the concepts, as well as their
   reliability, are produced automatically from data. The reasoning
   capability of the fuzzy inference engine of the KRFPN is used in a novel
   way for inconsistency checking of the classified image segments,
   automatic scene recognition, and the inference of generalized and
   derived classes.
   The results of image interpretation of Corel images belonging to the
   domain of outdoor scenes achieved by the proposed system outperform the
   published results obtained on the same image base in terms of average
   precision and recall. Owing to the fuzzy-knowledge representation
   scheme, the obtained image interpretation is enriched with new, more
   general and abstract concepts that are close to concepts people use to
   interpret these images. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mg-Al layered double hydroxides (LDHs) intercalated with NO3- (NO3
   center dot Mg-Al LDH) and Cl- (Cl center dot Mg-Al LDH) were found to
   adsorb fluoride from aqueous solutions. Fluoride is removed by anion
   exchange in solution with NO3- and Cl- intercalated in the LDH
   interlayer. In both cases, the residual F concentration is lower than
   the effluent standards for F in Japan (8 mg/L). The rate-determining
   step in the removal of F using NO3 center dot Mg-Al and Cl center dot
   Mg-Al LDH is chemical adsorption involving F-anion exchange with
   intercalated NO3- and Cl- ions. The removal of F is described by
   pseudo-second-order reaction kinetics, with Langmuir-type adsorption.
   The values obtained for the maximum adsorption and the equilibrium
   adsorption constant are respectively 3.3 mmol g(-1) and 2.8 with NO3
   center dot Mg-Al LDH, and 3.2 mmol g(-1) and 1.5 with Cl center dot
   Mg-Al LDH. The F in the F center dot Mg-Al LDH produced in these
   reactions was found to exchange with NO3- and Cl- ions in solution. The
   regenerated NO3 center dot Mg-Al and Cl center dot Mg-Al LDHs thus
   obtained can be used once more to capture aqueous F. This suggests that
   NO3 center dot Mg-Al and Cl center dot Mg-Al LDHs can be recycled and
   used repeatedly for F removal. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Current study was aimed to develop 200 mg controlled release matrix
   tablets of Losartan Potassium using Ethocel 100 Premium and Ethocel 100
   FP Premium as rate controlling polymer. In-vitro studies were performed
   according to USP Method-I in phosphate buffer (PH 6.8) using pharma test
   dissolution apparatus. The temperature of the dissolution medium was
   kept constant at 37 +/- 0.5 degrees C at 100 rpm. Flow properties,
   physical quality control tests, effect of polymer size and
   drug-to-polymers ratios were studied using different kinetics models
   such as 1st-order, zero-order, Hixon Crowell model, Highuchi model and
   Power law. Difference factor f(1) and similarity factor f(2) were
   applied for dissolution profiles against Cardaktin (R) tablets used as a
   reference formulation. The matrices with polymer ethocel 100 FP Premiums
   have prolonged the drug release rate as compared to polymer ethocel 100
   Premiums. The n values matrices with polymer ethocel grade 100 ranged
   from 0.603 to 0.857 indicating that the drug release occurred by
   anomalous non fickian diffusion kinetics while then value of reference
   Cardaktin (R) tablet was measured as 0.125 indicating that these tablets
   do not follow power law. The dissolution profiles of test formulations
   were different than that of reference Cardaktin (R). This suggests the
   polymer Ethocel grade 100 can be proficiently incorporated in
   fabrication and development of once a day controlled release matrix
   tablets. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A system to measure the Optokinetic and Optomotor response in mice}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS}},

Volume = {{256}},

Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Visually evoked compensatory head movements (Optomotor
   responses) or eye movements (Optokinetic responses) are extensively used
   in experimental mouse models for developmental defects, pathological
   conditions, and testing the efficacy of therapeutic manipulations.
   New method: We present an automated system to measure Optomotor and
   Optokinetic responses under identical stimulation conditions, enabling a
   direct comparison of the two reflexes. A semi-automated calibration
   procedure and a commercial eye tracker are used to record angular eye
   velocity in the restrained animal. Novel video tracking algorithms
   determine the location of the mouse head in real time and allow
   repositioning of the stimulus relative to the mouse head.
   Results: Optomotor and Optokinetic responses yield comparable results
   with respect to determining visual acuity in mice. Our new head tracking
   algorithms enable a far more accurate analysis of head angle
   determination, and reveal individual head retractions, analogous to
   saccadic eye movements observed during Optokinetic Nystagmus.
   Comparison with existing methods: To our knowledge this is the first
   apparatus allowing the direct comparison of Optomotor and Optokinetic
   responses in mice. Our tracking algorithms, which allow an objective
   determination of head movements are a significant increment over
   existing systems which rely on subjective human observation. The
   increased accuracy of the novel algorithms increases the robustness of
   automated Optomotor response determinations and reveals novel aspects of
   this reflex.
   Conclusions: We provide the blueprints for inexpensive hardware, and
   release open source software for our system, and describe an accurate
   and accessible method for Optomotor and Optokinetic response
   determination in mice. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Schema theory and therapy may be an additional therapeutic approach to
   identify and treat chronic psychological problems, namely early
   maladaptive schemas (EMSs), in patients with obsessive-compulsive
   disorder (OCD) and panic disorder (PAD). In the current study, we
   investigated the characteristics in EMSs between patients with OCD and
   PAD. Fifty-one patients with OCD, 46 patients with PAD, and 70 normal
   controls participated in this study. EMSs and depressive symptoms were
   measured using the Young Schema Questionnaire and the Beck Depression
   Inventory (BDI), respectively. Analysis of covariance was conducted with
   age, sex, BDI score, and education level as covariates to assess group
   differences. Direct comparisons among the three groups revealed that the
   defectiveness/shame and social isolation/alienation schemas were
   prominently activated in patients with OCD, whereas the vulnerability to
   harm or illness and self-sacrifice were activated in patients with PAD.
   In subgroup analysis, these differences were observed between subgroups
   with lower BDI scores, but not between the patient subgroups with higher
   BDI scores. However, the differences between the patient groups in the
   defectiveness/shame and vulnerability to harm or illness schemas almost
   reached significance. Patients with OCD and PAD differed in particular
   EMS characteristics, which could have potential therapeutic
   implications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Highly efficient zinc compounds (Zn3N2, ZnO, ZnS, and ZnSe) have been
   investigated as low-cost electrocatalysts for the counter electrodes
   (CE) of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Among them, Zn3N2 and ZnSe
   are introduced for the first time in DSSCs. The zinc compounds were
   separately mixed with a conducting binder,
   poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS),
   and thereby four composite films of Zn3N2/PEDOT:PSS, ZnO/PEDOT:PSS,
   ZnS/PEDOT:PSS, and ZnSe/PEDOT:PSS were coated on the tin-doped indium
   oxide (ITO) substrates through a simple drop-coating process. In the
   composite film, nanoparticles of the zinc compound form active sites for
   the electrocatalytic reduction of triiodide ions, and PEDOT:PSS provides
   a continuous conductive matrix for fast electron transfer. By varying
   the weight percentage (5-20 wt \%) of a zinc compound with respect to
   the weight of the PEDOT:PSS, the optimized concentration of a zinc
   compound was found to be 10 wt \% in all four cases, based on the
   photovoltaic performances of the corresponding DSSCs. At this
   concentration (10 wt \%), the composites films with Zn3N2 (Zn3N2-10),
   ZnO (ZnO-10), ZnS (ZnS-10), and ZnSe (ZnSe-10) rendered, for their
   DSSCs, power conversion efficiencies (eta) of 8.73\%, 7.54\%, 7.40\%,
   and 8.13\%, respectively. The difference in the power conversion
   efficiency is explained based on the electrocatalytic abilities of those
   composite films as determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV), Tafel
   polarization plots, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
   techniques. The energy band gaps of the zinc compounds, obtained by
   density functional theory (DFT) calculations, were used to explain the
   electrocatalytic behaviors of the compounds. Among all the zinc-based
   composites, the one with Zn3N2-10 showed the best electrocatalytic
   ability and thereby rendered for its DSSC the highest eta of 8.73\%,
   which is even higher than that of the cell with the traditional Pt CE
   (8.50\%). Therefore, Zn3N2 can be considered as a promising inexpensive
   electrocatalyst to replace the rare and expensive Pt.}},

Abstract = {{In order to avoid the inherent deficiencies of the traditional BP neural
   network, such as slow convergence speed, that easily leading to local
   minima, poor generalization ability and difficulty in determining the
   network structure, the dynamic self-adaptive learning algorithm of the
   BP neural network is put forward to improve the function of the BP
   neural network. The new algorithm combines the merit of principal
   component analysis, particle swarm optimization, correlation analysis
   and self-adaptive model, hence can effectively solve the problems of
   selecting structural parameters, initial connection weights and
   thresholds and learning rates of the BP neural network. This new
   algorithm not only reduces the human intervention, optimizes the
   topological structures of BP neural networks and improves the network
   generalization ability, but also accelerates the convergence speed of a
   network, avoids trapping into local minima, and enhances network
   adaptation ability and prediction ability. The dynamic self-adaptive
   learning algorithm of the BP neural network is used to forecast the
   total retail sale of consumer goods of Sichuan Province, China.
   Empirical results indicate that the new algorithm is superior to the
   traditional BP network algorithm in predicting accuracy and time
   consumption, which shows the feasibility and effectiveness of the new
   algorithm.}},

   fluctuations across a north-south gradient}},
Journal = {{BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: The spatial-temporal dynamics of Bordetella pertussis
   remains as a highly interesting case in infectious disease epidemiology.
   Despite large-scale vaccination programs in place for over 50 years
   around the world, frequent outbreaks are still reported in many
   countries.
   Methods: Here, we use annual time series of pertussis incidence from the
   thirteen different regions of Chile (1952-2010) to study the
   spatial-temporal dynamics of Pertussis. The period 1975-1995 was
   characterized by a strong 4 year cycle, while the last two decades of
   the study period (1990-2010) were characterized by disease resurgence
   without significant periodic patterns.
   Results: During the first decades, differences in periodic patterns
   across regions can be explained by the differences in susceptible
   recruitment. The observed shift in periodicity from the period 1952-1974
   to the period 1975-1995 across regions was relatively well predicted by
   the susceptible recruitment and population size. However, data on
   vaccination rates was not taken into account in this study.
   Conclusions: Our findings highlight how demography and population size
   have interacted with the immunization program in shaping periodicity
   along a unique latitudinal gradient. Widespread B. pertussis vaccination
   appears to lead to longer periodic dynamics, which is line with a
   reduction in B. pertussis transmission, but our findings indicate that
   regions characterized by both low birth rate and population size
   decreased in periodicity following immunization efforts.}},

Title = {{Engineering transcription factors to improve tolerance against alkane
   biofuels in Saccharomyces cerevisiae}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Biologically produced alkanes can be used as `drop in' to
   existing transportation infrastructure as alkanes are important
   components of gasoline and jet fuels. Despite the reported microbial
   production of alkanes, the toxicity of alkanes to microbial hosts could
   pose a bottleneck for high productivity. In this study, we aimed to
   improve the tolerance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a model eukaryotic
   host of industrial significance, to alkane biofuels.
   Results: To increase alkane tolerance in S. cerevisiae, we sought to
   exploit the pleiotropic drug resistance (Pdr) transcription factors
   Pdr1p and Pdr3p, which are master regulators of genes with pleiotropic
   drug resistance elements (PDREs)-containing upstream sequences.
   Wild-type and site-mutated Pdr1p and Pdr3p were expressed in S.
   cerevisiae BY4741 pdr1 Delta pdr3 Delta (BYL13). The point mutations of
   PDR1 (F815S) and PDR3 (Y276H) in BYL13 resulted in the highest tolerance
   to C10 alkane, and the expression of wild-type PDR3 in BYL13 led to the
   highest tolerance to C11 alkane. To identify and verify the correlation
   between the Pdr transcription factors and tolerance improvement, we
   analyzed the expression patterns of genes regulated by the Pdr
   transcription factors in the most tolerant strains against C10 and C11
   alkanes. Quantitative PCR results showed that the Pdr transcription
   factors differentially regulated genes associated with multi-drug
   resistance, stress responses, and membrane modifications, suggesting
   different extents of intracellular alkane levels, reactive oxygen
   species (ROS) production and membrane integrity. We further showed that
   (i) the expression of Pdr1(mt1) + Pdr3(mt) reduced intracellular C10
   alkane by 67 \% and ROS by 53 \%, and significantly alleviated membrane
   damage; and (ii) the expression of the Pdr3(wt) reduced intracellular
   C11 alkane by 72 \% and ROS by 21 \%. Alkane transport assays also
   revealed that the reduction of alkane accumulation was due to higher
   export (C10 and C11 alkanes) and lower import (C11 alkane).
   Conclusions: We improved yeast's tolerance to alkane biofuels by
   modulating the expression of the wild-type and site-mutated Pdr1p and
   Pdr3p, and extensively identified the correlation between Pdr
   transcription factors and tolerance improvement by analyzing gene
   patterns, alkane transport, ROS, and membrane integrity. These findings
   provide valuable insights into manipulating transcription factors in
   yeast for improved alkane tolerance and productivity.}},

   increases with an increase of the laser pulse duration at low laser
   intensity, but decreases with an increase of the laser pulse duration at

Abstract = {{Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC) is a kind of High Performance
   Fiber Reinforced Cementitious Composites (HPFRCC) with a low fiber
   volume content of 2\%. The unique properties of tensile strain hardening
   behavior and tight multiple cracks ensure that ECC can meet the
   stringent requirements of resiliency and durability of concrete
   infrastructures. While there are strong initiatives for the adoption of
   ECC in China, wider applications will require localization of material
   ingredients. In this paper, ECCs with local ingredients, including
   domestic PVA fibers, fly ash and crumb rubber, were developed under the
   guidance of micromechanics model for ECC. The fiber/matrix interface
   parameters and matrix parameters from single fiber pullout test and
   fracture toughness test respectively, were obtained for the tailoring of
   domestic ECC. The experimental results indicated that cost-effective
   ductile ECCs can be designed successfully using local material
   ingredients. These composites show an ultimate tensile strength of 4-5
   MPa and tensile strain capacity of 3-6\%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{MDR-1 and MRP-1 activity in peripheral blood leukocytes of rheumatoid
   arthritis patients}},
Journal = {{DIAGNOSTIC PATHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic disease leading to
   decreased quality of life with a rather variable response rate to
   Disease Modifying Anti Rheumatic Drugs. Methotrexate (MTX) is the gold
   standard therapy in Rheumatoid Arthritis. The Multidrug resistance
   Related Protein and Multi Drug Resistance protein 1, also called
   P-glycoprotein-170 transporters can alter the intracellular
   concentration of different drugs. Methotrexate is an MRP1 substrate and
   thus the functional activity of MRP1 might have a clinical impact on the
   efficiency of the Methotrexate-therapy in Rheumatoid Arthritis.
   Methods: We have compared the functional Multidrug Activity Factors
   (MAF) of the MDR1 and MRP1 transporters of Peripheral Blood Leukocytes
   of 59 Rheumatoid Arthritis patients with various response rate to
   MTX-therapy (MTX-responder, MTX-resistant and MTX-intolerant RA-groups)
   and 47 non-RA controls in six different leukocyte subpopulations
   (neutrophil leukocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes, CD4+, CD8+ and CD19+
   cells). There was a decreased MAF of RA patients compared to
   non-Rheumatoid Arthritis patients and healthy controls in the leukocyte
   subpopulations. There was a significant difference between the MAF
   values of the MTX-responder and MTX intolerant groups. But we have not
   found significant differences between the MAF values of the MTXresponder
   and MTX-resistant Rheumatoid Arthritis -groups.
   Results: Our results suggest that MDR1 and MRP1 functional activity does
   not seem to affect the response rate to MTX-therapy of Rheumatoid
   Arthritis-patients, but it might be useful in predicting MTX-side
   effects. We have demonstrated the decreased functional MDR-activity on
   almost 60 Rheumatoid Arthritis patients, which can be interpreted as a
   sign of the immune-suppressive effect of the MTX-treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of pyrogenic
   nanosilica with different specific surfaces areas (200 and 380 m(2)/g)
   on mechanical properties of fiber-reinforced high-performance concrete
   (FRHPC) produced with two different types of fibers including steel and
   polypropylene fibers. Accordingly, different mechanical tests
   (compressive, splitting tensile and flexural strengths) as well as
   electrical resistivity were performed at 7, 28, and 91 curing days. In
   addition, the modulus of rupture and flexural toughness of FRHPC prisms
   were calculated based on the flexural, testing results. Also, scanning
   electron microscopy test (SEM) was conducted to evaluate the
   microstructural performance of pyrogenic nanosilicas in the matrices of
   FRHPCs.
   Results demonstrated that the application of pyrogenic nanosilica can
   enhance the mechanical and electrical resistivity properties of FRHPC.
   In addition, the coarser type of pyrogenic nanosilica showed better
   performance in increasing the mechanical properties of FRHPC than finer
   one. However, the finer type of pyrogenic nanosilica resulted in higher
   electrical resistivity in FRHPC specimens compared to coarser
   nanosilica. Moreover, according to SEM test, the enhancement of
   mechanical properties of FRHPC in the presence of pyrogenic rianosilicas
   could be related to the densification of the matrix caused by their
   particles. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Modeling Leggett-Garg-inequality violation}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{The Leggett-Garg inequality is a widely used test of the
   ``quantumness{''} of a system and involves correlations between
   measurements realized at different times. According to its widespread
   interpretation, a violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality disproves
   macroscopic realism and noninvasiveness. Nevertheless, recent results
   point out that macroscopic realism is a model-dependent notion and that
   one should always be able to attribute to invasiveness a violation of a
   Leggett-Garg inequality. This opens some natural questions: How do we
   provide such an attribution in a systematic way? How can apparent
   macroscopic realism violation be recast into a dimensional-independent
   invasiveness model? The present work answers these questions by
   introducing an operational model where the effects of invasiveness are
   controllable through a parameter associated with what is called the
   measurability of the physical system. Such a parameter leads to
   different generalized measurements that can be associated with the
   dimensionality of a system, to measurement errors, or to back action.}},

   bis-ester derivative 28 of trihydroxybenzaldehyde 26 is condensed with
   syncarpic acid (10) to give tricyclic hemiacetal 29. Acetalization and
   cuprate addition to the enone function led to bis-ester 32 which gave
   rhodomyrtone (1) by TiCl4-induced regioselective Fries rearrangement.

Abstract = {{We examined whether the patients with Bipolar Disorder (BD) and
   Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) comorbidity may represent a distinct
   form of BD. The subjects diagnosed with BD (n=48), OCD (n=61), and BD
   with OCD (n=32) were compared in terms of several socio-demographic and
   clinical characteristics. Previous history of suicidal attempts was more
   likely to be higher in BD-OCD group compared to the other two groups. A
   more episodic course of OCD, higher rates of rapid cycling, and the
   seasonality were found in BD-OCD patients. The frequency of bipolar II
   and NOS subtypes was more prevalent in patients with BD-OCD than in OCD
   patients. The first diagnosed illness was BD in the majority of BD-OCD
   cases. It was found that first affective episode was major depression in
   half of BD-OCD patients. Age at onset of BD was found to be earlier in
   BD-OCD group compared to pure BD patients. Bipolarity may not have a
   specific effect on the phenomenology of OC symptoms. The episodic course
   of OCD, seasonality, rapid cycling, earlier onset of BD, and impulsivity
   in BD-OCD patients may be indicative for a distinct form of BD. (C) 2015

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},

Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{A modeling study was carried out to analyze thermal stresses in a
   microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (mSOFC) stack and to estimate thermal
   expansion of the fuel cells inside the stack. A joint analysis by
   Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Computational Structural
   Mechanics Finite Element Method (FEM) was performed. Temperature
   profiles generated by the thermo-hydrodynamic model were applied in the
   thermo-mechanical model to calculate thermal stress distributions in the
   mSOFC stack. The results yield maximum thermal axial elongation equal to
   1.34 mm for the mSOFC stack, while the maximum radial elongation was
   equal to 0.496 mm. Modeled maximum equivalent (von Mises) stress was
   equal to 538 MPA in the contact areas of the cylindrical housing and
   manifold on the fuel inlet side. Based on comparison of the total axial
   stresses and the residual ones with the material strength it was noticed
   that the anode and electrolyte layers should not be critically deformed,
   but there is a risk of damage for cathode layers at chosen fuel cell
   configurations. A high risk of damage was also noticed for the outer
   housing, near contact points with manifolds as well as at the air
   distributor due to large number of cutouts in the material. (C) 2015

Title = {{Dressing the chopped-random-basis optimization: A bandwidth-limited
   access to the trap-free landscape}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{In quantum optimal control theory the success of an optimization
   algorithm is highly influenced by how the figure of merit to be
   optimized behaves as a function of the control field, i.e., by the
   control landscape. Constraints on the control field introduce local
   minima in the landscape-false traps-which might prevent an efficient
   solution of the optimal control problem. Rabitz et al. {[}Science 303,
   1998 (2004)] showed that local minima occur only rarely for
   unconstrained optimization. Here, we extend this result to the case of
   bandwidth-limited control pulses showing that in this case one can
   eliminate the false traps arising from the constraint. Based on this
   theoretical understanding, we modify the chopped-random-basis (CRAB)
   optimal control algorithm and show that this development exploits the
   advantages of both (unconstrained) gradient algorithms and of truncated
   basis methods, allowing one to always follow the gradient of the
   unconstrained landscape by bandwidth-limited control functions. We study
   the effects of additional constraints and show that for reasonable
   constraints the convergence properties are still maintained. Finally, we
   numerically show that this approach saturates the theoretical bound on
   the minimal bandwidth of the control needed to optimally drive the
   system.}},

Abstract = {{This research examines the strength and durability properties of
   concrete containing up to 50\% ground bagasse ash (GBA) replacing
   ordinary Portland cement (OPC) by weight of binder. The setting times,
   compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, chloride resistance, and
   expansion due to a 5\% Na2SO4 solution of concretes containing ground
   bagasse ash were investigated. The results showed that concrete with
   50\% of GBA produced at least 90\% compressive strength as compared to
   control concrete (CT concrete) at the age of 28 days. The rapid chloride
   ion penetration in term of charge passed (Coulombs) was at a very low
   level when 20-50\% of GBA was used to replace OPC in the concrete.
   Moreover, the same trend of chloride penetration depth was found by the
   immersion test, i.e., the chloride resistance increased with the
   increase of GBA replacement. The results suggest that the use of GBA of
   up to 50\% to replace OPC by weight of binder can increase the
   durability properties of concrete, especially its chloride penetration
   resistance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{HIV-1 Drug Resistance Mutations: Potential Applications for
   Point-of-Care Genotypic Resistance Testing}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{The increasing prevalence of acquired and transmitted HIV-1 drug
   resistance is an obstacle to successful antiretroviral therapy (ART) in
   the low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) hardest hit by the HIV-1
   pandemic. Genotypic drug resistance testing could facilitate the choice
   of initial ART in areas with rising transmitted drug resistance (TDR)
   and enable care-providers to determine which individuals with
   virological failure (VF) on a first-or second-line ART regimen require a
   change in treatment. An inexpensive near point-of-care (POC) genotypic
   resistance test would be useful in settings where the resources,
   capacity, and infrastructure to perform standard genotypic drug
   resistance testing are limited. Such a test would be particularly useful
   in conjunction with the POC HIV-1 viral load tests that are currently
   being introduced in LMICs. A POC genotypic resistance test is likely to
   involve the use of allele-specific point mutation assays for detecting
   drug-resistance mutations (DRMs). This study proposes that two major
   nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-associated DRMs (M184V
   and K65R) and four major NNRTI-associated DRMs (K103N, Y181C, G190A, and
   V106M) would be the most useful for POC genotypic resistance testing in
   LMIC settings. One or more of these six DRMs was present in 61.2\% of
   analyzed virus sequences from ART-naive individuals with intermediate or
   high-level TDR and 98.8\% of analyzed virus sequences from individuals
   on a first-line NRTI/NNRTI-containing regimen with intermediate or
   high-level acquired drug resistance. The detection of one or more of
   these DRMs in an ART-naive individual or in a individual with VF on a
   first-line NRTI/NNRTI-containing regimen may be considered an indication
   for a protease inhibitor (PI)-containing regimen or closer virological
   monitoring based on cost-effectiveness or country policy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a study on the influence of tungsten
   as a structure promoter in the carbothermal reduction of silica. The
   morphology and surface structure of the obtained materials were analyzed
   using XRD, SEM-EDS, TEM and FTIR techniques. Surface area and porosity
   were evaluated on the basis of low temperature adsorption of nitrogen.
   The WC-W2c-beta-sic nanostructured composite material formed from the
   carbothermal reduction of SiO2 promoted with tungsten had a larger
   surface area (25.8m(2) g(-1)) in comparison to that measured for a
   beta-sic sample obtained by the simple carbothermal reduction of silica.
   Based on the results of this research, tungsten promoted carbothermal
   reduction of silica appears as a relatively simple procedure for
   obtaining valuable materials with a sufficiently high surface area to be
   used in catalysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Muscle Function after Injury}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Skeletal muscle regeneration following acute injury is a multi-step
   process involving complex changes in tissue microenvironment.
   Macrophages (MPs) are one of the key cell types involved in
   orchestration and modulation of the repair process. Multiple studies
   highlight the essential role of MPs in the control of the myogenic
   program and inflammatory response during skeletal muscle regeneration. A
   variety of MP phenotypes have been identified and characterized in vitro
   as well as in vivo. As such, MPs hold great promise for cell-based
   therapies in the field of regenerative medicine. In this study we used
   bone-marrow derived in vitro LPS/IFN-y-induced M1 MPs to enhance
   functional muscle recovery after tourniquet-induced ischemia/reperfusion
   injury (TK-I/R). We detected a 15\% improvement in specific tension and
   force normalized to mass after M1 (LPS/IFN-gamma) MP transplantation 24
   hours post-reperfusion. Interestingly, we found that M0 bone
   marrow-derived unpolarized MPs significantly impaired muscle function
   highlighting the complexity of temporally coordinated skeletal muscle
   regenerative program. Furthermore, we show that delivery of M1
   (LPS/IFN-gamma) MPs early in regeneration accelerates myofiber repair,
   decreases fibrotic tissue deposition and increases whole muscle IGF-I
   expression.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Microscopy has long been considered to be the gold standard
   for diagnosis of malaria despite the introduction of newer assays.
   However, it has many challenges like requirement of trained
   microscopists and logistic issues. A vision based device that can
   diagnose malaria, provide speciation and estimate parasitaemia was
   evaluated.
   Methods: The device was evaluated using samples from 431 consented
   patients, 361 of which were initially screened by RDT and microscopy and
   later analysed by PCR. It was a prospective, non-randomized, blinded
   trial. Quantification of parasitaemia was performed by two experienced
   technicians. Samples were subjected to diagnosis by Sight Dx digital
   imaging scanning.
   Results: The sensitivity and specificity of the SightDx P1 device for
   analysed samples were found to be 97.05 and 96.33 \%, respectively, when
   compared to PCR. When compared to microscopy, sensitivity and
   specificity were found to be 94.4 and 95.6 \%, respectively. The device
   was able to speciate 73.3 \% of the PCR Plasmodium falciparum positive
   samples and 91.4 \% of PCR Plasmodium vivax positive samples.
   Conclusion: The ability of the device to detect parasitaemia as compared
   with microscopy, was within 50 \% in 71.3 \% of cases and demonstrated a
   correlation coefficient of 0.89.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis and characterization is reported of an efficient
   polysiloxane derivative containing the 1,3-bis(9-carbazolyl)benzene
   (mCP) moiety as a pendant unit on the polysiloxane backbone. In
   comparison with mCP, the mCP-polysiloxane hybrid (PmCPSi) has
   significantly improved thermal and morphological stabilities with a high
   decomposition temperature (T-d = 523 degrees C) and glass transition
   temperature (T-g = 194 degrees C). The silicon oxygen linkage of PmCPSi
   prevents intermolecular pi-stacking and ensures a high triplet energy
   level (E-T = 3.0 eV). Using PmCPSi as a host, blue phosphorescent
   organic light emitting devices (PhO-LEDs) effectively confine triplet
   excitons, with efficient energy transfer to the guest emitter and a
   relatively low turn-on voltage of 5.8 V. A maximum external quantum
   efficiency of 9.24\% and maximum current efficiency of 18.93 cd/A are
   obtained. These values are higher than for directly analogous
   poly(vinylcarbazole) (PVK) based devices (6.76\%, 12.29 cd/A). Good
   color stability over a range of operating voltages is observed. A
   two-component ``warm-white{''} device with a maximum current efficiency
   of 10.4 cd/A is obtained using a blend of blue and orange phosphorescent
   emitters as dopants in PmCPSi host. These results demonstrate that
   well-designed polysiloxane derivatives are highly efficient hosts
   suitable for low-cost solution-processed PhOLEDs.}},

   Stroke Care Audit (SSCA) data in identifying stroke in the Scottish
   population}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: In Scotland all non-obstetric, non-psychiatric acute
   inpatient and day case stays are recorded by an administrative hospital
   discharge database, the Scottish Morbidity Record (SMR01). The Scottish
   Stroke Care Audit (SSCA) collects data from all hospitals managing acute
   stroke in Scotland to support and improve quality of stroke care. The
   aim was to assess whether there were discrepancies between these data
   sources for admissions from 2010 to 2011.
   Methods: Records were matched when admission dates from the two data
   sources were within two days of each other and if an International
   Classification of Diseases (ICD) code of I61, I63, I64, or G45 was in
   the primary or secondary diagnosis field on SMR01. We also carried out a
   linkage analysis followed by a case-note review within one hospital in
   Scotland.
   Results: There were a total of 22 416 entries on SSCA and 22 200 entries
   on SMR01. The concordance between SSCA and SMR01 was 16 823. SSCA
   contained 5593 strokes that were not present in SMR01, whereas SMR01
   contained 185 strokes that were not present in SSCA. In the case-note
   review the concordance was 531, with SSCA containing 157 strokes that
   were not present in SMR01 and SMR01 containing 32 strokes that were not
   present in SSCA.
   Conclusions: When identifying strokes, hospital administrative discharge
   databases should be used with caution. Our results demonstrate that SSCA
   most accurately represents the number of strokes occurring in Scotland.
   This resource is useful for determining the provision of adequate
   patient care, stroke services and resources, and as a tool for research.}},

   griseofulvin and polymer PVP K30 in water and allowing the mix to
   equilibrate. A PMD probe was immersed in each mixture and the dissolved
   free drug concentrations were determined in the PMD samples. The
   experimental procedure and the equations used for data analysis are
   presented. To assess the consistency of data, a binding model was fit to
   the data obtained using PMD by calculating the dissolved free drug
   fraction f(D) for each drug-polymer ratio in solution, and obtaining the
   product of the binding stoichiometry and binding constant (nu K per mole
   of polymer) from the slope of a plot of (1-f(D))/f(D) vs. the molar
   polymer concentration. For comparison, equilibrium binding experiments
   were also performed at 23 C, and the determined value of nu K was
   similar to the value found using PMD. Experiments were performed at
   three temperatures, and a plot of ln (nK) vs. 1/T was linear and a
   binding enthalpy of -110.9 +/- 4.4 J/mol of monomer was calculated from
   its slope. It was concluded that PMD can be used to determine the
   dissolved free drug concentrations in situ, which allows
   characterization of the drug-polymer interaction, even for low drug
   concentrations. This information may be important in modeling the
   dissolution or release of drugs from formulations containing polymers.

Abstract = {{Novel Ag@CeO2 core-shell nanostructures with well-controlled shape and
   shell thickness were successfully synthesized via a green and facile
   template-free approach in aqueous solution. As-prepared samples were
   characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
   (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS), ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS),
   electron spin resonance (ESR) and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL).
   The structures with different core shapes and controllable shell
   thickness exhibited unique optical properties. It is found that the
   nanoscale Ag@CeO2 core-shell photocatalysts exhibit significantly
   enhanced photocatalytic activities in the O-2 evolution and MB dye
   degradation compared to pure CeO2 nanoparticals. The enhancement in
   photocatalytic activities can be ascribed to the localized surface
   plasmon resonance (SPR) of Ag cores. Moreover, larger active interfacial
   areas and contact between metal/semiconductor in the core-shell
   structure facilitate transfer of charge carriers and prolong lifetime of
   photogenerated electron-hole pairs. It is expected that the Ag@CeO2
   core-shell structure may have great potential in a wider range of
   light-harvesting applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are proposed to play important roles in
   the degradation of collagens, thus causing the post-mortem softening of
   fish muscle, although the specific mechanism remains largely unresolved.
   Previously, we reported the existence of gelatinase-like proteinases in
   common carp (Cyprinus carpio) muscle. The primary structures of these
   proteinases, however, have never been investigated. In the present
   study, two MMPs with molecular masses of 66 and 65 kDa were purified to
   homogeneity from common carp muscle by ammonium sulfate fractionation
   and a series of column chromatographies. Matrix-assisted laser
   desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry
   (MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS/MS) analysis indicated that they are completely
   identical to MMP-2 from common carp. During chilled storage of common
   carp at 4 degrees C, the enzymatic activity of MMP-2 increased to 212\%
   in 12 h while the texture profile increased over the first 2 h and
   gradually decreased. On the other hand, type V collagen was purified to
   homogeneity and a specific polyclonal antibody against this protein was
   prepared. Both type I and V collagens were effectively hydrolyzed by
   MMP-2 at 30 degrees C and even at 4 degrees C. Furthermore, injection of
   Metalloproteinase proteinase inhibitor EDTA into the blood vessel of
   live common carp suppressed post-mortem tenderization significantly. All
   of these results confirmed that MMP-2 is a major proteinase responsible
   for the degradation of collagens, resulting in the softening of fish
   muscle during chilled storage.}},

Abstract = {{With the aim of specifying the type of curing compound for water-scarce

   compressive and flexural strength, drying shrinkage, impermeability and

   cracks. In general, the composite-based and the acrylic-based curing
   compound performed better than the paraffin-based and the silicate-based
   curing compound. At the same time, microstructure test results showed
   that curing compound promoted the hydration of the cement to form a
   compact and homogenous microstructure, and AFt crystalline particles
   were rod-like with a larger size. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   beam computed tomography: an observational study}},
Journal = {{HEAD \& FACE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the neurovascular
   bundle (NVB) position with cone-beam computerized tomography (CBCT).
   Methods: CBCT images of 345 patients were evaluated. The distance from
   the neurovascular bundle to the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) was
   measured (DNB). The distance from mid-palatal suture to the alveolar
   crest was used to determine the palatal depth. Palatal junction angle
   (PA) was measured using the junction angle between the hard palate and
   alveolar crest. The relationships between the DNB and the palatal depth
   and between these two parameters and the PA were evaluated. Student's
   t-test was used to analyze the differences in DNB related to gender, and
   the correlation between the DNB while Pearson correlation analysis was
   used to determine the correlation between the DNB and age (p = 0.05).
   The relationship between the DNB and the palatal depth, and the
   relationship between these two parameters and the PA were also evaluated
   using Pearson correlation analysis.
   Results: Except at the canine and first premolar areas the DNB was
   positively correlated with the palatal depth. No significant
   relationship between the PA and DNB or with PVD was observed. The
   highest DNB was 14 mm at the first molar, and the lowest was 10.8 mm at
   the canine.
   Conclusions: Care is needed while rotating flap and harvesting the
   subepithelial connective tissue graft at the canine area because the
   neurovascular bundle passes approximately 11 mm apically to CEJ at the
   canine region.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, wetting process of copper filling in through silicon vias
   was investigated by agitation and vacuum pretreatment. Copper filling
   followed the pretreatment was fabricated in electrolyte with optimal
   additives concentration. By agitation pretreatment, a large void was
   observed at the bottom of the vias where the copper seed layer was
   clearly seen, which was attributed to the insufficient wetting of vias.
   In the blind vias with higher aspect ratio, the ambient gas phase was
   difficult to be completely removed from the vias by agitation. This
   resulted in electrolyte having better wettability does not reach all the
   places of the vias by capillarity. The vacuum pretreatment results
   suggested that the air inside the vias was almost completely evacuated.
   Hence, the deionized water used as wetting solution easily permeated the
   blind vias relying on atmospheric pressure. Consequently, the uniform,
   complete and void-free copper filling was achieved due to better
   wettability of 273 K deionized water. Nevertheless, deionized water with
   temperature higher than the critical vaporization temperature yielded a
   void formation at the bottom of the vias, which resulted from the
   insufficient wetting caused by the vaporization of deionized water. The
   conclusions drawn by the experimental results were employed in the
   through silicon vias, and void-free copper filling in the vias having
   aspect ratio as high as 16 was fabricated. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Precise nodal staging is particularly important to guide the treatments
   and determine the prognosis for cancer patients. However, it is still
   challenging to noninvasively and precisely detect in-depth tumor
   metastasis in lymph nodes (LNs) because of the small size and high
   potential of obtaining pseudopositive results. Herein, we report the
   rational design of a T-1-T-2 dual-modal MRI contrast agent for accurate
   imaging of tumor metastasis in LNs using gadolinium-embedded iron oxide
   nanoplates (GdIOP). The GdIOP were modulated with suitable size in vivo
   through surface functionalization by zwitterionic dopamine sulfonate
   (ZDS) molecules. The efficient uptake of GdIOP@ZDS nanoparticles through
   drainage effect because of the presence of large amount of macrophages
   and dendritic cells generates both T-1 and T-2 contrasts in LNs. In
   contrast, the low uptake of protein-corona-free GdIOP@ZDS nanoparticles
   by melanoma B16 tumor cells promises pseudocontrast imaging of potential
   tumor metastasis in LNs. The combination of T-1 and T-2 imaging
   modalities allows self-confirmed detection of a metastatic tumor with
   about 1.2 mm in the minimal dimension in LNs, which is close to the
   detection limit of submilimeter level of MRI scans. This study provides
   an efficient and noninvasive strategy to detect tumor metastasis in LNs
   with greatly enhanced diagnostic accuracy.}},

Title = {{Smiles2Monomers: a link between chemical and biological structures for
   polymers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: The monomeric composition of polymers is powerful for
   structure comparison and synthetic biology, among others. Many databases
   give access to the atomic structure of compounds but the monomeric
   structure of polymers is often lacking. We have designed a smart
   algorithm, implemented in the tool Smiles2Monomers (s2m), to infer
   efficiently and accurately the monomeric structure of a polymer from its
   chemical structure.
   Results: Our strategy is divided into two steps: first, monomers are
   mapped on the atomic structure by an efficient subgraph-isomorphism
   algorithm; second, the best tiling is computed so that non-overlapping
   monomers cover all the structure of the target polymer. The mapping is
   based on a Markovian index built by a dynamic programming algorithm. The
   index enables s2m to search quickly all the given monomers on a target
   polymer. After, a greedy algorithm combines the mapped monomers into a
   consistent monomeric structure. Finally, a local branch and cut
   algorithm refines the structure. We tested this method on two manually
   annotated databases of polymers and reconstructed the structures de novo
   with a sensitivity over 90 \%. The average computation time per polymer
   is 2 s.
   Conclusion: s2m automatically creates de novo monomeric annotations for
   polymers, efficiently in terms of time computation and sensitivity. s2m
   allowed us to detect annotation errors in the tested databases and to
   easily find the accurate structures. So, s2m could be integrated into
   the curation process of databases of small compounds to verify the
   current entries and accelerate the annotation of new polymers. The full
   method can be downloaded or accessed via a website for peptide-like
   polymers at http://bioinfo.lifl.fr/norine/smiles2monomers.jsp.}},

Abstract = {{PPAR alpha belongs to the peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptors
   (PPARs) family, which plays a critical role in inhibiting cell
   proliferation and tumorigenesis, while the molecular mechanism is still
   unclear. Here we report that PPAR alpha serves as an E3 ubiquitin ligase
   to govern Bcl2 protein stability. PPAR alpha physically bound to Bcl2
   protein. In this process, PPAR alpha/C102 was critical for PPAR alpha
   binding to BH3 domain of Bcl2, subsequently, PPAR alpha transferred
   K48-linked polyubiquitin to lysine-22 site of Bcl2 resulting in its
   ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. Importantly,
   overexpression of PPAR alpha enhanced cancer cell chemotherapy
   sensitivity. In contrast, silenced PPAR alpha decreased this event.
   These findings revealed a novel mechanism of PPAR alpha governed
   endogenous Bcl2 protein stability leading to reduced cancer cell
   chemoresistance, which provides a potential drug target for cancer
   treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Dogs lap because they have incomplete cheeks and cannot suck. When
   lapping, a dog's tongue pulls a liquid column from the bath, suggesting
   that the hydrodynamics of column formation are critical to understanding
   how dogs drink. We measured lapping in 19 dogs and used the results to
   generate a physical model of the tongue's interaction with the air-fluid
   interface. These experiments help to explain how dogs exploit the fluid
   dynamics of the generated column. The results demonstrate that effects
   of acceleration govern lapping frequency, which suggests that dogs curl
   the tongue to create a larger liquid column. Comparing lapping in dogs
   and cats reveals that, despite similar morphology, these carnivores lap
   in different physical regimes: an unsteady inertial regime for dogs and
   steady inertial regime for cats.}},

Abstract = {{Herein, we evaluated the concordance of population inferences and
   conclusions resulting from the analysis of short mitochondrial fragments
   (i.e., partial or complete D-Loop nucleotide sequences) versus complete
   mitogenome sequences for 53 bobwhites representing six ecoregions across
   TX and OK (USA). Median joining (MJ) haplotype networks demonstrated
   that analyses performed using small mitochondrial fragments were
   insufficient for estimating the true (i.e., complete) mitogenome
   haplotype structure, corresponding levels of divergence, and maternal
   population history of our samples. Notably, discordant demographic
   inferences were observed when mismatch distributions of partial (i.e.,
   partial D-Loop) versus complete mitogenome sequences were compared, with
   the reduction in mitochondrial genomic information content observed to
   encourage spurious inferences in our samples. A probabilistic approach
   to variant prediction for the complete bobwhite mitogenomes revealed 344
   segregating sites corresponding to 347 total mutations, including 49
   putative nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) distributed
   across 12 protein coding genes. Evidence of gross heteroplasmy was
   observed for 13 bobwhites, with 10 of the 13 heteroplasmies involving
   one moderate to high frequency SNV. Haplotype network and phylogenetic
   analyses for the complete bobwhite mitogenome sequences revealed two
   divergent maternal lineages (d(XY) = 0.00731; F-ST = 0.849; P < 0.05),
   thereby supporting the potential for two putative subspecies. However,
   the diverged lineage (n = 103 variants) almost exclusively involved
   bobwhites geographically classified as Colinus virginianus texanus,
   which is discordant with the expectations of previous geographic
   subspecies designations. Tests of adaptive evolution for functional
   divergence (MKT), frequency distribution tests (D, F-S) and phylogenetic
   analyses (RAxML) provide no evidence for positive selection or
   hybridization with the sympatric scaled quail (Callipepla squamata) as
   being explanatory factors for the two bobwhite maternal lineages
   observed. Instead, our analyses support the supposition that two
   diverged maternal lineages have survived from pre-expansion to
   post-expansion population(s), with the segregation of some slightly
   deleterious non-synonymous mutations.}},

Abstract = {{The recent LHCb discovery of states P-c(+)(4380), P-c(+)(4450), believed
   to be c (c) over bar uud pentaquark resonances, begs the question of
   whether equivalent states with c (c) over bar -> s (s) over bar exist,
   and how they might be produced. The precise analogue to the P-c(+)
   discovery channel Lambda(b) -> J/psi K- p, namely, Lambda(c) -> phi
   pi(0)pi, is feasible for this study and indeed is less Cabibbo
   suppressed, although its limited phase space suggests that evidence of a
   s (s) over bar uud resonance P-s(+) would be confined to the kinematic
   end-point region.}},

Abstract = {{The axon initial segment (AIS), located within the first 30 mu m of the
   axon, has two essential roles in generating action potentials and
   maintaining axonal identity. AIS assembly depends on a beta
   IV-spectrin/ankyrin G scaffold, but its macromolecular arrangement is
   not well understood. Here, we quantitatively determined the AIS
   nanoscale architecture by using stochastic optical reconstruction
   microscopy (STORM). First, we directly demonstrate that the 190-nm
   periodicity of the AIS submembrane lattice results from longitudinal,
   head-to-head beta IV-spectrin molecules connecting actin rings. Using
   multicolor 3D-STORM, we resolve the nanoscale organization of ankyrin G:
   its amino terminus associates with the submembrane lattice, whereas the
   C terminus radially extends (similar to 32 nm on average) toward the
   cytosol. This AIS nano-architecture is highly resistant to cytoskeletal
   perturbations, indicating its role in structural stabilization. Our
   findings provide a comprehensive view of AIS molecular architecture and
   will help reveal the crucial physiological functions of this
   compartment.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Young non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients under the
   age of 40 can further be categorized into different age subgroups.
   Whether they have homogeneous clinical features and survival outcomes
   remains unexplored.
   Methods: Information of 4623 NSCLC patients up to 40 years old from 1988
   to 2012 was retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
   Results (SEER) database. Clinicopathologic characteristics and survival
   outcomes were compared between patients diagnosed at 18-30 years old
   (younger group) and those at 31-40 years old (older group).
   Results: The proportion of patients in the younger group among all lung
   cancer patients was stable between 1988 and 2012. However, the
   proportion of patients in the older group decreased from 1.2\% to 0.5\%.
   The younger patients had a higher proportion of adenocarcinoma (P =
   0.016), a lower proportion of large cell carcinoma (P = 0.008), a higher
   proportion of stage I disease (P = 0.002) and a lower proportion of
   stage III disease (P < 0.001). The younger patients had significantly
   better lung cancer-specific survival (LCSS) in the whole cohort (P <
   0.001) and in the subgroup of patients with stage I (P = 0.038) or stage
   IV (P < 0.001) disease. Multivariate survival analysis showed that
   patients under 30 years old was an independent predictor of both better
   LCSS (P = 0.010) and overall survival (OS) (P = 0.018).
   Conclusions: Adult NSCLC patients under 30 years old had distinctive
   clinicopathologic characteristics and survival outcomes compared to
   patients diagnosed at 31-40 years old.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanisms of the formation of nanoparticles of some B2 shape memory

   Such morphology is related to the nanosized particles gathered in
   agglomerates. Detailed examination of those particles allows proposed
   several mechanisms of their formation. The mechanisms explains two kinds
   of nanosized particles: particles of several tens and even hundreds of
   nanometers are formed due to explosion of molten droplets while the
   smaller particles having in turn a different structure and morphology
   are formed as a result of condensation of evaporated constituents under
   different conditions. The latter have the composition usually different
   from the target composition while the composition of the former is very

Title = {{Time Trends in Ischemic Stroke among Type 2 Diabetic and Non-Diabetic
   Patients: Analysis of the Spanish National Hospital Discharge Data
   (2003-2012)}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) is the most rapidly increasing risk factor for
   ischemic stroke. We aimed to compare trends in outcomes for ischemic
   stroke in people with or without diabetes in Spain between 2003 and
   2012.
   Methods
   We selected all patients hospitalized for ischemic stroke using national
   hospital discharge data. We evaluated annual incident rates stratified
   by T2DM status. We analyzed trends in the use of diagnostic and
   therapeutic procedures, patient comorbidities, and in-hospital outcomes.
   We calculated in-hospital mortality (IHM), length of hospital stay
   (LOHS) and readmission rate in one month after discharge. Time trend on
   the incidence of hospitalization was estimated fitting Poisson
   regression models by sex and diabetes variables. In-hospital mortality
   was analyzed using logistic regression models separate for men and
   women. LOHS were compared with ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis when necessary.
   Results
   We identified a total of 423,475 discharges of patients (221,418 men and
   202,057 women) admitted with ischemic stroke as primary diagnosis.
   Patients with T2DM accounted for 30.9\% of total. The estimated
   incidence rates of discharges increased significantly in all groups. The
   incidence of hospitalization due to stroke (with ICD9 codes for stroke
   as main diagnosis at discharge) was higher among those with than those
   without diabetes in all the years studied. T2DM was positively
   associated with ischemic stroke with an adjusted incidence rate ratio
   (IRR) of 2.27 (95\% CI 2.24-2.29) for men and 2.15 (95\% CI 2.13-2.17)
   for women. Over the 10 year period LOHS decreased significantly in men
   and women with and without diabetes. Readmission rate remained stable in
   diabetic and non diabetic men (around 5\%) while slightly increased in
   women with and without diabetes. We observed a significant increase in
   the use of fibrinolysis from 2002-2013. IHM was positively associated
   with older age in all groups, with Charlson Comorbidity Index > 3 and
   atrial fibrillation as risk factors. The IHM did not change
   significantly over time among T2DM men and women ranging from 9.25\% to
   10.56\% and from 13.21\% to 14.86\%, respectively; neither did among
   non-diabetic women. However, in men without T2DM IHM decreased
   significantly over time. Diabetes was associated to higher IHM only in
   women (OR 1.07; 95\% CI, 1.05-1.11).
   Conclusions
   Our national data show that incidence rate of ischemic stroke
   hospitalization increased significantly during the period of study
   (2003-2012). People with T2DM have more than double the risk of ischemic
   stroke after adjusting for other risk factors. Women with T2DM had
   poorer outcomes-IHM and readmission rates-than diabetic men. Diabetes
   was an independent factor for IHM only in women.}},

Abstract = {{Dramatic increases in hippocampal spine synapse density are known to
   occur within minutes of estrogen exposure. Until now, it has been
   assumed that enhanced spinogenesis increased excitatory input received
   by the CA1 pyramidal neurons, but how this facilitated learning and
   memory was unclear. Delivery of 17a-estradiol or an estrogen receptor
   (ER)-alpha (but not ER-beta) agonist into the dorsal hippocampus rapidly
   improved general discrimination learning in female mice. The same
   treatments increased CA1 dendritic spines in hippocampal sections over a
   time course consistent with the learning acquisition phase.
   Surprisingly, estrogen-activated spinogenesis was associated with a
   decrease in CA1 hippocampal excitatory input, rapidly and transiently
   reducing CA1 AMPA activity via a mechanism likely reflecting AMPA
   receptor internalization and creation of silent or immature synapses. We
   propose that estrogens promote hippocampally mediated learning via a
   mechanism resembling some of the broad features of normal development,
   an initial overproduction of functionally immature connections being
   subsequently pruned by experience.}},

Title = {{Genome-wide discovery and validation of Eucalyptus small RNAs reveals
   variable patterns of conservation and diversity across species of
   Myrtaceae}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{DEC 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Micro RNAs are a class of small non coding RNAs of 20-24
   nucleotides transcribed as single stranded precursors from MIR gene
   loci. Initially described as post-transcriptional regulators involved in
   development, two decades ago, miRNAs have been proven to regulate a wide
   range of processes in plants such as germination, morphology and
   responses to biotic and abiotic stress. Despite wide conservation in
   plants, a number of miRNAs are lineage specific. We describe the first
   genome wide survey of Eucalyptus miRNAs based on high throughput
   sequencing.
   Results: In addition to discovering small RNA sequences, MIR loci were
   mapped onto the reference genome and interspecific variability
   investigated. Sequencing was carried out for the two most world widely
   planted species, E. grandis and E. globulus. To maximize discovery, E.
   grandis samples were from BRASUZ1, the same tree whose genome provided
   the reference sequence. Interspecific analysis reinforces the
   variability in small RNA repertoire even between closely related
   species. Characterization of Eucalyptus small RNA sequences showed 95
   orthologous to conserved miRNAs and 193 novel miRNAs. In silico target
   prediction confirmed 163 novel miRNAs and degradome sequencing
   experimentally confirmed several hundred targets. Experimental evidence
   based on the exclusive expression of a set of small RNAs across 16
   species within Myrtaceae further highlighted variable patterns of
   conservation and diversity of these regulatory elements.
   Conclusions: The description of miRNAs in Eucalyptus contributes to
   scientific knowledge of this vast genre, which is the most widely
   planted hardwood crop in the tropical and subtropical world, adding
   another important element to the annotation of Eucalyptus grandis
   reference genome.}},

Title = {{Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase Promoter Haplotypes and Residential
   Traffic-Related Air Pollution Jointly Influence Exhaled Nitric Oxide
   Level in Children}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{DEC 29}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), a biomarker of airway inflammation,
   predicts asthma risk in children. We previously found that the promoter
   haplotypes in inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) and exposure to
   residential traffic independently influence FeNO level. Because NOS2 is
   inducible by environmental exposures such as traffic-related exposure,
   we tested the hypothesis that common NOS2 promoter haplotypes modulate
   the relationship between residential traffic-related exposure and FeNO
   level in children.
   Methods
   In a cross-sectional population-based study, subjects (N = 2,457; 7-11
   year-old) were Hispanic and non-Hispanic white children who participated
   in the Southern California Children's Health Study and had FeNO
   measurements. For residential traffic, lengths of local roads within
   circular buffers (50m, 100m and 200m radii around homes) around the
   subjects' homes were estimated using geographic information system (GIS)
   methods. We interrogated the two most common NOS2 promoter haplotypes
   that were found to affect FeNO level.
   Results
   The relationship between local road lengths within 100m and 200m
   circular buffers and FeNO level varied significantly by one of the NOS2
   promoter haplotypes (P-values for interaction between road length and
   NOS2 promoter haplotype = 0.02 and 0.03, respectively). In children who
   had <= 250m of local road lengths within 100m buffer around their homes,
   those with two copies of the haplotype had significantly lower FeNO
   (adjusted geometric mean = 11.74ppb; 95\% confidence intervals (CI):
   9.99 to 13.80) than those with no copies (adjusted geometric mean =
   15.28ppb; 95\% CI: 14.04 to 16.63) with statistically significant trend
   of lower FeNO level with increasing number of haplotype copy (P-value
   for trend = 0.002). In contrast, among children who had >250m of local
   road lengths within 100m buffer, FeNO level did not significantly differ
   by the haplotype copy-number (P-value for trend = 0.34). Similar
   interactive effects of this haplotype and local road lengths within 200m
   buffer on FeNO were also observed.
   Conclusions
   Higher exposure from residential traffic nullifies the protective effect
   of one common NOS2 promoter haplotype on FeNO level. Regulation of
   traffic-related pollution may protect children's respiratory health.}},

Abstract = {{Influenza-virus antigenicity evolves to escape host immune protection.
   Antibody lineages within individuals evolve in turn to increase affinity
   and hence potency. Strategies for a ``universal{''} influenza vaccine to
   elicit lineages that escape this evolutionary arms race and protect
   against seasonal variation and novel, pandemic viruses will require
   directing B cell ontogeny to focus the humoral response on conserved
   epitopes on the viral hemagglutinin (HA). The unmutated common ancestors
   (UCAs) of six distinct, broadly neutralizing antibody lineages from one
   individual bind the HA of a virus circulating at the time the
   participant was born. HAs of viruses circulating more than 5 years later
   no longer bind the UCAs, but mature antibodies in the lineages bind
   strains from the entire 18-year lifetime of the participant. The
   analysis shows how immunological memory shaped the response to
   subsequent influenza exposures and suggests that early imprinting by a
   suitable influenza antigen may enhance likelihood of later breadth.}},

   Precision Farming}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED ROBOTIC SYSTEMS}},

Month = {{DEC 29}},
Abstract = {{Determining variations in fields is important for precision farming
   applications. Precision farming is used to determine, analyse, and
   manage factors such as temporal and spatial variability to obtain
   maximum profit, sustainability, and environmental protection. However,
   precision farming is excessively dependent on soil and plant test
   processes. Furthermore, test processes are time-consuming, laborious and
   expensive. These processes also cannot be performed quickly by humans.
   For these reasons, autonomous robots should be designed and developed
   for the detection of field variations and variable-rate applications. In
   this study, a remote-controlled and GPS-guided autonomous robot was
   designed and developed, which can be controlled via the 3G internet and
   is suitable for image-processing applications. The joystick is used to
   manually remotely control the robot movements in any direction or speed.
   Real-time video transmission to the remote computer can be accomplished
   with a camera placed on the vehicle. Navigation software was developed
   for steering the robot autonomously. In the results of the field test
   for the navigation software, it was found that the linear target point
   precision ranged from 10 to 12 cm and the distributed target point
   precision ranged from 15 to 17 cm.}},

Title = {{Discordant lymphoma consisting of mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma and
   nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma in the right supraclavicular lymph
   nodes: a case report}},
Journal = {{DIAGNOSTIC PATHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Discordant lymphoma is defined by the simultaneous presence
   of two or more distinct types of lymphomas at different anatomic sites.
   With fewer than 20 studies reporting cases of discordant lymphoma to
   date, the incidence of this condition is believed to be very low.
   Case Presentation: Here, we report a case of discordant lymphoma in a
   34-year-old female patient that involved mediastinal large B-cell
   lymphoma and nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma in the right
   supraclavicular lymph nodes. The patient presented with a mass in the
   mediastinum and enlargement of the right supraclavicular lymph nodes,
   but no obvious signs of lymphoma. Histological examination revealed that
   the encapsulated mediastinal mass contained medium-or large-size tumor
   cells with lightly stained cytoplasm and round vesicular nuclei as well
   as a high percentage of mitotic cells; strongly positive
   immunohistochemical staining for PAX5, CD20, and CD79a also was
   observed. Examination of biopsied right supraclavicular lymph node
   tissues revealed separation by collagen fibers, extensive inflammatory
   cell infiltration, and large-size tumor cells, such as Reed-Sternberg
   cells. These tissues stained strongly positive for PAX5 and CD30, weakly
   positive for CD15, and negative for Epstein-Barr viral RNA. We also
   found monoclonal gene rearrangement in the immunoglobulin heavy chain
   gene in the mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, but no monoclonal gene
   rearrangement in the nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma. These findings
   suggested that these two lymphomas were not of a common clonal origin.
   The patient was treated by surgical excision of the mediastinal mass
   followed by radio-chemotherapy, and no metastasis or recurrence occurred
   during a follow-up period of 32 months.
   Conclusion: A review of previously reported cases indicated that the
   clinical manifestations and pathological features of discordant lymphoma
   are diverse due to variation in the types of lymphomas involved.
   Physicians must have an awareness of discordant lymphoma to avoid
   incorrect and missed diagnoses, especially considering that the true
   incidence may not be as low as previously believed.}},

Title = {{Street crossing behavior in younger and older pedestrians: an eye- and
   head-tracking study}},
Journal = {{BMC GERIATRICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Crossing a street can be a very difficult task for older
   pedestrians. With increased age and potential cognitive decline, older
   people take the decision to cross a street primarily based on vehicles'
   distance, and not on their speed. Furthermore, older pedestrians tend to
   overestimate their own walking speed, and could not adapt it according
   to the traffic conditions. Pedestrians' behavior is often tested using
   virtual reality. Virtual reality presents the advantage of being safe,
   cost-effective, and allows using standardized test conditions.
   Methods: This paper describes an observational study with older and
   younger adults. Street crossing behavior was investigated in 18 healthy,
   younger and 18 older subjects by using a virtual reality setting. The
   aim of the study was to measure behavioral data (such as eye and head
   movements) and to assess how the two age groups differ in terms of
   number of safe street crossings, virtual crashes, and missed street
   crossing opportunities. Street crossing behavior, eye and head
   movements, in older and younger subjects, were compared with
   non-parametric tests.
   Results: The results showed that younger pedestrians behaved in a more
   secure manner while crossing a street, as compared to older people. The
   eye and head movements analysis revealed that older people looked more
   at the ground and less at the other side of the street to cross.
   Conclusions: The less secure behavior in street crossing found in older
   pedestrians could be explained by their reduced cognitive and visual
   abilities, which, in turn, resulted in difficulties in the
   decision-making process, especially under time pressure. Decisions to
   cross a street are based on the distance of the oncoming cars, rather
   than their speed, for both groups. Older pedestrians look more at their
   feet, probably because of their need of more time to plan precise
   stepping movement and, in turn, pay less attention to the traffic. This
   might help to set up guidelines for improving senior pedestrians'
   safety, in terms of speed limits, road design, and mixed
   physical-cognitive trainings.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{The entanglement entropy of a generic d-dimensional conformal field
   theory receives a regulator independent contribution when the entangling
   surface contains a (hyper)conical singularity of opening angle Omega,
   codified in a function a((d))(Omega). In arXiv : 1505 . 04804, we
   proposed that for three-dimensional conformal field theories, the
   coefficient sigma((3)) characterizing the limit where the surface
   becomes smooth is proportional to the central charge C-T appearing in
   the two-point function of the stress tensor. In this paper, we prove
   this relation for general three-dimensional holographic theories, and
   extend the result to general dimensions. In particular, we de fine a
   generalized coefficient sigma((d)) to characterize the almost smooth
   limit of a (hyper) conical singularity in entangling surfaces in higher
   dimensions. We show then that this coefficient is universally related to
   C-T for general holographic theories and provide a general formula for
   the ratio sigma((d))/C-T in arbitrary dimensions. We conjecture that the
   latter ratio is universal for general CFTs. Further, based on our recent
   results in arXiv : 1507 . 06997, we propose an extension of this
   relation to general Renyi entropies, which we show passes several
   consistency checks in d - 4 and 6.}},

Title = {{Analysis of the exciton-LO-phonon coupling in single wurtzite GaN

Abstract = {{In this study, we analyze the interaction between excitons and
   longitudinal-optical phonons (LO phonons) in single, wurtzite GaN
   quantum dots (QDs) by means of micro-photoluminescence (mu PL)
   spectroscopy. We report on Stokes-shifted emission lines measured for
   hundreds of single QDs. A decrease of the Huang-Rhys factor (similar to
   0.5-0.01) is observed with increasing QD emission energy that can be
   modeled in an adiabatic approximation applying two-particle eight-band
   k.p wave functions. In order to obtain the QD dimensions and shape
   needed for these calculations, we conduct a scanning transmission
   electron microscope (STEM) analysis, not only focusing on the QD
   dimensions, but also on alloying effects. The QD height is identified as
   the most detrimental parameter for the exciton-LO-phonon interaction in
   strongly polar QD systems based on nitrides. Additionally, we extract
   the LO-phonon energy for a significant number of individual QDs from our
   mu PL data set scaling in-between the bulk values for the QD (GaN) and
   the matrix material (AlN). Such a large variation of the LO-phonon
   energy cannot be explained by the alloying effects attested by our STEM
   analysis. Hence, the exciton-LO-phonon interaction resides in a volume
   that encloses the QD in the growth direction and a fraction of the
   matrix material depending on the QD height. We approximate this
   exciton-LO-phonon interaction volume by a sphere with a constant
   diameter of 2.6 +/- 0.2 nm.}},

Title = {{TM4SF1 Promotes Gemcitabine Resistance of Pancreatic Cancer In Vitro and
   In Vivo}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{Background
   TM4SF1 is overexpressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and
   affects the development of this cancer. Also, multidrug resistance (MDR)
   is generally associated with tumor chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer.
   However, the correlation between TM4SF1 and MDR remains unknown. This
   research aims to investigate the effect of TM4SF1 on gemcitabine
   resistance in PDAC and explore the possible molecular mechanism between
   TM4SF1 and MDR.
   Methods
   The expression of TM4SF1 was evaluated in pancreatic cancer cell lines
   and human pancreatic duct epithelial (HPDE) cell lines by quantitative
   RT-PCR. TM4SF1 siRNA transfection was carried out using Hiperfect
   transfection reagent to knock down TM4SF1. The transcripts were analyzed
   by quantitative RT-PCR, RT-PCR and western blotting for further study.
   The cell proliferation and apoptosis were obtained to investigate the
   sensitivity to gemcitabine of pancreatic cancer cells after silencing
   TM4SF1 in vitro. We demonstrated that cell signaling of TM4SF1 mediated
   chemoresistance in cancer cells by assessing the expression of multidrug
   resistance (MDR) genes using quantitative RT-PCR. In vivo, we used
   orthotopic pancreatic tumor models to investigate the effect of
   proliferation after silencing TM4SF1 by a lentivirus-mediated shRNA in
   MIA PaCa-2 cell lines.
   Results
   The mRNA expression of TM4SF1 was higher in seven pancreatic cancer cell
   lines than in HPDE cell lines. In three gemcitabine-sensitive cell lines
   (L3.6pl, BxPC-3, SU86.86), the expression of TM4SF1 was lower than that
   in four gemcitabine-resistant cell lines (MIA PaCa-2, PANC-1, Hs766T,
   AsPC-1). We evaluated that TM4SF1 was a putative target for gemcitabine
   resistance in pancreatic cancer cells. Using AsPC-1, MIA PaCa-2 and
   PANC-we investigated that TM4SF1 silencing affected cell proliferation
   and increased the percentages of cell apoptosis mediated by treatment
   with gemcitabine compared with cells which were treated with negative
   control. This resistance was associated with the expression of multidrug
   resistance genes including ABCB1 and ABCC1. In vivo, silencing of TM4SF1
   in MIA PaCa-2 cell lines increased the effectiveness of
   gemcitabine-based treatment in orthotopic pancreatic tumor models
   evaluated using noninvasive bioluminescent imaging.
   Conclusion
   These findings suggest that TM4SF1 is a surface membrane antigen that is
   highly expressed in pancreatic cancer cells and increases the
   chemoresistance to gemcitabine. Thus, TM4SF1 may be a promising target
   to overcome the chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a new concept in hybrid hydrogel design. Synthetic
   water-soluble N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA) polymers grafted
   with multiple peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) are crosslinked upon addition
   of the linker DNA. The self-assembly is mediated by the PNA-DNA
   complexation, which results in the formation of hydrophilic polymer
   networks. We show that the hydrogels can be produced through two
   different types of complexations. Type I hydrogel is formed via the
   PNA/DNA double-helix hybridization. Type II hydrogel utilizes a unique
   ``P-form{''} oligonucleotide triple-helix that comprises two PNA
   sequences and one DNA. Microrheology studies confirm the respective
   gelation processes and disclose a higher critical gelation concentration
   for the type I gel when compared to the type II design. Scanning
   electron microscopy reveals the interconnected microporous structure of
   both types of hydrogels. Type I double-helix hydrogel exhibits larger
   pore sizes than type II triple-helix gel. The latter apparently contains
   denser structure and displays greater elasticity as well. The designed
   hybrid hydrogels have potential as novel biomaterials for pharmaceutical
   and biomedical applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We consider ultracold quantum gases of scalar bosons residing in a
   coupling strength-density regime in which they constitute a twofold
   fragmented condensate trapped in a single well. It is shown that the
   corresponding quantum states are, in the appropriate Fock space basis,
   identical to the photon cat states familiar in quantum optics, which
   correspond to superpositions of coherent states of the light field with
   a phase difference of pi. In marked distinction to photon cat states,
   however, the very existence of matter-wave cat states crucially depends
   on the many-body correlations of the constituent bosons. We consequently
   establish that the quadratures of the effective ``photons,{''}
   expressing the highly nonclassical nature of the macroscopic matter-wave
   superposition state, can be experimentally accessed by measuring the
   density-density correlations of the interacting quantum gas.}},

Title = {{Impact evaluation of a healthy lifestyle intervention to reduce
   cardiovascular disease risk in health centers in San Jose, Costa Rica
   and Chiapas, Mexico}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Background: Previous healthy lifestyle interventions based on the Salud
   para Su Corazon curriculum for Latinos in the United States, and a pilot
   study in Guatemala, demonstrated improvements in patient knowledge,
   behavior, and clinical outcomes for adults with hypertension. This
   article describes the implementation of a healthy lifestyle group
   education intervention at the primary care health center level in the
   capital cities of Costa Rica and Chiapas, Mexico for patients with
   hypertension and/or type 2 diabetes and presents impact evaluation
   results.
   Methods: Six group education sessions were offered to participants at
   intervention health centers from November 2011 to December 2012 and
   participants were followed up for 8 months. The study used a
   prospective, longitudinal, nonequivalent pretest-posttest comparison
   group design, and was conducted in parallel in the two countries.
   Cognitive and behavioral outcome measures were knowledge, self-efficacy,
   stage-of-change, dietary behavior and physical activity. Clinical
   outcomes were: body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure,
   and fasting blood glucose. Group by time differences were assessed using
   generalized estimating equation models, and a dose-response analysis was
   conducted for the intervention group.
   Results: The average number of group education sessions attended in
   Chiapas was 4 (SD: 2.2) and in Costa Rica, 1.8 (SD: 2.0). In both
   settings, participation in the study declined by 8-month follow-up. In
   Costa Rica, intervention group participants showed significant
   improvements in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and borderline
   significant improvement for fasting glucose, and significant improvement
   in the stages-of-change measure vs. the comparison group. In Chiapas,
   the intervention group showed significant improvement in the
   stages-of-change measure in relation to the comparison group.
   Significant improvements were not observed for knowledge, self-efficacy,
   dietary behavior or physical activity. In Chiapas only, a significant
   dose-response relationship was observed for systolic and diastolic blood
   pressure.
   Conclusion: Group education interventions at health centers have the
   potential to improve stage-of-change activation, and may also improve
   clinical outcomes. In the future, it will be essential to dedicate
   resources to understand ways to reach a representative group of the
   patient population, tailor the intervention so that patients are engaged
   to participate, and consider the broader family and community context
   that influences patients' capacity to manage their condition.}},

Title = {{Morphology of First Zoeal Stage of Four Genera of Alvinocaridid Shrimps

   Biology and Phylogeny}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Alvinocaridid shrimps are endemic species inhabiting hydrothermal vents
   and/or cold seeps. Although indirect evidences (genetic and lipid
   markers) suggest that their larval stages disperse widely and support
   large scale connectivity, larval life and mechanisms underlying
   dispersal are unknown in alvinocaridids. Here we provide for the first
   time detailed descriptions of the first larval stage (zoea I) of four
   alvinocaridid species: Rimicaris exoculata and Mirocaris fortunata from
   the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, Alvinocaris muricola from the Congo Basin and
   Nautilocaris saintlaurentae from the Western Pacific. The larvae were
   obtained from onboard hatching of brooding females (either at
   atmospheric pressure or at habitat pressure in hyperbaric chambers) and
   from the water column near adult habitats, sampled with plankton pumps
   or sediment traps. Major characteristics of the alvinocaridid larvae
   include undeveloped mandible and almost complete absence of setation in
   the inner margin of the mouth parts and maxillipeds. Although the larvae
   are very similar between the four species studied, some morphological
   features could be used for species identification. In addition,
   undeveloped mouthparts and the large amount of lipid reserves strongly
   support the occurrence of primary lecithotrophy in the early stage of
   alvinocaridids. Although lecithotrophy in decapod crustaceans is usually
   associated with abbreviated larval development, as a mechanism of larval
   retention, morphological and physiological evidences suggest the
   occurrence of an extended and lecithotrophic larval stage in the
   Alvinocarididae. These traits permit the colonization of widely
   dispersed and fragmented environments of hydrothermal vents and cold
   seeps. Distribution of larval traits along the phylogenetic
   reconstruction of the Alvinocarididae and related families suggest that
   lecithotrophy/planktotrophy and extended/abbreviated development have
   evolved independently along related families in all potential
   combinations. However, the Alvinocarididae is the only taxa with a
   combination of lecithotrophy and extended larval development.}},

Abstract = {{The move to a low-carbon economy has generated renewed interest in
   microalgae for the production of biofuels with the potential mutual
   benefit of wastewater treatment. However, harvesting has been identified
   as a limiting factor to the economic viability of this process. This
   paper explores the harvesting of microalgae using high-pressure gas
   without the addition of coagulants. Coagulation of microalgae under
   high-pressure gas was found to be an efficient method to separate algae
   from suspension. The critical coagulation pressures (CCPs) for H-2 and
   CO2 were determined to be 6.1 and 6.2 MPa, respectively. The CO2-induced
   decrease in solution pH positively influenced coagulation rates, without
   appearing to affect the CCP. This approach could be beneficial for the
   economic removal of microalgae from solution for the production of both
   biofuels and biomedical compounds without the addition of
   non-environmentally friendly chemicals.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},

Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{We study the performance of the euro-Swiss franc exchange rate in the
   extraordinary period from September 6, 2011 to January 15, 2015 when the
   Swiss National Bank enforced a minimum exchange rate of 1.20 Swiss
   francs per euro. Within the general framework built on geometric
   Brownian motions and based on the analogy between Brownian motion in
   finance and physics, the first-order effect of such a steric constraint
   would enter a priori in the form of a repulsive entropic force
   associated with the paths crossing the barrier that are forbidden.
   Nonparametric empirical estimates of drift and volatility show that the
   predicted first-order analogy between economics and physics is
   incorrect. The clue is to realize that the random-walk nature of
   financial prices results from the continuous anticipation of traders
   about future opportunities, whose aggregate actions translate into an
   approximate efficient market with almost no arbitrage opportunities.
   With the Swiss National Bank's stated commitment to enforce the barrier,
   traders' anticipation of this action leads to a vanishing drift together
   with a volatility of the exchange rate that depends on the distance to
   the barrier. This effect is described by Krugman's model {[}P. R.
   Krugman, Target zones and exchange rate dynamics, Q. J. Econ. 106, 669
   (1991)]. We present direct quantitative empirical evidence that
   Krugman's theoretical model provides an accurate description of the
   euro-Swiss franc target zone. Motivated by the insights from the
   economic model, we revise the initial economics-physics analogy and show
   that, within the context of hindered diffusion, the two systems can be
   described with the same mathematics after all. Using a recently proposed
   extended analogy in terms of a colloidal Brownian particle embedded in a
   fluid of molecules associated with the underlying order book, we derive
   that, close to the restricting boundary, the dynamics of both systems is
   described by a stochastic differential equation with a very small
   constant drift and a linear diffusion coefficient. As a side result, we
   present a simplified derivation of the linear hydrodynamic diffusion
   coefficient of a Brownian particle close to a wall.}},

Abstract = {{We present an experimental demonstration of edge detection based on
   ghost imaging (GI) in the gradient domain. Through modification of a
   random light field, gradient GI (GGI) can directly give the edge of an
   object without needing the original image. As edges of real objects are
   usually sparser than the original objects, the signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR) of the edge detection result will be dramatically enhanced,
   especially for large-area, high-transmittance objects. In this study, we
   experimentally perform one- and two-dimensional edge detection with a
   double-slit based on GI and GGI. The use of GGI improves the SNR
   significantly in both cases. Gray-scale objects are also studied by the
   use of simulation. The special advantages of GI will make the edge
   detection based on GGI be valuable in real applications. (C) 2015

   Orientational order dependence and elastic instability}},

Abstract = {{Previous reports of rapid phase transformation above 18 GPa {[}Erskine
   and Nellis, Nature 349, 317 (1991)] and large elastic waves below 18 GPa
   {[}Lucas et al., J. Appl. Phys. 114, 093515 (2013)] for shock-compressed
   ZYB-grade highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), but not for less
   oriented ZYH-grade HOPG, indicated a link between the orientational
   order dependence of the HOPG response above and below the phase
   transformation stress. To gain insight into this link and into the
   mechanical response of HOPG shocked to peak stresses approaching the
   phase transformation onset, the compressibility of ZYB- and ZYH-grade
   HOPG in the shocked state was examined using front surface impact
   experiments. Particle velocity histories and sound velocities were
   measured for peak stresses reaching 18 GPa. Although the locus of the
   measured peak stress-particle velocity states is indistinguishable for
   the two grades of HOPG, the measured sound velocities in the peak state
   reveal significant differences between the two grades. Specifically (1)
   the measured sound velocities are somewhat higher for ZYH-grade HOPG
   compared with ZYB-grade HOPG; (2) the measured sound velocities for
   ZYH-grade HOPG increase smoothly with compression, whereas those for
   ZYB-grade HOPG exhibit a significant reduction in the compression
   dependence from 12 GPa to 17GPa and an abrupt increase from 17GPa to 18
   GPa; and (3) the longitudinal moduli, determined from the measured sound
   velocities, are smaller than the calculated bulk moduli for ZYB-grade
   HOPG shocked to peak stresses above 15 GPa, indicating the onset of an
   elastic instability. The present findings demonstrate that the softening
   of the longitudinal modulus (or elastic instability) presented here is
   linked to the large elastic waves and the rapid phase transformation
   reported previously-all observed only for shocked ZYB-grade HOPG. The
   elastic instability in shocked ZYB-grade HOPG is likely a precursor to
   the rapid phase transformation observed above 18 GPa for this HOPG
   grade. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{An average-power-scalable, two-stage optical parametric chirped pulse

   signal pulses were recompressible to within a few percent of their
   similar to 50-fs Fourier limit in anti-reflection coated fused silica at
   negligible losses. The overall energy conversion efficiency from the
   1030-nm pump to the recompressed signal reached 19\%, significantly
   reducing the cost per watt of pump power compared to similar systems.
   The two-stage source will serve as the front-end of a three-stage system

Abstract = {{In multi-server environments, user authentication is a very important
   issue because it provides the authorization that enables users to access
   their data and services; furthermore, remote user authentication schemes
   for multi-server environments have solved the problem that has arisen
   from user's management of different identities and passwords. For this
   reason, numerous user authentication schemes that are designed for
   multi-server environments have been proposed over recent years. In 2015,
   Lu et al. improved upon Mishra et al.'s scheme, claiming that their
   remote user authentication scheme is more secure and practical; however,
   we found that Lu et al.' s scheme is still insecure and incorrect. In
   this paper, we demonstrate that Lu et al.'s scheme is vulnerable to
   outsider attack and user impersonation attack, and we propose a new
   biometrics-based scheme for authentication and key agreement that can be
   used in multi-server environments; then, we show that our proposed
   scheme is more secure and supports the required security properties.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term outcome data in pancreatic adenocarcinoma are predominantly

   incidence and natural history of = 5-year survivors with non-resected
   pancreatic adenocarcinoma. All patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma
   who received oncologic therapy alone without surgery at our institution
   between 1995 and 2009 were identified. Non-resected >= 5-year survivors
   represented 2\% (11/544) of all non-resected patients undergoing
   treatment for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and 11\% (11/98) of >= 5-year
   survivors. Nine patients had localized tumor and 2 metastatic disease at
   initial diagnosis. Disease progression occurred in 6 patients, and the
   local tumor bed was the most common site of progression. Six patients
   suffered from significant morbidities including recurrent cholangitis,
   second malignancy, malnutrition and bowel perforation. A rare subset of
   patients with pancreatic cancer achieve longterm survival without
   resection. Despite prolonged survival, morbidities unrelated to the
   primary cancer were frequently encountered and a close follow-up is
   warranted in these patients. Factors such as tumor biology and host
   immunity may play a key role in disease progression and survival.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{Motivated by experiments on sheared suspensions that show a transition
   between ordered and disordered phases, we here study the long-time
   behavior of a sheared and overdamped two-dimensional system of particles
   interacting by repulsive forces. As a function of interaction strength
   and shear rate we find transitions between phases with vanishing and
   large single-particle diffusion. In the phases with vanishing
   single-particle diffusion, the system evolves towards regular lattices,
   usually on very slow time scales. Different lattices can be approached,
   depending on interaction strength and forcing amplitude. The disordered
   state appears in parameter regions where the regular lattices are
   unstable. Correlation functions between the particles reveal the
   formation of shear bands. In contrast to single-particle densities, the
   spatially resolved two-particle correlation functions vary with time and
   allow to determine the phase within a period. As in the case of the
   suspensions, motion in the state with low diffusivity is essentially
   reversible, whereas in the state with strong diffusion it is not.}},

   brain from measured time series. Recent work has focused on causal
   definitions of information transfer aimed at decompositions of
   predictive information about a target variable, while excluding effects
   of common drivers and indirect influences. While common drivers clearly
   constitute a spurious causality, the aim of the present article is to
   develop measures quantifying different notions of the strength of
   information transfer along indirect causal paths, based on first
   reconstructing the multivariate causal network. Another class of novel
   measures quantifies to what extent different intermediate processes on
   causal paths contribute to an interaction mechanism to determine
   pathways of causal information transfer. The proposed framework
   complements predictive decomposition schemes by focusing more on the
   interaction mechanism between multiple processes. A rigorous
   mathematical framework allows for a clear information-theoretic
   interpretation that can also be related to the underlying dynamics as
   proven for certain classes of processes. Generally, however, estimates
   of information transfer remain hard to interpret for nonlinearly
   intertwined complex systems. But if experiments or mathematical models
   are not available, then measuring pathways of information transfer
   within the causal dependency structure allows at least for an
   abstraction of the dynamics. The measures are illustrated on a
   climatological example to disentangle pathways of atmospheric flow over
   Europe.}},

   able to increase the speed of Monte Carlo simulations by a factor of up
   to 6700 compared to simulations without tables, with only minimal
   further loss in accuracy. To obtain further enhancement of sampling, we
   combine tabulation with the weighted ensemble (WE) method, in which
   multiple parallel simulations are occasionally replicated or pruned in

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{143}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are involved in many cellular
   processes. Experimentally obtained protein quaternary structures provide
   the location of protein-protein interfaces, the surface region of a
   given protein that interacts with another. These regions are termed
   half-interfaces (HIs). Canonical HIs cover roughly one third of a
   protein's surface and were found to have more hydrophobic residues than
   the non-interface surface region. In addition, the classical view of
   protein HIs was that there are a few (if not one) HIs per protein that
   are structurally and chemically unique. However, on average, a given
   protein interacts with at least a dozen others. This raises the question
   of whether they use the same or other HIs. By copying HIs from monomers
   with the same folds in solved quaternary structures, we introduce the
   concept of geometric HIs (HIs whose geometry has a significant match to
   other known interfaces) and show that on average they cover three
   quarters of a protein's surface. We then demonstrate that in some cases,
   these geometric HI could result in real physical interactions (which may
   or may not be biologically relevant). The composition of the new HIs is
   on average more charged compared to most known ones, suggesting that the
   current protein interface database is biased towards more hydrophobic,
   possibly more obligate, complexes. Finally, our results provide evidence
   for interface fuzziness and PPI promiscuity. Thus, the classical view of
   unique, well defined HIs needs to be revisited as HIs are another
   example of coarse-graining that is used by nature. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{A subgrid orographic parameterization (SOP) is updated by including the
   effects of orographic anisotropy and flow-blocking drag (FBD). The
   impact of the updated SOP on short-range forecasts is investigated using
   a global atmospheric forecast model applied to a heavy snowfall event
   over Korea on 4 January 2010. When the SOP is updated, the orographic
   drag in the lower troposphere noticeably increases owing to the
   additional FBD over mountainous regions. The enhanced drag directly
   weakens the excessive wind speed in the low troposphere and indirectly
   improves the temperature and mass fields over East Asia. In addition,
   the snowfall overestimation over Korea is improved by the reduced heat
   fluxes from the surface. The forecast improvements are robust regardless
   of the horizontal resolution of the model between T126 and T510. The
   parameterization is statistically evaluated based on the skill of the
   medium-range forecasts for February 2014. For the medium-range
   forecasts, the skill improvements of the wind speed and temperature in
   the low troposphere are observed globally and for East Asia while both
   positive and negative effects appear indirectly in the middle-upper
   troposphere. The statistical skill for the precipitation is mostly
   improved due to the improvements in the synoptic fields. The
   improvements are also found for seasonal simulation throughout the
   troposphere and stratosphere during boreal winter.}},

   ranged from 0.16 to 0.27, depending on the variables used), the validity
   in lower educated respondents was poor (-0.07 to 0.05). Conclusions: The

Abstract = {{Agricultural activities can lead to nitrogen losses in the environment,
   particularly nitrate (NO3-) leaching and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions.
   This study aims to measure N losses from organic farming (OF) and
   conventional farming (CF) arable cropping systems, both adopted in a
   single farm, located on the same drained loamy soil in the Seine basin,
   in the North of France. Leaching was measured with ceramic cups and N2O
   emissions with automatic and manual chambers over the 2011-2014 period.
   Manual chambers showed the same trend as automatic chambers but
   underestimated small variations and overestimated peak emissions. On
   average, N2O emissions were lower in OF (0.65 +/- 0.64 kg N ha(-1) yr-1)
   than in CF fields (0.95 +/- 0.77 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). The mean amount of
   N leached was 13.3 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) in the OF system during the
   8-crops rotation (alfalfa 1, alfalfa 2, wheat, green bean, wheat, faba
   bean, wheat, flax) and 18.4 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) in the CF system for a
   3-crops CF rotation (legume, wheat, wheat), corresponding to 9 and 10\%
   of total N inputs, respectively. Leached N and N2O emissions expressed
   per unit of protein-N harvested were slightly higher in CF (0.11 kg
   NO3-N kr, N yr(-1) and 5.4 N2O-N kg(-1) N yr(-1), respectively) than in
   OF systems (0.10 kg NO3-N kg(-1) N yr(-1) and 4.7 g N2O-N kg(-1) N
   yr(-1), respectively). These results show a relative lower environmental
   impact of OF practices compared to CF practices (-30\% area-scaled and
   -12\% yield-scaled for leaching and N2O emissions), with further margins
   of progress in both systems, including a better management of
   fertilisers, legumes and catchcrops. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Through silicon via (TSV) technology holds the promise of chip-to-chip

   investigate the use of etch hard mask for finer TSVs etching to have
   clear definition of etched via pattern. Conventionally employed
   photoresist methods were initially evaluated as reference processes, and
   oxide and metal hard mask were investigated. We admit that pure metal
   mask is rarely employed in industry, but the etch result of metal mask
   support why hard mask are more realistic for finer TSV etching than

Abstract = {{Chemicals that induce asthma at the workplace are substances of concern.
   At present, there are no widely accepted methods to identify respiratory
   sensitizers, and classification of these substances is based on human
   occupational data. Several studies have contributed to understanding the
   mechanisms involved in respiratory sensitization, although uncertainties
   remain. One point of interest for respiratory sensitization is the
   reaction of the epithelial lung barrier to respiratory sensitizers. To
   elucidate potential molecular effects of exposure of the epithelial lung
   barrier, a gene expression profile was created based on a DNA microarray
   experiment using the bronchial epithelial cell line 16HBE14o(-). The
   cells were exposed to 12 respiratory sensitizers and 10 non-sensitizers.
   For statistical analysis, we used a class prediction approach that
   combined three machine learning algorithms, leave-one-compound-out cross
   validation, and majority voting per tested compound. This approach
   allowed for a prediction accuracy of 95\%. Identified predictive genes
   were mainly associated with the cytoskeleton and barrier function of the
   epithelial cell. Several of these genes were reported to be associated
   with asthma as well. Taken together, this indicates that pulmonary
   barrier function is an important target for respiratory sensitizers and
   associated genes can be used to predict the respiratory sensitization
   potential of chemicals. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the nanoindentation technique was adopted to evaluate the
   mechanical properties of the matrix formed on glass coverslips by
   immortalized cell line Y201 from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) at
   different cell culture conditions. However, the extracellular matrix
   formed on the implant or other surfaces are often highly inhomogeneous.
   This would make data interpretation of nanoindentation complicated.
   Therefore, Gaussian mixture model was adopted to extract the mechanical
   properties of different components in the matrix synthesised by Y201
   cells. It reveals that this matrix is also anisotropic. The elastic
   modulus of the matrix is 11-19 GPa at transverse direction which is
   almost independent of culture period. The longitudinal modulus is 21-36
   GPa which depends on the culture period. Surface chemistry analysis has
   shown higher Ca/P ratio in this mineralized matrix compared to native

Abstract = {{Many central pattern generators (CPGs) are built on a basic circuit of
   reciprocally inhibitory neurons, the minimal configuration that can
   produce distinct rhythmic patterns for controlling antagonistic muscles.
   In this paper, we use a closed-loop to control the rhythm of a CPG model
   based on this minimal network architecture. The closed-loop adapts the
   maximum conductance of the inhibition to achieve a regularized rhythm
   departing from an otherwise highly irregular spiking-bursting activity.
   Our results show that the closed-loop conductance control can rapidly
   find the best connectivity that leads to the regularization goal. We
   also discuss several external stimuli that lead to regularized CPG
   rhythms. We argue that the proposed closed-loop approach can be used to
   control CPG rhythms in a wide variety of applications in experimental
   and theoretical research. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The market of recombinant proteins as human pharmaceuticals has
   surpassed annual revenues of more than 150 billion dollars. The marketed
   proteins are often complex in terms of post-translational modifications
   and conventional hosts have shown weaknesses in terms of quality of
   these recombinant proteins. Especially the non-human glycopatterns
   leading to immunogenicity or shortened in vivo half-life have gained
   attention over the past decade.
   Therefore, production cell lines with better or novel characteristics
   are required and human cell lines seem to be the most genuine and
   logical choice. Thus, several human cell lines have been used to
   generate biopharmaceuticals. We here present an overview of such
   examples and highlight their promise for biopharmaceutical production
   processes of the future.}},

Abstract = {{The microstructure, surface morphologies and corrosion behavior of 316L
   stainless steel processed by sandblasting (SB) and sandblasting + acid
   pickling + passivation (SBPP) were studied in this work. Microstructure
   of the surface layer was investigated by optical microscope, scanning
   electron microscope and X-ray diffraction etc. The corrosion behavior
   was studied by potentiodynamic polarization tests and the surface
   morphologies were observed by scanning electron microscope. Results
   indicated that SB and SBPP samples had almost the same microhardness and
   dislocation density which were higher than the as-received (AR) sample.
   Besides, strain-induced alpha'-martensite phase was observed in SB and
   SBPP samples. After sandblasting, the corrosion resistance decreased
   dramatically due to the surface morphologies, formation of
   alpha'-martensite phase and increase of dislocation density, while it
   was improved to some extent by the subsequent add pickling and
   passivation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Corals have long been used as proxies for changes in the seawater
   environment. However, the existence of trace element and isotopic
   inconsistencies between different coral species and within different
   architectural elements of the same species grown simultaneously suggests
   that factors besides seawater temperature and its chemical composition
   contribute to coral geochemical records. Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry
   (SIMS) analysis was conducted on the reef building coral Orbicella
   annularis from the Veracruz Reef System, in the Southern Gulf of Mexico
   in order to investigate variability in oxygen isotopes (delta O-18) and
   elemental calcium ratios between the different architectural structures
   of this coral. The microstructures of Orbicella include thecae walls,
   septa, costae, exothecal dissepiments (ExDs), and endothecal
   dissepiments (EnDs). SIMS data showed that EnDs are isotopically heavier
   by 0.7\% than other simultaneously grown structures. The elemental
   heterogeneity between architectural structures was observed by
   LA-ICP-MS: EnDs were found to become depleted in Mg/Ca, B/Ca and
   enriched in Ba/Ca, U/Ca relative to thecae. Elemental and isotopic spot
   profiles (with a 6.5 mm long sampling path) in the coral growth
   direction yielded weekly time resolution and demonstrated that factors
   other than temperature - including aragonite growth rate and
   modification of calcifying fluid chemistry - also affect elemental and
   isotopic ratios in corallite aragonite. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{1223-1233}},

Abstract = {{The Mg/HA/Mg nanocomposites were fabricated with pure magnesium and the
   addition of different amounts of hydroxyapatite and periclase
   nanopowders using a blend-cold press-sinter powder metallurgy technique
   to improve the bio-corrosion and mechanical properties of the resulting
   material. Potentiodynamic polarization, immersion and mechanical tests
   were used to investigate bio-corrosion and mechanical properties of the
   nanocomposites produced. The compositions of the corrosion products and
   surface morphologies of the corroded specimens were characterized by
   X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission
   electron microscopy, and field-emission scanning electron microscopy.
   The corrosion resistance of the nanocomposites is shown to increase from
   0.25 k Omega cm(2) to 1.23 k Omega cm(2) with the addition of 10 wt.\%
   MgO; additionally, decreasing the amount of HA from 27.5 to 12.5 wt.\%
   is shown to yield an increase in the compressive failure strain from 4.2
   to 11.5\%. The corrosion products of the composite surface are shown to
   be primarily Mg(OH)(2), HA and Ca-3(PO4)(2). During immersion in SBF
   solution, the growth of the Mg(OH)(2) nanorods on the nanocomposites
   increased the contact angle between the SBF solution and the substrate;
   as a result, the corrosion rate and hydrogen evolution rate decreased.
   The cell culture results indicate that Mg/HA/Mg nanocomposite is
   biocompatible with osteoblasts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   memory capacitors, i.e., all ITO structures, produced by sputtering
   method, which shows a high optical transmittance of approximately 80\%

   in a RS test to evaluate a reliability for the proposed memory devices,
   we observed a stable endurance of > 100 cycles and a retention time of >
   10(4) s at 85 degrees C, with a current ratio of similar to 10(2) to
   similar to 10(3). This result indicates that this transparent memory by

Abstract = {{Lipid homeostasis in mammalian cells is regulated by sterol regulatory
   element-binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors that are activated
   through sequential cleavage by Golgi Site-1 and Site-2 proteases.
   Fission yeast SREBP, Sre1, engages a different mechanism involving the
   Golgi Dsc E3 ligase complex, but it is not clearly understood exactly
   how Sre1 is proteolytically cleaved and activated. In this study, we
   screened the Schizosaccharomyces pombe non-essential haploid deletion
   collection to identify missing components of the Sre1 cleavage
   machinery. Our screen identified an additional component of the SREBP
   pathway required for Sre1 proteolysis named rhomboid protein 2 (Rbd2).
   We show that an rbd2 deletion mutant fails to grow under hypoxic and
   hypoxia-mimetic conditions due to lack of Sre1 activity and that this
   growth phenotype is rescued by Sre1N, a cleaved active form of Sre1. We
   found that the growth inhibition phenotype under low oxygen conditions
   is specific to the strain with deletion of rbd2, not any other fission
   yeast rhomboid-encoding genes. Our study also identified conserved
   residues of Rbd2 that are required for Sre1 proteolytic cleavage. All
   together, our results suggest that Rbd2 is a functional SREBP protease
   with conserved residues required for Sre1 cleavage and provide an
   important piece of the puzzle to understand the mechanisms for Sre1
   activation and the regulation of various biological and pathological
   processes involving SREBPs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Tetraspanin 8 (TSPAN8) is a tumor-associated antigen implicated in tumor
   progression and metastasis. However, the validation of TSPAN8 as a
   potential therapeutic target in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has
   not yet been studied. In this study, through several in vitro
   methodologies, we identified a large extracellular loop of TSPAN8
   (TSPAN8-LEL) as a key domain for regulating mCRC invasion. Using phage
   display technology, we developed a novel anti-TSPAN8-LEL human antibody
   with subnanomolar affinity that specifically recognizes amino acids
   140-205 of TSPAN8-LEL in a conformation-dependent manner. Finally, we
   demonstrated that the antibody specifically reduces invasion in the
   HCT116 and LoVo mCRC cell lines more potently than in the HCT-8 and
   SW480 non-mCRC cell lines. Our data suggest that TSPAN8-LEL may play an
   important role in mCRC cell invasion, and that the antibody we have
   developed could be a useful tool for inhibiting the invasion of
   TSPAN8-expressing mCRCs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Squirrel cage induction motors have mostly been used for their small
   capacity because the starting torque is smaller than the starting
   current during start-up. However, as more and more mid-to-large capacity
   motors are developed, the demands for improvements in performance
   characteristics have also increased. In this study, the starting
   characteristics of squirrel cage induction motors were analyzed based on
   the rotor materials and shapes using a finite element method to provide
   design data suitable for different use purposes and capacities. We
   further completed analysis by combining electromagnetic equations
   deduced from Maxwell's equations and the circuit equations of stators
   and rotors. A moving coordinator was introduced to rotate the rotor
   during the analysis, and the torques calculated via the finite element
   method were combined with the motion equations to calculate the position
   and angular velocity of the rotors at the next time, thereby analyzing
   the transient characteristics. The analysis results of the transient
   characteristics were applied to a 3-phase 4-pole 5-hp induction motor to
   calculate the starting torque, speed, and rotation angle of the rotors.
   In the reference model, the materials and shapes of the rotor slot were
   changed to copper and silicon copper and a deep slot, shallow slot, and
   long-neck-shaped slot.}},

Title = {{Dynamic mechanical behavior of a Zr-based bulk metallic glass composite}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{69-74}},
Month = {{DEC 25}},
Abstract = {{Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was used to study the viscoelastic
   properties of a Zr56.2Ti13.8Nb5.0Cu6.9Ni5.6Be12.5 (LM2) bulk metallic
   glass (BMG) matrix composite. The temperature spectrum and the frequency
   spectrum were tested by three point bending. We revealed that the
   relaxation process of the LM2 composite is different from the single
   amorphous alloys. The unique superimposition of glass transition
   (a-relaxation) and beta-phase transformation during DMA results in
   double peaks on the loss modulus evolution and a plateau on the storage
   modulus evolution. The numerical analysis of the isothermal spectrum
   suggests that the dynamic relaxation behavior of the LM2 composite
   cannot be described by a single classical relaxation model. A coupling
   model is instead proposed to well quantify the coupling effect of the
   a-relaxation and beta-phase transformation in the LM2 BMG composite. Our
   findings provide an insight into understanding the more complex
   structural relaxation of BMG composite than monolithic BMGs. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This work aimed to,evaluate the effects of different dilutions of
   gasoline water-soluble fraction (GSF) on Danio rerio,hepatocyte cell
   line (ZFL). Two tests were used to assess cell viability, MTT reduction
   assay (MTT) and the Trypan blue (TB) exclusion test. Oxidative stress
   was evaluated through the quantification of reactive oxygen species
   (ROS) and the assessment of the total antioxidant capacity against
   peroxyl radicals (ACAP) and the comet assay was employed to assess DNA
   damage. ZFL cells were exposed to 5, 10,25 and 50\% GSF or only to
   saline for 1,3 and 6 h. The GSF exhibited concentration-dependent
   cytotoxicity, and longer exposure times resulted in lower cell viability
   as indicated by both MTT and TB assays. The establishment of oxidative
   stress in cells exposed to GSF was not observed at any exposure period
   and the lower ROS levels could be related to the increased antioxidant
   capacity after 6-hour exposure. DNA damage was significantly increased
   after exposure to GSF at the three experimental times. Taking together
   these results show that GSF has a genotoxic potential at the lower
   concentrations and becomes cytotoxic at higher concentrations and that
   ZFL can be considered a good biological model for in vitro toxicological
   studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Periostin has an essential role in mechanotransduction in bone.
   Naringin, a natural flavonoid, has been evidenced for its
   osteoprotective role in osteoporosis, while its mechanism is far from
   clear. Here we show that down-regulation of periostin, and up-regulation
   of its downstream sclerostin and inactivation of Wnt/beta-catenin
   signaling were implicated in neurectomy-induced bone loss. Naringin
   could upregulate periostin and prevent neurectomy-induced deterioration
   of BMD, trabecular microstructure and bone mechanical characteristics.
   In conclusion, naringin could prevent progress of disuse osteoporosis in
   rats, which may be mediated by increased periostin expression and
   subsequently inhibition of sclerostin and activation of Wnt/beta-catenin
   signaling pathways. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{U71Mn rail steel has been widely used in high speed railway
   construction, and it is commonly jointed by flash welding process. It is
   inevitable to produce very high residual stress in the welded joint. In
   this study, residual stresses in a rail steel flash-butt joint were
   measured by hole-drilling method. Meanwhile, an in-house finite element
   programme JWRIAN was developed to simulate welding residual stresses in
   the flash-butt joint. To effectively and accurately predict welding
   residual stress, a fast computing algorithm named iterative substructure
   method and an advanced material model with consideration of the
   influence of solid-state phase transformation were included in the
   computational approach. By comparing the calculated results with the
   experimental data, the validity of the developed computational approach
   was verified. Both experimental and numerical results suggest that the
   solid-state phase transformation plays a very important role in the
   course of formation of welding residual stress. In addition, simulation
   results indicate that the welding residual stress distribution in the
   flash-butt joint is very complex, and the peak values of tensile
   residual stress are relatively high. The residual stress distributions
   of the rail steel joint obtained by numerical simulation will be helpful
   in assessing the structural integrity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{LepB is a key membrane component of the cellular secretion machinery,
   which releases secreted proteins into the periplasm by cleaving the
   inner membrane-bound leader. We showed that LepB is also an essential
   component of the machinery hijacked by the tRNase colicin D for its
   import. Here we demonstrate that this non-catalytic activity of LepB is
   to promote the association of the central domain of colicin D with the
   inner membrane before the FtsH-dependent proteolytic processing and
   translocation of the toxic tRNase domain into the cytoplasm. The novel
   structural role of LepB results in a stable interaction with colicin D,
   with a stoichiometry of 1: 1 and a nanomolar K-d determined in vitro.
   LepB provides a chaperone-like function for the penetration of several
   nuclease-type bacteriocins into target cells. The colicin-LepB
   interaction is shown to require only a short peptide sequence within the
   central domain of these bacteriocins and to involve residues present in
   the short C-terminal Box E of LepB. Genomic screening identified the
   conserved LepB binding motif in colicin-like ORFs from 13 additional
   bacterial species. These findings establish a new paradigm for the
   functional adaptability of an essential inner-membrane enzyme.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy metals provoke toxicological effects on aquatic animal species,
   including fish, though their effects on fish leucocytes and
   immunotoxicology are still limited. In the present work the effects of
   heavy metals (Cd, Hg, Pb or As) on viability, oxidative stress and
   innate immune parameters of isolated head-kidney leucocytes from
   gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) are studied. Cytotoxicity results
   indicated that short exposures (30 min or 2 h) to Hg promoted both
   apoptosis and necrosis cell death of leucocytes whilst Cd, Pb and As did
   only by apoptosis, in all cases in a concentration- and time-dependent
   manner. In addition, production of free oxygen radicals was induced by
   Cd, Hg and As heavy metals. Cd failed to change phagocytosis but Hg and
   As increased the percentage of phagocytic cells but decreased the number
   of ingested particles per cell whilst Pb increased both phagocytic
   parameters. On the other hand, respiratory burst activity was
   significantly reduced by incubation with Cd, Hg and As but increased
   with Pb. Furthermore, the gene expression profiles partly support the
   functional finding of this work. This study provides an in vitro
   approach for elucidating the heavy metals toxicity, and particularly the
   immunotoxicity, in fish leucocytes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Einstein established the theory of general relativity and the
   corresponding field equation in 1915 and its vacuum solutions were
   obtained by Schwarzschild and Kerr for, respectively, static and
   rotating black holes, in 1916 and 1963, respectively. They are, however,
   still playing an indispensable role, even after 100 years of their
   original discovery, to explain high energy astrophysical phenomena.
   Application of the solutions of Einstein's equation to resolve
   astrophysical phenomena has formed an important branch, namely
   relativistic astrophysics. I devote this article to enlightening some of
   the current astrophysical problems based on general relativity. However,
   there seem to be some issues with regard to explaining certain
   astrophysical phenomena based on Einstein's theory alone. I show that
   Einstein's theory and its modified form, both are necessary to explain
   modern astrophysical processes, in particular, those related to compact
   objects.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study about deposition parameters with

   ranged from 400 to 600 degrees C and from 0.5 to 3.0 Torr, respectively.
   The chemical composition and structural properties of the contained
   samples were analyzed by XRD, FT-IR, and Raman spectroscopy. The
   mechanical and tribological properties were evaluated by scratching,
   nanohardness, friction, and wear tests. The results showed that the
   films presented amorphous structures, and those obtained with 500
   degrees C and 3.0 Torr presented high adhesion and tribological
   performance. The films grown by using only HMDSO as precursor at 500
   degrees C showed the highest deposition rate, higher hardness, good

Abstract = {{In the present study, the role of lncRNAs in response to
   radiation-induced DNA damage and oxidative stress were explored to
   improve our understanding of the biological pathways activated upon
   radiation-induced toxicity. The toxicity of X-ray radiation on human
   bronchial epithelial cell lines (HBE) was determined through a
   dose-dependent increase in ROS production and gamma-H2AX formation and
   changes to lncRNA expression was observed and quantified using
   lncRNA-specific microarrays. 115 lncRNAs expression was increased in a
   dose-dependent manner following X-ray irradiation. Bioinformatic
   prediction algorithms determined that these lncRNAs significantly affect
   the p53 signaling pathway, and, more specifically, the BRCA 1
   transcription factor and coding genes adjacent to BRCA 1. Our results
   highlight a previously uncharacterized role for lncRNAs to act via the
   p53-pathway in response to X-ray-induced DNA damage, and suggest lncRNAs
   may serve as novel indicators for radiation toxicity. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Invasion and migration of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a multistep
   process and an important phenotype that causes this disease to invade
   surrounding tissues in the brain. The purpose of this study was to
   determine the role of miR-590-3p in regulation of epithelial mesenchymal
   transition (EMT) and metastasis of GBM cells. Expression levels of
   miR-590-3p in 15 GBM specimens with adjacent tissues and five GBM cell
   lines were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. We found that miR-590-3p was
   down-regulated in detected GBM tissue samples and all of the GBM cell
   lines. In addition, Ectopic expression of miR-590-3p suppressed and
   miR-590-3p-in promoted EMT, migration, and invasion in U87MG and A172
   cells. Bioinformatics coupled with luciferase and Western blot assays
   also revealed that miR-590-3p inhibited expression of ZEB1 and ZEB2,
   which are master regulators of tumor metastasis. Our study first
   indicates that miR-590-3p functions as a suppressor of GBM EMT and
   metastasis by targeting ZEB1 and ZEB2, and it may be a therapeutic
   target for metastatic GBM. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The total variation (TV) model is one of the most successful methods for
   image restoration, as well as an ideal bed to develop optimization
   algorithms for solving sparse representation problems. Previous studies
   showed that derivative space formulation of the image restoration model
   is useful in improving the success rate in image recovery and kernel
   estimation performance in blind deconvolution. However, little
   attentions are paid on the model and algorithm for derivative space
   based image restoration. In this paper, we study the TV based image
   restoration (TVIR) by developing a novel derivative space-based
   reformulation together with an efficient derivative alternating
   direction method of multipliers (D-ADMM) algorithm. Thanks to the
   simplicity of the proposed derivative space reformulation, D-ADMM only
   requires four fast Fourier transform (FFT) operations per iteration, and
   is much more efficient than the other augmented Lagrangian methods.
   Numerical experiments show that, D-ADMM can obtain satisfactory
   restoration result and is much faster than the state-of-the-art TVIR
   algorithms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the present paper, a constitutive model for the description of the
   dissipation in the concrete is provided. The theoretical description is
   based on a micromorphic model in which the microstructure is constituted
   by a kinematical scalar descriptor phi whose time derivative is linked
   to a dissipative potential. The scalar phi can be interpreted as the
   relative displacement between two opposite faces of the microcracks, and
   our physical interpretation of dissipation is indeed linked to the
   friction force (in a mixed Coulomb-type and viscous-type behavior)
   between them. To evaluate the effects of bending on the dissipation, the
   3D model is then reduced by means of standard Saint-Venant's procedure
   in case of combined compression and bending over a cylindrical domain. A
   qualitative analysis of the reduced ODEs model is then provided.
   Numerical results showing comparison between different types of
   dissipative force and between pure compression and combined compression
   and bending are included in a dedicated section. Finally, the proposed
   model and our physical interpretation of the dissipation are supported
   by some experimental data concerning standard concrete and a concrete
   enriched by adding to the mixture a filler constituted by
   micro-particles capable of improving the dissipative behavior of the
   material. Measured data show very good fit with our theoretical
   previsions and provide a sufficiently sound basis for further deepening
   of the theoretical description of the considered phenomena. Copyright

Abstract = {{The structural stability and stress rupture properties of a Ni-Fe based
   alloy, considered as boiler materials in 700 degrees C advanced
   ultra-supercritical (A-USC) coal-fired power plants, was studied.
   Investigation on the structural stability of the existing alloy GH984
   shows that the most important changes in the alloys are gamma'
   coarsening, the gamma' to eta transformation and the coarsening and
   agglomeration of grain boundary M23C6 during thermal exposure. The
   stress rupture strength was found to be slightly lower than the
   requirement of 700 degrees C A-USC. The fracture mode of creep tested
   specimens was intergranular fracture. Detailed analysis revealed that
   eta phase precipitation is sensitive to Ti/Al ratio and can be
   suppressed by decreasing Ti/Al ratio. The coarsening behavior of gamma'
   phase is related to Fe content. Adding B and P was suggested to
   stabilize M23C6 and increase grain boundary strength. Based on the
   research presented and analysis of the data, a modified alloy was
   developed through changes in composition. For the modified alloy, eta
   phase is not observed and M23C6 is still blocky and discretely
   distributes along grain boundary after thermal exposure at 700 degrees C
   for 20,000 h. Moreover, the creep strength is comparable to the levels
   of Ni-based candidate alloys for 700 degrees C A-USC. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A series of Ca2Sb2O7:xBi(3+) (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4 and 8 mol\%) blue
   phosphors were synthesized using a chemical co-precipitation technique
   with further calcination. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning
   electron microscope (SEM) results revealed that the obtained
   Ca2Sb2O7:xBi samples are orthorhombic weberite structure with particle
   size ranging from 20 nm to 40 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
   confirmed that the introduction of bismuth into the Ca2Sb2O7 crystal was
   in the form of Bi3+ and no other chemical states were found. The
   Bi-doped Ca2Sb2O7 powders exhibit a broad emission band centered at 438
   nm upon UV-irradiation and it is characterized by double-luminescence
   centers. The dependence of the luminescent intensity on the Bi-doping
   concentration in Ca2Sb2O7 was studied in detail. As a result, the
   optimized concentration of Bi3+ is 1.5 mol\% for the highest emission
   intensity peaking at 438 nm, and the concentration quenching occurs when
   the concentration of Bi3+ exceeds 1.5 mol\%. The luminescence mechanism
   of Bi3+ in Ca2Sb2O7 was also discussed. The favorable luminescent
   properties of Ca2Sb2O7:Bi3+ make it promising for lighting and display
   applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},

Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{990-998}},
Month = {{DEC 25}},
Abstract = {{Friction taper plug welding experiment was conducted on X65 pipeline
   steel in underwater wet condition. Results indicate that the weld
   defects, microstructural evolution and mechanical properties are closely
   related to the material flow behavior during welding. The formation of
   weld defect characterized by incomplete filling or lack of bonding is
   mainly caused by the poor flowing property of the plug material
   especially in low axial welding force. In the experiment condition,
   rising the axial force would result in better material flow, higher weld
   power, more energy input and further improve the bond quality of the
   weld. Microstructure of both weld zone and heat-affected-zone mainly
   consists of lath bainite which results in an overmatching condition
   through the weld. High quality welds in this study also exhibit good
   tensile and impact properties that is equal to the base metal and
   acceptable bend property of 105 degrees as the best. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper focus on utilizing a simple and effective method that is
   coating highly oriented graphite films (HOGFs) on the surface of
   polyaaylonitrile-based (PAN-based) carbon fiber reinforced plastic
   (CFRP) composite laminates to improve the in-plane thermal conductivity
   of composite laminates. The thermal physical and mechanical properties
   of HOGF reinforced CFRP (HOGF-CFRP) composite laminates are measured.
   The measurement results show that HOGF greatly improves the in-plane
   thermal conductivity of hybrid HOGF-CFRP composite laminates. In-plane
   thermal conductivity of HOGF-T700/epoxy composite laminates increases to
   50.7 W/m K and enhances 14.1 times than that of T700/epoxy composite
   laminates. The in-plane thermal conductivity of HOGF-M55J/epoxy hybrid
   composite laminates is also up to 118.8 W/m K and attains to the level
   of the aluminum alloys (nearly 120 W/m K), which satisfy the requirement
   of engineering application in aircraft, aerospace and other high-end
   heat dissipation fields. Moreover, HOGF-CFRP composite laminates show
   the same low thermal expansivity as CFRP composite laminates. The
   mechanical results suggest that the HOGF-CFRP composite laminates not
   only have high in-plane thermal conductivity but also high specific
   mechanical property. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most frequent
   cause of cancer-related death in adults. Despite recent advances in the
   clinical technologies, the screening and diagnostic efficacy for HCC
   remains poor. Discovering novel and reliable HCC biomarkers is urgently
   needed.
   Material/Methods: We performed a transcriptome-proteome integrated assay
   to track the possible HCC biomarkers from the process of HCC-derived
   gene expression in malignant cells to its protein product released into
   serum.
   Results: Our screening results demonstrated that heat shock protein 90A
   (HSP90A), which participates in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and many
   other cancer-related pathways, warrants further investigation. The
   expression of HSP90A was increased in the HCC cells, serum, and tissues.
   Immunohistochemistry analysis on 76 clinical tissue samples also
   suggested the relevance between HSP90A expression and HCC metastatic
   behavior.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest a role for HSP90A in HCC
   pathogenesis and the potential use of HSP90A for the screening and
   diagnosis of this malignancy.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless Community Networks (WCNs) are bottom-up broadband networks
   empowering people with their on-line communication means. Too often,
   however, services tailored for their characteristics are missing, with
   the consequence that they have worse performance than what they could.
   We present here an adaptation of an Open Source P2P live streaming
   platform that works efficiently, and with good application-level
   quality, over WCNs. WCNs links are normally symmetric (unlike standard
   ADSL access), and a WCN topology is local and normally flat (contrary to
   the global Internet), so that the P2P overlay used for video
   distribution can be adapted to the underlaying network characteristics.
   We exploit this observation to derive overlay building strategies that
   make use of cross-layer information to reduce the impact of the P2P
   streaming on the WCN while maintaining good application performance. We
   experiment with a real application in real WCN nodes, both in the
   Community-Lab provided by the CONFINE EU Project and within an emulation
   framework based on Mininet, where we can build larger topologies and
   interact more efficiently with the mesh underlay, which is unfortunately
   not accessible in Community-Lab. The results show that, with the overlay
   building strategies proposed, the P2P streaming applications can reduce
   the load on the WCN to about one half, also equalizing the load on
   links. At the same time the delivery rate and delay of video chunks are
   practically unaffected. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a principal causative
   agent of primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) with a poor prognosis in
   immunocompromised patients. However, it still lacks effective treatment
   which urgently requires the identification of novel therapeutic targets
   for PEL. Here, we report that the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-MET
   pathway is highly activated by KSHV in vitro and in vivo. The selective
   c-MET inhibitor, PF-2341066, can induce PEL apoptosis through cell cycle
   arrest and DNA damage, and suppress tumor progression in a xenograft
   murine model. By using microarray analysis, we identify many novel genes
   that are potentially controlled by HGF/c-MET within PEL cells. One of
   the downstream candidates, ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase subunit
   M2 (RRM2), also displays the promising therapeutic value for PEL
   treatment. Our findings provide the framework for development of
   HGF/c-MET-focused therapy and implementation of clinical trials for PEL

Abstract = {{Dense phase silica layers with thickness of a few nanometers featuring
   embedded organic molecular wires of type p-oligo(phenyienevinylene) are
   shown by visible light sensitized electrochemical measurements to
   transport charges across the insulating membrane. We find that such
   hybrid materials combination allows electronic charge transport only
   through the wires, while blocking molecular transport. Embodiment of the
   wire molecules in the silica was accomplished by atomic layer deposition
   under mild temperature conditions. Grown on CO oxide films:for water
   oxidation, with the wire molecules covalently anchored on the Oxide
   surface, the layer functions as a proton conducting separation Membrane.
   Characterization by XPS, FT-IR and STEM/DX confirms the integrity of the
   silica-encapsulated organic Wires,. Cyclic voltammetry with redox couple
   of selected potential relative to the energy-levels of the wire
   molecules shows that the Membrane is free of pinholes. The new type of
   membrane allows separation of incompatible redox reaction environments
   on the length stale of nanometers while enabling controlled electron
   transport between them. This opens up the coupling of carbon dioxide
   reduction with water oxidation, the essential reactions of artificial
   photosynthesis, in an integrated nanoscale photosystem.}},

Abstract = {{The gas phase structure and excited state dynamics of o-aminophenol-H2O
   complex have been investigated using REMPI, IR-UV hole-burning
   spectroscopy, and pump-probe experiments with picoseconds laser pulses.
   The IR-UV spectroscopy indicates that the isomer responsible for the
   excitation spectrum corresponds to an orientation of the OH band away
   from the NH2 group. The water molecule acts as H-bond acceptor of the OH
   group of the chromophore. The complexation of o-aminophenol with one
   water molecule induced all enhancement in the excited state lifetime on
   the band origin. The variation of the excited state lifetime of the
   complex with the excess energy from 1.4 +/- 0.1 ns for the 0-0 band to
   0.24 +/- 0.3 ns for the band at 0-0 + 120 cm(-1) is very similar to the
   variation observed in the phenol-NH3 system. This experimental result
   suggests that the excited state hydrogen transfer reaction is the
   dominant channel for the non radiative pathway. Indeed, excited state ab
   initio calculations demonstrate that H transfer leading to the formation
   of the H3O center dot radical within the complex is the main reactive
   pathway.}},

Abstract = {{The eel fauna (orders Anguilliformes and Saccopharyngiformes) of Taiwan
   is one of the richest in the world. Recent genetic and morphological
   studies have improved the taxonomic resolution and increased the known
   diversity of the eels of Taiwan, and the overall diversity is comparable
   to that of adjacent marine zoogeographic regions with rich biodiversity,
   such as Australia and the Philippines. In this special issue, we
   verified the historical records and examined numerous recently collected
   specimens, and conclude that the eel fauna of Taiwan is represented by
   207 species in 75 genera and 14 families, with several undescribed
   species still likely to be discovered. The Muraenidae (71 species),
   Ophichthidae (60), Congridae (29) and Synaphobranchidae (17) are the
   most abundant and species-rich in Taiwanese waters. We add 42 species to
   the Taiwanese fish fauna, including one new genus and 13 new species.
   Two further species are newly described, one from the Philippines and
   one from Indonesia.}},

Abstract = {{Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a major global health threat, replicates in
   macrophages in part by inhibiting phagosome-lysosome fusion, until
   interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) activates the macrophage to traffic M.
   tuberculosis to the lysosome. How IFN gamma elicits this effect is
   unknown, but many studies suggest a role for macroautophagy (herein
   termed autophagy), a process by which cytoplasmic contents are targeted
   for lysosomal degradation(1). The involvement of autophagy has been
   defined based on studies in cultured cells where M. tuberculosis
   co-localizes with autophagy factors ATG5, ATG12, ATG16L1, p62, NDP52,
   BECN1 and LC3 (refs 2-6), stimulation of autophagy increases bacterial
   killing(6-8), and inhibition of autophagy increases bacterial
   survival(1,2,4,6,7). Notably, these studies reveal modest (similar to
   1.5-3-fold change) effects on M. tuberculosis replication. By contrast,
   mice lacking ATG5 in monocyte-derived cells and neutrophils
   (polymorponuclear cells, PMNs) succumb to M. tuberculosis within 30
   days(4,9), an extremely severe phenotype similar to mice lacking IFN
   gamma signalling(10,11). Importantly, ATG5 is the only autophagy factor
   that has been studied during M. tuberculosis infection in vivo and
   autophagy-independent functions of ATG5 have been described(12-18). For
   this reason, we used a genetic approach to elucidate the role for
   multiple autophagy-related genes and the requirement for autophagy in
   resistance to M. tuberculosis infection in vivo. Here we show that,
   contrary to expectation, autophagic capacity does not correlate with the
   outcome of M. tuberculosis infection. Instead, ATG5 plays a unique role
   in protection against M. tuberculosis by preventing PMN-mediated
   immunopathology. Furthermore, while Atg5 is dispensable in alveolar
   macrophages during M. tuberculosis infection, loss of Atg5 in PMNs can
   sensitize mice to M. tuberculosis. These findings shift our
   understanding of the role of ATG5 during M. tuberculosis infection,
   reveal new outcomes of ATG5 activity, and shed light on early events in
   innate immunity that are required to regulate disease pathology and
   bacterial replication.}},

Abstract = {{In order to improve water quality and ecosystems health, the focus of
   river ecological restoration and water ecosystem-based management needs
   to reach beyond its usual policy domain by restricting the expansion of
   urban built-up land and reducing urbanization-related pollution. This
   study aims to assess the impacts of urbanization on water quality for
   three spatial urban development zones, i.e. center, inner pen-urban and
   outer pen-urban of the eastern coastal municipality of Lianyungang,
   China. We analyze the relationship between urban landscape ecological
   pattern and water quality in three landscape zones. The study explores
   this relationship and its policy implications. The results of our
   analysis are as follow: (1) In the center zone, the landscape pattern
   metrics, largest patch index (LPI) and total class area (CA) were
   strongly correlated with water quality parameters, such as CODMn and
   NH3-N; (2) In the inner penurban zone, the number of significant
   relations of land use pattern metrics and water quality parameters in
   2008 was greater than that in 2000 and 2004; (3) land use pattern
   metrics in the outer pen-urban were less correlated to water quality
   than in the other zones; (4) the degree of correlation in different
   spatial zones was in following order: center (2008 > 2000 > 2004), inner
   pen-urban (2008 > 2000 > 2004), outer pen-urban (2004> 2000 = 2008).
   Thus, the relationships between landscape and water quality varies
   significantly over space due to varying watershed characteristics and
   pollution sources across space. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Graphite-like Carbon nitride (g-C3N4)-based heterostructures have
   attracted much attention because of their prominent photocatalytic
   performance. However, theoretical understanding on the relationship of
   the interface and enhanced photocatalytic activity is still lacking. In
   this study, we systematically calculated energy band structure and
   charge transfer of the g-C3N4/CdS heterojunction using the hybrid
   density functional approach. The interaction between g-C3N4 and the CdS
   (110) surface was explored. Results indicated that g-C3N4 and CdS were
   in contact and formed a van der Waals heterojunction. The valence and
   conduction band edge positions of g-C3N4 and CdS changed with the Fermi
   level and formed a standard type-II heterostructure. Furthermore,
   density of states, Bader charge, and charge density difference indicated
   that the internal electric field facilitated the separation of electron
   hole pair in the g-C3N4/CdS recombination. These results demonstrated
   that the band structure of the g-C3N4/CdS heterojunction had significant
   advantages to improve photocatalytic efficiency under visible-light
   irradiation. Moreover, our work may be used as a basis for the design of
   other highly active heterostructures.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{176}},
Pages = {{508-514}},
Month = {{DEC 24}},
Abstract = {{Ethnopharmacological relevance: Different communities throughout the
   world have specialized and profound knowledge on the use medicinal
   plants for various diseases. However, the detailed information on the
   respective use may extinct in near future as this knowledge is passed
   only orally among generations in most of the communities.
   Aim of the study: The present survey aimed to document the use of
   medicinal plants by traditional healers from the Kisii community, Borabu
   sub-county in Nyamira county, Kenya, to treat infections of the urinary
   tract, oral cavity, gastrointestinal system and the skin and to evaluate
   the social context in which the healers work and practice.
   Materials and methods: Validated questionnaires were applied to 50
   traditional healers in the study region, followed by interviews and
   structured conversations. Information on the relevant traditionally used
   medicinal plants and their use were documented, including sampling and
   identification of voucher specimens.
   Results: The ethnopharmacological survey revealed 25 medicinal plant
   species belonging to 19 families. It got evident that most of these
   species will be extinct in the near future unless appropriate measures
   are taken, as it turned out difficult to collect some of the wild
   growing species. Elaeodendron buchananii Loes, Erlangea marginata S.
   Moore, Acacia gerrardii Benth., Balanites orbicularis Sprague, Solanum
   renschii Vatke and Orthosiphon hildebrandtii Vatke have not been
   described before for its medicinal use. Among the 25 species collected
   from the various regions of Borabu sub-county Urtica dioica L. was the
   only medicinal plant that was collected from all regions. In contrast
   Erythrina abyssinica and Rhus natalensis were found in only two regions
   of the study area.
   Conclusion: The traditional medicinal use of the reported plants for
   infections should be documented and a great need of awareness from
   scientists and local government for improved preservation or field
   cultivation of some species is obvious. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Abstract = {{The possibility to use multicapillary gas-chromatography column (MCC) as
   the second-dimension column in comprehensive two-dimensional gas
   chromatography (GC x GC) has been demonstrated. Dependences of the
   efficiency on the carrier gas volumetric flow rate were studied for
   capillary columns (CC) HP-5 and ZB-WAX of length 5 m and multicapillary
   columns of length 0.25 m with stationary phases OV-73 and Carbowax 20 M.
   For standard capillary columns, the maximum efficiency is reached at a
   flow rate below 2 mL/min. In the GC x GC mode, a capillary column is
   operated at a flow rate strongly exceeding the optimal value. Therewith,
   the efficiency of standard capillary column decreases several-fold, to
   1570 theoretical plates for HP-5 and 1000 theoretical plates for ZB-WAX.
   In the case of multicapillary columns that are used in this paper, the
   maximum efficiency is reached at the carrier gas velocities above 60
   mL/min. This allows MCC to be used as the second-dimension column in GC
   x GC at the optimal flow rate, thus reaching a maximum efficiency of
   5900 theoretical plates for MCC with the OV-73 stationary phase and 2800
   theoretical plates with Carbowax 20 M. The GC x GC separation of
   aliphatic and aromatic compounds was used to demonstrate that high
   efficiency of MCC enhances peak resolution in the second dimension as
   compared to standard capillary column. MCC was shown to be superior in
   separation of the components with close retention times and
   substantially differing concentrations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Organophosphate (OP) diesters in urine samples have potential use as

   study developed a quantitatively sensitive ultra high pressure liquid
   chromatography (UHPLC-MS) based method for urine and the determination
   of OP diesters (i.e. diphenyl phosphate (DPHP), bis(2-chloroethyl)

   phosphate (DNBP), di(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (DEHP),
   bis(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BCIPP), and bis(2-butoxyethyl)
   phosphate (BBOEP)). Fortified with the 7 OP diesters, 1 mL of human
   urine sample was cleaned up using weak anion exchange solid phase
   extraction and eluted with high ionic strength ammonium acetate buffer.
   Subsequently, 4 non-chlorinated OP diesters were directly determined

   and UHPLC-ESI(+)-QqQ-MS was used for determination of 3 chlorinated OP
   diesters after methylation using diazomethane. Recovery efficiencies of
   OP diesters ranged from 88 to 160\% at three spiking levels (0.4, 2 and
   10 ng/mL urine). Matrix effects (MEs) and method limits of
   quantification (MLOQs) were 15-134\% and 0.10-0.32 ng/mL urine,

Title = {{Inhibitory Effect of the Melanocortin Receptor Agonist Melanotan-II
   (MTII) on Feeding Depends on Dietary Fat Content and not Obesity in Rats
   on Free-Choice Diets}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Conflicting data exist on sensitivity changes of the
   melanocortin system during diet Induced obesity. We hypothesized that
   melanocortin sensitivity depends on diet composition, in particular on
   the fat content rather than the level of obesity. The aim of this study
   was to determine the influence of diet composition on feeding responses
   to a melanocortin receptor agonist, using free-choice diets that differ
   in food components.
   Methods: Male Wistar rats were subjected to a chow (CHOW) diet or a
   free-choice (fc) diet of either chow, saturated fat and liquid sugar
   (fcHFHS), chow and saturated fat (fcHF), or chow and liquid sugar (fcHS)
   for 4 weeks. Melanocortin sensitivity was tested by measuring food
   intake following administration of the melanocortin 3/4 receptor agonist
   melanotan II (MTII) or vehicle in the lateral ventricle. In a separate
   experiment, proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti related protein (AgRP)
   mRNA levels were determined in the arcuate nucleus with in situ
   hybridization in rats subjected to the free-choice diets for 4 weeks.
   Results: Rats on the fcHFHS diet for 4 weeks show increased caloric
   intake and body weight gain compared to rats on the CHOW, fcHS and fcHF
   diet. Caloric intake and body weight gain was comparable between rats on
   the fcHF, fcHS, and CHOW diet. After 4 weeks diet, POMC and AgRP mRNA
   levels were not different between diet groups. Mill inhibited caloric
   intake to a larger extent in rats on the fcHF diet compared to rats on
   the CHOW, fcHFHS or fcHS diet. Moreover, the fat component was the most
   inhibited by Mill, and the sugar component the least.
   Conclusion: Rats on the fcHF diet show stronger food intake inhibition
   to the melanocortin receptor agonist Mill than rats on the CHOW, fcHS,
   and fcHFHS diet, which is independent of caloric intake and body weight
   gain. Our data point toward an important role for diet composition,
   particularly the dietary fat content, and not obesity in the sensitivity
   of the melanocortin system.}},

Abstract = {{The structure and dynamics of the solutions of LiPF6 in propylene
   carbonate over a concentration range of 0-3 mol/kg are studied with
   neutron spin echo spectroscopy, alternating-current (AC) conductometry,
   and shear impedance spectroscopy. The neutron diffraction shows a
   prepeak at approximate to 10 nm(-1) in addition to the main peak at
   approximate to 14 nm(-1) when the concentration of the salt is no less
   than 2 mol/kg. Compared with the frequency-dependent shear viscosity and
   AC conductivity, the relaxation of the shear stress agrees with that
   expected from the structural relaxation of the main peak. On the other
   hand, the relaxation of the conductivity is slower than the shear
   relaxation at all the concentrations, and the former approximately
   matches with the relaxation of the prepeak at the highest concentration,
   3 mol/kg, which is several times slower than that of the main peak. The
   possible contribution of the prepeak structure to the ionic conduction
   is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Ethnopharmacological relevance: Several Ganoderma fungi are well-known
   for their medical uses to treat cancer, insomnia and kidney disease in
   East Asia. Triperpenoids and polysaccharides have been considered for a
   long time to be the major active components of the genus Ganoderma. The
   present study is to examine the effects of lingzhilactones from G.
   lingzhi on adriamycin-induced nephropathy in mice.
   Materials and methods: A combination of various chromatography led to
   the isolation of lingzhilactones A-C, their structures were identified
   by spectroscopic and computational methods. The intracellular reactive
   oxygen species (ROS) was detected with the
   carboxymethyl-H2-dichlorofluorescein diacetate fluoroprobe. The fibrotic
   markers were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analyses.
   Detection of SEAP was conducted with the chemiluminescent. Urine albumin
   was measured using an ELISA assay. Histology and immunohistochemical
   staining was used to assess fibrotic lesions in mice.
   Results: Three new lingzhilactones A-C (1-3) containing a fused lactone
   moiety were isolated from G. lingzhi. We found that 2 could inhibit ROS
   generation in a dose-dependent manner, inhibit mRNA expression of
   collagen IV, fibronectin, IL-6 and increase expression of Nrf2 in rat
   tubular epithelial cells. Furthermore, we found that 2 could reduce
   urinary albumin levels, abrogate myofibroblastic activation and inhibit
   the phosphorylation of Smad3 in adriamycin-induced mice.
   Conclusions: The in vitro and in vivo results suggested that
   lingzhilactone B could protect against renal injuries by increasing the
   activities of antioxidants and inhibiting inflammation. The inhibition
   of Smad3 phosphorylation suggested that this substance displays in vivo
   antifibrotic activity by a mechanism that is dependent on disruption of
   Smad3. These results promote understanding of the traditional usage of
   G. lingzhi and provide promising findings which may be beneficial for
   anti-kidney disease drug design. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Volume = {{92}},

Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{We study the effective field theory (EFT) of large-scale structure for
   cosmic density and momentum fields. We show that the finite part of the
   two-loop calculation and its counterterms introduces an apparent scale
   dependence for the leading-order parameter c(s)(2) of the EFT starting
   at k = 0.1 hMpc(-1). These terms limit the range over which one can
   trust the one-loop EFT calculation at the 1\% level to k < 0.1 hMpc(-1)
   at redshift z = 0. We construct a well-motivated one-parameter ansatz to
   fix the relative size of the one-and two-loop counterterms using their
   high-k sensitivity. Although this one-parameter model is a very
   restrictive choice for the counterterms, it explains the apparent scale
   dependence of c(s)(2) seen in simulations. It is also able to capture
   the scale dependence of the density power spectrum up to k approximate
   to 0.3 hMpc(-1) at the 1\% level at redshift z = 0. Considering a simple
   scheme for the resummation of large-scale motions, we find that the
   two-loop calculation reduces the need for this IR resummation at k < 0.2
   hMpc(-1). Finally, we extend our calculation to momentum statistics and
   show that the same one-parameter model can also describe
   density-momentum and momentum-momentum statistics.}},

Title = {{Prevalence of hepatitis B and C and sensibility of a selective screening

Journal = {{BMC CANCER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Reactivation of hepatitis B or C virus can occur in patients
   undergoing chemotherapy. Recommendations for selective or systematic
   hepatitis B virus testing prior chemotherapy for solid tumors differ.
   The primary aim was to determine the seroprevalence of hepatitis B or C
   in a low endemic country. The second objective was to assess the
   relevance of a questionnaire on hepatitis B/C risk factors to consider a
   selective screening.
   Methods: Patients were prospectively tested for hepatitis B/C markers.
   HBs antigen positive patients and isolated anti-HBc positive patients
   with detectable viral load received antiviral preventive treatment.
   Patients or physicians completed the questionnaire on infection risk
   factors.
   Results: Among the 450 patients included, 388 were tested for all
   serological markers and had gastrointestinal (63.7 \%), lung (31.2 \%)
   and skin (4.6 \%) cancers. The prevalence of subjects exposed to
   hepatitis B virus was 8.5 \% (33/388). One patient tested positive for
   HBs antigen and received preventive treatment. Prevalence of subjects
   exposed to hepatitis C was 1.3 \% (5/388). The questionnaire sensitivity
   was 45.5 \%, 100 \% and 50 \% for detecting carriers of hepatitis B, C
   and one or the other, respectively.
   Conclusions: Seroprevalence of hepatitis B was low. Selective screening
   with the questionnaire was insufficiently sensitive. Systematic
   screening with serological tests prior to chemotherapy in patients with
   solid tumors is therefore relevant.}},

Title = {{The effectiveness of a shared conference experience in improving
   undergraduate medical and nursing students' attitudes towards
   inter-professional education in an Asian country: a before and after
   study}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: In recent years, increasing emphasis has been placed on the
   importance of collaboration within multi-disciplinary healthcare teams,
   so as to facilitate holistic patient care and thus allow improved
   treatment outcomes. There is hence an urgent need to educate healthcare
   undergraduates early in their professional careers on the importance of
   and complexities involved in cooperating with counterparts from other
   allied healthcare professions. In conjunction with this, a milestone
   student-led conference for undergraduate students, the 9th Student
   Medical-Nursing Education Conference (SMEC), was organised in 2013 to
   provide a unique opportunity for shared learning among the entire cohort
   of undergraduate medical and nursing students in Singapore matriculating
   in that year.
   Methods: This study evaluated the effectiveness of the 9th SMEC 2013 as
   a shared conference experience in improving the attitudes of
   undergraduate medical and nursing students in Singapore towards
   inter-professional education (IPE). A 19-point Readiness for
   Inter-Professional Learning Scale (RIPLS) questionnaire comprising three
   subscales was administered to participants both before and after the
   conference. 352 responses were collected, giving a response rate of 75.1
   \%.
   Results were analysed using paired-samples t-tests with statistical
   significance set at p = 0.05. Results: Improvements in overall scores
   for both medical and nursing students were reported for all three RIPLS
   subscales. Examining the RIPLS items individually, significant
   improvement in scores for both medical and nursing students was obtained
   in all 19 items. Prior exposure to IPE activities was not a predictor of
   improvement in IPE attitudes.
   Conclusion: The authors propose that student-led jointly-organised
   conference experiences are effective in improving healthcare students'
   attitudes towards IPE. This study provides valuable insights to
   facilitate the development of further IPE programs to allow for the
   rapid and effective promotion of cooperation and collaboration between
   students across various healthcare disciplines.}},

Title = {{Generation of Functional Inhibitory Synapses Incorporating Defined
   Combinations of GABA(A) or Glycine Receptor Subunits}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain is mediated by wide range
   of GABAA receptor (GABAAR) and glycine receptor (GIyR) isoforms, each
   with different physiological and pharmacological properties. Because
   multiple isoforms are expressed simultaneously in most neurons, it is
   difficult to define the properties of individual isoforms under synaptic
   stimulation conditions in vivo. Although recombinant expression systems
   permit the expression of individual isoforms in isolation, they require
   exogenous agonist application which cannot mimic the dynamic
   neurotransmitter profile characteristic of native synapses. We describe
   a neuron-HEK293 cell co culture technique for generating inhibitory
   synapses incorporating defined combinations of GABAAR or GIyR subunits.
   Primary neuronal cultures, prepared from embryonic rat cerebral cortex
   or spinal cord, are used to provide presynaptic GABAergic and
   glycinergic terminals, respectively. When the cultures are mature,
   HEK293 cells expressing the subunits of interest plus neuroligin 2A are
   plated onto the neurons, which rapidly form synapses onto HEK293 cells.
   Patch clamp electrophysiology is then used to analyze the physiological
   and pharmacological properties of the inhibitory postsynaptic currents
   mediated by the recombinant receptors. The method is suitable for
   investigating the kinetic properties or the effects of drugs on
   inhibitory postsynaptic currents mediated by defined GABAAR or GIyR
   isoforms of interest, the effects of hereditary disease mutations on the
   formation and function of both types of synapses, and synaptogenesis and
   synaptic clustering mechanisms. The entire cell preparation procedure
   takes 2-5 weeks.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{We derive superconformal partial waves for all scalar four-point
   functions on a super Grassmannian space Gr(m vertical bar n, 2m vertical
   bar 2n) for all m; n. This family of four-point functions includes those
   of all (arbitrary weight) half BPS operators in both N = 4 SYM (m = n =
   2) and in N = 2 superconformal field theories in four dimensions (m = 2,
   n = 1) on analytic superspace. It also includes four-point functions of
   all (arbitrary dimension) scalar fields in non-supersymmetric conformal
   field theories (m = 2, n = 0) on Minkowski space, as well as those of a
   certain class of representations of the compact SU(2 n) coset spaces. As
   an application we then specialise to N = 4 SYM and use these results to
   perform a detailed superconformal partial wave analysis of the
   four-point functions of arbitrary weight half BPS operators. We discuss
   the non-trivial separation of protected and unprotected sectors for the
   < 2222 >, < 2233 > and < 3333 > cases in an SU(N) gauge theory at finite
   N. The < 2233 > correlator predicts a non-trivial protected twist four
   sector for < 3333 > which we can completely determine using the
   knowledge that there is precisely one such protected twist four operator
   for each spin.}},

Abstract = {{Linearly polarized light with an energy of 3.1 eV has been used to

   spin-selective excitation process has been studied by spin-and
   momentum-resolved two-photon photoemission. Analyzing the photoemission
   patterns in two-dimensional momentum planes, we find that the optically
   driven transition from the valence band to the QWS acts almost
   exclusively on majority-spin electrons. The mechanism providing the high
   spin polarization is discussed by the help of a density-functional
   theory calculation. Additionally, a sizable effect of spin-orbit
   coupling for the QWS is evidenced.}},

Abstract = {{Penicillium roqueforti has the ability to produce secondary metabolites,
   including roquefortine C (ROQC) and mycophenolic acid (MPA). In a
   previous study, the presence of these mycotoxins, alone or in
   co-occurrence, has been reported in blue-veined cheese. A high
   variability of mycotoxin content has also been observed, although the
   majority of samples exhibited relatively low concentrations. The
   observed variability raises the question of the factors impacting ROQC
   and MPA production. In this context, the mycotoxigenic potential of 96
   P. roqueforti strains (biotic factor) and the effect of some abiotic
   factors (pH, temperature, NaCl and O-2 contents, and C/N ratio) on
   mycotoxin production were evaluated. A high intraspecific diversity,
   established via genotypic (RAPD) and phenotypic (FIR) approaches, was
   observed. It was associated with mycotoxigenic potential variability and
   may thus explain part of the observed variability in mycotoxin content
   of blue-veined cheese. Moreover, a significant decrease of ROQC and MPA
   production was observed for conditions (temperature, C/N ratio, O-2 and
   NaCl concentrations) encountered during cheese-making compared with
   optimal growth conditions. The results also highlighted that there was
   no significant effect of addition of ROQC amino-acid precursor on the
   production of both mycotoxins whereas a pH increase from 4.5 to 6.5
   slightly reduced MPA but not ROQC production. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in
   women: randomised controlled trial}},
Journal = {{BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{351}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{STUDY QUESTION
   Can treatment of the symptoms of uncomplicated urinary tract infection
   (UTI) with ibuprofen reduce the rate of antibiotic prescriptions without
   a significant increase in symptoms, recurrences, or complications?
   METHODS
   Women aged 18-65 with typical symptoms of UTI and without risk factors
   or complications were recruited in 42 German general practices and
   randomly assigned to treatment with a single dose of fosfomycin 3 g (n =
   246; 243 analysed) or ibuprofen 3x400 mg (n = 248; 241 analysed) for
   three days (and the respective placebo dummies in both groups). In both
   groups additional antibiotic treatment was subsequently prescribed as
   necessary for persistent, worsening, or recurrent symptoms. The primary
   endpoints were the number of all courses of antibiotic treatment on days
   0-28 (for UTI or other conditions) and burden of symptoms on days 0-7.
   The symptom score included dysuria, frequency/urgency, and low abdominal
   pain.
   STUDY ANSWER AND LIMITATIONS
   The 248 women in the ibuprofen group received significantly fewer course
   of antibiotics, had a significantly higher total burden of symptoms, and
   more had pyelonephritis. Four serious adverse events occurred that lead
   to hospital referrals; one of these was potentially related to the trial
   drug. Results have to be interpreted carefully as they might apply to
   women with mild to moderate symptoms rather than to all those with an
   uncomplicated UTI.
   WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS
   Two thirds of women with uncomplicated UTI treated symptomatically with
   ibuprofen recovered without any antibiotics. Initial symptomatic
   treatment is a possible approach to be discussed with women willing to
   avoid immediate antibiotics and to accept a somewhat higher burden of
   symptoms.

Title = {{The ACT-i-Pass study protocol: How does free access to recreation
   opportunities impact children's physical activity levels?}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Physical activity during childhood is associated with a
   multitude of physical, behavioural, and psychological health benefits.
   Identification of effective population level strategies for increasing
   children's physical activity levels is critical for improving the
   overall health of Canadians. The overall objective of this study is to
   assess how a naturally-occurring, community-level intervention which
   offers Grade 5 children in London, Canada a free access pass to physical
   activity opportunities (facilities and programs) for an entire school
   year can lead to increased physical activity among recipients.
   Methods/Design: This study adopts a longitudinal cohort study design to
   assess the effectiveness of improving children's access to physical
   activity opportunities for increasing their physical activity levels. To
   meet our overall objective we have three aims: (1) to assess whether the
   provision of free access increases children's physical activity levels
   during and after the intervention compared to a control group; (2) to
   assess how and why child-specific trajectories of physical activity
   (between-children differences in level of physical activity measured
   across time) in the intervention group differ according to children's
   individual and household characteristics; and (3) to explore additional
   factors that are unaccounted for in the theoretical model to gain a
   further understanding of why the free access intervention had varying
   effects on changing physical activity levels. We will be addressing
   these aims using a mixed methods approach, including: a series of youth
   surveys conducted before, during, immediately after, and 4-months after
   the intervention; parent surveys before, during, and post-intervention;
   real-time tracking of the access pass use during the intervention; and
   focus groups at the conclusion of the intervention. Data compiled from
   the youth surveys will provide a subjective measure of physical activity
   to be used as our outcome measure to address our primary aims.
   Discussion: The results of this study can inform policy-and
   decision-makers about the sub-groups of the population that benefitted
   the most (or least) from the intervention to provide more specific
   information on how to develop and target future interventions to have a
   greater impact on the physical activity levels and overall health of
   children.}},

Abstract = {{Gentiana lutea L subsp. aurantiaca M. Lainz is an endangered plant
   endemic of the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. This subspecies is
   characterized by the colour of its flowers, ranging from orange to
   almost red. Like G. lutea, its roots have been collected for its high
   content in bitter compounds in order to be used mainly in the
   elaboration of bitter spirits and in medicine. HPLC chromatography has
   been used to study the variability in the concentration of bitter
   compounds (secoiridoids glycosides) between the roots of thirty-two wild
   populations of G. lutea subsp. aurantiaca from two areas of the
   Cantabrian Mountains. These concentrations were related to the root
   development, population altitude and edaphic traits. All the populations
   were growing in soils of siliceous origin with very acidic pH (4.2),
   very different to the other subspecies of G. lutea. Statistical analysis
   grouped the populations in two different clusters related to their
   geographical origin. The populations from Laciana, Babia and Omana
   (LBO), regions of traditional collection, grow in soils richer in silt
   at a significantly higher altitude than those from the rest of the
   Cantabrian Mountains, allowing a higher development of the roots and a
   high potential in secoiridoids glycosides. Therefore, the establishment
   of regular cultivation of gentian in locations with the same
   characteristics as LBO regions, it would allow higher secoiridoid
   glycosides yield. So, the best populations could be selected and
   cultivated as a sustainable industrial crop. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Effects of Pre-Natal Vitamin D Supplementation with Partial Correction
   of Vitamin D Deficiency on Early Life Healthcare Utilisation: A
   Randomised Controlled Trial}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Some observational studies have suggested that higher prenatal Vitamin D
   intake may be associated with improved health outcomes in childhood.
   However there have been mixed results in this area with some negative
   studies, especially for effects on atopic and respiratory outcomes. We
   examined the effect of prenatal Vitamin D on healthcare utilisation in
   the first three years of life.
   Methods
   In an ethnically stratified randomised controlled trial conducted at St
   Mary's Hospital London, 180 women at 27 weeks gestation were allocated
   to no Vitamin D, 800 IU ergocalciferol daily until delivery, or a single
   oral bolus of 200,000 IU cholecalciferol. Participants were randomised
   in blocks of 15 using computer-generated numbers and investigators were
   blinded to group assignment. Supplementation increased maternal and cord
   blood 25 (OH) vitamin D concentrations, but levels remained lower than
   current recommendations. Primary health economic outcome was overall
   cost of unscheduled healthcare utilisation in the first three years of
   life as documented in the child's electronic health record. Secondary
   outcomes included cost attributable to: primary and secondary healthcare
   visits, respiratory and atopic complaints, cost in years 1, 2 and 3 of
   life and cost and frequency of prescribed medication. All costs were
   calculated as pounds sterling. Differences between groups were analysed
   using unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney U test, and analysis of variance
   for adjusted analyses.
   Results
   We assessed 99/180 (55\%) complete electronic health records, control (n
   = 31), daily (n = 36) and bolus (n = 32). We found no difference in
   total healthcare utilisation costs between the control and daily (mean

Title = {{Upregulation of NETO2 expression correlates with tumor progression and
   poor prognosis in colorectal carcinoma}},
Journal = {{BMC CANCER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Neuropilin and tolloid-like 2 (NETO2) has been found to be
   overexpressed in different human cancers, but its expression pattern and
   clinical relevance in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) remains unknown.
   Methods: Real-time quantitative PCR, western blot and
   immunohistochemistry analyses were used to analyze the expression of
   NETO2 in CRC clinical samples. The correlation of NETO2 expression with
   clinicopathologic features was estimated in a cohort containing 292
   patients with primary CRC. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards
   regression analyses were used to assess the prognostic value of NETO2
   expression in CRC.
   Results: The expression of NETO2 was frequently upregulated in CRC
   clinical samples at both the mRNA and protein levels, and its
   upregulation was significantly correlated with poor tumor
   differentiation (p = 0.013), advanced local invasion (p = 0.049),
   increased lymph node metastasis (p = 0.009), advanced TNM stage (p =
   0.041) and increased patient death (p = 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis of
   the complete study cohort revealed that patients with high-NETO2 tumors
   had a significantly shorter disease-specific survival (DSS) than those
   with low-NETO2 tumors (p < 0.001). Importantly, high levels of NETO2
   protein predicted poor DSS for patients with early stage tumors (p =
   0.027) and for those with advanced stage tumors (p = 0.020).
   Furthermore, multivariate analyses indicated that increased NETO2
   expression was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for patients
   with early stage tumors (hazard ratio {[}HR] = 1.937, 95 \% CI =
   1.107-3.390, p = 0.021) as well as patients with advanced stage tumors
   (HR = 2.241, 95 \% CI = 1.245-4.035, p = 0.007).
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that NETO2 upregulation could serve as
   a potential biomarker for the prediction of advanced tumor progression
   and unfavorable prognosis in patients with CRC.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Gram positive mycobacteria with a high GC content, such as the
   etiological agent of tuberculosis Mycobacterium tuberculosis, possess an
   outer membrane mainly composed of mycolic acids (MAs), the so-called
   mycomembrane, which is essential for the cell. About thirty genes are
   involved in the biosynthesis of MAs, which include the hadA, hadB and
   hadC genes that encode the dehydratases Fatty Acid Synthase type II
   (FAS-II) known to function as the heterodimers HadA-HadB and HadB-HadC.
   The present study shows that M. smegmatis cells remain viable in the
   absence of either HadA and HadC or both. Inactivation of HadC has a
   dramatic effect on the physiology and fitness of the mutant strains
   whereas that of HadA exacerbates the phenotype of a hadC deletion. The
   hadC mutants exhibit a novel MA profile, display a distinct colony
   morphology, are less aggregated, are impaired for sliding motility and
   biofilm development and are more resistant to detergent. Conversely, the
   hadC mutants are significantly more susceptible to low-and
   high-temperature and to selective toxic compounds, including several
   current anti-tubercular drugs.}},

Title = {{A Network-Based Model of Oncogenic Collaboration for Prediction of Drug
   Sensitivity}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN GENETICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Tumorigenesis is a multi step process, involving the acquisition of
   multiple oncogenic mutations that transform cells, resulting in systemic
   dysregulation that enables proliferation, invasion, and other cancer
   hallmarks. The goal of precision medicine is to identify
   therapeutically-actionable mutations from large-scale omic datasets.
   However, the multiplicity of oncogenes required for transformation,
   known as oncogenic collaboration, makes assigning effective treatments
   difficult. Motivated by this observation, we propose a new type of
   oncogenic collaboration where mutations in genes that interact with an
   oncogene may contribute to the oncogene's deleterious potential, a new
   genomic feature that we term ``surrogate oncogenes.{''} Surrogate
   oncogenes are representatives of these mutated subnetworks that interact
   with oncogenes. By mapping mutations to a protein protein interaction
   network, we determine the significance of the observed distribution
   using permutation based methods. For a panel of 38 breast cancer cell
   lines, we identified a significant number of surrogate oncogenes in
   known oncogenes such as BRCA1 and ESR1, lending credence to this
   approach. In addition, using Random Forest Classifiers, we show that
   these significant surrogate oncogenes predict drug sensitivity for 74
   drugs in the breast cancer cell lines with a mean error rate of 30.9 A.
   Additionally, we show that surrogate oncogenes are predictive of
   survival in patients. The surrogate oncogene framework incorporates
   unique or rare mutations from a single sample, and therefore has the
   potential to integrate patient-unique mutations into drug sensitivity
   predictions, suggesting a new direction in precision medicine and drug
   development. Additionally, we show the prevalence of significant
   surrogate oncogenes in multiple cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas,
   suggesting that surrogate oncogenes may be a useful genomic feature for
   guiding pancancer analyses and assigning therapies across many tissue
   types.}},

Title = {{Do ``Virtual{''} and ``Outpatient{''} Public Health Tuberculosis Clinics
   Perform Equally Well? A Program-Wide Evaluation in Alberta, Canada}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Meeting the challenge of tuberculosis (TB) elimination will require
   adopting new models of delivering patient-centered care customized to
   diverse settings and contexts. In areas of low incidence with cases
   spread out across jurisdictions and large geographic areas, a
   ``virtual{''} model is attractive. However, whether ``virtual{''}
   clinics and telemedicine deliver the same outcomes as face-to-face
   encounters in general and within the sphere of public health in
   particular, is unknown. This evidence is generated here by analyzing
   outcomes between the ``virtual{''} and ``outpatient{''} public health TB
   clinics in Alberta, a province of Western Canada with a large geographic
   area and relatively small population.
   Methods
   In response to the challenge of delivering equitable TB services over
   long distances and to hard to reach communities, Alberta established
   three public health clinics for the delivery of its program: two
   outpatient serving major metropolitan areas, and one virtual serving
   mainly rural areas. The virtual clinic receives paper-based or
   electronic referrals and generates directives which are acted upon by
   local providers. Clinics are staffed by dedicated public health nurses
   and university-based TB physicians. Performance of the two types of
   clinics is compared between the years 2008 and 2012 using 16 case
   management and treatment outcome indicators and 12 contact management
   indicators.
   Findings
   In the outpatient and virtual clinics, respectively, 691 and 150 cases
   and their contacts were managed. Individually and together both types of
   clinics met most performance targets. Compared to outpatient clinics,
   virtual clinic performance was comparable, superior and inferior in 22,
   3, and 3 indicators, respectively.
   Conclusions
   Outpatient and virtual public health TB clinics perform equally well. In
   low incidence settings a combination of the two clinic types has the
   potential to address issues around equitable service delivery and
   declining expertise.}},

Abstract = {{As part of a taxonomic revision of the genus Massonia, we here clarify
   concepts of Massonia echinata, M. latebrosa and M. tenella-all
   frequently misunderstood or reduced to synonymy. We discuss their
   history, biology, habitat preferences and distribution. Our study also
   shows that the current concept of M. echinata, including M. angustifolia
   and M. lanceolata as synonyms, includes two unpublished species which we
   here describe as M. pseudoechinata and M. roggeveldensis. A new
   combination in Massonia is proposed for Haemanthus sessiliflorus.}},

   Wellbeing: A Response Surface Analytical Approach}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Teachers' relationship quality with students has been argued to be an
   important source of teacher wellbeing. Thus, the current study aimed to
   investigate to what extent teachers' relationship closeness toward
   students, combined with attachment security is a resource protecting
   against teacher burnout. Eighty-three elementary school teachers
   reported on their most and least attached student's relationship
   closeness, their attachment security and levels of burnout, as measured
   by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and personal accomplishment.
   Response surface analysis (RSA), enabling researchers to investigate the
   effect of congruence/incongruence of two predictors on an outcome,
   revealed that teachers' depersonalization and emotional exhaustion were
   lowest when they developed homogenous close relationships toward the
   students within their classroom and when teachers in general made
   congruent relationship experiences. No RSA model could be specified for
   personal accomplishment, even though a correlational analysis revealed
   that increasing closeness with students fostered teachers' personal
   accomplishment. Teachers' secure attachment experiences were not
   directly related to burnout, but enhanced their capability to establish
   close relationships toward their students. Findings suggest that
   teachers' relationships toward students are a resource for the teacher's
   wellbeing, which highlights once again the importance of student teacher
   relationships in education.}},

Abstract = {{Antimicrobial-resistant non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) are an important
   cause of infection in Africa, but there is a lack of information on
   their molecular mechanisms of resistance and epidemiology. This study
   contributes to fill this gap through the characterization by
   pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus sequence typing
   (MIST), plasmid profiling and analysis of antibiotic-resistance
   determinants of 94 Salmonella enterica strains isolated from food in
   Morocco. PFGE revealed considerable heterogeneity among the strains,
   showing 32 pulsotypes. MIST of strains representative of the different
   serovars evidenced 13 sequence types (STs), three of which were newly
   identified (ST1694, ST1768 and ST1818) and nine not previously reported
   in Morocco. Thirty-four strains harbored from one to four plasmids, of
   Incl1 group in S. Mbandaka, IncFIIA in S. Typhimurium, IncL/M in S.
   Hadar and S. Blockley. For the first time in Morocco an intact
   Salmonella Genomic Island 1 (SGI1) carrying the resistance genes
   aadA2,floR, tetG, bla(PSE-1) and sul1 was detected in S. Typhimurium
   DT104. In serovar Hadar resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline and
   streptomycin was associated to bla(TEM-1), tetA and strA genes
   respectively, whereas one mutation in gyrA (Asp87Asn) and one in parC
   (Thr54Ser) genes conferred resistance to nalidixic acid. These findings
   improve the information on foodborne Salmonella in Morocco, evidencing
   the presence of MDR strains potentially dangerous to humans, and provide
   useful data for future studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   predictions. The stability and prediction ability of the E-N(T) model
   was evaluated using various common statistical methods such as
   cross-validation, external validation, and Y-randomization test. As

Abstract = {{Erasure-correcting codes, which support local repair of codeword

   this paper studies a class of codes with the following property: any
   small set of codeword symbols can be reconstructed (repaired) from a
   small number of other symbols. This is referred to as cooperative local
   repair. The main contribution of this paper is bounds on the trade-off
   of the minimum distance and the dimension of such codes, as well as
   explicit constructions of families of codes that enable cooperative
   local repair. Some other results regarding cooperative local repair are

Abstract = {{We introduce a new class of Composite Higgs models in which electroweak
   symmetry is broken by a seesaw-like mechanism. If a global symmetry is
   broken sequentially at different scales, two sets of pseudo-Goldstone
   bosons will arise, one set being typically heavier than the other. If
   two Composite Higgs doublets mix, then the mass-squared of the lighter
   state can be driven negative, and induce EWSB. We illustrate with the
   example SO(6) -> SO(5) -> SO(4), and derive an estimate of the light
   Higgs potential. We find that the introduction of an extra scale can
   ease many of the tensions present in conventional Composite Higgs
   models, especially those related to fine-tuning. In particular we find
   that we can significantly raise the upper bound on the mass of the
   elusive top partners.}},

Title = {{Expression Patterns of CREBs in Oocyte Growth and Maturation of Fish}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{In fish, oocyte meiotic maturation is regulated by 17 alpha, 20
   beta-dihydroxy-progesterone through cAMP. To study the role of cAMP
   response element binding protein (CREB) in meiotic maturation, we cloned
   and characterized the expression pattern of CREBs from two fish models,
   the Nile tilapia and catfish. In the Nile tilapia three different CREBs
   were identified where in CREB1 was found in many tissues including
   gonads with abundant expression in testis. CREB2, few amino acids
   shorter than CREB1, was expressed in several tissues with abundant
   expression in ovary. In addition, a 3'UTR variant form, CREB3 was
   exclusively found in ovary. During natural 14-day ovarian cycle of the
   Nile tilapia, CREB1 expression was stable throughout vitellogenesis with
   a sharp decrease on the day of spawning. In contrast, CREB2 remain
   unchanged throughout the ovarian cycle, however elevated in 11-day
   full-grown immature ovarian follicle and after hCG-induction.
   Interestingly, CREB3 expression was induced three folds on the day of
   spawning as well as during hCG-induced oocyte maturation. Based on the
   synergistic expression pattern, CREB1 is likely to control oocyte
   growth, whereas CREB 2 and 3 contribute to oocyte maturation in tilapia
   and the latter seems to be critical. In catfish, a single form of CREB
   showed a maximum expression during spawning phase and hCG-induced
   maturation both in vivo and in vitro augmented CREB expression. These
   results suggest that spatial and temporal expression of CREBs seems to
   be important for final oocyte maturation and may also regulate oocyte
   growth in fish.}},

Title = {{Optimized extraction, composition, antioxidant and antimicrobial
   activities of exo and intracellular polysaccharides from submerged
   culture of Cordyceps cicadae}},
Journal = {{BMC COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Cordyceps cicadae is known as Jin Chan Hua in Traditional
   Chinese Medicine and known to possess different pharmacological
   activities. Presently, it was collected from the wild and isolated.
   Mycelial culture was optimized for extraction of polysaccharides under
   submerged culture conditions. Besides antioxidant, antibacterial
   activities of extracted polysaccharides were tested for first time.
   Methods: Exo-polysaccharides (EPS) and intracellular polysaccharides
   (IPS) production was tested under different factors (medium capacity,
   rotation speed, pH, incubation time, temperature, carbon, nitrogen,
   minerals sources and carbon to nitrogen ratio) by orthogonal experiments
   using one-factor-at-a-time method. Monosaccharides composition of
   polysaccharides produced by C. cicadae was determined using high
   performance liquid chromatography. Antioxidant and antimicrobial
   activities on eight bacterial strains were checked by different standard
   procedures.
   Results: Factors viz., medium capacity, rotation speed, incubation time,
   pH and temperature affected the EPS and IPS production under submerged
   culture conditions. EPS and IPS production was observed to vary with
   different carbon and nitrogen sources as well as C/N ratio. Glucose was
   the major component of polysaccharides (63.10 +/- 4.15 \%). Extracted
   EPS and IPS showed higher antioxidant potential with significant DPPH
   radical scavenging activity, ABTS radical scavenging activity, reducing
   power and iron chelating activity. Antimicrobial activities of EPS and
   IPS varied among the tested bacterial strains. IPS showed slightly
   higher inhibition rate to all the tested bacterial strains as compared
   to EPS. Maximum inhibition zones of IPS (12.9 +/- 0.2 mm) and EPS (12.5
   +/- 0.3 mm) was observed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 10 \% con.
   However, both EPS and IPS fractions showed broad spectrum for all the
   pathogenic microbial strains tested. The MIC of both the extracts ranged
   from 60-100 mg/mL.
   Conclusions: EPS and IPS production from submerged culture of C. cicadae
   with significant antioxidant and antibacterial potential can be enhanced
   with the combination of several factors which can be used for large
   scale industrial fermentation of C. cicadae.}},

Title = {{Effect of Hydrodynamic Interactions on Self-Diffusion of
   Quasi-Two-Dimensional Colloidal Hard Spheres}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{26}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{We compare experimental results from a quasi-two-dimensional colloidal
   hard sphere fluid to a Monte Carlo simulation of hard disks with small
   particle displacements. The experimental short-time self-diffusion
   coefficient D-S scaled by the diffusion coefficient at infinite
   dilution, D-0, strongly depends on the area fraction, pointing to
   significant hydrodynamic interactions at short times in the experiment,
   which are absent in the simulation. In contrast, the area fraction
   dependence of the experimental long-time self-diffusion coefficient
   D-L/D-0 is in quantitative agreement with D-L/D-0 obtained from the
   simulation. This indicates that the reduction in the particle mobility
   at short times due to hydrodynamic interactions does not lead to a
   proportional reduction in the long-time self-diffusion coefficient.
   Furthermore, the quantitative agreement between experiment and
   simulation at long times indicates that hydrodynamic interactions
   effectively do not affect the dependence of D-L/D-0 on the area
   fraction. In light of this, we discuss the link between structure and
   long-time self-diffusion in terms of a configurational excess entropy
   and do not find a simple exponential relation between these quantities
   for all fluid area fractions.}},

Title = {{Geographic body size variation in ectotherms: effects of seasonality on
   an anuran from the southern temperate forest}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Body size variation has played a central role in
   biogeographical research, however, most studies have aimed to describe
   trends rather than search for underlying mechanisms. In order to provide
   a more comprehensive understanding of the causes of intra-specific body
   size variation in ectotherms, we evaluated eight hypotheses proposed in
   the literature to account for geographical body size variation using the
   Darwin's frog (Rhinoderma darwinii), an anuran species widely
   distributed in the temperate forests of South America. Each of the
   evaluated hypotheses predicted a specific relationship between body size
   and environmental variables. The level of support for each of these
   hypotheses was assessed using an information-theoretic approach and
   based on data from 1015 adult frogs obtained from 14 sites across the
   entire distributional range of the species.
   Results: There was strong evidence favouring a single model comprising
   temperature seasonality as the predictor variable. Larger body sizes
   were found in areas of greater seasonality, giving support to the
   ``starvation resistance{''} hypothesis. Considering the known role of
   temperature on ectothermic metabolism, however, we formulated a new,
   non-exclusive hypothesis, termed ``hibernation hypothesis{''}: greater
   seasonality is expected to drive larger body size, since metabolic rate
   is reduced further and longer during colder, longer winters, leading to
   decreased energy depletion during hibernation, improved survival and
   increased longevity (and hence growth). Supporting this, a higher
   post-hibernation body condition in animals from areas of greater
   seasonality was found.
   Conclusions: Despite largely recognized effects of temperature on
   metabolic rate in ectotherms, its importance in determining body size in
   a gradient of seasonality has been largely overlooked so far. Based on
   our results, we present and discuss an alternative mechanism, the
   ``hibernation hypothesis{''}, underlying geographical body size
   variation, which can be helpful to improve our understanding of
   biogeographical patterns in ectotherms.}},

Abstract = {{Cost-efficient nanoparticle carbocatalysts composed of fluorescent oh
   carbon dots (CDs) embedded in carbon matrix were synthesized via
   one-step acid-assisted hydrothermal treatment (200 degrees C) of
   glucose. These as-synthesized CD-based carbocatalysts have excellent
   photoluminescence (PL) properties over a broad range of wavelengths and
   the external visible or NIR irradiation on the carbocatalysts could
   produce electrons to form electron-hole (e(-) -h(+)) pairs on the
   surface of carbocatalysts. These restant electron-hole pairs will react
   with the adsorbed oxidants/reducers on the surface of the CD-based
   carbocatalysts to produce active radicals for reduction of 4-nitrophenol
   and degradation of dye molecules. Moreover, the local temperature
   increase over CD-based carbocatalyst under NIR irradiation can enhance
   the electron transfer rate between the organic molecules and CD-based
   carbocatalysts, thus obviously increase the catalytic activity of the
   CD-based carbo catalyst for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol and the
   degradation of dye molecules. Such a type of CD-based carbocatalysts
   with excellent properties and highly efficient metal-free photocatalytic
   activities is an ideal candidate as photocatalysts for the reduction of

Title = {{Does statin use have a disease modifying effect in symptomatic knee
   osteoarthritis? Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial}},
Journal = {{TRIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major clinical and public health
   problem, with no current medications approved as having disease
   modifying effects. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or ``statins{''}, a
   drug class widely used to prevent cardiovascular events, could
   potentially affect OA progression via a number of mechanisms including
   their effects on lipid metabolism and inflammation. The aim of this
   multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is to
   determine whether atorvastatin reduces the progression of knee
   structural changes and symptoms over 2 years in patients with
   symptomatic knee OA.
   Methods/design: 350 patients with symptomatic knee OA will be recruited
   through the OA Clinical Trial Network (in Melbourne, Hobart and
   Adelaide). They will be randomly allocated to the two arms of the study,
   receiving either 40 mg of atorvastatin or identical placebo once daily
   for 2 years. Magnetic resonance imaging of the knee will be performed at
   baseline and 2 years later. Knee structure, symptoms and function will
   be assessed using validated methods. The primary outcome is annual
   percentage change in knee cartilage volume. Secondary outcomes include
   progression of cartilage defects, bone marrow lesions, knee pain and
   function. The primary analysis will be by intention to treat, but per
   protocol analyses will also be performed.
   Discussion: The study will provide high-quality evidence to address
   whether atorvastatin has a novel disease modifying effect in OA by
   delaying the structural and symptomatic progression of knee OA. Thus,
   the trial has major public health and clinical importance, as if found
   to be beneficial, atorvastatin could produce substantial cost savings by
   delaying and possibly reducing the need for joint replacement surgery,
   and provide marked improvements in quality of life for people with OA.}},

Abstract = {{Treatment of carotid artery stenosis decreases the long-term risk of
   stroke and may enhance cerebral blood flow. It is therefore expected to
   have the potential to prevent cognitive decline or even improve
   cognition over the long-term. However, intervention itself can cause
   peri-interventional cerebral infarcts, possibly resulting in a decline
   of cognitive performance, at least for a short time. We investigated the
   long-term effects of three treatment methods on cognition and the
   emotional state one year after intervention.
   In this prospective observational cohort study, 58 patients with
   extracranial carotid artery stenosis (>= 70\%) underwent magnetic
   resonance imaging and assessment of cognition, mood and motor speed
   before carotid endarterectomy (n = 20), carotid stenting (n = 10) or
   best medical treatment (n = 28) (i.e., time-point 1 {[}TP1]), and at
   one-year follow-up (TP2). Gain scores, reflecting cognitive change after
   treatment, were built according to performance as (TP2 -TP1)/TP1.
   Independent of the treatment type, significant improvement in frontal
   lobe functions, visual memory and motor speed was found. Performance
   level, motor speed and mood at TP1 were negatively correlated with gain
   scores, with greater improvement in patients with low performance before
   treatment.
   Active therapy, whether conservative or interventional, produces
   significant improvement of frontal lobe functions and memory in patients
   with carotid artery disease, independent of treatment type. This effect
   was particularly pronounced in patients with low cognitive performance
   prior to treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Hibernation is one type of torpor, a hypometabolic state in
   heterothermic mammals, which can be used as an energy-conservation
   strategy in response to harsh environments, e.g. limited food resource.
   The liver, in particular, plays a crucial role in adaptive metabolic
   adjustment during hibernation. Studies on ground squirrels and bears
   reveal that many genes involved in metabolism are differentially
   expressed during hibernation. Especially, the genes involved in
   carbohydrate catabolism are down-regulated during hibernation, while
   genes responsible for lipid beta-oxidation are up-regulated. However,
   there is little transcriptional evidence to suggest physiological
   changes to the liver during hibernation in the greater horseshoe bat, a
   representative heterothermic bat. In this study, we explored the
   transcriptional changes in the livers of active and torpid greater
   horseshoe bats using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. A total of 1358
   genes were identified as differentially expressed during torpor. In the
   functional analyses, differentially expressed genes were mainly involved
   in metabolic depression, shifts in the fuel utilization, immune function
   and response to stresses. Our findings provide a comprehensive evidence
   of differential gene expression in the livers of greater horseshoe bats
   during active and torpid states and highlight potential evidence for
   physiological adaptations that occur in the liver during hibernation.}},

Abstract = {{Amorphous SnO2 (a-SnO2) thin films were conformally coated onto the
   surface of reduced graphene oxide (G) using atomic layer deposition
   (ALD). The electrochemical characteristics of the a-SnO2/G
   nanocomposites were then determined using cyclic voltammetry and
   galvanostatic charge/discharge curves. Because the SnO2 ALD films were
   ultrathin and amorphous, the impact of the large volume expansion of
   SnO2 upon cycling was greatly reduced. With as few as five formation
   cycles best reported in the literature, a-SnO2/G nanocomposites reached
   stable capacities of 800 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) and 450 mAh g 1000 mA
   g(-1). The capacity from a-SnO2 is higher than the bulk theoretical
   values. The extra capacity is attributed to additional interfacial
   charge storage resulting from the high surface area of the a-SnO2/G
   nanocomposites. These results demonstrate that metal oxide ALD on high
   surface area conducting carbon substrates can be used to fabricate high
   power and high capacity electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a genetic condition
   characterized by distinctive facial features, moderate to severe
   intellectual disability, developmental delay and multiple congenital
   anomalies. MWS is caused by heterozygous mutations or deletions of the
   ZEB2 gene located on chromosome 2q22.3. At present, over 190 cases with
   mutations and deletions involving the ZEB2 gene have been reported, but
   triplication or duplication of reciprocal region of Mowat-Wilson
   syndrome has never been reported.
   Case Presentation: Here we report a 2-year-2-month-old boy carrying a de
   novo 2.9 Mb complex copy number gain at 2q22.3 involving triplication of
   ZEB2 gene. The boy is characterized by intrauterine growth retardation,
   hypotonia, cognitive impairment, multiple congenital anomalies and
   behavioral abnormalities.
   Conclusion: This case provides evidence that triplication of ZEB2 gene
   may be clinical significance and ZEB2 gene is likely to be a dosage
   sensitive gene.}},

Abstract = {{Energy flow and sequestration at the state-to-state level are
   investigated for a prototypical four-atom reaction, H-2 + OH -> H + H2O,
   using a transition-state wave packet (TSWP) method. The product state
   distribution is found to depend strongly on the reactant vibrational
   excitation, indicating mode specificity at the state-to-state level.
   From a local-mode perspective, it is shown that the vibrational
   excitation of the H2O product derives from two different sources, one
   attributable to the energy flow along the reaction coordinate into the
   newly formed OH bond and the other due to the sequestration of the
   vibrational energy in the OH spectator moiety during the reaction. The
   analysis provided a unified interpretation of some seemingly
   contradicting experimental observations. It is further shown that the
   transfer of vibrational energy from the OH reactant to H2O product is
   gated by the transition state, accomplished. coherently by multiple
   TSWPs with the corresponding OH vibrational excitation.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{The process of cryopreservation results in high concentration of
   reactive oxygen species which is detrimental to spermatozoa. The aim of
   this study was to investigate whether addition of vitamin E analogue to
   freezing extender can facilitate the cryosurvival of spermatozoa in
   rabbits, and how vitamin E protects spermatozoa against damages during
   the process of preservation. Freshly ejaculated semen was diluted with
   Tris-citrate-glucose extender supplemented with different concentrations
   of Trolox (a vitamin E analogue). The level of radical oxygen species
   (ROS) in spermatozoa that was exposed to Trolox was significantly lower
   than that of the control during each step of the process of
   preservation. The percentage of frozen-thawed spermatozoa with lipid
   peroxidation in the Trolox treatments was significantly lower than that
   of the control. The motility, intact acrosome, membrane integrity and
   mitochondrial potentials of the frozen-thawed spermatozoa in the
   treatment of 200 mu M Trolox were significantly higher than those of the
   control. These observations suggest that addition of vitamin E to a
   freezing extender leads to higher integrity of acrosome, plasma membrane
   and mitochondrial membrane potential as well as higher motility. Vitamin
   E protects spermatozoa through its capacity to quench ROS accumulation
   and lipid peroxidation during the process of preservation. Addition of
   Trolox is recommended to facilitate the improvement of semen
   preservation for the rabbit breeding industry.}},

   we characterize the shape of loop quantum cosmology corrections to
   observable quantities across this parameter space. Our analysis provides
   a framework to contrast more accurately the theory with forthcoming

   other observables beyond the power spectra, such as non-Gaussianity.}},

Title = {{Vital Signs Directed Therapy: Improving Care in an Intensive Care Unit
   in a Low-Income Country}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Global Critical Care is attracting increasing attention. At several
   million deaths per year, the worldwide burden of critical illness is
   greater than generally appreciated. Low income countries (LICs) have a
   disproportionally greater share of critical illness, and yet critical
   care facilities are scarce in such settings. Routines utilizing abnormal
   vital signs to identify critical illness and trigger medical
   interventions have become common in high-income countries but have not
   been investigated in LICs. The aim of the study was to assess whether
   the introduction of a vital signs directed therapy protocol improved
   acute care and reduced mortality in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in
   Tanzania.
   Methods and Findings
   Prospective, before-and-after interventional study in the ICU of a
   university hospital in Tanzania. A context-appropriate protocol that
   defined danger levels of severely abnormal vital signs and stipulated
   acute treatment responses was implemented in a four week period using
   sensitisation, training, job aids, supervision and feedback. Acute
   treatment of danger signs at admission and during care in the ICU and
   in-hospital mortality were compared pre and post-implementation using
   regression models. Danger signs from 447 patients were included: 269
   pre-implementation and 178 post-implementation. Acute treatment of
   danger signs was higher post-implementation (at admission: 72.9\% vs
   23.1\%, p<0.001; in ICU: 16.6\% vs 2.9\%, p<0.001). A danger sign was
   five times more likely to be treated post-implementation (Prevalence
   Ratio (PR) 4.9 (2.9-8.3)). Intravenous fluids were given in response to
   35.0\% of hypotensive episodes post-implementation, as compared to 4.1\%
   pre-implementation (PR 6.4 (2.5-16.2)). In patients admitted with
   hypotension, mortality was lower post-implementation (69.2\% vs 92.3\% p
   = 0.02) giving a numbers-needed-to-treat of 4.3. Overall in-hospital
   mortality rates were unchanged (49.4\% vs 49.8\%, p = 0.94).
   Conclusion
   The introduction of a vital signs directed therapy protocol improved the
   acute treatment of abnormal vital signs in an ICU in a low-income
   country. Mortality rates were reduced for patients with hypotension at
   admission but not for all patients.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive experimental study on the interaction between the
   PEO-PPO-PEO block copolymer P123 (EO20PO68EO20) and the anionic bile
   salt sodium glycodeoxycholate (NaGDC) in water has been performed. The
   work was aimed at investigating the suitability of using P123 as bile
   salt sequestrant beside the fundamental aspects of PEO-PPO-PEO block
   copolymer-bile salt interactions. Various experimental techniques
   including dynamic and static light scattering, small-angle X-ray
   scattering, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were employed in
   combination with electrophoretic mobility measurements. The system was
   investigated at a constant P123 concentration of 1.74 mM and with
   varying bile salt concentrations up to approximately 250 mM NaGDC (or a
   molar ratio n(NaGDC)/n(P123) = 144). In the mixed P123-NaGDC solutions,
   the endothermic process related to the self-assembly of P123 was
   observed to gradually decrease in enthalpy and shift to higher
   temperatures upon progressive addition of NaGDC. To explain this effect,
   the formation of NaGDC micelles carrying partly dehydrated P123 unimers
   was proposed and translated into a stoichiometric model, which was able
   to fit the experimental DSC data. In the mixtures at low molar ratios,
   NaGDC monomers associated with the P123 micelle forming a charged ``P123
   micelle-NaGDC{''} complex with a dehydrated PPO core. These complexes
   disintegrated upon increasing NaGDC concentration to form small
   ``NaGDC-P123{''} complexes visualized as bile salt micelles including
   one or a few P123 copolymer chains.}},

Title = {{A cross-sectional controlled developmental study of neuropsychological
   functions in patients with glutaric aciduria type I}},
Journal = {{ORPHANET JOURNAL OF RARE DISEASES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Glutaric aciduria type I (GA-I) is an inherited metabolic
   disease due to deficiency of glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH).
   Cognitive functions are generally thought to be spared, but have not yet
   been studied in detail.
   Methods: Thirty patients detected by newborn screening (n = 13),
   high-risk screening (n = 3) or targeted metabolic testing (n = 14) were
   studied for simple reaction time (SRT), continuous performance (CP),
   visual working memory (VWM), visual-motor coordination (Tracking) and
   visual search (VS). Dystonia (n = 13 patients) was categorized using the
   Barry-Albright-Dystonia Scale (BADS). Patients were compared with 196
   healthy controls. Developmental functions of cognitive performances were
   analysed using a negative exponential function model.
   Results: BADS scores correlated with speed tests but not with tests
   measuring stability or higher cognitive functions without time
   constraints. Developmental functions of GA-I patients significantly
   differed from controls for SRT and VS but not for VWM and showed obvious
   trends for CP and Tracking. Dystonic patients were slower in SRT and CP
   but reached their asymptote of performance similar to asymptomatic
   patients and controls in all tests. Asymptomatic patients did not differ
   from controls, except showing significantly better results in Tracking
   and a trend for slower reactions in visual search. Data across all age
   groups of patients and controls fitted well to a model of negative
   exponential development.
   Conclusions: Dystonic patients predominantly showed motor speed
   impairment, whereas performance improved with higher cognitive load.
   Patients without motor symptoms did not differ from controls.
   Developmental functions of cognitive performances were similar in
   patients and controls. Performance in tests with higher cognitive demand
   might be preserved in GA-I, even in patients with striatal degeneration.}},

Abstract = {{In breast cancer it has been proposed that the presence of cancer stem
   cells may drive tumor initiation, progression and recurrences. IL-8,
   up-regulated in breast cancer, and associated with poor prognosis,
   increases CSC self-renewal in cell line models. It signals via two cell
   surface receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2. Recently, the IL-8/CXCR1 axis was
   proposed as an attractive pathway for the design of specific therapies
   against breast cancer stem cells. Reparixin, a powerful CXCR1 inhibitor,
   was effective in reducing in vivo the tumour-initiating population in
   several NOD/SCID mice breast cancer models, showing that the selective
   targeting of CXCR1 and the combination of reparixin and docetaxel
   resulted in a concomitant reduction of the bulk tumour mass and CSC
   population. The available data indicate that IL-8, expressed by tumour
   cells and induced by chemotherapeutic treatment, is a key regulator of
   the survival and self-renewal of the population of CXCR1-expressing CSC.
   Consequently, this investigation on the mechanism of action of the
   reparixin/paclitaxel combination, was based on the observation that
   reparixin treatment contained the formation of metastases in several
   experimental models. However, specific data on the formation of breast
   cancer brain metastases, which carry remarkable morbidity and mortality
   to a substantial proportion of advanced breast cancer patients, have not
   been generated. The obtained data indicate a beneficial use of the drug
   combination reparixin and paclitaxel to counteract brain tumour
   metastasis due to CSC, probably due to the combined effects of the two
   drugs, the pro-apoptotic action of paclitaxel and the cytostatic and
   anti-migratory effects of reparixin.}},

Abstract = {{Surface plasmon resonances of optical bowtie nanoantennas with symmetry
   breaking are studied numerically using the finite-element method.
   Beginning with both x-axial and y-axial symmetry, bowtie structures are
   reshaped by varying two parameters (edge lengths and bow angles) to
   create various symmetries to achieve controllable resonant modes and gap
   enhancement in the visible and infrared wavelength range. The four
   edges' coupling is the main factor contributing to the final fundamental
   resonances. Double fundamental resonances can be achieved in bowtie
   structures with x-axial or y-axial symmetry. These properties can guide
   both the engineering and the fabrication of plasmonic nanoantennas. (C)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{We perform a general analysis of axionic dark radiation produced from
   the decay of the lightest modulus in the sequestered LARGE Volume
   Scenario. We discuss several cases depending on the form of the Kahler
   metric for visible sector matter fields and the mechanism responsible
   for achieving a de Sitter vacuum. The leading decay channels which
   determine dark radiation predictions are to hidden sector axions,
   visible sector Higgses and SUSY scalars depending on their mass. We show
   that in most of the parameter space of split SUSY-like models squarks
   and sleptons are heavier than the lightest modulus. Hence dark radiation
   predictions previously obtained for MSSM-like cases hold more generally
   also for split SUSY-like cases since the decay channel to SUSY scalars
   is kinematically forbidden. However the inclusion of string loop
   corrections to the Kahler potential gives rise to a parameter space
   region where the decay channel to SUSY scalars opens up, leading to a
   significant reduction of dark radiation production. In this case, the
   simplest model with a shift-symmetric Higgs sector can suppress the
   excess of dark radiation Delta N-eff to values as small as 0.14, in
   perfect agreement with current experimental bounds. Depending on the
   exact mass of the SUSY scalars all values in the range 0.14 less than or
   similar to Delta N-eff less than or similar to 1.6 are allowed.
   Interestingly dark radiation overproduction can be avoided also in the
   absence of a Giudice-Masiero coupling.}},

Abstract = {{Plasmodium parasites are the causative agent of human malaria, and the
   development of a highly effective vaccine against infection, disease and
   transmission remains a key priority. It is widely established that
   multiple stages of the parasite's complex lifecycle within the human
   host and mosquito vector are susceptible to vaccine-induced antibodies.
   The mainstay approach to antibody induction by subunit vaccination has
   been the delivery of protein antigen formulated in adjuvant. Extensive
   efforts have been made in this endeavor with respect to malaria vaccine
   development, especially with regard to target antigen discovery, protein
   expression platforms, adjuvant testing, and development of soluble and
   virus-like particle (VLP) delivery platforms. The breadth of approaches
   to protein-based vaccines is continuing to expand as innovative new
   concepts in next-generation subunit design are explored, with the
   prospects for the development of a highly effective
   multi-component/multi-stage/multi-antigen formulation seeming ever more
   likely. This review will focus on recent progress in protein vaccine
   design, development and/or clinical testing for a number of leading
   malaria antigens from the sporozoite-, merozoite- and sexual-stages of
   the parasite's lifecycle-including PfCeITOS, PfMSP1, PfAMA1, PfRH5,
   PfSERA5, PfGLURP, PfMSP3, Pfs48/45 and Pfs25. Future prospects and
   challenges for the development, production, human delivery and
   assessment of protein-based malaria vaccines are discussed. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{Viral vectors used in heterologous prime-boost regimens are one of very
   few vaccination approaches that have yielded significant protection
   against controlled human malaria infections. Recently, protection
   induced by chimpanzee adenovirus priming and modified vaccinia Ankara
   boosting using the ME-TRAP insert has been correlated with the induction
   of potent CD8(+) T cell responses. This regimen has progressed to field
   studies where efficacy against infection has now been reported. The same
   vectors have been used pre-clinically to identify preferred protective
   antigens for use in vaccines against the pre-erythrocytic, blood-stage
   and mosquito stages of malaria and this work is reviewed here for the
   first time. Such antigen screening has led to the prioritization of the
   PfRH5 blood-stage antigen, which showed efficacy against heterologous
   strain challenge in non-human primates, and vectors encoding this
   antigen are in clinical trials. This, along with the high
   transmission-blocking activity of some sexual-stage antigens,
   illustrates well the capacity of such vectors to induce high titre
   protective antibodies in addition to potent T cell responses. All of the
   protective responses induced by these vectors exceed the levels of the
   same immune responses induced by natural exposure supporting the view
   that, for subunit vaccines to achieve even partial efficacy in humans,
   ``unnatural immunity{''} comprising immune responses of very high
   magnitude will need to be induced. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Title = {{A Simple and Fast Kinetic Assay for the Determination of Fructan
   Exohydrolase Activity in Perennial Ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.)}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{Despite the fact that fructans are the main constituent of water-soluble
   carbohydrates in forage grasses and cereal crops of temperate climates,
   little knowledge is available on the regulation of the enzymes involved
   in fructan metabolism. The analysis of enzyme activities involved in
   this process has been hampered by the low affinity of the fructan
   enzymes for sucrose and fructans used as fructosyl donor. Further, the
   analysis of fructan composition and enzyme activities is restricted to
   specialized labs with access to suited HPLG equipment and appropriate
   fructan standards. The degradation of fructan polymers with high degree
   of polymerization (DP) by fructan exohydrolases (FEHs) to
   fructosyloligomers is important to liberate energy in the form of
   fructan, but also under conditions where the generation of low DP
   polymers is required. Based on published protocols employing enzyme
   coupled endpoint reactions in single cuvettes, we developed a simple and
   fast kinetic 1-FEH assay. This assay can be performed in multi-well
   plate format using plate readers to determine the activity of 1-FEH
   against 1-kestotriose, resulting in a significant time reduction.
   Kinetic assays allow an optimal and more precise determination of enzyme
   activities compared to endpoint assays, and enable to check the quality
   of any reaction with respect to linearity of the assay. The enzyme
   coupled kinetic 1-FEH assay was validated in a case study showing the
   expected increase in 1-FEH activity during cold treatment. This assay is
   cost effective and could be performed by any lab with access to a plate
   reader suited for kinetic measurements and readings at 340 nm, and is
   highly suited to assess temporal changes and relative differences in
   1-FEH activities. Thus, this enzyme coupled kinetic 1-FEH assay is of
   high importance both to the field of basic fructan research and plant
   breeding.}},

Abstract = {{By a combination of first-principles calculations and semiclassical
   Boltzmann transport theory, we investigate the effect of epitaxial
   strain on the electronic structure and transport properties of PtCoO2

   systems, we predict for PtCoO2 a high sensitivity of the out-of-plane
   transport properties to strain, which is not present in PdCoO2. At
   ambient temperature we identify a considerable absolute change in the
   thermopower from -107 mu V/K at -5\% compressive strain to -303 mu V/K
   at +5\% tensile strain. This remarkable response is related to distinct
   changes of the Fermi surface, which involve the crossing of two
   additional bands at a moderate compressive in-plane strain. Combining
   our transport results with available experimental data on electrical and
   lattice thermal conductivity we predict a thermoelectric figure of merit
   of up to ZT = 0.25 at T = 600 K for strained PtCoO2.}},

Abstract = {{We report that the hydrogenation of a single crystal 2H-MoS2 induces a
   novel-intermediate phase between 2H and 1T phases on its surface, i.e.,
   the large-area, uniform, robust, and surface array of atomic stripes
   through the intralayer atomic-plane gliding. The total energy
   calculations confirm that the hydrogenation-induced atomic stripes are
   energetically most stable on the MoS2 surface between the semiconducting
   2H and metallic 1T phase. Furthermore, the electronic states associated
   with the hydrogen ions, which is bonded to sulfur anions on both sides
   of the MoS2 surface layer, appear in the vicinity of the Fermi level
   (E-F) and reduces the band gap. This is promising in developing the
   monolayer-based field-effect transistor or vanishing the Schottky
   barrier for practical applications.}},

Abstract = {{We carry out experimental and numerical studies to investigate the
   collapse and breakup of finite size, nano- and microscale, liquid metal
   filaments supported on a substrate. We find the critical dimensions
   below which filaments do not break up but rather collapse to a single
   droplet. The transition from collapse to breakup can be described as a
   competition between two fluid dynamic phenomena: the capillary driven
   end retraction and the Rayleigh Plateau type instability mechanism that
   drives the breakup. We focus on the unique spatial and temporal
   transition region between these two phenomena using patterned metallic
   thin film strips and pulsed-laser-induced dewetting. The experimental
   results are compared to an analytical model proposed by Driessen et al.
   and modified to include substrate interactions. In addition, we report
   the results of numerical simulations based on a volume-of-fluid method
   to provide additional insight and highlight the importance of liquid
   metal resolidification, which reduces inertial effects.}},

Abstract = {{Living organisms display a spectrum of wondrous colors, which can be
   produced by pigmentation, structural coloration, or a combination of the
   two. A relatively well-studied system, which produces colors via an
   array of alternating anhydrous guanine crystals and cytoplasm, is
   responsible for the metallic luster of many fish. The structure of
   biogenic anhydrous guanine was so far believed to be the same as that of
   the synthetic one, a monoclinic polymorph (denoted as alpha). Here we
   re-examine the structure of biogenic guanine, using detailed
   experimental X-ray and electron diffraction data, exposing troublesome
   inconsistencies, namely, a ``guanigma{''}. To address this, we sought
   alternative candidate polymorphs using symmetry and packing
   considerations and then utilized first-principles calculations to
   determine whether the selected candidates could be energetically stable.
   We identified theoretically a different monoclinic polymorph (denoted as
   beta), were able to synthesize it, and confirmed using X-ray diffraction
   that it is this polymorph that occurs in biogenic samples. However, the
   electron diffraction data were still not consistent with this polymorph
   but rather with a theoretically generated orthorhombic polymorph
   (denoted as gamma). This apparent inconsistency was resolved by showing
   how the electron diffraction pattern could be affected by crystal
   structural faults composed of offset molecular layers.}},

Abstract = {{The segregation of DNA before cell division is essential for faithful
   genetic inheritance. In many bacteria, segregation of low-copy number
   plasmids involves an active partition system composed of a nonspecific
   DNA-binding ATPase, ParA, and its stimulator protein ParB. The ParA/ParB
   system drives directed and persistent movement of DNA cargo both in vivo
   and in vitro. Filament-based models akin to actin/microtubule-driven
   motility were proposed for plasmid segregation mediated by ParA. Recent
   experiments challenge this view and suggest that ParA/ParB system
   motility is driven by a diffusion ratchet mechanism in which ParB-coated
   plasmid both creates and follows a ParA gradient on the nucleoid
   surface. However, the detailed mechanism of ParA/ParB-mediated directed
   and persistent movement remains unknown. Here, we develop a theoretical
   model describing ParA/ParB-mediated motility. We show that the ParA/ParB
   system can work as a Brownian ratchet, which effectively couples the
   ATPase-dependent cycling of ParA-nucleoid affinity to the motion of the
   ParB-bound cargo. Paradoxically, this resulting processive motion relies
   on quenching diffusive plasmid motion through a large number of
   transient ParA/ParB-mediated tethers to the nucleoid surface. Our work
   thus sheds light on an emergent phenomenon in which nonmotor proteins
   work collectively via mechanochemical coupling to propel cargos-an
   ingenious solution shaped by evolution to cope with the lack of
   processive motor proteins in bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{There are deep, yet largely unexplored, connections between computer
   science and biology. Both disciplines examine how information
   proliferates in time and space. Central results in computer science
   describe the complexity of algorithms that solve certain classes of
   problems. An algorithm is deemed efficient if it can solve a problem in
   polynomial time, which means the running time of the algorithm is a
   polynomial function of the length of the input. There are classes of
   harder problems for which the fastest possible algorithm requires
   exponential time. Another criterion is the space requirement of the
   algorithm. There is a crucial distinction between algorithms that can
   find a solution, verify a solution, or list several distinct solutions
   in given time and space. The complexity hierarchy that is generated in
   this way is the foundation of theoretical computer science. Precise
   complexity results can be notoriously difficult. The famous question
   whether polynomial time equals nondeterministic polynomial time (i.e., P
   = NP) is one of the hardest open problems in computer science and all of
   mathematics. Here, we consider simple processes of ecological and
   evolutionary spatial dynamics. The basic question is: What is the
   probability that a new invader (or a new mutant) will take over a
   resident population? We derive precise complexity results for a variety
   of scenarios. We therefore show that some fundamental questions in this
   area cannot be answered by simple equations (assuming that P is not
   equal to NP).}},

   illumination}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{Illumination can have adverse effects on live cells. However, many
   experiments, e.g. traction force microscopy, rely on fluorescence
   microscopy. Current methods to assess undesired photo-induced cell
   changes rely on qualitative observation of changes in cell morphology.
   Here we utilize a quantitative technique to identify the effect of light
   on cell contractility prior to morphological changes. Fibroblasts were
   cultured on soft elastic hydrogels embedded with fluorescent beads. The
   adherent cells generated contractile forces that deform the substrate.
   Beads were used as fiducial markers to quantify the substrate
   deformation over time, which serves as a measure of cell force dynamics.
   We find that cells exposed to moderate fluorescence illumination (lambda
   = 540-585 nm, I = 12.5 W/m(2), duration = 60 s) exhibit rapid force
   relaxation. Strikingly, cells exhibit force relaxation after only 2 s of
   exposure, suggesting that photo-induced relaxation occurs nearly
   immediately. Evidence of photo-induced morphological changes were not
   observed for 15-30 min after illumination. Force relaxation and
   morphological changes were found to depend on wavelength and intensity
   of excitation light. This study demonstrates that changes in cell
   contractility reveal evidence of a photo-induced cell response long
   before any morphological cues.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate a particular version of the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) NMSSM
   characterized by an economical and rigidly hierarchical flavor structure
   and based on flavored gauge mediation and on some considerations
   inspired by string theory GUTs. In this way we can express the
   Lagrangian of the PQ NMSSM through very few parameters. The obtained
   model is studied numerically and confronted with the most relevant
   phenomenological constraints. We show that typical spectra are for the
   most part too heavy to be significantly probed at the LHC, but regions
   of the parameter space exist yielding signatures that might possibly be
   observed during Run II. We also calculate the fine tuning of the model.
   We show that, in spite of the appearance of large scales in the
   superpotential and soft terms, it does not exceed the tuning present in
   the MSSM for equivalent spectra, which is of the order of 10(4).}},

Abstract = {{In this work we present a combined analysis of small-angle neutron
   scattering, linear rheology and pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic
   resonance spectroscopy experiments on the supramolecular association and
   chain structure of well-defined telechelically modified poly(ethylene
   glycol) (PEG) in the bulk. Oligomeric PEG was functionalized with
   directed heterocomplementary hydrogen-bonding end-groups, thymine (Thy)
   and diaminotriazine (DAT). The polarity of the backbone polymer is
   comparable to the end groups and avoids clustering of the groups basing
   on energetic arguments. Their linear association behavior in the ideal
   melt state was investigated on the microscopic/molecular level as a
   function of temperature. By means of a selective labeling scheme, which
   should ideally lead to the formation of alternating
   hydrogeneous-deuterated building block sequences if the hydrogen bonding
   reaction is exclusively heterocomplementary, we showed that the Thy DAT
   association is dominant and a Thy Thy homoassociation is approximately
   three times less probable. Latter nondirected association gives rise to
   a considerable amount of random-copolymerization without affecting
   seriously neither the macroscopic melt viscosity nor the diffusivity of
   the supramolecular associates. From the q-dependence of a multiblock RPA
   structure factor, the linear association in the melt is confirmed.
   Furthermore, this diffusion and viscosity study reveals simple Rouse
   dynamics of supramolecular polymer chains with molecular weight much
   larger than the entanglement mass Me. The Rouse-like dynamics of long
   supramolecular chains indicates short lifetime hydrogen bonds of the end
   groups. Our results are in excellent agreement with the related
   polycondensation theory.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Dense genetic maps, along with quantitative trait loci (QTLs) detected
   on such maps, are powerful tools for genomics and molecular breeding
   studies. In the important woody genus Eucalyptus, the recent release of
   E. grandis genome sequence allows for sequence-based genomic comparison
   and searching for positional candidate genes within QTL regions. Here,
   dense genetic maps were constructed for E. urophylla and E. tereticornis
   using genomic simple sequence repeats (SSR), expressed sequence tag
   (EST) derived SSR, EST-derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence
   (EST-CAPS), and diversity arrays technology (DArT) markers. The E.
   urophylla and E. tereticornis maps comprised 700 and 585 markers across
   11 linkage groups, totaling at 1,208.2 and 1,241.4 cM in length,
   respectively. Extensive synteny and colinearity were observed as
   compared to three earlier DArT-based eucalypt maps (two maps with E.
   grandis x E. urophylla and one map of E. globulus) and with the E.
   grandis genome sequence. Fifty-three QTLs for growth (10-56 months of
   age) and wood density (56 months) were identified in 22 discrete regions
   on both maps, in which only one colocalizaiton was found between growth
   and wood density. Novel QTLs were revealed as compared with those
   previously detected on DArT-based maps for similar ages in Eucalyptus.
   Eleven to 585 positional candidate genes were obained for a 56-month-old
   QTL through aligning QTL confidence interval with the E. grandis genome.
   These results will assist in comparative genomics studies, targeted gene
   characterization, and marker-assisted selection in Eucalyptus and the
   related taxa.}},

Title = {{Prevalence of Isolated Diastolic Hypertension and Associated Risk
   Factors among Different Ethnicity Groups in Xinjiang, China}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{Objectives
   Little is known about isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH) among
   different ethnicity groups. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and
   risk factors for IDH among the major ethnicity population i.e. Han,
   Uygur and Kazakh in Xinjiang, northwestern part of China.
   Methods
   In total, 14,618 adult participants (7,799 males, 6,819 females) were
   recruited from the Cardiovascular Risk Survey conducted during 2007 and
   2010. Blood pressure, body mass index and standard lipid profile and
   fasting glucose level from plasma were measured.
   Results
   The overall prevalence of IDH was 10.8\% in the Han, 4.5\% in the Uygur
   and 8.7\% in the Kazakh populations. When stratified by gender, IDH
   prevalence was 9.8\% in men and 6.8\% in women (P<0.001). The prevalence
   of IDH also varied significantly with age and it was highest in those
   aged 35-44 yrs old (9.7\%) and lowest in those over 75 yrs old (4.1\%,
   P<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that
   overweight (OR = 1.179, 95\% CI: 1.015-1.369) or obesity (OR = 1.202,
   95\% CI: 1.015-1.424), smoking (OR = 1.362, 95\% CI: 1.156-1.604) and
   high total cholesterol (TC) hyperlipidemia (OR = 1.237, 95\% CI:
   1.074-1.423) were significantly associated with a higher prevalence of
   IDH. Identified risk factors for IDH differed among ethnicity groups
   with male gender, young age (35-44 yrs old), more coffee or tea
   consumption and high TC hyperlipidemia in the Han; smoking and often
   coffee or tea consumption in the Uygur and male gender and overweight or
   obesity in the Kazakh populations.
   Conclusions
   IDH prevalence in the Han population is higher than that in the Uygur
   and Kazak populations in Xinjiang, northwestern part of China. Male
   gender, middle age, overweight or obesity, smoking and high TC
   hyperlipidemia appear to be relevant risk factors of IDH in adults.
   Different ethnicity background had different sets of risk factors for
   IDH.}},

Abstract = {{B-cell receptor (BCR) and JAK/STAT pathways play critical roles in
   diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Herein, we investigated the
   anti-lymphoma activity of cerdulatinib, a novel compound that dually
   targets SYK and JAK/STAT pathways. On a tissue microarray of 62 primary
   DLBCL tumors, 58\% expressed either phosphorylated SYK or STAT3 or both.
   SYK and STAT3 are also phosphorylated in a panel of eleven DLBCL cell
   lines although ABC and GCB subtypes exhibited different JAK/STAT and BCR
   signaling profiles. In both ABC and GCB cell lines, cerdulatinib induced
   apoptosis that was associated with caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. The
   compound also blocked Gl/S transition and caused cell cycle arrest,
   accompanied by inhibition of RB phosphorylation and down-regulation of
   cyclin E. Phosphorylation of BCR components and STAT3 was sensitive to
   cerdulatinib in both ABC and GCB cell lines under stimulated conditions.
   Importantly, JAK/STAT and BCR signaling can be blocked by cerdulatinib
   in primary GCB and non-GCB DLBCL tumor cells that were accompanied by
   cell death. Our work provides mechanistic insights into the actions of
   cerdulatinib, suggesting that the drug has a broad anti-tumor activity
   in both ABC and GCB DLBCL, at least in part by inhibiting SYK and JAK
   pathways.}},

Title = {{Differential Response of Acidobacteria Subgroups to Forest-to-Pasture
   Conversion and Their Biogeographic Patterns in the Western Brazilian
   Amazon}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Members of the phylum Acidobacteria are among the most abundant soil
   bacteria on Earth, but little is known about their response to
   environmental changes. We asked how the relative abundance and
   biogeographic patterning of this phylum and its subgroups responded to
   forest-to-pasture conversion in soils of the western Brazilian Amazon.
   Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes was employed to assess the abundance
   and composition of the Acidobacteria community across 54 soil samples
   taken using a spatially nested sampling scheme at the landscape level.
   Numerically, Acidobacteria represented 20\% of the total bacterial
   community in forest soils and 11\% in pasture soils. Overall, 15
   different Acidobacteria subgroups of the current 26 subgroups were
   detected, with Acidobacteria subgroups 1, 3, 5, and 6 accounting
   together for 87\% of the total Acidobacteria community in forest soils
   and 75\% in pasture soils. Concomitant with changes in soil chemistry
   after forest-to-pasture conversion particularly an increase in
   properties linked to soil acidity and nutrient availability we observed
   an increase in the relative abundances of Acidobacteria subgroups 4, 10,
   17, and 18, and a decrease in the relative abundances of other
   Acidobacteria subgroups in pasture relative to forest soils. The
   composition of the total Acidobacteria community as well as the most
   abundant Acidobacteria subgroups (1, 3, 5, and 6) was significantly more
   similar in composition across space in pasture soils than in forest
   soils. These results suggest that preponderant responses of
   Acidobacteria subgroups, especially subgroups 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6, to
   forest-to-pasture conversion effects in soils could be used to define
   management-indicators of agricultural practices in the Amazon Basin.
   These acidobacterial responses are at least in part through alterations
   on acidity- and nutrient-related properties of the Amazon soils.}},

Title = {{Trajectory analyses of virologic outcomes reflecting community-based HIV
   treatment in Washington DC 1994-2012}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Effective treatment of HIV since 1996 has reduced morbidity
   and mortality through virologic suppression. Combination antiretroviral
   therapy (cART) has been recognized as key to the prevention of drug
   resistance and the transmission of infection. We used eighteen years of
   virologic outcomes in a long-standing cohort of women to describe
   longitudinal viral load trajectories; and examine factors associated
   with sustained viremia and mortality.
   Methods: We analyzed data from DC WIHS women with > four semiannual
   visits using a group-based logistic trajectory analysis approach to
   identify patterns of HIV RNA detection (> 80 copies/mL or lower assay
   limit, and > 1000 copies/mL). We verified findings using cumulative
   viral load suppression-years, explored group characteristics using
   generalized linear modeling with generalized estimating equations for
   repeated measures, and examined survival using the Kaplan-Meier and Cox
   proportional hazard analyses.
   Results: 329 women contributed 6633 visits between 1994 and 2012 and
   demonstrated high, moderate, and low probability patterns of HIV RNA
   detection (> 80 copies/mL) in 40.7, 35.6, and 23.7 \% of participant
   visits, respectively. Analysis of cumulative years of viral load
   suppression supported these observations. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
   demonstrated high mortality of 31.1 \% with sustained viremia, but no
   significant difference in mortality between intermittent viremia and
   non-viremia patterns, 6.9 and 4.9 \% respectively. Mortality was
   associated with higher age, lower CD4+ T lymphocyte count, and sustained
   viremia by Cox multivariate analysis.
   Conclusions: This ecologic study demonstrates the effectiveness of viral
   suppression, and conversely the association between viremia and
   mortality. In community delivery of cART for HIV care, distinct patterns
   of sustained viremia, intermittent viremia, and non-viremia were
   identified over nearly 18 years in the DC WIHS, capturing the dynamics
   and complexity of sustaining long-term HIV care. Persistent viremia was
   associated with lower CD4s and mortality, but surprisingly mortality was
   not different between continuous suppression and intermittent viremia.
   Classification of long-term virologic patterns such as these observed
   HIV treatment ``careers{''} may provide a suitable framework to identify
   modifiable factors associated with treatment resilience and failure.
   Both individual and population interventions are needed to reduce
   transmission, prevent the emergence of drug resistance, and improve
   outcomes of community ART programs.}},

Abstract = {{Circadian clocks are oscillatory systems that allow organisms to
   anticipate rhythmic changes in the environment. Several studies have
   shown that circadian clocks are connected to metabolism, but it is not
   generally clear whether metabolic signaling is one voice among many that
   influence the clock or whether metabolic cycling is the major clock
   synchronizer. To address this question in cyanobacteria, we used a
   synthetic biology approach to make normally autotrophic cells capable of
   growth on exogenous sugar. This allowed us to manipulate metabolism
   independently from light and dark. We found that feeding sugar to
   cultures blocked the clock-resetting effect of a dark pulse.
   Furthermore, in the absence of light, the clock efficiently synchronizes
   to metabolic cycles driven by rhythmic feeding. We conclude that
   metabolic activity, independent of its source, is the primary clock
   driver in cyanobacteria.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an adaptive algorithm is proposed to develop an
   orthogonally optimized waveforms with good correlation properties that
   are suitable for the detection of target in the presence of strong
   clutter. The joint optimization both at the transmitter and receiver is
   adapted based on the secondary data and clutter to maximize signal to
   interference noise ratio (SINR) with target and clutter knowledge. The
   result shows good correlation properties and better SINR and signal to
   clutter ratio (SCR) compared to the existing iterative algorithm. The
   proposed algorithm also shows improved detection even for lower SCR when
   implemented with GLRT.}},

Abstract = {{Sanaria Inc. has developed methods to manufacture, purify and
   cryopreserve aseptic Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoites (SPZ), and
   is using this platform technology to develop an injectable PESPZ-based
   vaccine that provides high-grade, durable protection against infection
   with Pf malaria. Several candidate vaccines are being developed and
   tested, including PfSPZ Vaccine, in which the PfSPZ are attenuated by
   irradiation, PfSPZ-CVac, in which fully infectious PfSPZ are attenuated
   in vivo by concomitant administration of an anti-malarial drug, and
   PfSPZ-GA1, in which the PfSPZ are attenuated by gene knockout.
   Forty-three research groups in 15 countries, organized as the
   International PfSPZ Consortium (I-PfSPZ-C), are collaborating to advance
   this program by providing intellectual, clinical, and financial support.
   Fourteen clinical trials of these products have been completed in the
   USA, Europe and Africa, two are underway and at least 12 more are
   planned for 2015-2016 in the US (four trials), Germany (2 trials),
   Tanzania, Kenya, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ghana and Equatorial Guinea.
   Sanaria anticipates application to license a first generation product as
   early as late 2017, initially to protect adults, and a year later to
   protect all persons >6 months of age for at least six months. Improved
   vaccine candidates will be advanced as needed until the following
   requirements have been met: long-term protection against natural
   transmission, excellent safety and tolerability, and operational
   feasibility for population-wide administration. Here we describe the
   three most developed whole PfSPZ vaccine candidates, associated clinical
   trials, initial plans for licensure and deployment, and long-term
   objectives for a final product suitable for mass administration to
   achieve regional malaria elimination and eventual global eradication.

Abstract = {{The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying adaptive changes to
   physiological stress within the intestinal epithelium remain poorly
   understood. Here, we show that PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K ->
   AKT -> mTORC1-signaling pathway, is an important regulator of dormant
   intestinal stem cells (d-ISCs). Acute nutrient deprivation leads to
   transient PTEN phosphorylation within d-ISCs and a corresponding
   increase in their number. This release of PTEN inhibition renders d-ISCs
   functionally poised to contribute to the regenerative response during
   re-feeding via cell-autonomous activation of the PI3K -> AKT -> mTORC1
   pathway. Consistent with its role in mediating cell survival, PTEN is
   required for d-ISC maintenance at baseline, and intestines lacking PTEN
   have diminished regenerative capacity after irradiation. Our results
   highlight a PTEN-dependent mechanism for d-ISC maintenance and further
   demonstrate the role of d-ISCs in the intestinal response to stress.}},

Abstract = {{Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) significantly influence the development
   and regulation of genome expression in cells. Here, we demonstrate the
   role of lncRNA ceruloplasmin (NRCP) in cancer metabolism and elucidate
   functional effects leading to increased tumor progression. NRCP was
   highly upregulated in ovarian tumors, and knockdown of NRCP resulted in
   significantly increased apoptosis, decreased cell proliferation, and
   decreased glycolysis compared with control cancer cells. In an
   orthotopic mouse model of ovarian cancer, siNRCP delivered via a
   liposomal carrier significantly reduced tumor growth compared with
   control treatment. We identified NRCP as an intermediate binding partner
   between STAT1 and RNA polymerase II, leading to increased expression of
   downstream target genes such as glucose-6-phosphate isomerase.
   Collectively, we report a previously unrecognized role of the lncRNA
   NRCP in modulating cancer metabolism. As demonstrated, DOPC
   nanoparticle-incorporated siRNA-mediated silencing of this lncRNA in
   vivo provides therapeutic avenue toward modulating lncRNAs in cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is known to form the crystalline complexes
   with iodine ions, in which the linear I-3(-) ions form the columnar
   arrays and are connected to the neighboring PVA chains of planar-zigzag
   conformation through the charge transfer between OH groups and I-3(-)
   ions. In order to clarify the effective OH segmental length necessary
   for the formation of such an iodine complex along the chain axis, the
   complex formation behavior has been investigated systematically for a
   series of ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH) random copolymers on the basis
   of the experimental data of 2D X-ray diffraction, visible-ultraviolet
   (UV-Vis) absorption spectra, Raman spectra, and infrared spectra. By
   comparing the observed X-ray diffraction patterns, the EVOH copolymers
   with VOH content near 100 mol \% were found to take the relatively
   regular complex II structure, while the EVOH copolymers of 70-50 VOH mol
   \% were found to take the structure of complex I, in which the PVA
   zigzag chains are packed together randomly with and without coupling
   with iodine ions. In this way, an increase of VOH monomer content in the
   copolymer generates the longer VOH unit sequences, which can couple with
   I-3(-) ions to form the crystalline complex with higher regularity. The
   infrared bands of OH and CO stretching modes were found to shift by
   iodine complexation, indicating that the OH center dot center dot center
   dot O hydrogen bonds between the neighboring PVA chains are broken in
   the complex formation process, and the interactions between I-3(-) ions
   and OH groups, which may be assumed as a kind of intermolecular hydrogen
   bonds, become stronger with an increase of VOH content in the EVOH

Abstract = {{The main chain stiffness parameter (lambda M-1) of cylindrical rod
   brushes consisting of a flexible polymethacrylate (PMA) main chain and
   poly(n-hexyl isocyanate) (PHIC) rod side chains has been determined in
   tetrahydrofuran (THF) at 25 degrees C by static light and small-angle
   X-ray scattering measurements. Furthermore, we have rationalized lambda
   M-1 as a function of the degree of polymerization of HIC, N-s. The
   lambda(-1)(M) values were compared to those of rod brushes consisting of
   a flexible polystyrene (PSt) main chain {[}Macromolecules 2008, 41,
   6564] to reveal how the molecular conformation of the rod brush is
   influenced by the difference in the primary structure or chemical nature
   of the main chain. A series of rod brushes, poly(MA-HIC-N-s-Ac) with
   different side chain lengths, where N, ranged from 26 to 82, were
   prepared by radical homopolymerization of
   a-methacryloyloxyethoxy-omega-acetyl ended PHIC macromonomers
   (MA-HIC-N-s-Ac) in n-hexane at 60 degrees C. The mean-square
   cross-section radius of gyration ((S-c(2))) of poly(MA-HIC-N-s-Ac) was
   essentially consistent with those of the rod brushes consisting of a PSt
   main chain, poly(VB-HIC-Ns-H), and could be quantitatively described by
   the wormlike comb model. The z-averaged mean-square radius of gyration
   ((< S >(2))) of the brush, determined as the function of molecular
   weight, was analyzed with the aid of the cylindrical wormlike chain
   model theory to determine the lambda(-1)(M) value. The scattering form
   factor of poly(MA-HIC-Ns-Ac) was also quantitatively described by the
   wormlike chain model, and the corresponding 4,lambda(-1)(M) parameter
   was determined. The lambda(-1)(M) value of poly(MA-HIC-N,-AO was much
   greater than that of poly(VB-HIC-Ns-H) having the same N, and increased
   in proportion with increasing side chain length (lambda(-1)(M)
   proportional to N-s-H). The chemical nature of the main chain, which is
   the minor component in the brush polymers, was found to play an
   essential role in the overall conformation of the rod brushes.}},

Abstract = {{The CRNDE gene seems to play an oncogenic role in cancers, though its
   exact function remains unknown. Here, we tried to assess its usefulness
   as a molecular prognostic marker in ovarian cancer. Based on results of
   our microarray studies, CRNDE transcripts were further analyzed by
   Real-Time qPCR-based profiling of their expression. The qPCR study was
   conducted with the use of personally designed TaqMan assays on 135
   frozen tissue sections of ovarian carcinomas from patients treated with
   platinum compounds and either cyclophosphamide (PC, N = 32) or taxanes
   (TP, N = 103). Elevated levels of two different CRNDE transcripts were a
   negative prognostic factor; they increased the risk of death and
   recurrence in the group of patients treated with TP, but not PC
   (DNA-damaging agents only). Higher associations were found for
   overexpression of the short CRNDE splice variant (FJ466686): HR 6.072,
   95\% CI 1.814-20.32, p = 0.003 (the risk of death); HR 15.53, 95\% CI
   3.812-63.28, p < 0.001 (the risk of recurrence). Additionally,
   accumulation of the TP53 protein correlated with decreased expression of
   both CRNDE transcripts in tumor cells. Our results depict CRNDE as a
   potential marker of poor prognosis in women with ovarian carcinomas, and
   suggest that its significance depends on the therapeutic regimen used.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Today, cancer documentation is still a tedious task
   involving many different information systems even within a single
   institution and it is rarely supported by appropriate documentation
   workflows.
   Methods: In a comprehensive 14 step analysis we compiled diagnostic and
   therapeutic pathways for 13 cancer entities using a mixed approach of
   document analysis, workflow analysis, expert interviews, workflow
   modelling and feedback loops. These pathways were stepwise classified
   and categorized to create a final set of grouped pathways and workflows
   including electronic documentation forms.
   Results: A total of 73 workflows for the 13 entities based on 82 paper
   documentation forms additionally to computer based documentation systems
   were compiled in a 724 page document comprising 130 figures, 94 tables
   and 23 tumour classifications as well as 12 follow-up tables. Stepwise
   classification made it possible to derive grouped diagnostic and
   therapeutic pathways for the three major classes
   -solid entities with surgical therapy
   -solid entities with surgical and additional therapeutic activities and
   -non-solid entities.
   For these classes it was possible to deduct common documentation
   workflows to support workflow-guided single-source documentation.
   Conclusions: Clinical documentation activities within a Comprehensive
   Cancer Center can likely be realized in a set of three documentation
   workflows with conditional branching in a modern workflow supporting
   clinical information system.}},

Abstract = {{Cell derivatives have received increasing attention due to their unique
   ability to mimic many of the natural properties displayed by their
   source cells. Integration of cell-derived natural materials with
   synthetic subjects can be applied toward the development of novel
   biomedical nano/microscale devices for a wide range of applications,
   including drug delivery and biodetoxification. Herein, a cell membrane
   functionalized magnesium-based Janus micromotor, powered by water, that
   mimics natural motile cells is reported. The new cell-mimicking Janus
   micromotor is constructed by integrating red blood cell (RBC) membranes,
   gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and alginate (ALG) onto the exposed surface
   areas of magnesium microparticles that are partially embedded in
   Parafilm. The resulting RBC membrane-coated magnesium (RBC-Mg) Janus
   micromotors display an efficient and guided propulsion in water without
   any external fuel, as well as in biological (albumin-rich) media with no
   apparent biofouling, mimicking the movement of natural motile cells. The
   effective RBC membrane coating bestows the RBC-Mg Janus micromotors with
   unique capability for absorbing and neutralizing both biological protein
   toxins and nerve agent simulants. Such detoxification ability is
   facilitated greatly by the water-driven motion of the motors. The RBC-Mg
   Janus micromotors represent an exciting progress toward cell-mimicking
   microscale motors that hold great promise for diverse biomedical and
   biodefense applications.}},

Abstract = {{Li-rich layered cathode materials have been considered as a family of
   promising high-energy density cathode materials for next generation
   lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, although activation of the
   Li2MnO3 phase is known to play an essential role in providing superior
   capacity, the mechanism of activation of the Li2MnO3 phase in Li-rich
   cathode materials is still not fully understood. In this work, an
   interesting Li-rich cathode material Li1.87Mn0.94Ni0.19O3 is reported
   where the Li2MnO3 phase activation process can be effectively controlled
   due to the relatively low level of Ni doping. Such a unique feature
   offers the possibility of investigating the detailed activation
   mechanism by examining the intermediate states and phases of the Li2MnO3
   during the controlled activation process. Combining powerful synchrotron
   in situ X-ray diffraction analysis and observations using advanced
   scanning transmission electron microscopy equipped with a high angle
   annular dark field detector, it has been revealed that the subreaction
   of O-2 generation may feature a much faster kinetics than the transition
   metal diffusion during the Li2MnO3 activation process, indicating that
   the latter plays a crucial role in determining the Li2MnO3 activation
   rate and leading to the unusual stepwise capacity increase over charging
   cycles.}},

Title = {{Effect of Angiotensin (1-7) on Heart Function in an Experimental Rat
   Model of Obesity}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{Aim: Obesity is a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular
   diseases. Recently it was shown that overexpression of the Mas-receptor
   antagonist angiotensin(1-7) could prevent from diet induced obesity.
   However, it remained unclear whether diet-induced obesity and
   angiotensin(1-7) overexpression might also have effects on the
   cardiovascular system in these rats.
   Methods: Twenty three male Sprague Dawley rats were fed with standard
   chow (SD+chow, n = 5) or a cafeteria diet (SD+CD, n = 6) for 5 months.
   To investigate the effect of angiotensin(1-7) transgenic rats,
   expressing an angiotensin(1-7)-producing fusion protein in testis were
   used. These transgenic rats also received a 5 month's feeding period
   with either chow (TGR+chow, n = 6) or cafeteria diet (TGR+CD, n = 6),
   respectively. Hemodynamic measurements (pressure volume loops) were
   carried out to assess cardiac function and blood pressure. Subsequently,
   hearts were explanted and investigated according to the Langendorff
   technique. Furthermore, cardiac remodeling in these animals was
   investigated histologically.
   Results: After 5 months cafeteria diet feeding rats showed a
   significantly increased body weight, which could be prevented in
   transgenic rats. However, there was no effect on cardiac performance
   after cafeteria diet in non-transgenic and transgenic rats. Moreover,
   overexpression of angiotensin(1-7) deteriorated cardiac contractility as
   indicated by impaired dp/dt. Furthermore, histological analysis revealed
   that cafeteria diet led to myocardial fibrosis in both, control and
   transgenic rats and this was not inhibited by an overproduction of
   angiotensin(1-7).
   Conclusion: These results indicate that an overexpression of circulating
   angiotensin(1-7) prevents a cafeteria diet-induced increase in body
   weight, but does not affect cardiac performance in this experimental rat
   model of obesity. Furthermore, overexpression of angiotensin(1-7) alone
   resulted in an impairment of cardiac function.}},

Title = {{Adjuvant radiation therapy of regional lymph nodes in breast cancer - a
   meta-analysis of randomized trials- an update}},
Journal = {{RADIATION ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: Adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) of regional lymph nodes (LN) in
   early breast cancer is still a matter of debate. RT increases the
   Overall survival (OS) rate of breast cancer patients after breast
   conserving surgery and after mastectomy in patients with involved LN.
   The contribution of RT to regional LN to this improvement was poorly
   identified. Recently, the results of three large randomized trials
   addressing this question were published as full papers.
   Material and methods: Published data of the MA. 20 (n = 1832), the
   EORTC22922-10925 (EORTC) (n = 4004) trial and the French trial (n =
   1334) were the foundation of this meta-analysis. Major eligibility
   criteria were positive i) axillary LN (all trials), ii) LN negative
   disease with high risk for recurrence (MA. 20), and iii) medial/central
   tumor location (French, EORTC). The MA. 20 and the EORTC trial analyzed
   the effect of additional regional RT to the internal mammary (IM) LN and
   medial supraclavicular (MS) LN, whereas in the French trial all patients
   received RT to the MS-LN and solely RT to the IM-LN was randomized.
   Primary endpoint was OS. Secondary endpoints were disease-free survival
   (DFS) and distant metastasis free survival (DMFS).
   Results: Regional RT of MS-LN and IM-LN (MA. 20 and EORTC) resulted in a
   significant improvement of OS {[}Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.88 (95 \% CL 0.78 -
   0.99)]. Adding results of the French trial and using a random effects
   model to respect the different design of the French trial, the effect on
   OS of regional RT remained significant {[}HR 0.90 (95 \% CL 0.82 -
   0.99)]. The absolute benefits in OS were 1 \% in the MA. 20 trial at 10
   years, 1.6 \% in the EORTC trial at 10 years, and 3.3 \% in the French
   trial at 10 years (not significant in single trials). Regional RT of
   MS-LN and IM-LN (MA. 20 and EORTC) yielded to a significant improvement
   of DFS {[}HR 0.86 (95 \% CL 0.78 - 0.95)] and DMFS {[}HR 0.84 (95 \% CL
   0.75 - 0.94)].
   Conclusion: Additional regional RT to the internal mammary and medial
   supraclavicular LN statistically significantly improved DFS, DMFS, and
   OS in stage I-III breast cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Cytosolic PLA(2) (cPLA(2)) and Ca2+-independent PLA2 (iPLA(2)) play a
   significant role in insulin beta-cells secretion. Bacterial infections
   may be responsible of the onset of diabetes. The mechanism by which
   Staphylococcus aureus infection of INS-1 cells alters glucose-induced
   insulin secretion has been examined. After acute infection, insulin
   secretion and PLA(2) activities significantly increased. Moreover,
   increased expressions of phospho-cPLA(2), phospho-PKC alpha and
   phospho-ERK 1/2 were observed. Chronic infection causes a decrease in
   insulin release and a significant increase of iPLA(2) and COX-2 protein
   expression. Moreover, insulin secretion in infected cells could be
   restored using specific siRNAs against iPLA(2) isoform and specific
   COX-2 inhibitor. (C) 2015 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Title = {{Differential Impact of Constrictive Physiology after Pericardiocentesis
   in Malignancy Patients with Pericardial Effusion}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Echocardiographic signs of constrictive physiology (CP) after
   pericardiocentesis are frequently observed in malignancy patients. The
   purpose of the current study was to explore whether features of CP after
   pericardiocentesis have prognostic impact in malignancy patients with
   pericardial effusion (PE).
   Methods
   We retrospectively reviewed 467 consecutive patients who underwent
   pericardiocentesis at our institution from January 2006 to May 2014.
   Among them, 205 patients with advanced malignancy who underwent
   comprehensive echocardiography after the procedure comprised the study
   population. Co-primary end points were all-cause mortality (ACM) and
   repeated drainage (RD) for PE. Patients were divided into four subgroups
   according to cytologic result for malignant cells and CP (positive
   cytology with negative CP, both positive, both negative, and negative
   cytology with positive CP).
   Results
   CP after pericardiocentesis was present in 106 patients (50\%) at median
   4 days after the procedure. During median follow-up of 208 days, ACM and
   RD occurred in 162 patients (79\%) and 29 patients (14\%), respectively.
   Cox regression analysis revealed that independent predictors for ACM
   were male gender and positive cytology (all, p < 0.05). For RD,
   predictors were positive cytology, the absence of cardiac tamponade, and
   negative CP after pericardiocentesis (all, p < 0.05). When the patients
   were divided into four subgroups, patients with negative cytology and
   positive CP demonstrated the most favorable survival (hazard ratio
   {[}HR]: 0.39, p = 0.005) and the lowest RD rates (HR: 0.07, p = 0.012).
   Conclusion
   CP after pericardiocentesis is common, but does not always imply poor
   survival or the need for RD in patients with advanced malignancies. On
   the contrary, the presence of CP in patients with negative cytology
   conferred the most favorable survival and the lowest rate of RD.
   Comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation for CP after
   pericardiocentesis would be helpful for predicting prognosis in patients
   with advanced malignancies.}},

Abstract = {{We measure weak lensing mass profiles of voids from a volume-limited
   sample of SDSS Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs). We find voids using an
   algorithm designed to maximize the lensing signal by dividing the survey
   volume into 2D slices, and then finding holes in this 2D distribution of
   LRGs. We perform a stacked shear measurement on about 20 000 voids with
   radii between 15 and 55 Mpc h(-1), and redshifts between 0.16 and 0.37.
   We measure the characteristic radial shear signal of voids with a signal
   to noise of 7. The mass profile corresponds to a fractional underdensity
   of about -0.4 inside the void radius and a slow approach to the mean
   density indicating a partially compensated void structure. We compare
   our measured shape and amplitude with the predictions of Krause et al.
   Voids in the galaxy distribution have been extensively modelled using
   simulations and measured in the SDSS. We discuss how the addition of
   void mass profiles can enable studies of galaxy formation and cosmology.}},

Abstract = {{Zero-valent iron, cobalt, and nickel were installed into the
   metalloligand V{[}N(o-(NCH2P(Pr-i)(2))C6H4)(3)] (1, VL), generating the
   hetero-bimetallic trio FeVL (2), CoVL (3), and NiVL (4), respectively.
   In addition, the one-electron-oxidized analogues {[}FeVL]X ({[}2(ox)]X,
   where X = BPh4 or PF6) and {[}CoVL]BPh4 ({[}3(ox)]BPh4) were prepared.
   The complexes were characterized by a host of physical methods,
   including cyclic voltammetry, X-ray crystallography, magnetic
   susceptibility, electronic absorption, NMR, electron paramagnetic
   resonance (EPR), and Mossbauer spectroscopies. The CoV and FeV
   heterobimetallic compounds have short M-V bond lengths that are
   consistent with M-M multiple bonding. As revealed by theoretical
   calculations, the M-V bond is triple in 2, 2(ox), and 3(ox), double in
   3, and dative (Ni -> V) in 4. The (d-d)(10) species, 2 and 3(ox), are
   diamagnetic and exhibit large diamagnetic anisotropies of -4700 X
   10(-36) m(3)/molecule. Complexes 2 and 3(ox) are also characterized by
   intense visible bands at 760 and 610 nm (epsilon > 1000 M-1 cm(-1)),
   respectively, which correspond to an intermetal (M -> V) charge-transfer
   transition. Magnetic susceptibility measurements and EPR
   characterization establish S = 1/2 ground states for (d-d)(9) 2(ox) and
   (d-d)(11) 3, while (d-d)(12) 4 is S = 1 based on Evans' method.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The biomedical community benefits from the increasing
   availability of genomic data to support meaningful scientific research,
   e.g., Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). However, high quality GWAS
   usually requires a large amount of samples, which can grow beyond the
   capability of a single institution. Federated genomic data analysis
   holds the promise of enabling cross-institution collaboration for
   effective GWAS, but it raises concerns about patient privacy and medical
   information confidentiality (as data are being exchanged across
   institutional boundaries), which becomes an inhibiting factor for the
   practical use.
   Methods: We present a privacy-preserving GWAS framework on federated
   genomic datasets. Our method is to layer the GWAS computations on top of
   secure multi-party computation (MPC) systems. This approach allows two
   parties in a distributed system to mutually perform secure GWAS
   computations, but without exposing their private data outside.
   Results: We demonstrate our technique by implementing a framework for
   minor allele frequency counting and chi(2) statistics calculation, one
   of typical computations used in GWAS. For efficient prototyping, we use
   a state-of-the-art MPC framework, i.e., Portable Circuit Format (PCF)
   {[}1]. Our experimental results show promise in realizing both efficient
   and secure cross-institution GWAS computations.}},

Abstract = {{The merger of two white dwarfs (WDs) has for many years not been
   considered as the favoured model for the progenitor system of Type Ia
   supernovae (SNe Ia). But recent years have seen a change of opinion as a
   number of studies, both observational and theoretical, have concluded
   that they should contribute significantly to the observed SN Ia rate. In
   this paper, we study the ignition and propagation of detonation through
   post-merger remnants and we follow the resulting nucleosynthesis up to
   the point where a homologous expansion is reached. In our study we cover
   the entire range of WD masses and compositions. For the emergence of a
   detonation we study three different setups. The first two are guided by
   the merger remnants from our earlier simulations, while for the third
   one the ignitions were set by placing hotspots with properties
   determined by spatially resolved calculations taken from the literature.
   There are some caveats to our approach which we investigate. We
   carefully compare the nucleosynthetic yields of successful explosions
   with SN Ia observations. Only three of our models are consistent with
   all the imposed constraints and potentially lead to a standard Type Ia
   event. The first one, a 0.45 M-circle dot helium (He) + 0.9 M-circle dot
   carbon-oxygen (CO) WD system produces a sub-luminous, SN 1991bg-like
   event while the other two, a 0.45M(circle dot) He+1.1 M-circle dot
   oxygen-neon WD system and a 1.05 + 1.05 M-circle dot system with two CO
   WDs, are good candidates for common SNe Ia.}},

Abstract = {{Recent analysis of well-tempered metadynamics (WTmetaD) showed that it

   simple tempering scheme, inspired by a related mollified adaptive

   the free energy estimate. We use a toy model to examine the role of
   artifacts in WTmetaD and solvated alanine dipeptide to compare the

Title = {{The Role of the Paratrigeminal Nucleus in Vagal Afferent Evoked
   Respiratory Reflexes: A Neuroanatomical and Functional Study in Guinea
   Pigs}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{The respiratory tree receives sensory innervation from the jugular and
   nodose vagal sensory ganglia. Neurons of these ganglia are derived from
   embryologically distinct origins and as such demonstrate differing
   molecular, neurochemical and physiological phenotypes. Furthermore,
   whereas nodose afferent neurons project to the nucleus of the solitary
   tract (nTS), recent neuroanatomical studies in rats suggest that jugular
   neurons have their central terminations in the paratrigeminal nucleus
   (Pa5). In the present study we confirm that guinea pigs demonstrate a
   comparable distinction between the brainstem terminations of nodose and
   jugular ganglia afferents. Thus, microinjection of fluorescently
   conjugated cholera toxin B (CT-B) neural tracers into the caudal nTS and
   Pa5 resulted in highly specific retrograde labeling of neurons in the
   nodose and jugular ganglia, respectively. Whereas, nodose neurons more
   often expressed 160 KD neurofilament proteins and the alpha3 subunit of
   Na+/K+ ATPase, significantly more jugular neurons expressed the
   neuropeptides substance P (SP) and, especially, Calcitonin Gene-Related
   Peptide (CGRP). Indeed, terminal fibers in the Pa5 compared to the nTS
   were characterized by their significantly greater expression of CGRP,
   further supporting the notion that jugular afferents project to
   trigeminal-related brainstem regions. Electrical stimulation of the
   guinea pig larynx following selective surgical denervation of the nodose
   afferent innervation to the larynx (leaving intact the jugular
   innervation) resulted in stimulus dependent respiratory slowing and
   eventual apnea. This jugular ganglia neuron mediated response was
   unaffected by bilateral microinjections of the GABA(A) agonist muscimol
   into the nTS, but was abolished by muscimol injected into the Pa5. Taken
   together these data confirm that jugular and nodose vagal ganglia
   afferent neurons innervate distinct central circuits and support the
   notion that multiple peripheral and central pathways mediate sensory
   responses associated with airway irritations.}},

   Strong fluctuations in measured axial ion velocity throughout the

Title = {{Transmission of the First Influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 Pandemic Wave in
   Australia Was Driven by Undetected Infections: Pandemic Response
   Implications}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{Background
   During the first wave of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in Victoria, Australia
   the rapid increase in notified cases and the high proportion with
   relatively mild symptoms suggested that community transmission was
   established before cases were identified. This lead to the hypothesis
   that those with low-level infections were the main drivers of the
   pandemic.
   Methods
   A deterministic susceptible-infected-recovered model was constructed to
   describe the first pandemic wave in a population structured by disease
   severity levels of asymptomatic, low-level symptoms, moderate symptoms
   and severe symptoms requiring hospitalisation. The model incorporated
   mixing, infectivity and duration of infectiousness parameters to
   calculate subgroup-specific reproduction numbers for each severity
   level.
   Results
   With stratum-specific effective reproduction numbers of 1.82 and 1.32
   respectively, those with low-level symptoms, and those with asymptomatic
   infections were responsible for most of the transmission. The effective
   reproduction numbers for infections resulting in moderate symptoms and
   hospitalisation were less than one. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the
   importance of parameters relating to asymptomatic individuals and those
   with low-level symptoms.
   Conclusions
   Transmission of influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 was largely driven by those
   invisible to the health system. This has implications for control
   measures-such as distribution of antivirals to cases and contacts and
   quarantine/isolation-that rely on detection of infected cases. Pandemic
   plans need to incorporate milder scenarios, with a graded approach to
   implementation of control measures.}},

   be increased by epistatic gene action}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{387}},
Pages = {{241-257}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{Epistatic gene action occurs when mutations or alleles interact to
   produce a phenotype. Theoretically and empirically it is of interest to
   know whether gene interactions can facilitate the evolution of
   diversity. In this paper, we explore how epistatic gene action affects
   the additive genetic component or heritable component of multivariate
   trait variation, as well as how epistatic gene action affects the
   evolvability of multivariate traits. The analysis involves a sexually
   reproducing and recombining population. Our results indicate that under
   stabilizing selection conditions a population with a mixed additive and
   epistatic genetic architecture can have greater multivariate additive
   genetic variation and evolvability than a population with a purely
   additive genetic architecture. That greater multivariate additive
   genetic variation can occur with epistasis is in contrast to previous
   theory that indicated univariate additive genetic variation is decreased
   with epistasis under stabilizing selection conditions. In a multivariate
   setting, epistasis leads to less relative covariance among individuals
   in their genotypic, as well as their breeding values, which facilitates
   the maintenance of additive genetic variation and increases a
   population's evolvability. Our analysis involves linking the
   combinatorial nature of epistatic genetic effects to the ancestral graph
   structure of a population to provide insight into the consequences of
   epistasis on multivariate trait variation and evolution. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{We study nonlinear effects of intense terahertz (THz) field on
   photoexcited carrier dynamics in gated monolayer graphene. By employing
   optical-pump/intense-THz-probe spectroscopy on lightly doped graphene,
   we observe a crossover from negative to positive photo-induced THz
   differential transmission as the THz probe field is increased. We
   attribute this qualitative change in the response to a crossover from a
   regime where the photo-induced increase in the carrier density dominates
   the differential response to one where a THz-field-induced increase in
   the scattering rate dominates. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   low-concentrated Ca2+ more strongly perturbs interfacial water

   concentrations, the water H-bonding network at the DPPC/CaCl2 interface
   reorganizes and the resulting spectrum closely follows that of the bare

   the appearance of a negative band at approximate to 3450cm(-1) in the

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES Evaluation of 30-day outcomes after transcatheter aortic
   valve replacement (TAVR) with the novel balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3 (S3)
   transcatheter heart valve (THV) (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine,
   California) emphasizing the updated Valve Academic Research Consortium
   (VARC-2) criteria.
   BACKGROUND Preliminary data on clinical performance with the S3 THV are
   promising. However, information regarding 30-day outcome is limited.
   METHODS A total of 250 consecutive patients undergoing transfemoral TAVR
   with the S3 THV at our center were enrolled, and outcomes according to
   VARC-2 criteria were analyzed at 30 days.
   RESULTS The mean age was 81.0 +/- 6.2 years, median logistic EuroSCORE
   (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation) and Society of
   Thoracic Surgeons score were 12.1\% and 4.4\%, respectively.
   VARC-2-defined device success was achieved in 244 patients (97.6\%);
   moderate paravalvular leakage developed in 5 patients (2.0\%). One
   patient (0.4\%) died of a noncardiac cause and 8 patients (3.2\%) had a
   stroke. Life-threatening bleeding and major vascular complications
   occurred in 12 (4.8\%) and 9 (3.6\%) of the patients, respectively. From
   discharge to 30 days, 5 patients (2.0\%) were hospitalized due to
   valve-related symptoms or worsening of heart failure. The VARC-2
   composite early safety endpoint was observed in 25 patients (10.0\%).
   Permanent pacemaker implantation rate at 30 days was 15.2\%. Myocardial
   infarction, coronary obstruction requiring intervention, valve-related
   dysfunction, and endocarditis were not observed.
   CONCLUSIONS We found very good 30-day results using the novel S3 THV
   with a low rate of clinical events according to VARC-2 criteria. The S3
   THV is associated with high procedural success and favorable early
   safety profile. The need for pacemaker implantations appears to be more
   frequent than with its predecessor. (C) 2015 by the American College of

Abstract = {{Background: Many sand fly species are implicated in the transmission
   cycle of Leishmania parasites around the world. Incriminating new sand
   flies species, as vectors of Leishmania is crucial to understanding the
   parasite-vector transmission cycle in different areas in Tunisia and
   surrounding countries.
   Findings: Seventy-four unfed females belonging to the genera
   Sergentomyia and Phlebotomus were collected in South Tunisia between
   June and November 2014, using sticky papers. PCR-RFLP (Restriction
   Fragment Length Polymorphism) analysis of the internal transcribed
   spacer 1 (ITS1) was used for Leishmania parasites detection and
   identification. Leishmania (L.) major (Yakimoff \& Shokkor, 1914) was
   identified within two Sergentomyia (S.) minuta (Rondani, 1843) and one
   Phlebotomus papatasi (Scopoli, 1786).
   Conclusion: This is the first report of L. major identified from S.
   minuta in Tunisia. This novel finding enhances the understanding of the
   transmission cycle of L. major parasites of cutaneous leishmaniasis in
   an endemic area in South Tunisia.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrazine reacts with silica-supported tantalum-hydrides {[}(

   IR in situ monitoring of the reaction with N2H4 or (N2H4)-N-15, and the
   solid-state MAS NMR spectra of the fully N-15 labeled compounds (CP
   N-15, H-1-N-15 HETCOR, double-quantum, and H-1-H-1 triple-quantum
   spectra) were used to identify stable intermediates and products. DFT
   calculations were used for determining the reaction pathway and
   calculating the N-15 and NMR chemical shifts. Combining the experimental
   and computational studies led to the following results. At room
   temperature, only hydrazine adducts, 1-N2H4, are formed. Upon heating at
   100 degrees C, the hydrazine adducts are converted to several species
   among whit!). {[}( SiO)(2)Ta(=NH)(NH2)], 2, {[}(SiO)(2)TaH(NH2)2], 3,
   and {[}(SiO)(2)TaH2(NH-NH2)], 4, were identified. The final product 2 is
   also formed in the reaction of N-2 with the same silica-supported
   tantalum-hydride complexes, and the species identified as 3 and 4 had
   been previously Suggested by DFT studies as intermediates on the
   reaction pathway for N-N cleavage in N-2. The present computational
   studies (cluster models with M06 functional complemented by selected
   calculations with periodic calculations) show that 2 is formed via 3 and
   4, with either N-2 or N2H4. This strengthens the previous proposal of
   the existence of 3 and 4 as intermediates in the reaction of N-2 with
   the tantalum-hydrides. However, the reaction of N-2 does not imply the
   formation of N2H4 or its hydrazido monoanionic or dianionic ligand as an
   intermediate. For this reason, this study informs both on the
   sitnilarities and differences of the reaction pathways involving N-2 and
   N2H4 with tantalum-hydrides.}},

Abstract = {{Inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) of a single hydrogen
   atom on the Cu(100) surface in a scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)
   configuration has been investigated by employing the non-equilibrium
   Green's function formalism combined with density functional theory. The
   electron-vibration interaction is treated at the level of lowest order
   expansion. Our calculations show that the single peak observed in the
   previous STM-IETS experiments is dominated by the perpendicular mode of
   the adsorbed H atom, while the parallel one only makes a negligible
   contribution even when the STM tip is laterally displaced from the top
   position of the H atom. This propensity of the IETS is deeply rooted in
   the symmetry of the vibrational modes and the characteristics of the
   conduction channel of the Cu-H-Cu tunneling junction, which is mainly
   composed of the 4s and 4pz atomic orbitals of the Cu apex atom and the
   1s orbital of the adsorbed H atom. These findings are helpful for
   deepening our understanding of the propensity rules for IETS and
   promoting IETS as a more popular spectroscopic tool for molecular
   devices. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to assess usage patterns of
   transradial access in rescue percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
   for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and associations
   between vascular access site choice and outcomes.
   BACKGROUND Transradial access reduces bleeding and mortality in STEMI
   patients undergoing primary PCI. Little is known about access site
   choice and outcomes in patients undergoing rescue PCI after receiving
   full-dose fibrinolytic therapy for STEMI.
   METHODS Patients in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry's CathPCI
   Registry undergoing rescue PCI for STEMI between 2009 and 2013 were
   studied. Patients were divided on the basis of access site. Patterns of
   access use and baseline demographics were noted. Unadjusted and
   propensity-matched analyses were performed comparing in-hospital
   bleeding, vascular complications, and mortality outcomes among
   transradial and transfemoral access patients. The falsification endpoint
   of gastrointestinal bleeding was specified to assess for persistent
   unmeasured confounding.
   RESULTS Transradial access was used in 14.2\% of cases. In
   propensity-matched analyses, transradial rescue PCI was associated with
   significantly less bleeding than transfemoral access (odds ratio {[}OR]:
   0.67; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 0.52 to 0.87; p = 0.003), but not
   mortality (OR: 0.81; 95\% CI: 0.53 to 1.25; p = 0.35). Gastrointestinal
   bleeding was less frequent in the radial group (OR: 0.23; 95\% CI: 0.05
   to 0.98; p = 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS In a large, ``real-world{''} registry, transradial access
   was used in a minority of cases and was associated with significantly
   less bleeding than transfemoral access in patients undergoing rescue
   PCI. However, given persistent differences in a falsification endpoint,
   the influence of treatment-selection bias on these results cannot be
   ruled out. Further studies are needed to determine predictors of
   bleeding and mortality in this understudied high-risk group. (C) 2015 by

Abstract = {{Foreign body impaction in the upper digestive tract is not an infrequent
   emergency in every clinical setup. In the present retrospective study,
   we have tried to analyze the incidence of impacted foreign body in the
   upper digestive tract at our center. The most frequent presentation is
   history of foreign body ingestion or aspiration. They are chiefly
   produced by accidental swallowing of the foreign body in the extremes of
   age and deliberate attempts in case of psychiatric and criminal
   background subjects. Varied manifestations of dysphagia, drooling of
   saliva and retro-sternal pain is presented. Additional symptoms of
   vomiting and subjective sensation of breathlessness are present
   occasionally. Removal of foreign body at times is a challenge for the
   gastrointestinal endoscopist. If not intervened expeditiously, can lead
   to horrific outcome. In our review study, rigid endoscopy resolved the
   problem in majority of cases by removal of the foreign body or
   dislodgement of the impacted fleshy meat ball in to the stomach. We
   report a retrospective study of incident and types of impacted foreign
   body in the upper digestive tract. The study was carried out at a
   Tertiary Care Center at Gangtok, India, spread over 5 years. The review
   of the case details was tabulated and the incidence types and outcome
   was calculated to review the clinical condition and its management.}},

Title = {{Why are primary school children overweight and obese? A cross sectional
   study undertaken in Kinondoni district, Dar-es-salaam}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: The world is experiencing an alarming increase in prevalence
   of childhood obesity. Despite this trend little is known about
   determinants of childhood obesity in Tanzania. A cross sectional study
   determined the prevalence and factors associated with overweight and
   obesity in 1722 children aged 7-14 years (10.9 +/- 1.74) attending
   primary schools in Dar es Salaam.
   Methods: Six public and four private schools were systemically selected
   from a total of 227 primary schools. Anthropometric measurements (weight
   and height) were collected using a standard protocol and Body Mass Index
   (BMI) was calculated. Interviews collected demographic characteristics
   and lifestyle factors. Multiple logistic regression test was used to
   assess the influence of independent variables on overweight and obesity
   while controlling for confounding factors. The level of significance was
   set at a = 5 \%.
   Results: Of 1, 722 children 10.2 \% were overweight and 4.5 \% were
   obese. Overweight and obesity was higher in boys (14.9 \%) than girls
   (14.5 \%), higher in children attending private schools (27.7 \%) than
   public schools (5.9 \%). Children who walked to and from school were
   less likely to be overweight or obese than those who used vehicles (AOR
   = 0.5; 95\% CI: 0.3-0.6; p < 0.001). Those who used private cars or
   school buses were more likely to be overweight or obese than those who
   used public transport (AOR = 2.9; 95\% CI: 0.2-0.7; p< 0.05).
   Computer/video game use were associated with increased risk of
   overweight and obesity (AOR = 1.6; 95\% CI: 1.1-2.3; p = 0.03). Lunch
   provided by schools was associated with increased risk of overweight or
   obese (AOR = 6.4, 95 \% CI = 4.2-9.6, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: The findings of this study identified a number of
   behavioural and dietary factors that are related to overweight and
   obesity. Parents and teachers should encourage children to be physically
   active by limiting screen time and promoting active transport to and
   from school to promote health and reduce obesity. Ministry of education
   needs to formulate/enforce policies that encourage physical activities
   for school children and regulate quality of foods provided to children
   at schools.}},

Title = {{The Immunoglobulin-like Gene spe-45 Acts during Fertilization in
   Caenorhabditis elegans like the Mouse Izumo1 Gene}},

Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{The Caenorhabditis elegans spe-9 class genes, which show specific or
   predominant expression in the male germline, are indispensable for
   fertilization {[}1, 2]. However, due to the rapid evolution of genes
   involved in reproduction, we do not currently know if there are spe-9
   class genes in mammals that play similar roles during fertilization to
   those found in C. elegans. In mice, the Izumo1 gene encodes a
   sperm-specific transmembrane (TM) protein with a single immunoglobulin
   (Ig)-like domain that is absolutely required for gamete fusion {[}3, 4].
   In this study, we hypothesized that C. elegans has a new member of the
   spe-9 class genes coding for an IZUMO1-like protein. We screened C.
   elegans microarray data {[}5, 6] to identify male germline-enriched
   genes that encode membrane proteins with Ig-like domains. A deletion
   (tm3715) in one such gene (F28D1.8) caused hermaphrodites to show a male
   germline-dependent self-sterility, so we have named it spe-45. Mutant
   spe-45 worms seemed to normally undergo spermatogenesis (spermatid
   production by meiosis) and spermiogenesis (spermatid activation into
   actively motile spermatozoa). spe-45 mutant spermatozoa, however, could
   not complete gamete fusion, which is a characteristic of all spe-9 class
   mutants {[}1, 2]. Moreover, spe-45 self-sterile worms were rescued by a
   transgene expressing chimeric SPE-45 protein in which its Ig-like domain
   was replaced by the Ig-like domain from mouse IZUMO1. Hence, C. elegans
   SPE-45 and mouse IZUMO1 appear to have retained a common function(s)
   that is required during fertilization.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, a lot of work was done that has revealed some very
   interesting properties of neutron stars. One can relate the first few
   multipole moments of a neutron star, or quantities that can be derived
   from them, with relations that are independent of the equation of state
   (EoS). This is a very significant result that has great implications for
   the description of neutron stars and in particular for the description
   of the spacetime around them. Additionally, it was recently shown that
   there is a four-parameter analytic spacetime, known as the two-soliton
   spacetime, which can accurately capture the properties of the geometry
   around neutron stars. This allows for the possibility of describing in a
   unified formalism the astrophysically relevant properties of the
   spacetime around a neutron star independently of the particulars of the
   EoS for the matter of the star. More precisely, the description of these
   astrophysical properties is done using an EoS omniscient spacetime that
   can describe the exterior of any neutron star. In the present work, we
   investigate properties such as the location of the innermost stable
   circular orbit RISCO (or the surface of the star when the latter
   overcomes the former), the various frequencies of perturbed circular
   equatorial geodesics, the efficiency of an accretion disc, its
   temperature distribution, and other properties associated with the
   emitted radiation from the disc, in a way that holds for all possible
   choices of a realistic EoS for the neutron star. Furthermore, we provide
   proof of principle that if one were to measure the right combinations of
   pairs of these properties, with the additional knowledge of the mass of
   the neutron star, one could determine the EoS of the star.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: The quantification and longitudinal monitoring of athlete training
   load (TL) provides a scientific explanation for changes in performance
   and helps manage injury/illness risk. Therefore, accurate and reliable
   monitoring tools are essential for the optimization of athletic
   performance. The aim of the present study was to establish the
   relationship between measures of internal {[}heart rate (HR) and session
   RPE (sRPE)] and external TL specific to wheelchair rugby (WR).
   Methods: Fourteen international WR athletes (age = 29 +/- 7 years: body
   mass = 58.9 +/- 10.9 kg) were monitored during 18 training sessions over
   a 3 month period during the competitive phase of the season. Activity
   profiles were collected during each training session using a radio
   frequency based indoor tracking system (ITS). External TL was quantified
   by total distance (m) covered as well as time spent and distance covered
   in a range of classification-specific arbitrary speed zones. Banister's
   TRIMP, Edwards's summated HR zone (SHRZ), and Lucia's TRIMP methods were
   used to quantify physiological internal TL. sRPE was calculated as the
   product of session duration multiplied by perceived exertion using the
   Borg CR10 scale. Relationships between external and internal TL were
   examined using correlation coefficients and the 90\% confidence
   intervals (90\% CI).
   Results: sRPE (r = 0.59) and all HR based (r > 0.80) methods showed
   large and very large relationships with the total distance covered
   during training sessions, respectively. Large and very large
   correlations (r = 0.56 - 0.82) were also observed between all measures
   of internal TL and times spent and distances covered in low and moderate
   intensity speed zones. HR based methods showed very large relationships
   with time (r = 0.71 - 0.75) and distance (r = 0.70 - 0.73) in the very
   high speed zone and a large relationship with the number of high
   intensity activities (HIA) performed (r = 0.56 - 0.62). Weaker
   relationships (r = 0.32 - 0.35) were observed between sRPE and all
   measures of high intensity activity. A large variation of individual
   correlation co-efficient was observed between sRPE and all external TL
   measures.
   Conclusion: The current findings suggest that sRPE and HR-based internal
   TL measures provide a valid tool for quantifying volume of external TL
   during WR training but may underestimate HIA. It is recommended that
   both internal and external TL measures are employed for the monitoring
   of overall TL during court-based training in elite WR athletes.}},

Title = {{An industrial scale process for the enzymatic removal of steryl
   glucosides from biodiesel}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: Biodiesels produced from transesterification of vegetable
   oils have a major quality problem due to the presence of precipitates,
   which need to be removed to avoid clogging of filters and engine
   failures. These precipitates have been reported to be mostly composed of
   steryl glucosides (SGs), but so far industrial cost-effective methods to
   remove these compounds are not available. Here we describe a novel
   method for the efficient removal of SGs from biodiesel, based on the
   hydrolytic activity of a thermostable beta-glycosidase obtained from
   Thermococcus litoralis.
   Results: A steryl glucosidase (SGase) enzyme from T. litoralis was
   produced and purified from Escherichia coli cultures expressing a
   synthetic gene, and used to treat soybean-derived biodiesel. Several
   optimization steps allowed for the selection of optimal reaction
   conditions to finally provide a simple and efficient process for the
   removal of SGs from crude biodiesel. The resulting biodiesel displayed
   filterability properties similar to distilled biodiesel according to the
   total contamination (TC), the cold soak filtration test (CSFT), filter
   blocking tendency (FBT), and cold soak filter blocking tendency (CSFBT)
   tests. The process was successfully scaled up to a 20 ton reactor,
   confirming its adaptability to industrial settings.
   Conclusions: The results presented in this work provide a novel path for
   the removal of steryl glucosides from biodiesel using a cost-effective,
   environmentally friendly and scalable enzymatic process, contributing to
   the adoption of this renewable fuel.}},

Abstract = {{We present the pulsation and spectral characteristics of the High-Mass
   X-ray Binary (HMXB) 4U 0114+65 during a Suzaku observation covering the
   part of the orbit that included the previously known low-intensity
   emission of the source (dip) and the egress from this state. This dip
   has been interpreted in previous works as an X-ray eclipse. Notably, in
   this Suzaku observation, the count rate during and outside the dip vary
   by a factor of only 2-4 at odds with the eclipses of other HMXBs, where
   the intensity drops up to two orders of magnitude. The orbital intensity
   profile of 4U 0114+65 is characterized by a narrow dip in the RXTE-ASM
   (2-12 keV) light curve and a shallower one in the Swift-BAT (15-50 keV),
   which is different from eclipse ingress/egress behaviour of other HMXBs.
   The time-resolved spectral analysis reveal moderate absorption column
   density (N-H - 2-20 x 10(22) atoms cm(-2)) and a relatively low
   equivalent width (similar to 30 and 12 eV of the iron K alpha and K beta
   lines, respectively) as opposed to the typical X-ray spectra of HMXBs
   during eclipse where the equivalent width is similar to 1 keV. Both
   X-ray Imaging Spectrometer and HXD-PIN data show clear pulsations during
   the dip, which we have further confirmed using the entire archival data
   of the IBIS/ISGRI and JEM-X instruments onboard INTEGRAL. The results we
   presented question the previous interpretation of the dip in the light
   curve of 4U 0114+65 as an X-ray eclipse. We thus discuss alternative
   interpretations of the periodic dip in the light curve of 4U 0114+65.}},

Title = {{Task-Specific Dystonia in Professional Musicians A Systematic Review of
   the Importance of Intensive Playing as a Risk Factor}},

Abstract = {{Background: Focal dystonia in professional musicians is a movement
   disorder that manifests itself during playing. It is a multifactorial
   condition in which a genetic predisposition and exogenous factors both
   play a role. Evidence suggests that intensive playing is a risk factor
   for the development of task-specific dystonia in professional musicians.
   Methods: This review is based on pertinent publications (1950-2013)
   retrieved by a systematic search in medical and musicological databases.
   The references of the retrieved publications were also considered in the
   search.
   Results: 16 articles with clinical information on a total of 1144
   affected musicians were reviewed systematically. Their overall quality
   was intermediate to poor, and a meta-analysis was therefore not
   possible. The Bradford Hill criteria were applied to study a possible
   causative link between intensive playing and musician's dystonia.
   Musician's dystonia generally arises after at least ten years of
   intensive playing (corresponding to roughly 10 000 hours of practice).
   An association was found between the affected limb and the type of
   instrument: the limb that is subject to the greatest fine motor demands
   is the one most commonly affected. The average age of onset is 28 to 44
   years.
   Conclusion: The Bradford Hill causality criteria indicate that intensive
   playing is related to the development of musician's dystonia. In
   particular, the association of the type of instrument with the site of
   dystonia supports this thesis. The findings imply that task-specific
   dystonia in professional musicians should be included in the list of
   occupational diseases in Germany.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{143}},

Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{We present a Kadanoff-Baym formalism to study time-dependent phenomena
   for systems of interacting electrons and phonons in the framework of
   many-body perturbation theory. The formalism takes correctly into
   account effects of the initial preparation of an equilibrium state and
   allows for an explicit time-dependence of both the electronic and
   phononic degrees of freedom. The method is applied to investigate the
   charge neutral and non-neutral excitation spectra of a homogeneous,
   two-site, two-electron Holstein model. This is an extension of a
   previous study of the ground state properties in the Hartree (H),
   partially self-consistent Born (Gd) and fully self-consistent Born (GD)
   approximations published in Sakkinen et al. {[}J. Chem. Phys. 143,
   234101 (2015)]. Here, the homogeneous ground state solution is shown to
   become unstable for a sufficiently strong interaction while a
   symmetry-broken ground state solution is shown to be stable in the
   Hartree approximation. Signatures of this instability are observed for
   the partially self-consistent Born approximation but are not found for
   the fully self-consistent Born approximation. By understanding the
   stability properties, we are able to study the linear response regime by
   calculating the density-density response function by time-propagation.
   This amounts to a solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation with a
   sophisticated kernel. The results indicate that none of the
   approximations is able to describe the response function during or
   beyond the bipolaronic crossover for the parameters investigated.
   Overall, we provide an extensive discussion on when the approximations
   are valid and how they fail to describe the studied exact properties of
   the chosen model system. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{After synthesis and transit through the nucleus, messenger RNAs (mRNAs)
   are exported to the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). At
   the NPC, messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) first encounter the
   nuclear basket where mRNP rearrangements are thought to allow access to
   the transport channel. Here, we use single mRNA resolution live cell
   microscopy and subdiffraction particle tracking to follow individual
   mRNAs on their path toward the cytoplasm. We show that when reaching the
   nuclear periphery, RNAs are not immediately exported but scan along the
   nuclear periphery, likely to find a nuclear pore allowing export.
   Deletion or mutation of the nuclear basket proteins MP1/2 or the mRNA
   binding protein Nab2 changes the scanning behavior of mRNPs at the
   nuclear periphery, shortens residency time at nuclear pores, and results
   in frequent release of mRNAs back into the nucleoplasm. These
   observations suggest a role for the nuclear basket in providing an
   interaction platform that keeps RNAs at the periphery, possibly to allow
   mRNP rearrangements before export.}},

Abstract = {{The structure and dynamics of hydrogen-bonded structures are of
   significant importance in understanding many binary mixtures. Since
   self-diffusion is very sensitive to changes in the molecular weight and
   shape of the diffusing species, hydrogen-bonded associated structures in
   dimethylsulfoxide-methanol (DMSO-MeOH) and DMSO-ethanol (DMSO-EtOH)
   mixtures are investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
   diffusion experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations over the
   entire composition range at 298K. The self-diffusion coefficients of
   DMSO-MeOH and DMSO-EtOH mixtures decrease by up to 15\% and 10\%,
   respectively, with DMSO concentration, indicating weaker association as
   compared to DMSO-water mixtures. The calculated heat of mixing and
   radial distribution functions reveal that the intermolecular structures
   of DMSO-MeOH and DMSO-EtOH mixtures do not change on mixing.
   DMSO-alcohol hydrogen-bonded dimers are the dominant species in
   mixtures. Direct comparison of the simulated and experimental data
   afford greater insights into the structural properties of binary
   mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{The forced translocation of homopolymers through alpha beta alpha
   sandwich-like compound channels was investigated by Monte Carlo
   simulation. The interaction between polymer and part a is strongly
   attractive, whereas that between polymer and part beta is purely
   repulsive. Simulation results show that the translocation is influenced
   obviously by the length of part beta (L beta) and the starting position
   of part beta (L-alpha 1). For small L beta, the translocation is mainly
   governed by the escaping process, and polymer is trapped near the exit
   of the channel. However, the translocation time can be tuned by varying
   L-alpha 1 and the fastest translocation can be achieved at relatively
   large L-alpha 1. Whereas for large L beta and small L-alpha 1, the
   translocation is mainly controlled by the filling process. It is
   difficult for polymer to enter the channel, and polymer is trapped at
   the first alpha beta interface. Finally, the dynamics for the filling
   process and the escaping process are discussed from the view of
   free-energy landscape, respectively. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Dintor: functional annotation of genomic and proteomic data}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: During the last decade, a great number of extremely valuable
   large-scale genomics and proteomics datasets have become available to
   the research community. In addition, dropping costs for conducting
   high-throughput sequencing experiments and the option to outsource them
   considerably contribute to an increasing number of researchers becoming
   active in this field. Even though various computational approaches have
   been developed to analyze these data, it is still a laborious task
   involving prudent integration of many heterogeneous and frequently
   updated data sources, creating a barrier for interested scientists to
   accomplish their own analysis.
   Results: We have implemented Dintor, a data integration framework that
   provides a set of over 30 tools to assist researchers in the exploration
   of genomics and proteomics datasets. Each of the tools solves a
   particular task and several tools can be combined into data processing
   pipelines. Dintor covers a wide range of frequently required
   functionalities, from gene identifier conversions and orthology mappings
   to functional annotation of proteins and genetic variants up to
   candidate gene prioritization and Gene Ontology-based gene set
   enrichment analysis. Since the tools operate on constantly changing
   datasets, we provide a mechanism to unambiguously link tools with
   different versions of archived datasets, which guarantees reproducible
   results for future tool invocations. We demonstrate a selection of
   Dintor's capabilities by analyzing datasets from four representative
   publications. The open source software can be downloaded and installed
   on a local Unix machine. For reasons of data privacy it can be
   configured to retrieve local data only. In addition, the Dintor tools
   are available on our public Galaxy web service at
   http://dintor.eurac.edu.
   Conclusions: Dintor is a computational annotation framework for the
   analysis of genomic and proteomic datasets, providing a rich set of
   tools that cover the most frequently encountered tasks. A major
   advantage is its capability to consistently handle multiple versions of
   tool-associated datasets, supporting the researcher in delivering
   reproducible results.}},

Abstract = {{Kinship terms have been found to be highly diverse across languages.
   Here we investigated the brain representation of kinship terms in two
   distinct populations, native Chinese and Caucasian English speakers,
   with a five-element kinship identification (FEKI) task. The neuroimaging
   results showed a common extensive frontal and parietal lobe brain
   activation pattern for different kinship levels for both Chinese and
   Caucasian English speakers. Furthermore, Chinese speakers had longer
   reaction times and elicited more fronto-parietal brain networks
   activation compared to English speakers in level three (e.g., uncle and
   nephew) and four (e.g., cousin), including an association between the
   middle frontal gyrus and superior parietal lobe, which might be
   associated with higher working memory, attention control, and social
   distance representation load in Chinese kinship system processing. These
   results contribute to our understanding of the representation of kinship
   terms in the two languages.}},

Abstract = {{Nanodiamond-graphene core-shell materials have several unique properties
   compared with purely sp(2)-bonded nanocarbons and perform remarkably
   well as metal-free catalysts. In this work, we report that palladium
   nanoparticles supported on nanodiamond-graphene core-shell materials
   (Pd/ND@G) exhibit superior catalytic activity in CO oxidation compared
   to Pd NPs supported on an sp2-bonded onion-like carbon (Pd/OLC)
   material. Characterization revealed that the Pd NPs in Pd/ND@G have a
   special morphology with reduced crystallinity and are more stable
   towards sintering at high temperature than the Pd NPs in Pd/OLC. The
   electronic structure of Pd is changed in Pd/ND@G, resulting in weak CO
   chemisorption on the Pd NPs. Our work indicates that strong
   metal-support interactions can be achieved on a non-reducible support,
   as exemplified for nanocarbon, by carefully tuning the surface structure
   of the support, thus providing a good example for designing a
   high-performance nanostructured catalyst.}},

   it is also found that the device behaves as a highly efficient spin

Abstract = {{Larval retention plays a fundamental role in the persistence of coastal
   fish assemblages. Here, we examine larval fish distribution and
   abundance patterns in Palma Bay, a large (similar to 20 km) wind-driven
   microtidal bay in the southern coast of Mallorca (Spain, NW
   Mediterranean Sea). Larval fish assemblage structure in the bay were
   analyzed during July 2010 and interpreted in the context of the observed
   circulation patterns, adult habitat distribution and spawning traits.
   Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) observations showed the
   presence of retentive flow patterns in the middle of the bay enhancing
   local larval accumulation and self-recruitment. In consequence, larval
   abundances were higher in this central part of the bay (similar to 40 m
   depth, mean abundance 607.6 +/- 383 ind. 10 m(-2)) than along the
   coastal fringe (<35 m 113.7 +/- 91 ind. 10 m(-2)). Also, a multivariate
   predictive approach based on Redundancy Analysis (RDA) revealed
   differences between the larval fish assemblages in areas inside the bay,
   constituted by small pelagic and benthopelagic taxa (gobids, Chromis
   chromis and Serranus hepatus) and offshore larvae, mostly from meso and
   large pelagic fish. These larval fish assemblages were structured
   according to depth variations and zooplankton abundance, and remained
   relatively unmixed because of the circulation patterns in the mouth of
   the bay that uncouple its dynamics from alongshelf circulation. Even
   larvae of typically pelagic species that spawn close to the coast
   (Sardinella aurita, Auxis rochei) were associated with the retentive
   effect of the bay. Our study highlights the important role of coastal
   bays in the regulation of coastal fish population dynamics and as
   hotspots for the maintenance of diversity in the Mediterranean Sea. (c)

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel method for representing three-dimensional
   (3D) range data within regular two-dimensional (2D) images using
   multiwavelength encoding. These 2D images can then be further compressed
   using traditional lossless (e.g., PNG) or lossy (e.g., JPEG) image
   compression techniques. Current 3D range data compression methods
   require significant filtering to reduce lossy compression artifacts. The
   nature of the proposed encoding, however, offers a significant level of
   robustness to such artifacts brought about by high levels of JPEG
   compression. This enables extremely high compression ratios while
   maintaining a very low reconstruction error percentage with little to no
   filtering required to remove compression artifacts. For example, when
   encoding 3D geometry with the proposed method and storing the resulting
   2D image with Matlab R2014a JPEG80 image compression, compression ratios
   of approximately 935:1 versus the OBJ format can be achieved at an error
   rate of approximately 0.027\% without any filtering. (C) 2015 Optical

Abstract = {{The spontaneous adsorption of Sb onto nanostructured platinum
   electrodeposited films with a preferential (100) surface orientation,
   hereafter denoted Pt-100 pref, was studied by means of electrochemical
   quartz microbalance (EQCM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. EQCM
   results indicated the formation of a Sb monolayer, while XPS analyses
   confirmed that a fraction of the as-adsorbed Sb adatoms were in a
   metallic state, while the others were in an oxidized state. After
   cycling, all of the Sb adatoms were in a metallic state. The
   electrocatalytic performances towards formic acid oxidation were
   assessed through cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. On Pt-100
   pref, the presence of Sb markedly increased the current on the forward
   scan up to the potential value (typically 0.20 V) corresponding to a
   redox reaction occurring on the adatom. After one hour of electrolysis,
   the current on the Pt-100 pref electrode covered with 75\% Sb was ca. 15
   mA cm(geometric)(-2) at 0.14 V vs SCE, which is 100 times higher than on
   the bate Pt-100 pref electrode. The short- and long-term activities of
   the Pt-100 pref electrode were maintained even when the electrode was
   disoriented through potential cycling in the Pt oxide formation and
   reduction region. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Polyurethane/graphene (PU/RGO) nanocomposites were prepared by in situ
   polymerization of the residual hydroxyl or carboxyl groups on graphene
   with the castor oil-based polyurethane prepolymer, and their molecular
   structures were characterized by FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. In
   addition, the thermal stability and morphological structure and
   resistivity-temperature behavior of PU/RGO nanocomposites were
   investigated by thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and ZC36 high resistance
   meter, respectively. The results indicated that the addition of the
   graphene led to the increase in the cross-linked network owing to the
   reaction of more NCO groups of PU with graphenes, and the enhancement in
   physical crosslink amongst the polyurethane-based composites owing to
   the effect of the relative free graphene residual. As a result, the
   PU/RGO composites showed a slight increase in room-temperature
   resistivity due to the combined effect of crosslink network and physical
   crosslink reaction on the conductive network. When the temperature value
   reached a critical temperature, the rapid expansion of the volume of
   PU-based polymer destroyed the significant reductive network of
   graphene, resulting in the remarkable enhancement in the
   resistivity-temperature behavior of PU/RGO composites. Especially, at
   the loading of 3 wt\% graphene hybrid filler in PU matrix, PTCR behavior
   of the composites was observed with resistivity increase of nearly 3
   orders of magnitude. Therefore, it is expected that the PU-based
   composites with a few contents of graphene might be the promising PTCR
   materials.}},

Journal = {{ACTA PHYSICA SINICA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{Based on the laser-induced-phase model, periodic quantum phase
   modulation of the dipole response in atomic He is studied theoretically.
   The two-level system of the transition 1s(2) -> 1s2p with a delay width
   of 1.8 x 10(9) s(-1) and an energy difference of 21.2 eV between the
   excited state and the ground state is used in the calculation. The
   system is excited by attosecond laser pulse from high harmonic
   generator, and the spectral response of the system is of single isolated
   symmetric Lorentzian absorption line. After the excitation, near
   infrared (NIR) femtosecond laser pulse train with a repetition rate of 5
   GHz, central frequency 780 nm, and pulse duration of 100 fs, is utilized
   to periodically modify the spontaneous decay of the excited 1s2p level.
   The incremental phase step Delta phi depends on the intensity of the NIR
   laser pulse, while the initial offset phase phi can be controlled
   independently by partially overlapping the first NIR pulse with the
   excitation. Simulated results show that the Lorentzian absorption line
   is transformed into comb-like spectral structure with equal gap
   depending on the repetition rate of the NIR pulse train. The line shape
   of each comb tooth is symmetric Lorentzian line by setting phi = Delta
   phi/2 = pi/2, while it is Fano line by setting phi = Delta phi = pi. The
   location of the comb structure is mainly dependent on the energy
   difference between the excited state and the ground state, while it can
   be slightly tuned by controlling the incremental phase step Delta phi We
   develop an analytic description of the comb-like spectral structure by
   Fourier analysis, depending on both the atomic and the phase-control
   properties. The analytical expressions can be readily used to estimate
   the exact experimental parameters. The universality of this mechanism
   allows the spectral modulation in arbitrary atomic system at arbitrary
   frequency, including the hard X-ray regime, by using reference
   transitions in highly charged ions. The generalization of this approach
   should thus not only enable relative frequency measurement and relevant
   applications at extremely high frequencies, but also open the way for
   pulse shaping at arbitrary frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{We present a comprehensive catalog and analysis of broadband afterglow
   observations for 103 short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), comprised
   of all short GRBs from 2004 November to 2015 March with prompt follow-up
   observations in the X-ray, optical, near-infrared (NIR), and/or radio
   bands. These afterglow observations have uncovered 71 X-ray detections,
   30 optical/NIR detections, and 4 radio detections. Employing the
   standard afterglow synchrotron model, we perform joint probability
   analyses for a subset of 38 short GRBs with well-sampled light curves to
   infer the burst isotropic-equivalent energies and circumburst densities.
   For this subset, we find median isotropic-equivalent 7-ray and kinetic
   energies of E-gamma,E-iso approximate to 2 x 10(51) erg, and E-K, (iso)
   approximate to (1-3) x 10(51) erg, respectively, depending on the values
   of the model input parameters. We further find that short GRBs occur in
   low-density environments, with a median density of n approximate to
   (3-15) x 10(-3) cm(-3), and that 80\%-95\% of bursts have densities of n
   less than or similar to 1 cm(-3). We investigate trends between the
   circumburst densities and host galaxy properties, and find that events
   located at large projected offsets of >10 effective radii from their
   hosts exhibit particularly low densities of n less than or similar to
   10(-4) cm(-3), consistent with an intergalactic medium-like environment.
   Using late-time afterglow data for 11 events, we find a median jet
   opening angle of theta(j), = 16 +/- 10 degrees. We also calculate a
   median beaming factor of f(b) approximate to 0.04, leading to a
   beaming-corrected total energy release of E-true approximate to 1.6 x
   10(50) erg. Furthermore, we calculate a beaming-corrected event rate of
   (sic)(true) = 270(180)(-)(+1580) Gpc(-3) yr(-1), or approximate
   to(+47)(-5) within a 200 Mpc volume, the Advanced LIGO/Virgo typical
   detection distance for NS-NS binaries.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, we report the syntheses of IrO2 nanoparticles with
   SBA-15 template (s-IrO2), and s-IrO2 supported Pt nanocomposite
   (Pt/s-IrO2) as bifunctional oxygen catalyst. Physical characterizations
   including X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy
   demonstrate that s-IrO2 catalyst has excellent uniformity and regularity
   in particle shape and much ordered distribution in geometric space, and
   Pt/s-IrO2 catalyst shows a uniform Pt dispersion on the surface of the
   s-1rO(2) particles. Electrochemical analyses prove that s-IrO2 catalyst
   possesses superior OER activity at operating potentials; and that
   Pt/s-IrO2 catalyst, in comparison to Pt/commercial IrO2, has higher ESA
   value and ORR catalytic performance with a mechanism of four-electron
   pathway and a high ORR efficiency. And as a bifunctional oxygen
   catalyst, Pt/s-IrO2 also exhibits more remarkable OER performance than
   the commercial one. The s-IrO2 nanopartides will be a promising active
   component (for OER), and suitable for Pt support (for ORR). (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In Ariake Bay, Japan, two sciaenids Nibea albiflora and Pennahia
   argentata spawn in the same season and their larvae and juveniles are
   believed to co-occur. We developed a molecular method to identify larvae
   and early-stage juveniles of N. albiflora and P. argentata using
   multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) due to difficulties of species
   identification using morphological keys and compared the ontogenetic
   distribution and feeding habits in larvae and early-stage juveniles of
   both species. N. albiflora spawn in the shallow water of the inner part
   of the bay, and P. argentata spawn in the deeper waters from the middle
   to the outer part of the bay. As a result of inter-species difference in
   their preferred spawning areas, P. argentata larvae were more common
   than N. albiflora in the southern part of the bay. The larvae of both
   species tended to emerge in shallower waters toward the inside of the
   bay and juveniles were observed exclusively in the lower reaches of the
   inflowing rivers, suggesting that larvae and juveniles could be
   successfully transported to their nursery ground or retained in the bay
   without seaward dispersion. In Ariake Bay, the maximum turbidity zone is
   around the mouth and estuarine areas of the rivers in the innermost part
   of the bay and these areas are important nursery grounds for both study
   species during their early life stages, especially the early juvenile
   stage. For N. albiflora, pre-flexion and flexion larvae fed exclusively
   on small copepods, mainly Oithona davisae, whereas post-flexion and
   juveniles fed mainly on a large copepod, Sinocalanus sinensis, and
   mysids. P. argentata larvae and juveniles consistently fed on copepods,
   mainly Paracalanidae. Both species consumed small prey throughout the
   larval stages and the smallest prey consumed by juveniles was larger
   than that consumed by larvae. The size of the largest prey consumed by
   larvae and juveniles of both species tended to increase throughout
   development. The similarity of morphological features and ontogenetic
   distribution patterns between species suggest that the observed
   differences in diet composition of both species may result from
   differences in selective feeding by larval and juvenile N. albiflora and
   P. argentata. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A self-contained cartridge and an integrated operating prototype for
   automated molecular testing are described. This newly developed
   polymeric cartridge consists of multiple chambers self-containing all
   necessary reagents such as specimens, lysis, wash, and elution buffers.
   The cartridge is designed for optimal point-of-care testing. The
   operator can simply load a specimen into a chamber of the cartridge,
   then install the cartridge, and run the operating instrument. The
   fluidic movement inside the cartridge including reagents mixing, nucleic
   acids capturing, wastes-out and eluates collection are controlled by
   pneumatic actuations of syringe/piston sets and magnet/valve controls.
   The performance of the sample preparation efficiency on the cartridge
   was tested using Salmonella bacteria. The cartridge and the operating
   protocols need further modifications for optimal performance. However,
   the cartridge and the operating prototype have the potential to become
   applicable as a sample-in-answer-out tool of molecular diagnostics such
   as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or other amplification methods such

Abstract = {{In this work, IAPSO (International Association for the Physical Sciences
   of the Oceans) Standard Seawater has been characterized by measuring the
   speed of sound in the temperature range of (273.15 and 313.15) K and in
   the absolute salinity range of (10.036 and 38.201) g . kg(-1), for
   pressures up to 70 MPa. Measurements are traceable to ITS-90
   temperature, pressure and salinity reference standards. The experimental
   apparatus was also adapted to measure the speed of sound (SoS) in North
   Atlantic Seawater in the same temperature range at atmospheric pressure.
   These results are compared with those measured using four different
   commercial oceanographic sensors. The results in North Atlantic Seawater
   showed that, at least at atmospheric pressure, measurements with a
   typical uncertainty of 0.04\% can be obtained if the sensors are
   previously calibrated with pure water in the same speed of sound range
   where they will be utilized during oceanographic cruises. In the case of
   North Atlantic Seawater at atmospheric pressure, when experimental
   results are compared with those predicted by TEOS-10 equation of state,
   the agreement is generally better than 0.03\%. At higher pressures,
   speed of sound results, measured in IAPSO Standard Seawater, show an
   agreement on the order of 0.06\% with the exception of the sample with
   absolute salinity equal to 10.036 g . kg(-1). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

   rather complex process which is composed of physical, chemical,
   biochemical and biological stages. Nowadays, although ionizing radiation
   has been widely used in plant mutation breeding, the theoretical
   explanations for the mechanism of the ionizing radiation caused plant
   mutation effects are insufficient. Especially, a saddle shape
   relationship between the plant survival rate and radiation dose is found
   in the mutagenis effect of ionizing radiation on plants. The underlying
   mechanism of the saddle shape relationship remains unclear and
   challenges to all extant models.
   To explain this relationship, a damage-repair model for the plant
   mutation effects induced by ionizing radiation is proposed in the
   present work. Our model is based on the rate theory of ionizing
   radiation in which the cell damage and repair are taken into account
   simultaneously together with the micro-and macro-biological mutation
   effects of plant caused by ionizing radiation. The states of the
   radiated plant individuals are grouped into three categories: normal,
   damaged and lethal categories in our model. The evolution dynamics of
   the relative concentrations of the three categories are determined by a
   set of coupled equations which are mathematically the same as the
   Crow-Kimura equations in species evolution theories. With the numerical
   solution of our model in its steady state, the relative steady state
   concentration distributions of different categories of the radiated
   plants with increasing radiation dose are obtained. It is shown that
   without the plant repair effect, the relationship between the plant
   survival rate and radiation dose appears to be a conventional shoulder
   type one. With the plant repair effect, our model gives a saddle shape
   survival-dose relationship which has been observed commonly in the
   experiments on the radiated plants by ionizing radiation. To further
   test the model, the experimental data on the inbred lines of maizes
   radiated by heavy ion Li-7 are used to determine the parameters of the
   model. It is shown that the theoretical results are basically consistent
   with the experimental ones. In addition, the mutation characteristic of
   the survival plants also appears to be a saddle effect-dose
   relationship, for which the theoretical model could also give a
   reasonable explanation. Our damage-repair model explains the saddle
   shape relationship between the plant survival rate and radiation dose,
   which indeed illuminates its power. And it provides a theoretical basis
   and reference for studying the biological effect mechanism of plants
   induced by ionizing radiation and conducting ionizing radiation plant
   breeding.}},

Title = {{An automatic approach for urban land-cover classification from Landsat-8
   OLI data}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{5983-6007}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{Due to the lack of clear shape, texture characteristics, and abundant
   spectral or spatial information of urban objects, traditional
   per-/sub-pixel analysis and interpretation for
   moderate-resolution-remote sensing data are always confused by such
   shortcomings as dependence on special skills, requirements to a priori
   knowledge and training samples, complex process, time-consuming and
   subjective operations, etc.. In order to alleviate such disadvantages,
   an automatic approach is proposed to classify vegetation, water,
   impervious surface areas (dark and bright), and bare land from the
   Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor data of Landsat-8 in urban areas,
   which can be employed by common users to automatically obtain land-cover
   maps for urban applications. In detail, a preliminary classification
   result is achieved based on a new vegetation and water masking index
   (VWMI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and a new
   normalized difference bare land index (NDBLI), which are acquired
   automatically from the remote-sensing images based on available
   knowledge of spectral properties. VWMI is designed to extract vegetation
   and water information together with a simpler threshold, while NDBLI is
   developed to identify dark impervious surfaces and bare land in this
   work. A modification strategy is further proposed to improve preliminary
   classification results by a linear model. For this purpose, a stable
   sample selection method based on the histogram is developed to select
   training samples from the preliminary classification result and to build
   a non-linear support vector machine (SVM) model to reclassify the
   classes. For validation and comparison purposes, the proposed approach
   is evaluated via experiments with real OLI data of two study areas,
   Nanjing and Ordos. The results demonstrate that the approach is
   effective in automatically obtaining urban land-cover classification
   maps from OLI data for thematic analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Metabolomics is the study of small molecules, or `metabolites', that are
   the end products of biological processes. While -omics technologies such
   as genomics, transcriptoinics, and proteomics measure the metabolic
   potential of organisms, metabolomics provides detailed information on
   the organic compounds produced during metabolism and found within cells
   and in the environment. Improvements in analytical techniques have
   expanded our understanding of metabolomics and developments in
   computational tools have made metabolomics data accessible to a broad
   segment of the scientific community. Yet, metabolomics methods have only
   been applied to a limited number of projects in the marine environment.
   Here, we review analysis techniques for mass spectrometry data and
   summarize the current state of metabolomics databases. We then describe
   a boutique database developed in our laboratory for efficient data
   analysis and selection of mass spectral targets for metabolite
   identification. The code to implement the database is freely available
   on GitHub (https://github.com/joefutrelle/domdb). Data organization and
   analysis are critical, but often under-appreciated, components of
   metabolomics research. Future advances in environmental metabolomics
   will take advantage of continued development of new tools that
   facilitate analysis of large metabolomics datasets. (C) 2015 The

Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{In order to attain better reconstruction quality from compressive
   sensing (CS) of images, exploitation of the dependency or correlation
   patterns among the transform coefficients commonly has been employed. In
   this paper, we study a new image sensing technique, called compressive
   image sensing (CIS), with computational complexity O(m(2)), where m
   denotes the length of a measurement vector y = phi x, which is sampled
   from the signal x of length n via the sampling matrix phi with
   dimensionality m x n. CIS is basically a variation on compressive
   sampling.
   The contributions of CIS include: (i) reconstruction speed is extremely
   fast due to a closed-form solution being derived; (ii) certain
   reconstruction accuracy is preserved because significant components of x
   can be reconstructed with higher priority via an elaborately designed
   phi; and (iii) in addition to conventional 1D sensing, we also study 2D
   separate sensing to enable simultaneous acquisition and compression of
   large-sized images. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Here we report the use of LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-delta/carbon nanotube (LNF/CNT)
   hybrids as novel and robust anode catalysts that are in situ fabricated

   humidified methane. TEM observations confirm the formation of CNTs with
   the inner diameter and the wall thickness both at approximate to 15 nm.
   Combined XRD and EDX analyses show that LNF oxides decompose into a
   mixture of La2O3, FeNi3 alloy and LaFeO3, where FeNi3 alloy particles
   have an average diameter of 45 nm, largely exist outside of these CNTs
   and are surrounded by nano-scale La2O3 and LaFeO3 oxides. The LNF/CNT
   hybrids exhibit superior catalytic activities for methane oxidation
   reactions, yielding low anode polarization resistances of 0.22 Omega

Abstract = {{Dissolved gallium (Ga) concentrations are presented from the Beaufort
   Sea, representing the first reported values of Ga in the Arctic Ocean.
   Profiles of dissolved Ga in this region reflect Pacific and Atlantic
   Oceans source waters. Dissolved Ga concentrations of 4-6 pmol kg(-1) at
   depths <similar to 150 m are characteristic of dissolved Ga in the North
   Pacific, and at depths >similar to 350 m concentrations of 25-28 pmol
   kg(-1) are indicative of Atlantic waters. A smooth gradient of
   increasing dissolved Ga concentrations is observed through the
   thermocline, consistent with mixing of cool Pacific waters of low Ga
   concentration and relatively warm Atlantic waters of higher Ga
   concentration. Dissolved Ga is shown here to represent a complimentary
   tracer of Pacific inputs to the Western Arctic Ocean, as seasonal
   processes influencing temperature and Nitrate:Phosphate of Pacific Water
   entering the Arctic are not apparent in dissolved Ga profiles. Observed
   phosphate deficiency within nitrate deplete waters in the upper similar
   to 70 m is interpreted to result from nitrogen fixation in Pacific
   waters stored within the anticyclonic Beaufort Gyre. Conservative
   behavior of dissolved Ga within Pacific waters supports the
   interpretation here that nitrogen fixation rates calculated in this work
   are associated with Pacific source waters, as opposed to freshwater
   sources associated with the Mackenzie River or sea ice melt. Storage of
   phosphate deficient Pacific waters in the Beaufort Gyre followed by
   release and transport to the North Atlantic would result in pulses of
   phosphate deplete waters from the Arctic, impacting nitrogen fixation in
   the Atlantic Ocean. Sampling at one shelf station revealed local impacts
   on dissolved Ga concentrations, including high concentrations at shallow
   depths, interpreted to represent fresh waters inputs from the Mackenzie
   River or sea ice melt, while a restricted increase in Ga concentrations
   associated with the thermocline is suggested to result from increased
   scavenging rates within shelf environments due to increased particle
   abundance. Finally, first reports here of dissolved Ga in the Arctic
   allow comparison with profiles of dissolved Al. Distinct profiles of
   these two similar elements in the Arctic Ocean are interpreted to result
   from differential scavenging rates and vertical transport of dissolved
   Ga and Al within Atlantic sourced waters and deep basin waters. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The relationship between magnetic reconnection and plasma turbulence is
   investigated using multipoint in situ measurements from the Cluster
   spacecraft within a high-speed reconnection jet in the terrestrial
   magnetotail. We show explicitly that work done by electromagnetic fields
   on the particles, J . E, has a non-Gaussian distribution and is
   concentrated in regions of high electric current density. Hence,
   magnetic energy is converted to kinetic energy in an intermittent
   manner. Furthermore, we find that the higher-order statistics of
   magnetic field fluctuations generated by reconnection are characterized
   by multifractal scaling on magnetofluid scales and non-Gaussian global
   scale invariance on kinetic scales. These observations suggest that J .
   E within the reconnection jet has an analog in fluid-like turbulence
   theory in that it proceeds via coherent structures generated by an
   intermittent cascade. This supports the hypothesis that turbulent
   dissipation is highly nonuniform, and thus these results could have far
   reaching implications for space and astrophysical plasmas.}},

Abstract = {{To date, asteroseismology has provided core-to-surface differential
   rotation measurements in eight main-sequence stars. These stars, ranging
   in mass from similar to 1.5-9M(circle dot), show rotation profiles
   ranging from uniform to counter-rotation. Although they have a variety
   of masses, these stars all have convective cores and overlying radiative
   regions, conducive to angular momentum transport by internal gravity
   waves (IGWs). Using two-dimensional numerical simulations, we show that
   angular momentum transport by IGWs can explain all of these rotation
   profiles. We further predict that, should high mass, faster rotating
   stars be observed, the core-to-envelope differential rotation will be
   positive, but less than one.}},

Journal = {{MARINE CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{177}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{33-44}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{Distributions of dissolved iron (<0.2 mu m, dFe) and its reduced form,
   Fe(II), were measured during 3 cruises along Line P, a transect from the
   continental slope to the high nitrate, low chlorophyll (HNLC) northeast
   subarctic Pacific Ocean. Concentrations of Fe(II) ranged from below the
   detection limit (4.3 pM or less) to 330 pM, and dFe concentrations were
   as high as 3.6 nM. Maximum concentrations for both Fe(II) and dFe
   occurred in waters over the continental slope, with Fe(II) consistently
   increasing towards the bottom, consistent with Fe(II) supply from
   benthic sources on the continental shelf and slope. Low oxygen
   concentrations (similar to 10 mu M) and pH (similar to 7.5) in the North
   Pacific oxygen deficient zone (ODZ) likely serve to stabilize Fe(II) and
   may contribute to enhanced dFe release from shelf and slope sediments
   via reductive dissolution. Concentration gradients along isopycnal
   surfaces indicate that Fe(II) is transported several hundred kilometers
   from the continental slope at depth, and there is evidence that episodic
   events may advect shelf-derived Fe(II) similar distances near the
   surface. Comparison of transport times and Fe(II) half-lives suggests
   that it is unlikely for pre-formed Fe(II) to be transported these
   distances, but that sedimentary particles advected off the shelf and
   slope may constitute a continuous source of Fe(II) both at depth and
   near the surface. At the offshore stations, the Fe(II) time series
   reveals deep local maxima that are transient in time and space and are
   consistent with a sporadic Fe(II) source, such as remineralization of
   sinking particles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work a new method for determination of vaporization/sublimation
   enthalpies of aromatic compounds directly at T= 298.15 K was developed.
   This method is based on the general relationship between
   vaporization/sublimation enthalpy and enthalpies of solution and
   solvation of the studied compound in any solvent. According to this
   method the procedure for determination of vaporization (liquids) or
   sublimation (solids) enthalpy includes measurement of the solution
   enthalpy of the compound in a selected solvent and calculation of the
   solvation enthalpy for this system. A group-additivity scheme for
   calculation of salvation enthalpies is proposed. The salvation enthalpy
   of compound is estimated from the salvation enthalpy of parent aromatic
   or heteroaromatic compound and contributions of the substituent groups.
   Limiting solution enthalpies of 34 aromatic compounds (substituted
   benzenes, naphthalenes, biphenyls, pyrene, anthracene and pyridines) in
   carbon tetrachloride, benzene, acetonitrile and N,N-dimethylformamide
   were measured in the present work at 298.15 K. Vaporization/sublimation
   enthalpies of 78 aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds were determined
   directly at 298.15 K using experimentally measured solution enthalpies
   and predicted values of solvation enthalpies. The results are in good
   agreement with available literature data. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The census of exoplanets is incomplete for orbital distances larger than
   1 AU. Here, we present 41. long-period planet candidates in 38. systems
   identified by Planet Hunters based on Kepler archival data (Q0-Q17).
   Among them, 17. exhibit only one transit, 14. have two visible transits,
   and 10. have more than three visible transits. For planet candidates
   with only one visible transit, we estimate their orbital periods based
   on transit duration and host star properties. The majority of the planet
   candidates in this work (75\%) have orbital periods that correspond to
   distances of 1-3 AU from their host stars. We conduct follow-up imaging
   and spectroscopic observations to validate and characterize planet host
   stars. In total, we obtain adaptive optics images for 33. stars to
   search for possible blending sources. Six stars have stellar companions
   within 4 `'. We obtain high-resolution spectra for 6. stars to determine
   their physical properties. Stellar properties for other stars are
   obtained from the NASA Exoplanet Archive and the Kepler Stellar Catalog
   by Huber et al. We validate 7 planet candidates that have planet
   confidence over 0.997 (3 sigma level). These validated planets include 3
   single-transit planets (KIC-3558849b, KIC-5951458b, and KIC-8540376c), 3
   planets with double transits (KIC-8540376b, KIC-9663113b, and
   KIC-10525077b), and 1 planet with four transits (KIC-5437945b). This
   work provides assessment regarding the existence of planets at wide
   separations and the associated false positive rate for transiting
   observation (17\%-33\%). More than half of the long-period planets with
   at least three transits in this paper exhibit transit timing variations
   up to 41 hr, which suggest additional components that dynamically
   interact with the transiting planet candidates. The nature of these
   components can be determined by follow-up radial velocity and transit
   observations.}},

Abstract = {{Secondary metabolites produced by bacteria, fungi, algae and plants
   could affect the growth and development of biological and agricultural
   systems. This natural process that occurs worldwide is known as
   allelopathy. The main goal of this work was to investigate the influence
   of metabolites obtained from phytoplankton monocultures on the growth of
   green algae Chlorella vulgaris. We selected 6 species occurring in the
   Baltic Sea from 3 different taxonomic groups: cyanobacteria
   (Aphanizomenon flos-aquae; Planktothrix agardhii), diatoms
   (Thalassiosira pseudonana; Chaetoceros wighamii) and dinoflagellates
   (Alexandrium ostenfeldii; Prorocentrum minimum). In this study we have
   demonstrated that some of selected organisms caused allelopathic effects
   against microalgae. Both the negative and positive effects of collected
   cell-free filtrates on C vulgaris growth, chlorophyll a concentration
   and fluorescence parameters (OJIP,QY, NPQ) have been observed. No
   evidence has been found for the impact on morphology and viability of C
   vulgaris cells. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hollow spheres structured materials have been intensively pursued due to
   their unique properties for energy storage. In this paper,
   hollow-in-hollow carbon spheres (HIHCS) with a multi-shelled structure
   were successfully synthesized using a facile hard-templating procedure.
   When evaluated as anode material for lithium-ion batteries, the
   resultant HIHCS anode exhibited superior capacity and cycling stability
   than HCS. It could deliver reversible capacities of 937, 481, 401, 304
   and 236 mAh g(-1) at current densities of 0.1 A g(-1),1 A g(-1), 2 A
   g(-1), 5 A g(-1) and 10 A g(-1), respectively. And capacity fading is
   not apparent in 500 cycles at 5 A g(-1). The excellent performance of
   the HIHCS anode is ascribed to its unique hollow-in-hollow structure and
   high specific surface area. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Retrieval of leaf chlorophyll content in field crops using narrow-band

Abstract = {{Reliable estimation of leaf chlorophyll-a and -b content (chl-a+b) at
   canopy scales is essential for monitoring vegetation productivity,
   physiological stress, and nutrient availability. To achieve this,
   narrow-band vegetation indices (VIs) derived from imaging spectroscopy
   data are commonly used. However, VIs are affected by canopy structures
   other than chl-a+b, such as leaf area index (LAI) and leaf mean tilt
   angle (MTA). In this study, we evaluated the performance of 58 VIs
   reported in the literature to be chl-a+b-sensitive against a unique
   measured set of species-specific leaf angles for six crop species in
   southern Finland. We created a large simulated canopy reflectance
   database (100,000 canopy configurations) using the physically based
   PROSAIL (coupling of PROSPECT and SAIL (Scattering by Arbitrarily
   Inclined Leaves) radiative transfer models) model. The performance of
   model-simulated indices was compared against airborne AISA Eagle II
   imaging spectroradiometer data and field-measured chl-a+b, LAI, and MTA
   values. In general, LAI had a positive effect on the strength of the
   correlation between chl-a+b and VIs while MTA had a negative effect in
   both measured and simulated data. Three indices (REIP (red edge
   inflection point), TCARI (transformed chlorophyll absorption ratio
   index)/OSAVI (optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index), and CTR6
   (Carter indices)) showed strong correlations with chl-a+b and similar
   performance in model-simulated and measured data set. However, only two
   (TCARI/OSAVI and CTR6) were independent from LAI and MTA. We consider
   these two indices robust proxies of crop leaf chl-a+b.}},

Title = {{Liver transcriptomic networks reveal main biological processes
   associated with feed efficiency in beef cattle}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: The selection of beef cattle for feed efficiency (FE) traits
   is very important not only for productive and economic efficiency but
   also for reduced environmental impact of livestock. Considering that FE
   is multifactorial and expensive to measure, the aim of this study was to
   identify biological functions and regulatory genes associated with this
   phenotype.
   Results: Eight genes were differentially expressed between high and low
   feed efficient animals (HFE and LFE, respectively). Co-expression
   analyses identified 34 gene modules of which 4 were strongly associated
   with FE traits. They were mainly enriched for inflammatory response or
   inflammation-related terms. We also identified 463 differentially
   co-expressed genes which were functionally enriched for immune response
   and lipid metabolism. A total of 8 key regulators of gene expression
   profiles affecting FE were found. The LFE animals had higher feed intake
   and increased subcutaneous and visceral fat deposition. In addition, LFE
   animals showed higher levels of serum cholesterol and liver injury
   biomarker GGT. Histopathology of the liver showed higher percentage of
   periportal inflammation with mononuclear infiltrate.
   Conclusion: Liver transcriptomic network analysis coupled with other
   results demonstrated that LFE animals present altered lipid metabolism
   and increased hepatic periportal lesions associated with an inflammatory
   response composed mainly by mononuclear cells. We are now focusing to
   identify the causes of increased liver lesions in LFE animals.}},

Abstract = {{The double field theory action in the flux formulation is dimensionally
   reduced on a Calabi-Yau three-fold equipped with non-vanishing type IIB
   geometric and non-geometric fluxes. First, we rewrite the
   metric-dependent reduced DFT action in terms of quantities that can be
   evaluated without explicitly knowing the metric on the Calabi-Yau
   manifold. Second, using properties of special geometry we obtain the
   scalar potential of N = 2 gauged supergravity. After an orientifold
   projection, this potential is consistent with the scalar potential
   arising from the flux-induced superpotential, plus an additional D-term
   contribution.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) for hydrogen and
   methanol have attracted the attention of research groups for many years
   mainly because they are promising candidates for clean and renewable
   power sources. The most common commercial product used as PEM is
   Nafion((R)). However, certain limitations and high production costs
   stimulate the research of new materials. In this work, new hybrid
   proton-conducting membranes for PEMFC based on sulfonated poly(ether
   ether ketone) and an inorganic-organic polysiloxane phase were obtained
   with the objective of improving its mechanical, thermal, and chemical
   resistance properties. The hybrid membranes were prepared by dissolving
   the base polymer in DMSO and adding different amounts of the
   polysiloxane phase previously obtained from polydimethylsiloxane and a
   cross-linking agent (tetraethyl orthosilicate or phenyltrimetoxysilane).
   Membranes were characterized using infrared spectroscopy and thermal
   analysis. Macroscopic properties as water uptake, ion-exchange capacity,
   and proton conductivity were determined. The methanol permeabilities
   were in the range of 5.53x10(-7)-8.36x10(-7)cm(2)/s, which is several
   times lower than that of Nafion((R)) 117 (1.55x10(-6)cm(2)/s). The
   hybrid membranes with both cross-linkers also exhibited higher proton
   conductivity with respect to Nafion((R)) 117 (40 mS/cm) at 80 degrees C
   and 90\% relative humidity.}},

Abstract = {{Acarbose has been found to decrease some inflammatory parameters in
   diabetic patients. This study aimed to examine the influence of acarbose
   on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) risk in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients and
   on the incidence and severity of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in
   mice. In a nationwide, matched case-control study, we identified 723
   incident RA cases and selected 7,230 age-, sex- and RA diagnosis
   date-matched controls from all newly treated DM patients. We found that
   use of acarbose at >16,950 mg per year was associated with a lower RA
   risk (odds ratio 0.60; 95\% CI, 0.41-0.89). In the CIA mouse study,
   acarbose was orally administered from days -7 to 38 relative to type II
   collagen (CII) immunization. The results revealed that acarbose at the
   dose of 500 mg/kg/day attenuated the incidence and severity of arthritis
   and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-alpha,
   IL-6 and IL-17 in the paw tissues. Acarbose further decreased the
   productions of anti-CII-IgG, IL-17 and IFN-gamma by collagen-reactive
   lymph node cells. This work suggests that the use of acarbose decreased
   RA risk in DM patients and the incidence of CIA in mice. Acarbose also
   attenuated the severity of CIA via anti-inflammatory and
   immunomodulatory effects.}},

Abstract = {{Three m-substituted phenol derivatives, each with a labile benzylic
   alcohol group and bearing either protoadamantyl 4, homoadamantyl 5, or a
   cyclohexyl group 6, were synthesized and their thermal acid-catalyzed
   and, photochemical solvolytic reactivity studied; using preparative
   irradiations, fluorescence measurements, nanosecond laser flash
   photolysis, and quantum chemical calculations. The choice of
   m-hydroxy-substitution was driven by the potential for these phenolic
   systems to generate m-quinone methides on photolysis, which could
   ultimately drive the excited-state pathway, AS opposed to forming simple
   benzylic carbocations in the corresponding thermal route. Indeed,
   thermal acid-catalyzed reactions gave the corrosponding cations, which
   undergo rearrangement and elimination from 4, only elimination from 5,
   and substitution and elimination from 6: On the other hand, upon
   photoexcitation of 4-6 to S-1 in a polar protic solvent, proton
   dissociation from the phenol, coupled with elimination of the benzylic
   OH (as hydroxide ion) gave zwitterions (formal m-quinone methides). The
   zwitterions exhibit reactivity different from the corresponding cations
   due to a difference in charge distribution, as shown by DFT
   calculations. Thus, protoadamantyl zwitterion, has a less nonclassical
   character than the corresponding cation, so it does not undergo
   1,2.-shift of the carbon atom, as observed in the acid-catalyzed
   reaction.}},

Journal = {{BMC CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: Double-orifice mitral valve is an extremely rare cardiac
   anomaly possibly originating from insufficient endocardial fusion in
   embryogenesis. Severe concomitant cardiac anomalies and malfunction of
   the valve usually lead to an early diagnosis in childhood. Therefore the
   prevalence of isolated double-orifice mitral valve in adulthood is not
   known.
   Case presentation: We present the case of a 63 years old, female
   Caucasian patient with isolated double-orifice mitral valve diagnosed in
   routine echocardiographic evaluation after chemotherapy presenting
   without clinical symptoms.
   Conclusion: Trans-thoracic echocardiography is a suitable modality to
   diagnose and further assess anatomical and functional properties of the
   anomaly. In the presence of double-orifice mitral valve concomitant
   cardiac anomalies and valvular stenosis or regurgitation must be
   excluded. If an isolated double-orifice mitral valve with no functional
   abnormalities is present, no further follow-up is necessary.}},

Abstract = {{A computational examination of the tandem Nazarov/cycloaddition process
   involving an allenyl vinyl ketone with a diene has been carried out
   using the omega B97X-D/6-311++G(d,p)//omega B97X-D/6-31+G(d,p) method
   with solvation modeled by SMD-PCM. The barrier for the initial Lewis
   acid mediated Nazarov reaction, which provided the intermediate cyclic
   oxylallyl cation, was higher than that for any subsequent cydoaddition.
   The barrier for the first step of,a subsequent stepwise reaction did not
   vary much with the diene, and the lowest barrier was with the diene in
   its s-trans conformation. Stepwise formation of a (4 + 3) cycloaddition
   product was not energetically feasible, but (3 + 2) cycloaddition
   products could have been produced through low energy pathways. The
   barrier for a concerted (4 + 3) cycloaddition did depend upon the diene,
   which was always in an s-cis geometry. The barriers for the compact and
   the extended geometries for the transition states of (4 + 3)
   cycloadditions were not much different.}},

Abstract = {{A suspension of a map consists of the flow for which the Poincare
   section is that map. Designing a suspension of a given map remains a
   non-trivial task in general. The case of suspending the flenon map is
   here considered. Depending on the parameter values, the Henon map is
   orientation preserving or reversing; it is here shown that while a
   tridimensional suspension can be obtained in the former case, a
   four-dimensional flow is required to suspend the latter. A topological
   characterization of the three-dimensional suspension proposed by
   Starrett and Nicholas for the orientation preserving area is performed.
   A template is proposed for the four-dimensional case, for which the
   governing equations remain to be obtained. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Background: This study aimed to explore the association between feeding
   habits, non-nutritive sucking habits, and malocclusions in deciduous
   dentition.
   Methods: A cross-sectional observational survey was carried out in 275
   children aged 3 to 6 years and included clinical evaluations of
   malocclusions and structured interviews. Statistical significance for
   the association between feeding habits and the development of
   malocclusion was determined using chi-square and Fisher's exact tests.
   In addition, odds ratio (OR) calculations were used for intergroup
   comparisons. Controlling for confounders was adjusted by excluding
   children with non-nutritive sucking habits.
   Results: The results indicated that there were no significant
   relationships between exclusive breastfeeding or bottlefeeding and the
   presence of any type of malocclusion (p>0.05). There was also no
   significant association between breastfeeding or bottlefeeding duration
   and malocclusion (p>0.05). In addition, it was observed that exclusive
   breastfeeding had a protective effect and diminished the risk of
   acquiring non-nutritive sucking habits (p=0.001).
   Conclusions: There was no association between feeding habits and
   malocclusions in the deciduous dentition in this sample of children.
   Exclusive breastfeeding reduced the risk of acquiring non-nutritive
   sucking habits.}},

Title = {{Differential Occurrence of Interactions and Interaction Domains in
   Proteins Containing Homopolymeric Amino Acid Repeats}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN GENETICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{Homopolymeric amino acids repeats (AARs), which are widespread in
   proteomes, have often been viewed simply as spacers between protein
   domains, or even as ``junk{''} sequences with no obvious function but
   with a potential to cause harm upon expansion as in genetic diseases
   associated with polyglutamine or polyalanine expansions, including
   Huntington disease and cleidocranial dysplasia. A growing body of
   evidence indicates however that at least some AARs can form organized,
   functional protein structures, and can regulate protein function. In
   particular, certain AARs can mediate protein-protein interactions,
   either through homotypic AAR-AAR contacts or through heterotypic
   contacts with other protein domains. It is still unclear however,
   whether AARs may have a generalized, proteome-wide role in shaping
   protein-protein interaction networks. Therefore, we have undertaken here
   a bioinformatics screening of the human proteome and interactome in
   search of quantitative evidence of such a role. We first identified the
   sets of proteins that contain repeats of any one of the 20 amino acids,
   as well as control sets of proteins chosen at random in the proteome. We
   then analyzed the connectivity between the proteins of the
   AAR-containing protein sets and we compared it with that observed in the
   corresponding control networks. We find evidence for different degrees
   of connectivity in the different AAR-containing protein networks.
   Indeed, networks of proteins containing polyglutamine, polyglutamate,
   polyproline, and other AARs show significantly increased levels of
   connectivity, whereas networks containing polyleucine and other
   hydrophobic repeats show lower degrees of connectivity. Furthermore, we
   observed that numerous protein protein, -nucleic acid, and -lipid
   interaction domains are significantly enriched in specific AAR protein
   groups. These findings support the notion of a generalized,
   combinatorial role of AARs, together with conventional protein
   interaction domains, in shaping the interaction networks of the human
   proteome, and define proteome-wide knowledge that may guide the informed
   biological exploration of the role of AARs in protein interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The development of hydrogels that are responsive to external stimuli in
   a well-controlled manner is important for numerous biomedical
   applications. Herein we reported the first example of a hydrogel
   responsive to hydrogen sulphide (H2S). H2S is an important
   gasotransmitter whose deregulation has been associated with a number of
   pathological conditions. Our hydrogel design is based on the
   functionalization of an ultrashort hydrogelating peptide sequence with
   an azidobenzyl moiety, which was reported to react with H2S selectively
   under physiological conditions. The resulting peptide was able to
   produce hydrogels at a concentration as low as 0.1 wt\%. It could then
   be fully degraded in the presence of excess H2S. We envision that the
   novel hydrogel developed in this study may provide useful tools for
   biomedical research.}},

Abstract = {{A novel, simple, fast, and miniaturized method, termed in-line
   micro-matrix solid-phase dispersion (in-line MMSPD), coupled with high
   performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was developed for the
   simultaneous extraction and determination of Sudan dyes (i.e. Sudan
   I-IV, Sudan orange G, Sudan black B, and Sudan red G) with the aid of an
   experimental design strategy. In this method, a matrix solid-phase
   dispersion (MSPD) column including a suitable mixture of polar sorbents
   was inserted in the mobile phase pathway, and while the interfering
   compounds were retained, the analytes were eluted and entered into the
   analytical column. In this way, the extraction, elution, and separation
   of the analytes were performed sequentially. Under the optimal
   experimental conditions (including the amount of sample, 0.0426 g;
   amount of dispersant phase, 0.0216 g of florisil, 0.0227 g of silica,
   0.0141 g of alumina; and blending time, 112 s), the limits of detection
   (LODs), limits of quantification, linear dynamic ranges, and recoveries
   were obtained to be 0.3-15.3 mu g kg(-1), 1-50 mu g kg(-1), 50-28,000 mu
   g kg(-1), and 94.5-99.1\%, respectively. The results obtained showed
   that determination of the selected Sudan dyes in food samples using an
   enough sensitive and a simple analytically validated method like in-line
   MMSPD may offer a suitable screening method, which could be useful for
   food analysis and adulteration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Scattering Sensing Probe for Transcription Factor Detection}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{We have developed a unique DNA-assembled gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)
   dimer for dynamic light scattering (DLS) sensing of transcription
   factors, exemplified by estrogen receptor (ER) that binds specifically
   to a double-stranded (ds) DNA sequence containing estrogen response
   element (ERE). Here, ERE sequence is incorporated into the DNA linkers
   to bridge the AuNPs dimer for ER binding. Coupled with DLS, this AuNP
   dimer-based DLS detection system gave distinct readout of a single
   `complex peak' in the presence of the target molecule (i.e., ER). This
   unique signature marked the first time that such nanostructures can be
   used to study transcription factor-DNA interactions, which DLS alone
   cannot do. This was also unlike previously reported AuNP-DLS assays that
   gave random and broad distribution of particles size upon target
   binding. In addition, the ERE-containing AuNP dimers could also suppress
   the light-scattering signal from the unbound proteins and other
   interfering factors (e.g., buffer background), and has potential for
   sensitive detection of target proteins in complex biological samples
   such as cell lysates. In short, the as-developed AuNP dimer probe
   coupled with DLS is a simple (mix and test), rapid (readout in similar
   to 5 min) and sensitive (low nM levels of ER) platform to detect
   sequence-specific protein-DNA binding event.}},

Abstract = {{Feedback has a powerful influence on learning, but it is also expensive
   to provide. In large classes it may even be impossible for instructors
   to provide individualized feedback. Peer assessment is one way to
   provide personalized feedback that scales to large classes. Besides
   these obvious logistical benefits, it has been conjectured that students
   also learn from the practice of peer assessment. However, this has never
   been conclusively demonstrated. Using an online educational platform
   that we developed, we conducted an in-class matched-set, randomized
   crossover experiment with high power to detect small effects. We
   establish that peer assessment causes a small but significant gain in
   student achievement. Our study also demonstrates the potential of
   web-based platforms to facilitate the design of high-quality experiments
   to identify small effects that were previously not detectable.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{Heterocyclic aromatic amines formed in cooked meat may be an underlying
   mechanism for the red meat-colorectal cancer (CRC) association. These
   compounds require bioactivaction by N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2). An
   interaction effect between red meat consumption and NAT2 in increasing
   CRC risk has been inconsistently reported in whites. We investigated
   this interaction in two populations in which the high-activity rapid
   NAT2 phenotype is 10- and 2-fold more common than in whites. We
   meta-analyzed four studies of Japanese (2,217 cases, 3,788 controls) and
   three studies of African Americans (527 cases, 4,527 controls). NAT2
   phenotype was inferred from an optimized seven-SNP genotyping panel.
   Processed and total red meat intakes were associated with an increased
   CRC risk in Japanese and in both ethnic groups combined (P's <= 0.002).
   We observed an interaction between processed meat intake and NAT2 in
   Japanese (P = 0.04), African Americans (P = 0.02), and in both groups
   combined (P = 0.006). The association of processed meat with CRC was
   strongest among individuals with the rapid NAT2 phenotype (combined
   analysis, OR for highest vs. lowest quartile: 1.62, 95\% CI: 1.28-2.05;
   P-trend = 8.0x10(-5)), intermediate among those with the intermediate
   NAT2 phenotype (1.29, 95\% CI: 1.05-1.59; P-trend = 0.05) and null among
   those with the slow phenotype (P-trend = 0.45). A similar interaction
   was found for NAT2 and total red meat (P-interaction = 0.03). Our
   findings support a role for NAT2 in modifying the association between
   red meat consumption and CRC in Japanese and African Americans.}},

Abstract = {{AIM: To analyze the low weight gain (WG) from birth to 4 and 6wk of life
   to predict the development of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) among
   very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm babies.
   METHODS: Three hundred and three newborns with VLBW were analyzed. Body
   weight measurements were recorded weekly. In all patients, the
   proportion of the WG was defined as the preterm weight measured at the
   4th and 6th weeks of life minus the birth weight (BW) divided by the BW.
   Other risk factors for ROP were also analyzed.
   RESULTS: Mean gestational age and mean BW of the whole cohort were 29.56
   +/- 1.44wk and 1270.58 +/- 176.18 g respectively. WG proportion at 4wk
   postnatal age (18.89\%+/- 13.58\%) were significantly lower in infants
   with ROP (P=0.003). WG proportion at 6wk was not different between ROP
   and no ROP group (42.48\%+/- 20.36\% vs 46.43\%+/- 15.65\% P=0.118).
   When all the other risk factors significant for ROP were included in the
   logistic regression poor WG did not arise as an independent risk factor.
   Area under the ROC curve was 0.591 (95\% CI: 0.515-0.666; P=0.016). For
   ROP, the best discriminative cutoff of 18.06\% of the proportional WG at
   the 4th week over the BW, sensitivity and specificity values were 67.3\%
   and 50.0\% respectively.
   CONCLUSION: Low WG proportion in the first 4wk of life is maybe an
   additional predictor of ROP in very low BW infants. Preterm babies with
   low BW and low WG proportion should be followed closely for ROP.}},

Abstract = {{This study explores the food perception of young Taiwanese consumers, a
   growing market segment in the restaurant industry. An innovative
   qualitative tool known as the Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique
   (ZMET) was employed to elicit deeper thoughts and emotions of young
   consumers. Twelve Taiwanese from Generation Y were invited to
   participate in a ZMET interview where they expressed their perceptions
   concerning food and eating through self-collected images. The data were
   analyzed using constant comparative method and charted on a consensus
   map. Five themes have evolved from the consensus map: health, trying new
   food, sharing, enhancing knowledge, and happiness. Findings reveal that
   young Taiwanese consumers are health-conscious and have high acceptance
   of novel food. They perceive food as a means of enjoyment and fostering
   social relationships. This study has contributed additional perspectives
   to existing literature by revealing the function of food in enhancing
   knowledge, as well as unveiling the deep-seated meanings of food
   associated with consumer's personal relevance values. Marketing
   implications for the restaurant industry targeting young Taiwanese
   consumers are proposed.}},

Title = {{Analysis of surgery for incurable gastric cancer}},
Journal = {{WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: It is important to evaluate the curability of and avoid
   unnecessary exploratory surgery for gastric cancer preoperatively.
   However, no related research has been reported until now. The aim of
   this study was to evaluate the factors influencing surgery for incurable
   gastric cancer.
   Methods: 310 cases of T3-4 gastric cancer patients were analyzed
   retrospectively, including 141 cases with radical surgery and 169 with
   surgery for incurable gastric cancer. The incurable factors were
   categorized as T status (unresectable T4 tumor), N status (unresectable
   lymph node), peritoneal metastasis, and distant metastasis. chi(2) test
   and logistic regression were performed to analyze the associations
   between curability, T status, N status, peritoneal metastasis, or
   distant metastasis and clinicopathological data.
   Results: Esophageal involvement and T grade were associated with
   curability. Cardia involvement and Borrmann type were associated with T
   status. Esophageal involvement and T grade were associated with N
   status. Gastric body involvement, esophageal involvement, and T grade
   were associated with peritoneal metastasis. Gastric antrum involvement
   was associated with distant metastasis.
   Conclusions: The influencing factors of surgery for incurable gastric
   cancer should be analyzed preoperatively. Resectability should be
   evaluated according to these influencing factors combined with imaging
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The STAR Collaboration presents for the first time two-dimensional
   di-hadron correlations with identified leading hadrons in 200 GeV
   central Au+Au and minimum-bias d+Au collisions to explore hadronization
   mechanisms in the quark gluon plasma. The enhancement of the jet-like
   yield for leading pions in Au + Au data with respect to the d + Au
   reference and the absence of such an enhancement for leading non-pions
   (protons and kaons) are discussed within the context of a quark
   recombination scenario. The correlated yield at large angles,
   specifically in the ridge region, is found to be significantly higher
   for leading non-pions than pions. The consistencies of the constituent
   quark scaling, azimuthal harmonic model and a mini-jet modification
   model description of the data are tested, providing further constraints
   on hadronization. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical solutions for flow rate, pressure, and permeate flux, which
   vary with time and distance, are developed for a cross flow filter in a
   narrow rectangular domain with either one or two permeable walls. The
   governing equations consist of a generalized Darcy's law combined with
   flow and continuity equations. The contribution to fouling as either a
   static surface cake or depth plugging in the media is governed by a
   distribution function representing the ratio of the two phenomena. The
   mathematical model and solution for the clean filter case (i.e. no
   fouling) are presented first, along with design parameters
   (characteristic length, flow rate, and pressure) that arise from the
   solutions. The analytical solutions for the no-fouling case yield
   limiting values of filter length, inlet flow rate, and inlet pressure
   drop. These bounds also provide reasonable limits for operating
   parameters in the transient model with fouling. Parameter studies that
   compare transient effects with fouling to the clean filter case are
   presented to illustrate the application of the model. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{This article outlines a concept termed ``creative relationships{''}
   which ultimately could be used as basic concept and discursive tool in
   entrepreneurship education. A specifying distinction between ``creative
   co-operation{''} and ``creative co-existence{''} is also tentatively
   introduced, and it is argued that both these aspects need to be
   recognized in the discourse. The concept ``creative relationships{''} is
   built on a review and an analysis of three distinct relational
   conceptions of creativity; Hannah Arendt's, Kenneth Gergen's and Martin
   Buber's. A main point of the analysis is that the concept of creativity,
   as well as its broader counterpart, entrepreneurship, is not
   comprehensible without recognizing its relational context. At the end of
   the article, the outlined concept is applied to the question of
   curriculum development in entrepreneurship education.}},

Abstract = {{Males and females share many traits that have a common genetic basis;
   however, selection on these traits often differs between the sexes,
   leading to sexual conflict(1,2). Under such sexual antagonism, theory
   predicts the evolution of genetic architectures that resolve this sexual
   conflict(2-5). Yet, despite intense theoretical and empirical interest,
   the specific loci underlying sexually antagonistic phenotypes have
   rarely been identified, limiting our understanding of how sexual
   conflict impacts genome evolution(3,6) and the maintenance of genetic
   diversity(6,7). Here we identify a large effect locus controlling age at
   maturity in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), an important fitness trait in
   which selection favours earlier maturation in males than females(8), and
   show it is a clear example of sex-dependent dominance that reduces
   intralocus sexual conflict and maintains adaptive variation in wild
   populations. Using high-density single nucleotide polymorphism data
   across 57 wild populations and whole genome re-sequencing, we find that
   the vestigial-like family member 3 gene (VGLL3) exhibits sex-dependent
   dominance in salmon, promoting earlier and later maturation in males and
   females, respectively. VGLL3, an adiposity regulator associated with
   size and age at maturity in humans, explained 39\% of phenotypic
   variation, an unexpectedly large proportion for what is usually
   considered a highly polygenic trait. Such large effects are predicted
   under balancing selection from either sexually antagonistic or spatially
   varying selection(9,10). Our results provide the first empirical example
   of dominance reversal allowing greater optimization of phenotypes within
   each sex, contributing to the resolution of sexual conflict in a major
   and widespread evolutionary trade-off between age and size at maturity.
   They also provide key empirical evidence for how variation in
   reproductive strategies can be maintained over large geographical
   scales. We anticipate these findings will have a substantial impact on
   population management in a range of harvested species where trends
   towards earlier maturation have been observed.}},

Abstract = {{The main point of this paper concerns the theoretical characterisation
   of the effects induced by the intermolecular interaction on the electron
   density upon the formation of CH4-H2X (X=O,S) and CH4-Ng (Ng=Ar,Xe)
   complexes. The work has been stimulated by recent molecular scattering
   beams experiments, which point out differences in both strength and
   anisotropy of the intermolecular potential between CH4-H2X respect to
   reference CH4-Ng systems. Herein, attention is focused on the electronic
   charge polarisation and particularly charge transfer (CT) effects
   between involved partners, directly related to the topology of the full
   potential energy surface. The modification of electron density and the
   occurrence of CT have been evaluated via the charge displacement
   function worked out by high level ab initio calculations. Moreover, in
   the case of a specific configuration of CH4-H2O system, we define the
   leading interaction components, including their relative stabilising
   role and test our intermolecular potential model with reference to ab
   initio calculations. The results obtained indicate that CT clearly
   affects the strength and the anisotropy of CH4-H2O complex, and covers a
   minor and negligible role for CH4-H2S and the noble gas complexes,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Chromosomal abnormalities are an important cause of congenital
   anomalies.
   OBJECTIVE
   To evaluate the pattern of chromosomal imbalances in congenital anomaly
   child and to find out the frequency of internal anomalies associated
   with external anomalies.
   METHOD
   A total of 75 individuals in different age groups presenting clinical
   profile like syndromic features, congenital anomalies and facial
   dysmorphism were taken. All patients underwent clinical assessment,
   chest x-ray, echocardiogram and cytogenetic assessment through
   karyotyping. Chi-square test was used in the statistical analysis.
   RESULTS
   Out of 75 patients 40\% are males, 60\% are females of which chromosomal
   abnormalities detected 30\% and 35\% respectively; 62.66\% have minor
   anomalies and major anomalies of 37.33\%. Chromosomal abnormality
   detected includes Down's syndrome (77.77\%), satellite 13 and
   22(11.11\%), turners syndrome (5.55\%), trisomy 19(5.55\%). Most common
   internal anomaly is congenital heart disease, predominantly
   atrioventricular septal defect. It has statistical significance with
   consanguinity (p < 0.05).
   CONCLUSION
   Frequency of Down's syndrome is high, reflecting the need of screening
   in all antenatal women. Karyotyping is recommended in all dysmorphic
   children as it can bring to the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis and
   for genetic counselling of patients and families.}},

Abstract = {{Perfluorosulfonates and carboxylates, C-4 to C-8 surfactants, are
   sonolytically degraded primarily at the vapor-water interface of
   cavitation bubbles. The observed pseudo first-order rate constants for
   the elimination of the perfluorosurfactants indicate that rates should
   be proportional to the degree of interfacial bubble-water partitioning.
   In fact, the sonochemical degradation rates of the more soluble and less
   hydrophobic perfluorobutane sulfonate, PFBS, and perfluorobutanoate,
   PFBA, were found to be slower than longer chain analogs due to their
   greater water solubility compared to the C-8 counter parts. The observed
   degradation rate constants are found to increase with increasing power
   density. Enhanced degradation rates were observed for the C-8
   surfactants, PFOS (similar to 12\%) and PFOA (-23\%) under simultaneous

Volume = {{60}},

Abstract = {{Eukaryotes initiate autophagy to cope with the lack of external
   nutrients, which requires the activation of the nicotinamide adenine
   dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1). However,
   the mechanisms underlying the starvation-induced Sirt1 activation for
   autophagy initiation remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that
   glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a conventional
   glycolytic enzyme, is a critical mediator of AMP-activated protein
   kinase (AMPK)-driven Sirt1 activation. Under glucose starvation, but not
   amino acid starvation, cytoplasmic GAPDH is phosphorylated on Ser122 by
   activated AMPK. This causes GAPDH to redistribute into the nucleus.
   Inside the nucleus, GAPDH interacts directly with Sirt1, displacing
   Sirt1's repressor and causing Sirt1 to become activated. Preventing this
   shift of GAPDH abolishes Sirt1 activation and autophagy, while enhancing
   it, through overexpression of nuclear-localized GAPDH, increases Sirt1
   activation and autophagy. GAPDH is thus a pivotal and central regulator
   of autophagy under glucose deficiency, undergoing AMPK-dependent
   phosphorylation and nuclear translocation to activate Sirt1 deacetylase
   activity.}},

Title = {{Selective REM Sleep Deprivation Improves Expectation-Related Placebo
   Analgesia}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{The placebo effect is a neurobiological and psychophysiological process
   known to influence perceived pain relief. Optimization of placebo
   analgesia may contribute to the clinical efficacy and effectiveness of
   medication for acute and chronic pain management. We know that the
   placebo effect operates through two main mechanisms, expectations and
   learning, which is also influenced by sleep. Moreover, a recent study
   suggested that rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is associated with
   modulation of expectation-mediated placebo analgesia. We examined
   placebo analgesia following pharmacological REM sleep deprivation and we
   tested the hypothesis that relief expectations and placebo analgesia
   would be improved by experimental REM sleep deprivation in healthy
   volunteers. Following an adaptive night in a sleep laboratory, 26
   healthy volunteers underwent classical experimental placebo analgesic
   conditioning in the evening combined with pharmacological REM sleep
   deprivation (clonidine: 13 volunteers or inert control pill: 13
   volunteers). Medication was administered in a double-blind manner at
   bedtime, and placebo analgesia was tested in the morning. Results
   revealed that 1) placebo analgesia improved with REM sleep deprivation;
   2) pain relief expectations did not differ between REM sleep deprivation
   and control groups; and 3) REM sleep moderated the relationship between
   pain relief expectations and placebo analgesia. These results support
   the putative role of REM sleep in modulating placebo analgesia. The
   mechanisms involved in these improvements in placebo analgesia and pain
   relief following selective REM sleep deprivation should be further
   investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) have been used in biomolecules
   separation and as an efficient alternative to traditional purification
   systems for lipases extraction. Here, we investigated the partitioning
   and recovery of lipase derived from Leucosporidium scottii L117 using
   ATPS and aqueous two-phase micellar systems (ATPMS). Thus, we evaluated
   three ATPS: (i) polyethylene glycol (PEG)/phosphate salts and (ii)
   PEG/polyacrylic acid (NaPA) in different molecular weights (1500, 4000
   and 8000 g/mol). (iii) Triton X-114 (TX-114)/McIlvaine buffer pH 7.0 in
   different conditions (2.0\% (w/w) of TX-114 at 25.0 and 28.0 degrees C).
   The PEG/phosphate and PEG/NaPA systems resulted in a great loss of
   enzymatic activity; thus these systems do not represent viable
   alternatives for these lipase extraction. The micellar systems yielded
   the best results for lipase extraction with enzyme activity balances
   ranging between 84.7\% and 113.05\%. After optimizing the micellar
   system by experimental design of the partition coefficient of lipase
   increased by 10.3-fold (0.75-7.76). Lipase preferentially partitioned
   into the micelle-rich phase with K-Lip = 7.76, \% RECBot = 93.85\% and
   PF = 1.2 at 25.03 degrees C, 5.1 pH and 10.38\% TX-114 and K-Lip, =
   4.77, \% RECBot = 73.53\% and PF = 1.97 at 28.00 degrees C, 4.5 pH and
   8.0\% TX-114, indicating that the ATPMS represents an alternative to
   purification/extraction of lipase L scottii L117. A crude lipase extract
   was also evaluated to define the optimum pH and temperature. Lipase
   reached optimal activity at 40 degrees C, and remained stable in pH
   values ranging from pH 3.0 to 8.0 and temperatures from 20.0 to 45.0
   degrees C, with relative residual lipase activity above 80\% after 30
   min of incubation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{In ordinary, non-relativistic, quantum physics, time enters only as a
   parameter and not as an observable: a state of a physical system is
   specified at a given time and then evolved according to the prescribed
   dynamics. While the state can, and usually does, extend across all
   space, it is only defined at one instant of time. Here we ask what would
   happen if we defined the notion of the quantum density matrix for
   multiple spatial and temporal measurements. We introduce the concept of
   a pseudo-density matrix (PDM) which treats space and time
   indiscriminately. This matrix in general fails to be positive for
   measurement events which do not occur simultaneously, motivating us to
   define a measure of causality that discriminates between spatial and
   temporal correlations. Important properties of this measure, such as
   monotonicity under local operations, are proved. Two qubit NMR
   experiments are presented that illustrate how a temporal pseudo-density
   matrix approaches a genuinely allowed density matrix as the amount of
   decoherence is increased between two consecutive measurements.}},

   interaction}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW C}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{Starting from a realistic constituent quark model for the
   nucleon-nucleon interaction, we derive the equation of state (EOS) of
   nuclear matter within the Bethe-Brueckner-Goldstone approach up to the
   three-hole-line level, without the need to introduce three-nucleon
   forces. To estimate the uncertainty of the calculations both the gap and
   the continuous choices for the single-particle potential are considered
   and compared. The resultant EOS is compatible with the phenomenological
   analysis of the saturation point, the incompressibility, the symmetry
   energy at a low density, and its slope at saturation, together with the
   high-density pressure extracted from flow data on heavy-ion collisions.
   Although the symmetry energy is appreciably higher in the gap choice in
   the high-density region, the maximum neutron star masses derived from
   the continuous-choice EOS and the gap-choice EOS are similar and close
   to two solar masses, which is again compatible with recent observational
   data. A comparison with other microscopic equations of state is
   presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Pharmaceuticals as emerging pollutants have become a major concern not
   only because of the threat posed to health and safety of the aquatic
   life but also due to their continuous accumulation in aquatic
   environment and development of antibiotic-resistant microbial strains.
   Single classical water treatment techniques have been generally
   inadequate for the removal of these hazardous substances. Combined
   treatment techniques such as membrane separation and advanced oxidation
   processes (AOPs) is an exciting technology for complete removal of these
   pollutants because each technique complements the advantages and
   overcomes the challenges of the other. Technical flexibility of membrane
   separation technology has allowed possible integration/coupling with
   several AOPs as: pretreatment stage for removal of organics (which may
   cause membrane fouling) from membrane feed stream; post-treatment stage
   for oxidation of organics in both membrane permeate and concentrate
   streams or one pot/hybrid process for concurrent separation and
   oxidation of pollutants in the feed stream. AOPs such as ozonation,
   peroxone (O-3/H2O2), UV/H2O2, photo-Fenton, photocatalysis and
   electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) have been
   successfully integrated with membrane separation for removal of
   pharmaceuticals from water and they are critically examined in this
   review. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (RB) was the first identified tumor
   suppressor based on germline predisposition to the pediatric eye tumor.
   Since these early studies, it has become apparent that the functional
   inactivation of RB is a common event in nearly all human malignancy. A
   great deal of research has gone into understanding how the loss of RB
   promotes tumor etiology and progression. Since malignant tumors are
   characterized by aberrant cell division, much of this research has
   focused upon the ability of RB to regulate the cell cycle by repression
   of proliferation-related genes. However, it is progressively understood
   that RB is an important mediator of multiple functions. One area that is
   gaining progressive interest is the emerging role for RB in regulating
   diverse features of immune function. These findings suggest that RB is
   more than simply a regulator of cellular proliferation; it is at the
   crossroads of proliferation and the immune response. Here we review the
   data related to the functional roles of RB on the immune system,
   relevance to immune evasion, and potential significance to the response
   to immune-therapy.}},

Title = {{Is secondhand smoke associated with stress in smokers and non-smokers?}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Secondhand Smoking (SHS) has been suggested as a major
   health problem in the world and is known to cause various negative
   health effects that have in turn caused the deaths of almost 600,000
   people per year. Evidence has suggested that SHS may have an effect on
   health problems and such findings have influenced the implementation of
   smoking-free areas. However, few studies have investigated the effects
   of SHS on stress which is considered major risk factor for mental
   health. Thus, the purpose of our study was to investigate the
   association between exposure to SHS and stress.
   Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study using data from the Korea
   National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2007-2012). In our
   study, a total of 33,728 participants were included to evaluate the
   association between SHS exposure and stress based on smoking status.
   Association between SHS exposure and stress was examined using logistic
   regression models.
   Results: A total of 12,441 participants (42.9 \%) were exposed to SHS in
   the workplace or at home. In our study, exposure to SHS was
   significantly associated with higher stress compared to non-exposure,
   regardless of smoking status (smoker odds ratio {[}OR]: 1.22; ex-smoker
   OR: 1.25; never-smoker OR: 1.42). Our results showed that the effect of
   SHS on stress was greater when exposure took place both at home and in
   the workplace in smokers and never-smokers.
   Conclusions: Exposure to SHS in the workplace and at home is considered
   to be a risk factor for high stress in both smokers and never-smoker.
   Therefore, strict regulations banning smoke which can smoking ban reduce
   SHS exposure are recommended in order to improve the populations'
   health.}},

Abstract = {{Health concerns regarding microbial contamination on the one hand and
   brine disposal regulations on the other limits the application of both
   biological and physico-chemical techniques for nitrate removal from
   polluted inland groundwater. In the current work, a combined system
   consisting of ion exchange (IX) and advanced biophysical treatment of
   the recirculated regenerant was investigated to achieve a safe and
   reliable process for nitrate removal from groundwater with minimal brine
   discharge and chloride addition to the product water. Using a feed water
   composing 26 mg NO3-N/L, Cl- 243 mg/L and 16 mg SO42--S/L, optimal IX
   operation was found to be at a service cycle length of 380 bed volumes
   with `full treatment' of the water source rather than a `split
   treatment' option with shorter service cycle and final product water
   blending. `Full treatment' resulted in nitrate concentrations meeting
   regulations while minimizing both Cl- addition to the treated water
   (1.11 meq Cl- added per meq NO3--N removed) and waste brine production
   (0.25\% of the water volume treated). In the product water, the DOC was
   0.5 mg/L lower than the feed (tap) water and before disinfection the
   bacterial count was 10-700 cfu/mL.
   Spent regenerant was first treated in a sequential batch denitrification
   bioreactor followed by ozonation for polishing. The SBR unit achieved
   complete nitrate removal in 8 h with nitrate removal rates of 2.6 +/-
   0.4 g N/L-reactor/d and a low average ethanol to nitrate mass ratio of
   1.68 +/- 0.18. An ozone dose of 3-5 mg/L brine allowed for efficient
   recycling of the denitrified regenerant by removing suspended solids by
   foam fractionation. In spite of the low brine blow-down, DOC in the
   recycled regenerant brine after more than a year of continuous operation
   was maintained at relatively low levels of 61.0 +/- 11.6 mg/L. (C) 2015

Title = {{Disintegration of Carbon Dioxide Molecules in a Microwave Plasma Torch}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{A pure carbon dioxide torch is generated by making use of 2.45 GHz
   microwave. Carbon dioxide gas becomes the working gas and produces a
   stable carbon dioxide torch. The torch volume is almost linearly
   proportional to the microwave power. Temperature of the torch flame is
   measured by making use of optical spectroscopy and thermocouple. Two
   distinctive regions are exhibited, a bright, whitish region of
   high-temperature zone and a bluish, dimmer region of relatively
   low-temperature zone. Study of carbon dioxide disintegration and gas
   temperature effects on the molecular fraction characteristics in the
   carbon dioxide plasma of a microwave plasma torch under atmospheric
   pressure is carried out. An analytical investigation of carbon dioxide
   disintegration indicates that substantial fraction of carbon dioxide
   molecules disintegrate and form other compounds in the torch. For
   example, the normalized particle densities at center of plasma are given
   by n(CO2)/n(N) = 6.12 x 10(-3), n(CO)/n(N) = 0.13, n(C)/n(N) = 0.24,
   n(O)/n(N) = 0.61, n(C2)/n(N) = 8.32 x 10(-7), n(O2)/n(N) = 5.39 x
   10(-5), where n(CO2), n(CO), n(C), n(O), n(C2), and n(O2) are carbon
   dioxide, carbon monoxide, carbon and oxygen atom, carbon and oxygen
   molecule densities, respectively. n(N) is the neutral particle density.
   Emission profiles of the oxygen and carbon atom radicals and the carbon
   monoxide molecules confirm the theoretical predictions of carbon dioxide
   disintegration in the torch.}},

Title = {{Excitons in van der Waals heterostructures: The important role of
   dielectric screening}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{The existence of strongly bound excitons is one of the hallmarks of the
   newly discovered atomically thin semiconductors. While it is understood
   that the large binding energy is mainly due to the weak dielectric
   screening in two dimensions, a systematic investigation of the role of
   screening on two-dimensional (2D) excitons is still lacking. Here we
   provide a critical assessment of a widely used 2D hydrogenic exciton
   model, which assumes a dielectric function of the form epsilon(q) = 1 +
   2 pi alpha q, and we develop a quasi-2D model with a much broader
   applicability. Within the quasi-2D picture, electrons and holes are
   described as in-plane point charges with a finite extension in the
   perpendicular direction, and their interaction is screened by a
   dielectric function with a nonlinear q dependence which is computed ab
   initio. The screened interaction is used in a generalized Mott-Wannier
   model to calculate exciton binding energies in both isolated and
   supported 2D materials. For isolated 2D materials, the quasi-2D
   treatment yields results almost identical to those of the strict 2D
   model, and both are in good agreement with ab initio many-body
   calculations. On the other hand, for more complex structures such as
   supported layers or layers embedded in a van der Waals heterostructure,
   the size of the exciton in reciprocal space extends well beyond the
   linear regime of the dielectric function, and a quasi-2D description has
   to replace the 2D one. Our methodology has the merit of providing a
   seamless connection between the strict 2D limit of isolated monolayer
   materials and the more bulk-like screening characteristics of supported
   2D materials or van der Waals heterostructures.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{A new physical model of the gate controlled Schottky barrier height
   (SBH) lowering in top-gated graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs)
   under saturation bias condition is proposed based on the energy
   conservation equation with the balance assumption. The theoretical
   prediction of the SBH lowering agrees well with the experimental data
   reported in literatures. The reduction of the SBH increases with the
   increasing of gate voltage and relative dielectric constant of the gate
   oxide, while it decreases with the increasing of oxide thickness,
   channel length and acceptor density. The magnitude of the reduction is
   slightly enhanced under high drain voltage. Moreover, it is found that
   the gate oxide materials with large relative dielectric constant (> 20)
   have a significant effect on the gate controlled SBH lowering, implying
   that the energy relaxation of channel electrons should be taken into
   account for modeling SBH in GFETs.}},

   a normal pregnancy can turn into a high risk situation for the mother as
   well as for the fetus. Despite the relative frequency of this event,
   clinical management is one issue unresolved by the clinical research
   till date. A prospective study was designed to know the incidence,
   etiology, risk factors, fetal and maternal outcomes of prelabour rupture

Abstract = {{Insulin aggregation, to afford amyloidogenic polypeptide fibrils, is an
   energetically driven, well-studied phenomenon, which presents
   interesting biological ramifications. These aggregates are also known to
   form around insulin injection sites and in diabetic patients suffering
   from Parkinson's disease. Such occurrences force considerable reduction
   in hormone activity and are often responsible for necrotic deposits in
   diabetic patients. Changes in physicochemical environment, such as pH,
   temperature, ionic strength, and mechanical agitation, affect insulin
   fibrillation, which also presents intrigue from the structural
   viewpoint. Several reports have tried to unravel underlying mechanisms
   concerning the aggregation process taking into account a three aromatic
   amino acid patch Phe(B24)-Phe(B25)-Tyr(B26) located in the C-terminal
   part of the B chain, identified as a key site for human insulin receptor
   interaction. The present study describes design and inhibitory effects
   of novel peptide conjugates toward fibrillation of insulin as
   investigated by thioflavin T assay, circular dichroism, and AFM.
   Possible interaction of insulin with peptide-based fibrillation
   inhibitors reveals an important role of hydrophobic interactions in the
   inhibition process. Molecular dynamics simulation studies demonstrate
   that inhibitor D4 interacts with insulin residues from the helix and the
   C-terminal extended segment of chain B. These studies present a novel
   approach for the discovery of stable, peptide-based ligands as novel
   antiamyloidogenic agents for insulin aggregation.}},

Abstract = {{Structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) complexes are proteinaceous
   rings that embrace DNA to enable vital chromosomal functions. The ring
   is formed by two SMC subunits, closed at a pair of ATPase heads, whose
   interaction is reinforced by a kleisin subunit. Using biochemical
   analysis of fission-yeast cohesin, we find that a similar series of
   events facilitates both topological entrapment and release of DNA.
   DNA-sensing lysines trigger ATP hydrolysis to open the SMC head
   interface, whereas the Wapl subunit disengages kleisin, but only after
   ATP rebinds. This suggests an interlocking gate mechanism for DNA
   transport both into and out of the cohesin ring. The entry direction is
   facilitated by a cohesin loader that appears to fold cohesin to expose
   the DNA sensor. Our results provide a model for dynamic DNA binding by
   all members of the SMC family and explain how lysine acetylation of
   cohesin establishes enduring sister chromatid cohesion.}},

Abstract = {{Neural sequences are a fundamental feature of brain dynamics underlying
   diverse behaviours, but the mechanisms by which they develop during
   learning remain unknown. Songbirds learn vocalizations composed of
   syllables; in adult birds, each syllable is produced by a different
   sequence of action potential bursts in the premotor cortical area HVC.
   Here we carried out recordings of large populations of HVC neurons in
   singing juvenile birds throughout learning to examine the emergence of
   neural sequences. Early in vocal development, HVC neurons begin
   producing rhythmic bursts, temporally locked to a `prototype' syllable.
   Different neurons are active at different latencies relative to syllable
   onset to form a continuous sequence. Through development, as new
   syllables emerge from the prototype syllable, initially highly
   overlapping burst sequences become increasingly distinct. We propose a
   mechanistic model in which multiple neural sequences can emerge from the
   growth and splitting of a common precursor sequence.}},

Title = {{Tuberculosis in Healthcare Workers: A Matched Cohort Study in Taiwan}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Proportional mortality ratio data indicate that healthcare workers
   (HCWs) have an elevated tuberculosis (TB) mortality. Whether this is
   caused by an increased TB incidence, a worse TB treatment outcome, or a
   combination of effects, remains unclear. To elucidate the hazard
   components of occupational TB, we assessed TB incidence and TB treatment
   outcome among HCWs in Taiwan.
   Methods
   We compared the incidence of active TB among HCWs at a major medical
   center in Taiwan with that of Taiwan general population in 2004-2012. We
   also compared the TB treatment outcome of HCWs with that of
   age/sex-matched non-HCW patients treated at the same hospital, as well
   as that of nationally registered TB patients.
   Results
   The standardized TB incidence ratio of the HCWs was 1.9 (95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI]: 1.2-2.9), compared with the general population. HCWs
   with pulmonary TB (n = 30) were less likely to have underlying diseases,
   delay in diagnosis, delay in treatment, or side effects of treatment,
   compared with age/sex-matched non-HCW TB patients (n = 120) (all
   Ps<0.05). The TB treatment outcome of HCWs was significantly better than
   that of non-HCW patients (TB-related mortality: 0.0\% vs. 5.8\%, P =
   0.008, Mantel-Haenszel test). The standardized TB-related mortality rate
   was 1.08\%{[} 95\% CI: 0.96\% - 1.20\%] for all of the nationally
   registered TB patients in Taiwan.
   Conclusions
   HCWs are at increased risk of active TB, compared with general
   population. To mitigate this occupational hazard, more efforts need to
   be directed towards the prevention of nosocomial TB transmission.
   Healthy worker effect, more rapid diagnosis, and less delay in treatment
   contribute to a lower TB-related mortality in HCWs.}},

Abstract = {{The problem addressed in this paper is how to calculate the amount of
   personnel required to ensure the activity of a home health care (HHC)
   centre on a tactical horizon. Design of quantitative approaches for this
   question is challenging. The number of caregivers has to be determined
   for each profession in order to balance the coverage of patients in a
   region and the workforce cost over several months. Unknown demand in
   care and spatial dimensions, combination of skills to cover a care and
   individual trips visiting patients make the underlaying optimisation
   problem very hard. Few studies are dedicated to staff dimensioning for
   HHC compared to patient to nurses assignment/sequencing and centres
   location problems. We propose an original two-stage approach based on
   integer linear stochastic programming, which exploits historical medical
   data. The first stage calculates (near-)optimal levels of resources for
   possible demand scenarios, while the second stage computes the optimal
   number of caregiver for each profession to meet a target coverage
   indicator. For decision-makers, our algorithm gives the number of
   employees for each category required to satisfy the demand without any
   recourse (overtime, external resources) with fixed probability and
   confidence interval. The approach has been tested on various instances
   built from data of the French agency of hospitalisation data (ATIH).}},

Abstract = {{Gas-liquid scattering experiments were employed to measure the entry and
   dissociation of the acidic gas DCl into salty glycerol coated with
   dodecyl sulfate ions (DS- = CH3(CH2)(11)OSO3-). Five sets of salty
   solutions were examined: 0.25 and 0.5 M NaCl, 0.25 M MgCl2, 0.25 M
   CaCl2, and artificial sea salt. DS- bulk concentrations were varied from
   0 to 11 mM, generating DS- surface coverages of up to 34\% of a compact
   monolayer, as determined by surface tension and argon scattering
   measurements. DS- surface segregation is enhanced by the dissolved salts
   in the order MgCl2 approximate to CaCl2 > sea salt > NaCl. We find that
   DCl penetration through the dodecyl chains decreases at first gradually
   and then sharply as more chains segregate to the surface, dropping from
   70\% entry on bare glycerol to 11\% for DS- surface concentrations of
   1.8 x 10(14) cm(-2). When plotted against DS- surface concentration, the
   DCl entry probabilities fall within a single band for all solutions.
   These observations imply that the monovalent Na+ and divalent Ca2+ and
   Mg2+ ions do not bind differently enough to the ROSO3- headgroup to
   significantly alter the diffusive passage of DCl molecules through the
   dodecyl chains at the same DS- chain density. The chief difference among
   the salts is the greater propensity for the divalent salts to expel the
   soluble ionic surfactant to the surface.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   The role of the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) in recognition
   memory has been well documented in lesion, neuroimaging and repetitive
   Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) studies. The aim of the present
   study was to investigate the effects of transcranial Direct Current
   Stimulation (tDCS) over the left and the right DLPFC during the delay
   interval of a non-verbal recognition memory task.
   Method
   36 right-handed young healthy subjects participated in the study. The
   experimental task was an Italian version of Recognition Memory Test for
   unknown faces. Study included two experiments: in a first experiment,
   each subject underwent one session of sham tDCS and one session of left
   or right cathodal tDCS; in a second experiment each subject underwent
   one session of sham tDCS and one session of left or right anodal tDCS.
   Results
   Cathodal tDCS over the right DLPFC significantly improved non verbal
   recognition memory performance, while cathodal tDCS over the left DLPFC
   had no effect. Anodal tDCS of both the left and right DLPFC did not
   modify non verbal recognition memory performance.
   Conclusion
   Complementing the majority of previous studies, reporting long term
   memory facilitations following left prefrontal anodal tDCS, the present
   findings show that cathodal tDCS of the right DLPFC can also improve
   recognition memory in healthy subjects.}},

Abstract = {{This article addresses the problem of allocating limited operating room
   (OR) capacity among subspecialties in hospitals where two types of
   demands exist: elective surgeries and emergency surgeries. In many
   medium- and small-scale hospitals, no OR capacity is affiliated with a
   particular subspecialty, but several subspecialties share the OR
   capacity in the hospital. The administrator needs to decide how much OR
   capacity to assign to each subspecialty and how much to reserve for
   emergency surgeries. Because such an allocation is usually decided
   several weeks or even months before, the only information about future
   demands is their range. We focus on finding a robust solution that
   handles disturbances in the surgery demand. An adjustable robust model
   is developed to solve this surgery capacity allocation problem with
   demand uncertainty. The worst-case revenue loss resulting from a
   shortage of OR resources is minimised. We examine the impact of
   conservativeness of the robust model on the revenue loss of the surgery
   department, which provides hospital administrators guidance for setting
   the adjustable parameters. An implementer-adversary algorithm is applied
   to solve the robust optimisation model. We present computational results
   comparing the proposed robust optimisation approach with a
   scenario-based stochastic optimisation; the results show that by
   adjusting the conservatism, the expected objective value realised by the
   robust solution is very close to that obtained by the stochastic
   programming approach. Moreover, the robust optimisation method has the
   benefit of limiting the worst-case outcome of the surgery capacity
   allocation problem.}},

Title = {{A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of the Swedish Universal Parenting Program
   All Children in Focus}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   There are few health economic evaluations of parenting programs with
   quality-adjusted lifeyears (QALYs) as the outcome measure. The objective
   of this study was, therefore, to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis
   of the universal parenting program All Children in Focus (ABC). The
   goals were to estimate the costs of program implementation, investigate
   the health effects of the program, and examine its cost-effectiveness.
   Methods
   A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted. Costs included setup costs
   and operating costs. A parent proxy Visual Analog Scale was used to
   measure QALYs in children, whereas the General Health Questionnaire-12
   was used for parents. A societal perspective was adopted, and the
   incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated. To account for
   uncertainty in the estimate, the probability of cost-effectiveness was
   investigated, and sensitivity analyses were used to account for the
   uncertainty in cost data.
   Results
   The cost was (sic)326.3 per parent, of which (sic)53.7 represented setup
   costs under the assumption that group leaders on average run 10 groups,
   and (sic)272.6 was the operating costs. For health effects, the QALY
   gain was 0.0042 per child and 0.0027 per parent. These gains resulted in
   an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the base case of (sic)47 290
   per gained QALY. The sensitivity analyses resulted in ratios from
   (sic)41 739 to (sic)55 072. With the common Swedish threshold value of
   (sic)55 000 per QALY, the probability of the ABC program being
   cost-effective was 50.8 percent.
   Conclusion
   Our analysis of the ABC program demonstrates cost-effectiveness ratios
   below or just above the QALY threshold in Sweden. However, due to great
   uncertainty about the data, the health economic rationale for
   implementation should be further studied considering a longer time
   perspective, effects on siblings, and validated measuring techniques,
   before full scale implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Despite progress in the development of drugs that efficiently target
   cancer cells, treatments for metastatic tumours are often ineffective.
   The now well-established dependency of cancer cells on their
   microenvironment(1) suggests that targeting the non-cancer-cell
   component of the tumour might form a basis for the development of novel
   therapeutic approaches. However, the as-yet poorly characterized
   contribution of host responses during tumour growth and metastatic
   progression represents a limitation to exploiting this approach. Here we
   identify neutrophils as the main component and driver of metastatic
   establishment within the (pre-) metastatic lung microenvironment in
   mouse breast cancer models. Neutrophils have a fundamental role in
   inflammatory responses and their contribution to tumorigenesis is still
   controversial(2-4). Using various strategies to block neutrophil
   recruitment to the pre-metastatic site, we demonstrate that neutrophils
   specifically support metastatic initiation. Importantly, we find that
   neutrophil-derived leukotrienes aid the colonization of distant tissues
   by selectively expanding the sub-pool of cancer cells that retain high
   tumorigenic potential. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the
   leukotriene-generating enzyme arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (Alox5)
   abrogates neutrophil pro-metastatic activity and consequently reduces
   metastasis. Our results reveal the efficacy of using targeted therapy
   against a specific tumour microenvironment component and indicate that
   neutrophil Alox5 inhibition may limit metastatic progression.}},

   rotational state-resolved differential cross sections (DCSs) were
   measured at v' = 2, 3, 4 levels. The product angular distributions are
   predominantly backward scattered except for a small forward signal of
   HF(v' = 4) at 0.90 kcal/mol. At the collision energy of 0.52 kcal/mol,
   the forward scattering peak of the HF(v' = 2) product, which arises in F
   + H-2(v = 0) reaction from the Feshbach resonances, disappears in F +
   H-2(v = 1) reaction. Oscillatory structures do not appear in the
   backward direction of the scattering as the collision energy increases
   from 0.4 to 2.0 kcal/mol, indicating there are no:explicit reaction
   resonances in the F + H-2(v = 1, j = 0) > HF + H reaction in the studied

Abstract = {{Emerging evidence shows that Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma
   transcript 1 (MALAT1) plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation,
   migration, and invasion in tumors. However, the biological role and
   underlying mechanism of MALAT1 in liver fibrosis remains undefined. In
   this study, up-regulation of MALAT1 was observed in fibrotic liver
   tissues and in activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). In addition,
   depletion of MALAT1 inhibited the activation of HSCs in vitro and
   attenuated collagen deposits in vivo. Our results demonstrated that
   MALAT1 expression is negatively correlated with microRNA-101b (miR-101b)
   expression. Furthermore, there was a negative feedback loop between the
   levels of MALAT1 and miR-101b. Luciferase reporter assay indicated that
   MALAT1 and RAS-related C3 botulinum substrate 1 (Rac1) are targets of
   miR-101b. We uncovered that MALAT1 regulates Rac1 expression through
   miR-101b as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA), thereby influencing the
   proliferation, cell cycle and activation of primary HSCs. Collectively,
   The ceRNA regulatory network may prompt a better understanding of liver
   fibrogenesis and contribute to a novel therapeutic strategy for liver
   fibrosis.}},

Title = {{High-Up: A Remote Reservoir of Microbial Extremophiles in Central Andean
   Wetlands}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{The Central Andes region displays unexplored ecosystems of shallow lakes
   and salt flats at mean altitudes of 3700 m. Being isolated and hostile,
   these so-called ``High-Altitude Andean Lakes{''} (HAAL) are pristine and
   have been exposed to little human influence. HAAL proved to be a rich
   source of microbes showing interesting adaptations to life in extreme
   settings (poly-extremophiles) such as alkalinity, high concentrations of
   arsenic and dissolved salts, intense dryness, large daily ambient
   thermal amplitude, and extreme solar radiation levels. This work reviews
   HAAL microbiodiversity, taking into account different microbial niches,
   such as plankton, benthos, microbial mats and microbialites. The modern
   stromatolites and other microbialites discovered recently at HAAL are
   highlighted, as they provide unique modern though quite imperfect
   analogs of environments proxy for an earlier time in Earth's history
   (volcanic setting and profuse hydrothermal activity, low atmospheric O-2
   pressure, thin ozone layer and high UV exposure). Likewise, we stress
   the importance of HAIL microbes as model poly-extremophiles in the study
   of the molecular mechanisms underlying their resistance ability against
   UV and toxic or deleterious chemicals using genome mining and functional
   genomics. In future research directions, it will be necessary to exploit
   the full potential of HAAL poly-extremophiles in terms of their
   biotechnological applications. Current projects heading this way have
   yielded detailed molecular information and functional proof on novel
   extremoenzymes: i.e., DNA repair enzymes and arsenic efflux pumps for
   which medical and bioremediation applications, respectively, are
   envisaged. But still, much effort is required to unravel novel functions
   for this and other molecules that dwell in a unique biological treasure
   despite its being hidden high up, in the remote Andes.}},

Abstract = {{Superior green algal cells showing high lipid production and rapid
   growth rate are considered as an alternative for the next generation
   green energy resources. To achieve the biomass based energy generation,
   transformed microalgae with superlative properties should be developed
   through genetic engineering. Contrary to the normal cells, microalgae
   have rigid cell walls, so that target gene delivery into cells is
   challengeable. In this study, we report a ZnO nanowire-incorporated
   microdevice for a high throughput microalgal transformation. The
   proposed microdevice was equipped with not only a ZnO nanowire in the
   microchannel for gene delivery into cells but also a pneumatic
   poIydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microvalve to modulate the cellular
   attachment and detachment from the nanowire. As a model, hygromycin B
   resistance gene cassette (Hyg3) was functionalized on the hydrothermally
   grown ZnO nanowires through a disulfide bond and released into green
   algal cells, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, by reductive cleavage. During
   Hyg3 gene delivery, a monolithic PDMS membrane was bent down, so that
   algal cells were pushed down toward ZnO nanowires. The supply of vacuum
   in the pneumatic line made the PDMS membrane bend up, enabling the gene
   delivered algal cells to be recovered from the outlet of the
   microchannel. We successfully confirmed Hyg3 gene integrated in
   microalgae by amplifying the inserted gene through polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. The efficiency of the gene delivery
   to algal cells using the ZnO nanowire-incorporated microdevice was 6.52
   X 10(4)- and 9.66 X 10(4)-fold higher than that of a traditional glass
   bead beating and electroporation.}},

Abstract = {{Polymetallic sea nodules are the potential resources of copper, cobalt,
   manganese, and nickel. The exploration and exploitation of manganese
   nodules are necessary to meet the future demands of Mn in the world.
   This work describes the valuable extraction of Mn through an innovative
   approach of using sucrose as a reductant. The metal extraction from the
   nodule leaching was studied in ambient temperature (27 degrees C) and at
   an elevated temperature 90 degrees C with and without agitation. In both
   cases, 99.9\% of Mn was extracted while the extraction time appears to
   be significantly low (2 h) at 90 degrees C but it requires a longer time
   of 24 h at 27 degrees C. The optimum sucrose concentration selected was
   7\% (w/w) of nodule for maximum metal extraction. With use of 10\% (v/v)
   H2SO4, 7\% (w/w) sucrose at 90 degrees C, and solid to liquid (S/L)
   ratio of 1:10 the achieved metal recovery figures were the following: Mn
   >99\%, Ni 98\%, Cu 87\%, Co 83\% in 2 h. The oxidation pathway of
   sucrose is outlined in this study with the aid of mass spectrometry
   during reductive leaching of ocean bed nodule. Sucrose in acidic
   environment generates 1- or 6-monoacid of sucrose with ions of m/z
   (mass-to-charge ratio) 355 and 127, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5HMF). A
   dehydrated glucose complex (m/z 325) was generated at elevated
   temperature. These released organics act as reductant for the leaching
   of Mn2+ from MnO2. Glucaric acid (m/z 211) is generated as the end
   product of the sucrose oxidation in the solution.}},

Title = {{IL-33 reflects dynamics of disease activity in patients with autoimmune
   hemolytic anemia by regulating autoantibody production}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), a life-threatening
   anemia with rapid onset, is caused by autoantibody directed to self red
   blood cells (RBCs). Currently, mechanisms underlying AIHA pathogenesis
   are largely undefined. Here we explored the correlation of IL-33 with
   AIHA disease activity and evaluated IL-33 based therapeutics in AIHA
   treatment.
   Methods: Thirty patients diagnosed with AIHA of warm-type autoantibodies
   without treatment were enrolled and followed up for 6 months. Levels of
   cytokines including IL-33, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-13 was determined with
   ELISA. AIHA disease activity was presented by levels of reticulocyte
   count, hemoglobin and lactate dehydrogenase. Serum RBC-bound IgG
   autoantibody was detected using anti-IgG antibody with flow cytometry.
   To evaluate the effect of IL-33 blockade on AIHA development, groups of
   B6 mice were immunized with rat RBCs plus recombinant IL-33 protein or
   IL-33 neutralizing antibody respectively and detected for levels of
   anti-RBC antibody, frequency of reticulocytes and destruction of
   transfused syngeneic mouse RBCs.
   Results: Serum level of IL-33 was higher in AIHA patients compared with
   healthy individuals. Of interest, serum IL-33 was positively correlated
   with AIHA disease activity and sensitive to their changes in AIHA
   patients under clinical management. Mechanistically, IL-33 could promote
   the production of anti-RBC autoantibody. Serum IL-33 was closely
   associated with serum anti-RBC autoantibody and sensitive to their
   changes in AIHA patients. Accordingly, blockade of IL-33 interfered with
   AIHA incidence and ameliorated disease activity. Vice vasa, enforced
   IL-33 promoted AIHA incidence and disease activity.
   Conclusions: IL-33 was a potential biomarker for monitoring disease
   activity and therapeutic response in AIHA patients. Targeting IL-33 was
   a promising strategy for controlling autoantibody production in AIHA
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{The 1-loop partition function of the handlebody solutions in the AdS(3)
   gravity have been derived some years ago using the heat kernel
   techniques and the method of images. In the semiclassical limit, such
   partition function should correspond to the order O(c(0)) part in the
   partition function of dual conformal field theory(CFT) on the boundary
   Riemann surface. The higher genus partition function could be computed
   by the multipoint functions in the Riemann sphere via sewing
   prescription. In the large central charge limit, the CFT is effectively
   free in the sense that to the leading order of c the multi-point
   function is further simplified to be a summation over the products of
   two-point functions of single-particle states. Correspondingly in the
   bulk, the graviton is freely propagating without interaction.
   Furthermore the product of the two-point functions may define the links,
   each of which is in one-to-one correspondence with the conjugacy class
   of the Schottky group of the Riemann surface. Moreover, the value of a
   link is determined by the multiplier of the element in the conjugacy
   class. This allows us to reproduce exactly the gravitational 1-loop
   partition function. The proof can be generalized to the higher spin
   gravity and its dual CFT.}},

   Culture-Positive Pulmonary Tuberculosis}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most serious infectious diseases
   globally and has high mortality rates. A variety of diagnostic tests are
   available, yet none are wholly reliable. Serum cytokines, although
   significantly and frequently induced by different diseases and thus good
   biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis, are not sufficiently
   disease-specific. TB-specific antibody detection, on the other hand, has
   been reported to be highly specific but not sufficiently sensitive. In
   this study, our aim was to improve the sensitivity and specificity of TB
   diagnosis by combining detection of TB-related cytokines and TB-specific
   antibodies in peripheral blood samples.
   Methods
   TB-related serum cytokines were screened using a human cytokine array.
   TB-related cytokines and TB-specific antibodies were detected in
   parallel with microarray technology. The diagnostic performance of the
   new protocol for active TB was systematically compared with other
   traditional methods.
   Results
   Here, we show that cytokines I-309, IL-8 and MIG are capable of
   distinguishing patients with active TB from healthy controls, patients
   with latent TB infection, and those with a range of other pulmonary
   diseases, and that these cytokines, and their presence alongside
   antibodies for TB-specific antigens Ag14-16kDa, Ag32kDa, Ag38kDa and
   Ag85B, are specific markers for active TB. The diagnostic protocol for
   active TB developed here, which combines the detection of three
   TB-related cytokines and TB-specific antibodies, is highly sensitive
   (91.03\%), specific (90.77\%) and accurate (90.87\%).
   Conclusions
   Our results show that combining detection of TB-related cytokines and
   TB-specific antibodies significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy for
   active TB, providing greater accuracy than conventional diagnostic
   methods such as interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs), TB antibody
   Colloidal Gold Assays and microbiological culture, and suggest that this
   diagnostic protocol has potential for clinical application.}},

Abstract = {{Integrating environmental aspects into industrial practices has become a
   necessity. In fact, climate change and resource depletion have been
   established scientifically and can no more be neglected. Life Cycle
   Assessment is acknowledged to be an efficient tool to establish a
   product environmental profile and can be useful to businesses wishing to
   analyze their environmental record. Decreasing a building environmental
   footprint implies, among other considerations, a proper choice of
   building materials, both structural and architectural. A good avenue
   would be to select low environmental impact materials from
   cradle-to-grave. Architectural wooden doors are often specified in
   non-residential buildings in North America. However, only one Life Cycle
   Assessment has been carried out on wooden doors. This study explores the
   cradle-to-grave environmental profile of an interior wood door in a
   North American context. According to the results, the main contributor
   to the product impacts is the production of raw materials, especially
   the particleboard component, and their transportation to the
   manufacturing plant. The urea formaldehyde production is the main reason
   for particleboard impacts among the three damage categories, human
   health, climate change and resources, of IMPACT 2002+. The other life
   cycle stages that have a noticeable influence on the door environmental
   impacts are shipping and end-of-life. Transportation as a whole affected
   the system total environmental score. The current results could serve as
   a basis for ecodesign implementation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Vision-based Recognition of Activities by a Humanoid Robot}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED ROBOTIC SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{We present an autonomous assistive robotic system for human activity
   recognition from video sequences. Due to the large variability inherent
   to video capture from a nonfixed robot (as opposed to a fixed camera),
   as well as the robot's limited computing resources, implementation has
   been guided by robustness to this variability and by memory and
   computing speed efficiency. To accommodate motion speed variability
   across users, we encode motion using dense interest point trajectories.
   Our recognition model harnesses the dense interest point bag-of-words
   representation through an intersection kernel-based SVM that better
   accommodates the large intra-class variability stemming from a robot
   operating in different locations and conditions. To contextually assess
   the engine as implemented in the robot, we compare it with the most
   recent approaches of human action recognition performed on public
   datasets (non-robot-based), including a novel approach of our own that
   is based on a two-layer SVM-hidden conditional random field sequential
   recognition model. The latter's performance is among the best within the
   recent state of the art. We show that our robot-based recognition
   engine, while less accurate than the sequential model, nonetheless shows
   good performances, especially given the adverse test conditions of the
   robot, relative to those of a fixed camera.}},

Title = {{Classification epitopes in groups based on their protein family}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: The humoral immune system response is based on the
   interaction between antibodies and antigens for the clearance of
   pathogens and foreign molecules. The interaction between these proteins
   occurs at specific positions known as antigenic determinants or B-cell
   epitopes. The experimental identification of epitopes is costly and time
   consuming. Therefore the use of in silico methods, to help discover new
   epitopes, is an appealing alternative due the importance of biomedical
   applications such as vaccine design, disease diagnostic, anti-venoms and
   immune-therapeutics. However, the performance of predictions is not
   optimal been around 70\% of accuracy. Further research could increase
   our understanding of the biochemical and structural properties that
   characterize a B-cell epitope.
   Results: We investigated the possibility of linear epitopes from the
   same protein family to share common properties. This hypothesis led us
   to analyze physico-chemical (PCP) and predicted secondary structure
   (PSS) features of a curated dataset of epitope sequences available in
   the literature belonging to two different groups of antigens
   (metalloproteinases and neurotoxins). We discovered statistically
   significant parameters with data mining techniques which allow us to
   distinguish neurotoxin from metalloproteinase and these two from random
   sequences. After a five cross fold validation we found that PCP based
   models obtained area under the curve values (AUC) and accuracy above 0.9
   for regression, decision tree and support vector machine.
   Conclusions: We demonstrated that antigen's family can be inferred from
   properties within a single group of linear epitopes (metalloproteinases
   or neurotoxins). Also we discovered the characteristics that represent
   these two epitope groups including their similarities and differences
   with random peptides and their respective amino acid sequence. These
   findings open new perspectives to improve epitope prediction by
   considering the specific antigen's protein family. We expect that these
   findings will help to improve current computational mapping methods
   based on physico-chemical due it's potential application during epitope
   discovery.}},

Abstract = {{Background: An in vitro electrophysiological assay system, which can
   assess compound effects and thus show cardiotoxicity including
   arrhythmia risks of test drugs, is an essential method in the field of
   drug development and toxicology.
   Methods: In this study, high-throughput electrophysiological recordings
   of human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells and Chinese hamster ovary
   (CHO) cells stably expressing human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG)
   were performed utilizing an automated 384-well-patch-clamp system, which
   records up to 384 cells simultaneously. hERG channel inhibition, which
   is closely related to a drug-induced QT prolongation and is increasing
   the risk of sudden cardiac death, was investigated in the
   high-throughput screening patch-clamp system.
   Results: In the automated patch-clamp measurements performed here, K-v
   currents were investigated with high efficiency. Various hERG channel
   blockers showed concentration-dependent inhibition, the 50 \% inhibitory
   concentrations (IC50) of those blockers were in good agreement with
   previous reports.
   Conclusions: The high-throughput patch-clamp system has a high potential
   in the field of pharmacology, toxicology, and cardiac physiology, and
   will contribute to the acceleration of pharmaceutical drug development
   and drug safety testing.}},

Abstract = {{We report a simple and versatile method to covalently immobilize
   molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) nanoparticles on a Raman active
   substrate (Klarite) using a disulfide-derivatized perfluorophenylazide
   (PFPA-disulfide). Gold-coated Klarite was functionalized with
   PFPA-disulfide via a gold sulfur bond. Upon light radiation, the
   available azido groups were converted to highly reactive singlet
   perfluorophenyl nitrene that undergoes a CH insertion reaction and form
   covalent bonds with the MIP nanoparticles. The resulting surfaces were
   characterized using scanning electron microscopy and surface enhanced
   Raman spectroscopy to study the morphology and template affinity of the
   surfaces, respectively. The Raman measurements clearly show a
   dose-responsive signal when propranolol binds to the MIP surface.
   Because the MIP particles were covalently attached to the Raman active
   substrate, the sensing surface was stable and could be reused after
   regeneration in acetic acid solution. The MIP-based Raman sensor was
   used successfully to detect propranolol in urine samples (7.7 X 10(-4)
   M). Our results show that the high selectivity of MLPs and the
   fingerprint Raman identification can be integrated into a compact
   sensing unit using high-efficiency photoconjugation. Thus, the method
   proposed is reliable, efficient and fast for fabricating label-free
   chemical sensors.}},

Title = {{Universal scaling law for the condensation energy across a broad range

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{One of the goals in understanding any new class of superconductors is to
   search for commonalities with other known superconductors. The present
   work investigates the superconducting condensation energy, U, in the
   iron based superconductors (IBSs), and compares their U with a broad
   range of other distinct classes of superconductor, including
   conventional BCS elements and compounds and the unconventional heavy
   fermion, Sr2RuO4, Li0.1ZrNCl, kappa-(BEDT-TTF)(2)Cu(NCS)(2), and
   optimally doped cuprate superconductors. Surprisingly, both the
   magnitude and T-c dependence (U proportional to T-3.4 +/- 0.2 of U
   are-contrary to the previously observed behavior of the specific heat
   discontinuity at T-c, Delta C-quite similar in the IBS and BCS materials
   for T-c > 1.4 K. In contrast, the heavy fermion superconductors' U vs
   T-c are strongly (up to a factor of 100) enhanced above the IBS/BCS
   while the cuprate superconductors' U are strongly (factor of 8) reduced.
   However, scaling of U with the specific heat gamma(or Delta C) brings
   all the superconductors investigated onto one universal dependence upon
   Tc. This apparent universal scaling U/gamma proportional to T-c(2) for
   all superconductor classes investigated, both weak and strong coupled
   and both conventional and unconventional, links together extremely
   disparate behaviors over almost seven orders of magnitude for U and
   almost three orders of magnitude for T-c. Since U has not yet been
   explicitly calculated beyond the weak coupling limit, the present
   results can help direct theoretical efforts into the medium and strong
   coupling regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Crystalloid podocytopathy with focal segmental
   glomerulosclerosis in plasma cell myeloma (PCM) is rare.
   Case Presentation: We present a case of crystalline deposition in the
   bone marrow (BM) and various renal cells with only proteinuria as a
   symptom. As workup for proteinuria, a renal biopsy sample was obtained.
   EM showed multiple crystalline depositions in renal tubular cells and
   podocytes. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with crystalloid
   podocytopathy was diagnosed. Because monoclonal gammopathy was detected
   in the serum and urine, a BM study was also performed. Plasma cells with
   needle-shaped inclusion bodies were observed. The crystalline deposits
   in the plasma cells and podocytes were positive for Masson's trichrome
   and kappa light-chain staining. These findings indicated that the
   crystalline deposits originated from paraprotein. The case showed a rare
   process of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis via crystalline deposition
   in podocytes in plasma cell myeloma.
   Conclusions: Crystalloid podocytopathy is a likely cause of renal damage
   such as FSGS in PCM, although it is an uncommon mechanism for myeloma
   kidney.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate that migration away from self-produced chemicals
   (chemorepulsion) generates a generic route to clustering and pattern
   formation among self-propelled colloids. The clustering instability can
   be caused either by anisotropic chemical production, or by a delayed
   orientational response to changes of the chemical environment. In each
   case, chemorepulsion creates clusters of a self-limiting area which
   grows linearly with self-propulsion speed. This agrees with recent
   observations of dynamic clusters in Janus colloids (albeit not yet known
   to be chemorepulsive). More generally, our results could inform design
   principles for the self-assembly of chemorepulsive synthetic swimmers
   and/or bacteria into nonequilibrium patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon quantum dots (CDs) combined with self-assembly strategy have
   created an innovative way to fabricate novel hybrids for biological
   analysis. This study demonstrates a new fluorescence platform with
   enhanced selectivity for copper ion sensing in the striatum of the rat
   brain following the cerebral calm/sepsis process. Here, the fabrication
   of silica coated CDs probes is based on the efficient hybridization of
   APTES which act as a precursor of organosilane self-assembly, with CDs
   to form silica-coated CDs probes. The fluorescent properties including
   intensity, fluorescence quantum yield, excitation-independent region,
   and red/blue shift of the emission wavelength of the probe are tunable
   through reliable regulation of the ratio of CDs and APTES, realizing
   selectivity and sensitivity-oriented Cu2+ sensing. The as-prepared
   probes (i.e., 3.33\% APTES-0.9 mg mL(-1) CDs probe) show a synergistic
   amplification effect of CDs and APTES on enhancing the fluorescence
   signal of Cu2+ detection through fluorescent self-quenching. The
   underlying mechanism can be ascribed to the stronger interaction
   including chelation and electrostatic attraction between Cu2+ and N and
   O atoms-containing as well as negatively charged silica-coated CDs than
   other interference. Interestingly, colorimetric assay and Tyndall effect
   can be observed and applied to directly distinguish the concentration of
   Cu2+ by the naked eye. The proposed fluorescent platform here has been
   successfully applied to monitor the alteration of striatum Cu2+ in rat
   brain during the cerebral calm/sepsis process. The versatile properties
   of the probe provide a new and effective fluorescent platform for the
   sensing method in vivo sampled from the rat brain.}},

Abstract = {{The inconclusive results of the previous first-principles studies on the
   Sigma 3 grain boundaries (GBs) in CuInSe2 reveal the importance of
   employing a method that can correctly describe the electronic structure
   of this solar-cell material. We employ hybrid functional calculations to
   study the Sigma 3(112) and Sigma 3(114) GBs in CuInSe2 and CuGaSe2. The
   electronic structure changes introduced by the formation of GBs are
   threefold: the creation of gap states, a shift in band edges, and the
   alteration of band-gap sizes. Gap states commonly behave as
   recombination centers, but the band alignment and the change in the
   band-gap size induced by GBs mitigate the destructive effect of these
   states in CuInSe2. That means that S3 GBs are not detrimental for the

Abstract = {{Effect of air-sea coupling on the frequency distribution of intense
   tropical cyclones (TCs) over the northwestern Pacific (NWP) region is
   investigated using an atmosphere and ocean coupled general circulation
   model (AOGCM). Monthly varying flux adjustment enables AOGCM to simulate
   both subseasonal air-sea interaction and realistic seasonal to
   interannual sea surface temperature (SST) variability. The maximum of
   intense TC distribution around 20-30 degrees N in the AGCM shifts
   equatorward in the AOGCM due to the air-sea coupling. Hence, AOGCM
   reduces northward intense TC distribution bias seen in AGCM. Over the
   NWP, AOGCM-simulated SST variability is large around 20-30 degrees N
   where the warm mixed layer becomes shallower rapidly. Active entrainment
   from subsurface water over this region causes stronger SST cooling, and
   hence, TC intensity decreases. These results suggest that air-sea
   coupling characterized by subsurface oceanic condition causes more
   realistic distribution of intense TCs over the NWP.}},

Abstract = {{Nanopores are now being used not only as an ionic current sensor but
   also as a means to localize molecules near alternative sensors with
   higher sensitivity and/or selectivity. One example is a solid-state
   nanopore embedded in a graphene nanoribbon (GNR) transistor. Such a
   device possesses the high conductivity needed for higher bandwidth
   measurements and, because of its single-atomic-layer thickness, can
   improve the spatial resolution of the measurement. Here measurements of
   ionic current through the nanopore are shown during double-stranded DNA
   (dsDNA) translocation, along with the simultaneous response of the
   neighboring GNR due to changes in the surrounding electric potential.
   Cross-talk originating from capacitive coupling between the two
   measurement channels is observed, resulting in a transient response in
   the GNR during DNA translocation; however, a modulation in device
   conductivity is not observed via an electric-field-effect response
   during DNA translocation. A field-effect response would scale with GNR
   source-drain voltage (V-ds), whereas the capacitive coupling does not
   scale with V-ds. In order to take advantage of the high bandwidth
   potential of such sensors, the field-effect response must be enhanced.
   Potential field calculations are presented to outline a phase diagram
   for detection within the device parameter space, charting a roadmap for
   future optimization of such devices.}},

Abstract = {{The Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry
   (SABER) instrument on board the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere
   Energetics and Dynamics satellite has been measuring the limb radiance
   in 10 broadband infrared channels over the altitude range from similar
   to 400 km to the Earth's surface since 2002. The kinetic temperatures
   and CO2 volume mixing ratios (VMRs) in the mesosphere and lower
   thermosphere have been simultaneously retrieved using SABER limb
   radiances at 15 and 4.3 mu m under nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium
   (non-LTE) conditions. This paper presents results of a validation study
   of the SABER CO2 VMRs obtained with a two-channel, self-consistent
   temperature/CO2 retrieval algorithm. Results are based on comparisons
   with coincident CO2 measurements made by the Atmospheric Chemistry
   Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer (ACE-FTS) and simulations
   using the Specified Dynamics version of the Whole Atmosphere Community
   Climate Model (SD-WACCM). The SABER CO2 VMRs are in agreement with
   ACE-FTS observations within reported systematic uncertainties from 65 to
   110 km. The annual average SABER CO2 VMR falls off from a well-mixed
   value above similar to 80 km. Latitudinal and seasonal variations of CO2
   VMRs are substantial. SABER observations and the SD-WACCM simulations
   are in overall agreement for CO2 seasonal variations, as well as global
   distributions in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Not
   surprisingly, the CO2 seasonal variation is shown to be driven by the
   general circulation, converging in the summer polar mesopause region and
   diverging in the winter polar mesopause region.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. Lacosamide is a sodium channel blocker antiepileptic drug
   authorized as an adjunctive therapy for focal seizures in adolescents
   and adults.
   Aim. To analyze the efficacy and safety of lacosamide in Galicia
   according to its use in daily clinical practice.
   Patients and methods. Retrospective observational study in patients who
   started treatment with lacosamide between January 2014 and June 2013 in
   10 hospitals in Galicia, Spain. Its efficacy and safety at 3, 6 and 12
   months after starting lacosamide was assessed.
   Results. We included 184 patients with a mean age of 44.2 +/- 17.4 years
   old; 56.5\% (n = 104) were male; 173 patients constituted the efficacy
   population. Mean duration of epilepsy was 18.8 +/- 15.5 years. Seizure
   frequency was 2.5 +/- 1.6 episodes/month. After 12 months, 68.2\% of
   patients (n = 118) had >= 50\% improvement (responders) and among them,
   54 (45.8\% of responder patients) were seizure free. Twenty-three
   percent (n = 43) suffered from adverse events after 12 months, being
   dizziness (10.3\%) and instability (3.3\%) the most frequently reported.
   After the 12 month visit, 87.5\% of patients (n = 161) continued
   treatment with lacosamide.
   Conclusions. Lacosamide provides a very good efficacy and safety profile
   for patients with focal refractory epilepsy. High percentage of
   responders may be related to a less refractory population compared to
   other daily clinical practice studies. It constitutes an attractive
   therapeutic option for the treatment of focal epilepsies.}},

Abstract = {{Induced circular dichroism of thioflavin T (ThT) intercalated in
   acetylcholinesterase has been modeled by means of density functional
   theory. ThT in acetylcholinesterase is reported to be flat and thus
   cannot exhibit induced CD associated with a `chiral twist' mechanism, i.
   e. stabilization of one of the enantiomeric forms by a chiral
   environment. Even so, the presence of aromatic side chains forming the
   cavity in which ThT is bound is predicted to induce substantial Cotton
   effect in ThT, of the magnitude comparable to the one predicted to
   originate from a `chiral twist' mechanism. The predicted Cotton effect
   originates mostly from deformation of electron density of ThT by the
   presence of the aromatic rings, the contribution from crystallization
   water molecules being one order of magnitude smaller. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Hierarchical deconstruction of mouse olfactory sensory neurons: from
   whole mucosa to single-cell RNA-seq}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{The mouse olfactory mucosa is a complex chemosensory tissue composed of
   multiple cell types, neuronal and non-neuronal. We have here applied
   RNA-seq hierarchically, in three steps of decreasing cellular
   heterogeneity: starting with crude tissue samples dissected from the
   nose, proceeding to flow-cytometrically sorted pools of mature olfactory
   sensory neurons (OSNs), and finally arriving at single mature OSNs. We
   show that 98.9\% of intact olfactory receptor (OR) genes are expressed
   in mature OSNs. We uncover a hitherto unknown bipartition among mature
   OSNs. We find that 19 of 21 single mature OSNs each express a single
   intact OR gene abundantly, consistent with the one neuron-one receptor
   rule. For the 9 single OSNs where the two alleles of the abundantly
   expressed OR gene exhibit single-nucleotide polymorphisms, we
   demonstrate that monoallelic expression of the abundantly expressed OR
   gene is extremely tight. The remaining two single mature OSNs lack OR
   gene expression but express Trpc2 and Gucy1b2. We establish these two
   cells as a neuronal cell type that is fundamentally distinct from
   canonical, OR-expressing OSNs and that is defined by the differential,
   higher expression of 55 genes. We propose this tiered experimental
   approach as a paradigm to unravel gene expression in other cellularly
   heterogeneous systems.}},

Title = {{NERI: network-medicine based integrative approach for disease gene
   prioritization by relative importance}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Complex diseases are characterized as being polygenic and
   multifactorial, so this poses a challenge regarding the search for genes
   related to them. With the advent of high-throughput technologies for
   genome sequencing, gene expression measurements (transcriptome), and
   protein-protein interactions, complex diseases have been sistematically
   investigated. Particularly, Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks
   have been used to prioritize genes related to complex diseases according
   to its topological features. However, PPI networks are affected by
   ascertainment bias, in which more studied proteins tend to have more
   connections, degrading the results quality. Additionally, methods using
   only PPI networks can provide only static and non-specific results,
   since the topologies of these networks are not specific of a given
   disease.
   Results: The goal of this work is to develop a methodology that
   integrates PPI networks with disease specific data sources, such as GWAS
   and gene expression, to find genes more specific of a given complex
   disease. After the integration of PPI networks and gene expression data,
   the resulting network is used to connect genes related to the disease
   through the shortest paths that have the greatest concordance between
   their gene expressions. Both case and control expression data are used
   separately and, at the end, the most altered genes between the two
   conditions are selected. To evaluate the method, schizophrenia was
   adopted as case study.
   Conclusion: Results show that the proposed method successfully retrieves
   differentially coexpressed genes in two conditions, while avoiding the
   bias from literature. Moreover we were able to achieve a greater
   concordance in the selection of important genes from different
   microarray studies of the same disease and to produce a more specific
   gene set related to the studied disease.}},

Title = {{Artificial Selection of Gn1a Plays an Important role in Improving Rice
   Yields Across Different Ecological Regions}},
Journal = {{RICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Rice is one of the most important crops, and it is essential
   to improve rice productivity to satisfy the future global food supply
   demands. Gn1a (OsCKX2), which encodes cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase,
   plays an important role in regulating rice grain yield.
   Results: In this study, we analyzed the genetic variation of Gn1a, which
   influences grain yield through controlling the number of spikelets in
   rice. The allelic variations in the promoter, 5' untranslated region
   (UTR) and coding sequence (CDS) of Gn1a were investigated in 175
   cultivars and 21 wild rice accessions. We found that Gn1a showed less
   sequence variation in the cultivars, but exhibited significant
   nucleotide diversity in wild rice. A total of 14 alleles, named AP1 to
   AP14, were identified in the cultivars based on the amino acid
   divergence of GN1A. Association analysis revealed that the number of
   spikelets and grain yield were significantly different between the
   different alleles. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the three main
   alleles, AP3, AP8 and AP9, in the cultivars might originate from a
   common ancestor allele, AP1, in wild rice.
   Conclusions: Of these alleles in the cultivars, AP9 was suggested as the
   best allele in indica, as it has shown strong artificial selection in
   breeding high-yield rice in the past. It might be valuable to explore
   the high-yield-related alleles of Gn1a to develop high-yield rice
   cultivars in future breeding programs.}},

   KCa2Nb3O10 crystals with significantly larger sizes. By using different
   flux materials (K2SO4 and K2MoO4), crystals with average sizes of 8 and
   20 mu m, respectively, were obtained. The KCa2Nb3O10 crystals from K2SO4
   and K2MoO4 assisted synthesis were protonated and exfoliated into
   monolayer nanosheets, and the optimal exfoliation conditions were
   determined. Using pulsed laser deposition, highly (001)-oriented
   piezoelectric stacks (SrRuO3/PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3/SrRuO3, SRO/PZT/SRO) were
   deposited onto Langmuir-Blodgett films of Ca2Nb3O10- (CNO) nanosheets
   with varying lateral nanosheet sizes on Si substrates. The resulting PZT
   thin films showed high crystallinity irrespective of nanosheet size. The
   small sized nanosheets yielded a high longitudinal piezoelectric
   coefficient d(33) of 100 pm/V, while the larger sized sheets had a d(33)
   of 72 pm/V. An enhanced transverse piezoelectric coefficient d(31) of
   -107 pm/V, an important input parameter for the actuation of active
   structures in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices, was
   obtained for PZT films grown on CNO nanosheets with large lateral size,
   while the corresponding value on small sized sheets was -96 pm/V.}},

Abstract = {{In this effort, we examined the piezoelectric properties of the
   multi-walled boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), and the influence of the
   tube layer number on these properties using molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations. The results reveal that the piezoelectric coefficient is
   positive for BNNTs with odd numbers of layers but negative for those
   with even numbers of layers. For both, odd and even cases, the magnitude
   of the piezoelectric coefficient is found to decrease with increasing
   layer number of BNNTs. A simple continuum mechanics model is developed
   and reveals that the observed layer number-dependent piezoelectric
   coefficient of the multi-walled BNNTs mainly originates from their
   unique inversely stacked structure. In addition, integrating the
   continuum mechanics model with the MD data leads to an explicit
   expression for the piezoelectric coefficient of multi-walled BNNTs,
   which can be easily used to predict the piezoelectric coefficient of
   BNNTs with various layer numbers.}},

   Hexacyanoferrate Cathode for Zinc-Ion Battery}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{Zinc hexacyanoferrate (ZnHCF) which is a dimorphic (cubic or
   rhombohedral) Prussian blue analogue and can be intercalated by both
   monovalent and divalent ions, is a promising cathode material for
   rechargeable aqueous metal-ion batteries. In this paper, a simple
   co-precipitation method is developed to tune the particle morphology of
   ZnHCF by adjusting the dropping speed at room temperature. Three
   polyhedral ZnHCF particles, with cubooctahedral, truncated octahedral or
   octahedral shapes, are obtained at room temperature. Structural
   transformation from cubic phase of as-prepared ZnHCF to rhombohedral
   phase is observed by further dehydration of the sample at 70 degrees C,
   whereas the dehydrated ZnHCF crystals still hold the identical
   polyhedral shape as that of the cubic phase particles. Then the
   influence of shape and facets on electrochemical performance is studied
   for polyhedral ZnHCF with rhombohedral structure (RZnHCF). RZnHCF sample
   with cubooctahedral shape possesses the best rate capability and cyclic
   stability comparing with RZnHCF particles having truncated octahedral or
   octahedral shapes. Furthermore, the structure of cuboctahedron RZnHCF
   particles during electrochemical cycling has been monitored with ex situ
   X-ray diffraction to demonstrate the reversible zinc-ion intercalation
   mechanism.}},

Title = {{Evidence for Association of Cell Adhesion Molecules Pathway and NLGN1
   Polymorphisms with Schizophrenia in Chinese Han Population}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Multiple risk variants of schizophrenia have been identified by
   Genome-wide association studies (GWAS). As a complement for GWAS,
   previous pathway-based analysis has indicated that cell adhesion
   molecules (CAMs) pathway might be involved in the pathogenesis of
   schizophrenia. However, less replication studies have been reported. Our
   objective was to investigate the association between CAMs pathway and
   schizophrenia in the Chinese Han population. We first performed a
   pathway analysis utilizing our previous GWAS data. The CAMs pathway
   (hsa04514) was significantly associated with schizophrenia using hybrid
   gene set-based test (P = 1.03x10(-10)) and hypergeometric test (P =
   5.04x10(-6)). Moreover, 12 genes (HLA-A, HLA-C, HLA-DOB, HLA-DPB1,
   HLA-DQA2, HLA-DRB1, MPZ, CD276, NLGN1, NRCAM, CLDN1 and ICAM3) were
   modestly significantly associated with schizophrenia (P<0.01). Then, we
   selected one promising gene neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) to further investigate
   the association between eight significant SNPs and schizophrenia in an
   independent sample (1814 schizophrenia cases and 1487 healthy controls).
   Our study showed that seven SNPs of NLGN1 and two haplotype blocks were
   significantly associated with schizophrenia. This association was
   confirmed by the results of combined analysis. Among them, SNP rs9835385
   had the most significant association with schizophrenia (P =
   2.83x10(-7)). Furthermore, in silico analysis we demonstrated that NLGN1
   is preferentially expressed in human brain and SNP rs1488547 was related
   to the expression level. We validated the association of CAMs pathway
   with schizophrenia in pathway-level and identified one susceptibility
   gene NLGN1. Further investigation of the roles of CAMs pathway in the
   pathogenesis of schizophrenia is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{An important application of DNA microarray data is cancer
   classification. Because of the high-dimensionality problem of microarray
   data, gene selection approaches are often employed to support the expert
   systems in diagnostic capability of cancer with high classification
   accuracy. Penalized logistic regression using the least absolute
   shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is one of the key steps in
   high-dimensional cancer classification, as gene coefficient estimation
   and gene selection simultaneously. However, the LASSO has been
   criticized for being biased in gene selection. The adaptive LASSO (APLR)
   was originally proposed to overcome the selection bias by assigning a
   consistent weight to each gene. In high-dimensional data, however, the
   adaptive LASSO faces practical problems in choosing the type of initial
   weight. In practice, the LASSO estimator itself has been used as an
   initial weight. However, this may not be preferable because the LASSO is
   inconsistent in itself. To address this issue, an alternative initial
   weight in adaptive penalized logistic regression (CBPLR) is proposed.
   The effectiveness of the CBPLR is examined on three well-known
   high-dimensional cancer classification datasets using number of selected
   genes, area under the curve, and misclassification rate. The
   experimental results reveal that the proposed CBPLR is quite efficient
   and feasible for cancer classification. Additionally, the proposed
   weight is compared with APLR and LASSO and exhibits competitive
   performance in both classification accuracy and gene selection. The
   proposed CBPLR has significant impact in penalized logistic regression
   by selecting fewer genes with high area under the curve and low
   misclassification rate. Thus, the proposed weight could conceivably be
   used in other research that implements gene selection in the field of
   high dimensional cancer classification. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The initiation of cytotoxic immune responses by dendritic cells (DCs)
   requires the presentation of antigenic peptides derived from
   phagocytosed microbes and infected or dead cells to CD8(+) T cells, a
   process called cross-presentation. Antigen cross-presentation by
   non-activated DCs, however, is not sufficient for the effective
   induction of immune responses. Additionally, DCs need to be activated
   through innate receptors, like Toll-like receptors (TLRs). During DC
   maturation, cross-presentation efficiency is first upregulated and then
   turned off. Here we show that during this transient phase of enhanced
   cross-presentation, phago-lysosome fusion was blocked by the topological
   re-organization of lysosomes into perinuclear clusters. LPS-induced
   lysosomal clustering, inhibition of phago-lysosome fusion and enhanced
   cross-presentation, all required expression of the GTPase Rab34. We
   conclude that TLR4 engagement induces a Rab34-dependent re-organization
   of lysosomal distribution that delays antigen degradation to transiently
   enhance cross- presentation, thereby optimizing the priming of CD8(+) T
   cell responses against pathogens.}},

Abstract = {{In chemical looping combustion (CLC), the oxygen carrier circulates
   between two interconnected fluidized beds. Experiments can provide
   substantial insight into the hydrodynamic behaviour of CLC, but are
   limited to the scale of the investigated pilot plant. Furthermore, the
   availability of detailed experimental information from pilot plants is
   difficult because of the lack of accessibility, the harsh environment
   and the costs of measuring devices. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
   offers a significant contribution to the direct measurements. A recent
   literature review shows that Euler Euler CFD based model has not yet
   been applied to chemical looping combustion of coal. Therefore, a three
   dimensional, transient simulation model for the fuel reactor of CLC has
   been developed. Besides the calculation of gas solid flow, the model
   includes an accurate description of kinetic models for pyrolysis,
   heterogeneous reactions and related heat and mass transfer processes.
   The extended Euler Euler/thermochemical reaction model is validated with
   measurements obtained from the world's second largest CLC pilot plant (1
   MWth) erected at TU Darmstadt. The numerical results suggest that the
   pressure drop in the fuel reactor, the exiting flue gas composition as
   well as the solid fuel conversion can be predicted reasonably. The
   validated model is of relevance for further feasibility and scale up
   studies of CLC. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Boletus edulis and allied species (porcini) are one of the most
   appreciated and consumed species in the world. Despite their ecological
   and economic importance, little information is available on the
   mycobiota that characterize their natural growing habitats. Due to the
   importance to preserve the areas where these precious species grow,
   three different broadleaf sites were investigated to describe the above
   ground macrofungal communities. These forests, located in North-west
   Italy (Liguria), were intensively surveyed over three consecutive years
   by sporomata analysis. Altogether 243 fungal taxa were recorded in the
   selected 60 plots. The statistical results reveal that the studied
   sites, despite differing in vegetation type, are very similar in
   macrofungal species richness and composition. The ectomycorrhizal fungal
   group was the richest both in number and percentage. Comparisons of our
   results with other European mycological investigations suggest that
   porcini broadleaf sites are characterized by a similar and peculiar
   mycobiota.}},

Abstract = {{The finite phase transition temperature, T-N, of quasi two-dimensional
   (2D) Heisenberg antiferromagnetic (AF) crystals results from in-plane
   anisotropy or coupling between layers. It is usually not known which is
   the determining factor when both are weak. We show by an electron spin
   resonance experiment that in the quasi 2D antiferromagnetic
   crystal,kappa-(BEDT-TTF)(2)Cu{[}N(CN)(2)] Cl, TN is determined by
   in-plane anisotropy while interlayer coupling plays a minor role. The
   compound has a large isotropic Heisenberg exchange interaction between
   sites with S = 1/2 spins. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction is
   the main source of anisotropy, while in-plane anisotropy and the
   interlayer coupling are very weak. The external-field field-induced
   static and fluctuating AF magnetizations are independent in adjacent
   layers above the (zero-field) ordering temperature.}},

Abstract = {{A water-soluble glucopyranosyl conjugate, L, has been synthesized and
   characterized by different analytical and spectral techniques. The L has
   been demonstrated to have switch-on fluorescence enhancement of similar
   to 7S fold in the presence of La3+ among the nine lanthanide ions
   studied in the HEPES buffer at pH 7.4. A minimum detection limit of 140
   nM (16 +/- 2 ppb) was shown by L for La3+ in the buffer at physiological
   pH. The utility of L has been demonstrated by showing its sensitivity
   toward La3+ on Whatman filter paper strips. The reversible and reusable
   action of L has been demonstrated by monitoring the fluorescence changes
   as a function of the addition of La3+ followed by F- and HPO42- ions.
   The complexation of L by La3+ was shown by absorption spectra wherein
   isosbestic behavior was observed. The Job's plot suggests a 2:1 complex
   between L and La3+, and the same was supported by ESI-MS. The control
   molecular study revealed the necessity of hydroxy quinoline and the
   amine group for La3+ ion binding and the glyco-moiety to bring water
   solubility and biocompatibility. The structural features of the
   {[}2L+La3+] complex were established by DFT computational calculations.
   The chemo-ensemble, {[}2L+La3+], is shown responsible for providing
   intracellular fluorescence imaging in HepG2 cells.}},

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{While human impacts on rivers and other landforms have long been a
   component of geomorphic research, little of this work explicitly
   includes insights into human agency from social science or recognises
   that in many cases rivers can be considered to be hybrid co-productions
   or `socio-natures'. A socio-geomorphic approach proposed here has
   parallels with some aspects of sociohydrology and can extend and enrich
   existing geomorphic explanations of the morphology of, for example,
   urban rivers by explicitly recognising and working with the co-evolution
   of the human and natural systems. Examples from recent literature
   illustrate ways in which these relationships can be understood and
   analyzed, showing a range of socio-natural influences in particular
   contexts that have material consequences for river morphology and
   recognising that events in the system have many forms. The approach
   recognises the importance of contingency in time and place together with
   the role and nature of both local and global knowledge. An important
   element of this approach is that it provides ways for understanding the
   nature, position and intention of geomorphic and other scientific
   interventions as part of the system, for example in the case of river
   restoration. This also leads to the need for reflexivity by
   geomorphologists and reconsideration of the nature of geomorphological
   knowledge by those involved in such work and with respect to
   sociogeomorphology as a whole. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading type of lung cancer and
   has a poor prognosis. We have shown that chronic stress promoted NSCLC
   xenografts in mice via stress neurotransmitter-activated cAMP signaling
   downstream of beta-adrenergic receptors and incidental beta-blocker
   therapy was reported to improve clinical outcomes in NSCLC patients.
   These findings suggest that psychological stress promotes NSCLC whereas
   pharmacologically or psychologically induced decreases in cAMP may
   inhibit NSCLC. Cancer stem cells are thought to drive the development,
   progression and resistance to therapy of NSCLC. However, their potential
   regulation by stress neurotransmitters has not been investigated. In the
   current study, epinephrine increased the number of cancer stem cell like
   cells (CSCs) from three NSCLC cell lines in spheroid formation assays
   while enhancing intracellular cAMP and the stem cell markers sonic
   hedgehog (SHH), aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 (ALDH-1) and Gli1, effects
   reversed by GABA or dynorphin B via G(i)-mediated inhibition of cAMP
   formation. The growth of NSCLC xenografts in a mouse model of stress
   reduction was significantly reduced as compared with mice maintained
   under standard conditions. Stress reduction reduced serum levels of
   corticosterone, norepinephrine and epinephrine while the inhibitory
   neurotransmitter -aminobutyric acid (GABA) and opioid peptides
   increased. Stress reduction significantly reduced cAMP, VEGF, p-ERK,
   p-AKT, p-CREB, p-SRc, SHH, ALDH-1 and Gli1 in xenograft tissues whereas
   cleaved caspase-3 and p53 were induced. We conclude that stress
   neurotransmitters activate CSCs in NSCLC via multiple cAMP-mediated
   pathways and that pharmacologically or psychologically induced decreases
   in cAMP signaling may improve clinical outcomes in NSCLC patients.
   What's new? Despite significant reduction in smoking, the incidence of
   non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not significantly decreased. Here
   the authors uncover a novel link between NSLC and psychological stress.
   They show that the stress neurotransmitter epinephrine increases the
   levels of cancer stem cell markers and cancer stem cell like cells in
   NSCLC cell lines. Importantly, stress reduction inhibited NSCLC growth
   in vivo by increasing systemic levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter
   -aminobutyric acid and opioid peptides that inhibited the cAMP-driven
   activation of cancer stem cells underscoring the important influence of
   stress management on cancer development.}},

Abstract = {{Based on a CNC machine tool and a high-energy electropulse generator, a
   self-built experiment platform was employed to conduct
   electropulse-assisted incremental forming (EAIF) of AZ31B alloy. The
   experimental results show that the electroplastic effect increases with
   the increase of the root mean square (RMS) current density of
   electropulse, and the forming limit angle in EAIF have been up to 72
   degrees from the previous 39.6 degrees without electropulse. The tests
   prove that the peak current density plays a leading role in determining
   the materials formability when the RMS current density remains to be
   approximate. In addition, the microstructure transformations of the
   formed specimens were studied by means of optical microscopy and
   scanning electron microscopy. It is found that the electropulse can
   reduce the AZ31B dynamic recrystallization (DRX) temperature and
   accelerate the DRX progress, and it can also restrain the crack growth
   of the tested materials which in turn improves its formability. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Oxygen accumulation at buried implantation-damage layers was studied
   after post-implantation annealing of hydrogen- or deuterium-implanted
   4H-SiC. In this study H+ or H-2(+) implantation was carried out at
   energies E, from 200 keV to 1 MeV, to fluences D, ranging from 2 x
   10(16)/cm(2) to 1 x 10(17)/cm(2). For comparison, the implantation was
   also done into float-zone (FZ) and Czochralski (CZ) silicon wafers.
   Post-implantation annealing at temperatures from 400 degrees C to 1150
   degrees C was performed either in pure argon or in a water vapor.
   Characterization methods included SIMS, RBS and TEM. At sufficiently
   high doses, hydrogen implantation into semiconductors leads to the
   irreversible formation of a planar zone of microcavities, bubbles and
   other extended defects located at the maximum of deposited energy. This
   kind of highly perturbed layer, containing large amounts of agglomerated
   hydrogen is known to efficiently getter a number of impurities. Oxygen
   was detected in both CZ and FZ silicon subjected to Smart-Cut (TM)
   processing. We have identified, by SIMS profiling, a considerable oxygen
   peak situated at the interface between the SiC substrate and a layer
   implanted with 1 x 10(17) H ions/cm(2) and heated to 1150 degrees C in
   either H2O vapor or in a nominally pure Ar. In view of a lack of
   convincing evidence that a hexagonal SiC might contain substantial
   amounts of oxygen, the objective of the present study was to identify
   the source and possible transport mechanism of oxygen species to the
   cavity band. Through the analysis of several implants annealed at
   various conditions, we conclude that, besides diffusion from the bulk or
   from surface oxides, an alternative path for oxygen agglomeration is
   migration of gaseous O-2 or H2O from the edge of the sample through the
   porous layer. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two different microstructures of Ni-Ti-Fe shape memory alloys processed
   through different thermo-mechanical treatments with nearly similar grain
   size and in-grain misorientation but different crystallographic textures
   were subjected to series of thermal cycles without external loading. The
   microstructures and the phase transformation behavior of the samples
   were examined after every seventy cycles. The experiment involved
   treating the samples with liquid nitrogen (LN2) for complete martensitic
   (B19') transformation and then heating it back to parent austenite (B2)
   condition. Thermal cycling introduced significant differences in
   microstructural parameters especially the grain boundary nature, stored
   elastic energy and the misorientation or defect densities. These
   microstructural alterations during thermal cycling were related to
   changes in transformation temperatures and enthalpy. Thermal cycling
   also brought out changes in crystallographic orientations of austenite
   grains. The present study aims to address the role of microstructure on
   the thermal fatigue behavior in Ni-Ti based shape memory alloys during
   cyclic transformations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{SiGe based thermoelectric (TE) materials have been employed for the past
   four decades for power generation in radio-isotope thermoelectric
   generators (RTG). Recently ``nanostructuring{''} has resulted in
   significantly increasing the figure-of-merit (ZT) of both n and p-type
   of SiGe and thus nanostructured Si80Ge20 alloys are evolving as a
   potential replacement for their conventional bulk counterparts in
   designing efficient RTGs. However, apart from Zr, their mechanical
   properties are equally important for the long term reliability of their
   TE modules. Thus, we report the mechanical properties of p-type
   nanostructured Si80Ge20 alloys, which were synthesized employing spark
   plasma sintering of mechanically alloyed nanopowders of its constituent
   elements with 12\% boron doping. Nanostructured p-type Si80Ge20 alloys
   exhibited a hardness of similar to 9 +/- 0.1 GPa, an elastic modulus of
   similar to 135 +/- 1.9 GPa, a compressive strength of 108 +/- 02 MPa,
   and fracture toughness of similar to 1.66 +/- 0.04 MPalm with a thermal
   shock resistance value of 391 +/- 21 Wm(-1). This combination of good
   mechanical properties coupled with higher reported Zr of nanostructured
   p-type Si80Ge20 alloys are rendered to be a potential material for power
   generation applications, compared to its bulk counterpart. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Modular steel-plate composite (SC) safety-related nuclear power plant
   structures must be designed to resist accident thermal and mechanical
   loads. The design accident thermal load represents the condition where
   high pressure and temperature steam is released as result of a
   mechanical failure and applied against the surfaces of power plant
   structural walls. The effect of heating and pressure can have both short
   and long term effects on the mechanical integrity of SC structures
   including degradation and cracking of concrete infill, residual
   stresses, and out-of-plane deformations. The purpose of this research is
   to study the effects of thermal and mechanical loads on the out-of-plane
   flexural response of SC walls and to develop simplified equations that
   can be used to predict behavior. Four experimental beam tests are
   reported that represent full-scale cross-sections of SC walls subjected
   to combinations of mechanical and thermal loads. The study determined
   that thermal loads reduce the out-of-plane flexural stiffness of SC
   walls. For the ambient condition, the flexural stiffness closely matches
   a conventional elastic cracked-transformed model, and at elevated
   temperatures, the stiffness is reduced to a fully-cracked flexural
   stiffness that only takes into account the stiffness of the steel
   faceplates. A method is presented for estimating the thermal curvature,
   phi th, and thermal moment, Mth, resulting from unequal heating of
   opposing faces of an SC wall. Based on the tests in this study, the
   application of accident thermal loads did not result in a reduction of
   the flexural strength of the SC section. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to investigate the roles of
   alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtypes in the last-day pregnant rat uterus in
   vitro by the administration of subtype-specific antagonists (the
   alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor antagonist WB 4101 and the alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor
   antagonist BMY 7378) after 17 beta-estradiol or progesterone
   pretreatment.
   In isolated organ bath studies, contractions were elicited with
   (-)-noradrenaline (10(-5)-10(-5) M) in the presence of propranolol
   (10(-5) M) and yohimbine (10(-6) M) in order to avoid beta-, and
   alpha(2)-adrenergic action. The myometrial expressions of the
   oci-adrenoceptor subtypes were determined by means of the real time
   reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western
   blotting techniques. The activated G protein levels were investigated
   through radiolabelled GTP binding assays.
   Both 17 beta-estradiol and progesterone pretreatment changed the
   myometrial contracting effect of (-)-noradrenaline. In the presence of
   WB 4101, progesterone pretreatment decreased the
   (-)-noradrenaline-induced myometrial contraction. In the presence of BMY
   7378, both the 17 beta-estradiol and the progesterone pretreatment
   reduced the effect of (-)-noradrenaline. The mRNA and protein
   expressions of the alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors were decreased after 17
   beta-estradiol pretreatment. (-)-Noradrenaline increased the {[}S-35]GTP
   gamma S binding of the alpha(1)-adrenoceptors, which was most markedly
   elevated by progesterone. Pertussis toxin inhibited the {[}S-55]GTP
   gamma S binding-stimulating effect of (-)-noradrenaline, indicating the
   role of G(i) proteins in the signal mechanisms.
   17 beta-estradiol pretreatment blocks the expression of the
   alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors, whereas it does not influence the expression of
   the alpha(1p)-adrenoceptors. Progesterone pretreatment does not have any
   effect on the myometrial mRNA and protein expressions of the
   alpha(1)-adrenoceptors, but it alters the G protein coupling of these
   receptors, promoting a G(i)-dependent pathway. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Solubility and fluid-melt partitioning of H2O and Cl in andesitic magmas

Abstract = {{This study presents experimental data on the partitioning of Cl between
   andesitic melt and H2O- and Cl-bearing fluids at 1200 degrees C and at
   50 to 500 MPa. The results demonstrate that at isothermal conditions Cl
   partitioning is governed by pressure, Cl and H2O content in the system
   affecting mixing properties of the fluid phase. The maximum Cl contents
   in the melt reach similar to 2.5 wt.\% Cl at P < 200 MPa and about 3-3.5
   wt.\% Cl at P > 300 MPa in a good agreement with recent model (Webster
   et al., 2015. Experimental and modeled chlorine solubilities in
   aluminosilicatemelts at 1 to 7000 bars and 700 to 1250 degrees C:
   Applications to magmas of Augustine Volcano, Alaska. Am. Mineralogist,
   100:522-535). Water solubility in the melt increases from 1.4 to 10
   wt.\% with pressure increase from 50 to 500 MPa and can be described by
   a power law: H2O (wt\%) = 0.0659 . P-0.8184 (R-2 = 0.98). Moreover,
   there is a positive correlation between water and Cl contents of the
   melt at P < 200 MPa with an increase of maximum water concentration by a
   factor of 2 at 50 MPa in the range 0 to similar to 2 wt.\% Cl. Both
   increasing pressure and increasing Cl content in the system enhance
   partial dissolution of the melt into the fluid (mainly by extraction of
   Ca, Na and K) resulting in large uncertainty of fluid composition
   determination. However, based on well-defined systematic trends and
   observed general relationships between Cl + cation + H2O contents in the
   melt and fluid phases, the systems at P < 200 MPa can be characterized
   by the occurrence of fluid immiscibility (vapor + brine), whereas at P <
   300 MPa a single supercritical fluid is considered. Surprisingly, vapor
   phase at P < 200MPa can contain up to 35-40 wt.\% Cl+ Sigma/cations
   indicating that the immiscibility gap in andesitic system is
   dramatically reduced when compared with that of simple water-salt fluids
   or silicic melt + fluid systems. Despite observed differences in fluid
   characteristics at low and high P, fluid-melt partition coefficients of
   Cl (D-Cl) show similar non-linear evolution as a function of Cl content
   in the melt up to 2 wt.\% and vary between similar to 1 and similar to
   12 (on mass basis). Furthermore, systems with Cl content in the melt <1
   wt.\% follow Henrian behavior and considering only reproducibility
   errors for this range, their averaged D-Cl values demonstrate a
   pronounced minimum at around 2 at 200 MPa. A negative pressure
   dependence of DCl between 50 and 200 MPa can be described by a power law
   D-Cl = 279.92 P-0.914 (R-2 = 0.95), whereas a positive correlation with
   P between 200 and 500 MPa can be fitted by an exponential function: D-Cl
   = 1.0444 . e(0.004) (. P) (R-2 = 0.97). The observed change in the D-Cl
   trend is presumably attributed to the changes in Cl speciation in the
   fluid, i.e., from acidic HCl-dominated fluids at low P to basic
   cation-dominated fluids at high P which might be also responsible for
   the significant decrease in the fluid immiscibility gap at P < 200 MPa.
   The compilation of experimental data on Cl partitioning illustrates that
   silicic peralkaline magmas typically have up to an order of magnitude
   higher D-Cl at P > 200 MPa but may have comparable D-Cl at P < 200 MPa
   than the D-Cl of more mafic and metaluminous magmas. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The conditions which lead to caldera collapse are still poorly
   constrained. As there have only been four, possibly five,
   well-documented caldera forming events in the past century, the geodetic
   signals produced during chamber roof subsidence, or chamber volume
   reduction (shrinkage) in general, are not well documented or understood.
   In particular, when two or more geodetic sources are operating and
   providing signals at the same time, it is important to be able to
   estimate the likely contribution of each. Simultaneous activities of
   different geodetic sources are common and include pressure changes in
   magma chambers/reservoirs occurring at the same time as dyke
   emplacement. Here we present results from numerical models designed to
   simulate the subsidence of a magma-chamber roof, either directly
   (chamber shrinkage) or through ring-fault displacement, and the induced
   surface deformation and crustal stresses. We consider chamber depths at
   3 km, 5 km, and 7 kin below the crustal surface, using both non-layered
   (isotropic) and layered (anisotropic) crustal models. We also model the
   effects of a caldera lake and of a thick ice cover (ice sheet) on top of
   the caldera. The results suggest that magma-chamber roof subsidences
   between 20 m and 100 m generate large (tens of centimetres) vertical
   and, in particular, horizontal displacements at the surfaces of the ice
   and the crust out to distances of up to tens of kilometres from the
   caldera/chamber centre. Crustal layering tends to reduce, but increasing
   chamber depth to enlarge, the horizontal and vertical surface
   displacements. Applying the results to the ice subsidence in the
   Bardarbunga Caldera during the 2014-2015 Bardarbunga-Holuhraun
   volcanotectonic episode indicates that the modelled ice displacements
   are less than those geodetically measured. Also, the geodetically
   measured crustal displacements are less than expected for a 60 m
   chamber-roof subsidence. The modelling results thus suggest that only
   part of the ice subsidence is due to chamber-roof subsidence, the other
   part being related to flow in and down-bending of the ice. We show that
   such a flow is likely within the caldera as a result of the stress
   induced by the 45-km-long regional dyke emplaced (primarily in vertical
   magma flow) during the episode. This conclusion is further supported by
   the model results suggesting that the ring-fault (piston-like)
   displacements must have been much less than the total 60 mice
   subsidence, or else faults with tens-of-metres displacements would have
   cut through the ice (these are not observed). We suggest that the
   ring-fault subsidence was triggered by small doming of the volcanic
   field and system hosting the Bardarbunga Caldera and that this doming
   occurred as a result of magma inflow and pressure increase in a
   deep-seated reservoir. The doming is confirmed by GPS measurements and
   supported by the seismicity results. The magmatic pressure increase in
   the reservoir was, in terms of the present model, responsible for the
   regional dyke emplacement, the Holuhraun eruption, and part of the
   stress concentration around, and displacement of, the Bardarbunga
   Caldera. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the relationship between monogenetic and polygenetic
   volcanism has been a long-standing goal in volcanology, especially in
   cases where these two styles of volcanism are coeval and geographically
   adjacent. We studied the Carran-Los Venados (CLV) volcanic field and
   made comparisons with published data on CLV's polygenetic neighbor
   Puyehue-Cordon Caulle (PCC) in the Southern Andean arc, using
   quantitative tools and recent numerical simulations of magma reservoir
   formation. CLV is a basaltic to basaltic andesitic volcanic field
   composed of 65 post-glacial scoria cones and maars and a 1-km-high
   Pleistocene stratovolcano, whereas PCC is a basaltic to rhyolitic
   composite volcano. Our results point to three main differences between
   CLV and PCC: (1) the CLV magmas differentiate at low-crustal reservoirs,
   followed by rapid ascent to the surface, while the PCC magmas stagnate
   and differentiate in lower- and upper-crustal reservoirs; (2) CLV is
   elongated in the NE direction while FCC is elongated in the NW
   direction. Under the current stress field (N60 degrees sigma(Hmax)),
   these two volcanic alignments correspond, respectively, to local
   extensional and compressive deformation zones within the arc; and (3),
   the post-glacial CLV magma flux was estimated to be 3.1 +/- 1.0
   km(3)/ky, which is similar to the average magma flux estimated for KC;
   however, the FCC magma flux is estimated at approximately twice this
   value during peak eruptive periods (5.5 +/- 1.1 km(3)/ky). Based on
   numerical simulations, CLV is in a limit situation to create and sustain
   a mush-type upper-crustal reservoir containing highly crystalline magma,
   which is however not eruptible. The FCC volcanic system would have been
   able to create a stable reservoir containing eruptible silicic magma
   during periods of peak magma flux. We postulate that monogenetic
   volcanism occurs at CLV due to both low magma flux and an
   extensional/transtensional regime that favors rapid magma rise without
   storage and differentiation in stable upper-crustal reservoirs. However,
   the CLV system seems to be at an inflection point, and could become
   polygenetic if magma flux increases. For PCC, high magma flux during
   some periods together with compressive deformation would have led to the
   construction of one or several stable upper-crustal magma reservoirs,
   with subsequent silicic volcanism and construction of central conduits
   for magma extrusion, resulting in polygenetic volcanism with evolved
   compositions. In this model, monogenetic volcanic systems can become
   polygenetic despite extensional regime if magma flux increases
   sufficiently to create and sustain a stable upper-crustal magma
   reservoir. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Bodily distress syndrome: A new diagnosis for functional disorders in
   primary care?}},
Journal = {{BMC FAMILY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Conceptualisation and classification of functional disorders
   appear highly inconsistent in the health-care system, particularly in
   primary care. Numerous terms and overlapping diagnostic criteria are
   prevalent of which many are considered stigmatising by general
   practitioners and patients. The lack of a clear concept challenges the
   general practitioner's decision-making when a diagnosis or a treatment
   approach must be selected for a patient with a functional disorder. This
   calls for improvements of the diagnostic categories. Intense debate has
   risen in connection with the release of the fifth version of the
   `Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders' and the current
   revision of the `International Statistical Classification of Diseases
   and Related Health Problems'. We aim to discuss a new evidence based
   diagnostic proposal, bodily distress syndrome, which holds the potential
   to change our current approach to functional disorders in primary care.
   A special focus will be directed towards the validity and utility
   criteria recommended for diagnostic categorisation.
   Discussion: A growing body of evidence suggests that the numerous
   diagnoses for functional disorders listed in the current classifications
   belong to one family of closely related disorders. We name the
   underlying phenomenon `bodily distress'; it manifests as patterns of
   multiple and disturbing bodily sensations. Bodily distress syndrome is a
   diagnostic category with specific criteria covering this illness
   phenomenon. The category has been explored through empirical studies,
   which in combination provide a sound basis for determining a symptom
   profile, the diagnostic stability and the boundaries of the condition.
   However, as bodily distress syndrome embraces only the most common
   symptom patterns, patients with few but impairing symptoms are not
   captured. Furthermore, the current lack of treatment options may also
   influence the acceptance of the proposed diagnosis.
   Summary: Bodily distress syndrome is a diagnostic category with notable
   validity according to empirical studies. Nevertheless, knowledge is
   sparse on the utility in primary care. Future intervention studies
   should investigate the translation of bodily distress syndrome into
   clinical practice. A particular focus should be directed towards the
   acceptability among general practitioners and patients. Most
   importantly, it should be investigated whether the new category may
   provide the basis for better treatment and improved clinical outcome.}},

Abstract = {{The magnetic characteristics of chromium and iron containing

   spontaneous and magnetic field induced magnetostructural First order
   transitions at room temperature. These transitions might be accompanied
   by a large magnetocaloric effect. In general, Mn0.89Cr0.11NiGe can be
   classified as promising material for use in the magnetocaloric

   phase transition from the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic state is not

   the FM state in quenched-onwheel MnNi0.90Fe0.10Ge is preserved to the
   lowest temperatures. Based on the set of the magnetic properties, it has
   been concluded that the iron containing MnNiGe-based alloys are less

Title = {{Pesticide runoff from energy crops: A threat to aquatic invertebrates?}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{537}},
Pages = {{187-196}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The European Union aims to reach a 10\% share of biofuels in the
   transport sector by 2020. The major burden is most likely to fall on
   already established annual energy crops such as rapeseed and cereals for
   the production of biodiesel and bioethanol, respectively. Annual energy
   crops are typically cultivated in intensive agricultural production
   systems, which require the application of pesticides. Agricultural
   pesticides can have adverse effects on aquatic invertebrates in adjacent
   streams. We assessed the relative ecological risk to aquatic
   invertebrates associated with the chemical pest management from six
   energy crops (maize, potato, sugar beet, winter barley, winter rapeseed,
   and winter wheat) as well as from mixed cultivation scenarios.
   The pesticide exposure related to energy crops and cultivation scenarios
   was estimated as surface runoff for 253 small stream sites in Central
   Germany using a GIS-based runoff potential model. The ecological risk
   for aquatic invertebrates, an important organism group for the
   functioning of stream ecosystems, was assessed using acute toxicity data
   (48-h LC50 values) of the crustacean Daphnia magna. We calculated the
   Ecological Risk from potential Pesticide Runoff (ERPR) for all three
   main groups of pesticides (herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides).
   Our findings suggest that the crops potato, sugar beet, and rapeseed
   pose a higher ecological risk to aquatic invertebrates than maize,
   barley, and wheat. As maize had by far the lowest ERPR values, from the
   perspective of pesticide pollution, its cultivation as substrate for the
   production of the gaseous biofuel biomethane may be preferable compared
   to the production of, for example, biodiesel from rapeseed. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A framework for the reliability evaluation of grid-connected PV
   (photovoltaic) systems with intermittent faults is proposed using DBNs
   (dynamic Bayesian networks). A three-state Markov model is constructed
   to represent the state transition relationship of no faults,
   intermittent faults, and permanent faults for PV components. The model
   is subsequently fused into the DBNs. The reliability and availability of
   three simple PV systems with centralized, string, and multistring
   configurations, as well as a complex PV system, are analyzed through the
   proposed framework. The sequence of the degree of importance of PV
   components is investigated using mutual information. The effects of
   intermittent fault parameters, including the coefficients of
   intermittent fault, permanent fault, and intermittent repair, on the
   reliability and availability are explored. Results show that the
   reliability and availability of the PV system with centralized
   configuration rapidly decrease, compared with those of the PV systems
   with string and multistring configurations. The sequence of the degree
   of importance of PV components is DC/AC inverter, DC/DC converter, DC
   combiner, and PV module arranged from the largest to the smallest. The
   finding indicates that the DC/AC inverter should be given considerable
   attention to improve the reliability and availability and to prevent
   their possible failures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Benzotriazoles (BZTs) are used in a broad range of commercial and

   ultraviolet (UV) light stabilizer additives in plastics and polymers. In
   this study, dated sediment cores from two east coast estuaries were
   analyzed for commonly used BZTs. In Narragansett Bay, UV stabilizing
   BZTs (UV-BZTs) were present at high levels from 1961 on, reflecting
   their patent date, local production and long-term preservation in
   sediment In Salem Sound, UV-BZTs were present at concentrations
   consistent with other coastal marine locations not influenced by BZT
   production. Anticorrosive BZTs (AC-BZTs) were found in both cores, with
   the highest levels reported to date present in Narragansett Bay,
   indicating sorption to, and preservation in, sediments. This study
   revealed that both classes of BZTs have remained structurally intact
   over time in coastal sediment cores, demonstrating their resistance to
   degradation and persistence in environmental compartments. Published by

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{25}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The Ne-22(p,gamma)Na-23 reaction takes part in the neon-sodium cycle of
   hydrogen burning. This cycle affects the synthesis of the elements
   between Ne-20 and Al-27 in asymptotic giant branch stars and novae. The
   Ne-22(p,gamma)Na-23 reaction rate is very uncertain because of a large
   number of unobserved resonances lying in the Gamow window. At proton
   energies below 400 keV, only upper limits exist in the literature for
   the resonance strengths. Previous reaction rate evaluations differ by
   large factors. In the present work, the first direct observations of the
   Ne-22(p,gamma)Na-23 resonances at 156.2, 189.5, and 259.7 keV are
   reported. Their resonance strengths are derived with 2\%-7\%
   uncertainty. In addition, upper limits for three other resonances are
   greatly reduced. Data are taken using a windowless Ne-22 gas target and
   high-purity germanium detectors at the Laboratory for Underground
   Nuclear Astrophysics in the Gran Sasso laboratory of the National
   Institute for Nuclear Physics, Italy, taking advantage of the ultralow
   background observed deep underground. The new reaction rate is a factor
   of 20 higher than the recent evaluation at a temperature of 0.1 GK,
   relevant to nucleosynthesis in asymptotic giant branch stars.}},

Title = {{Risk analysis of housing energy efficiency interventions under model

Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{109}},

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Mathematical models can be used to evaluate the health impacts of
   housing energy efficiency interventions. However by their nature, models
   are subject to uncertainty and variability, which are important to
   quantify if used to support policy decisions. Models that are used to
   assess the impacts on health of housing energy efficiency interventions
   are likely to be based on a pair of linked component models: a building
   physics model which calculates changes in exposures and whose Outputs
   then feed into a health impact model. Current methods to propagate
   uncertainty in a series of models, where the outputs of one model are
   inputs to another, invariably use Monte Carlo (MC) numerical simulation.
   In this paper, two methods are used to quantify the uncertainty in the
   impact of draught proofing on childhood asthma: the MC simulation method
   and a semi-analytical method based on integral transforms. Both methods
   give close results but it is argued that the semi-analytical method has

Abstract = {{In this study, the cell free modified tryptone soya broth (pH 7.4 +/-
   0.2) of Bacillus subtilis URID 12.1 showed significant antimicrobial
   activity against multidrug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus,
   S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis. The
   partially purified antimicrobial molecule was found to be resistant to
   extremes of pH and temperatures and also to higher concentrations of
   trypsin and proteinase K. The antimicrobial molecule was purified by a
   three-step method that included reversed-phase high performance liquid
   chromatography (RP-HPLC). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
   values were determined for 14 species of bacteria using a microbroth
   dilution technique. The HPLC-purified fraction showed the MICs ranging
   from 0.5 to 16 mu g/ml for methicillin and vancomycin-resistant
   Staphylococcus aureus (MVRSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
   epidermidis (MRSE) strains. The molecular mass of the antimicrobial
   compound was determined to be 842.37 Da. The same antimicrobial fraction
   showed negligible haemolytic activity against human red blood cells even
   at a concentration as high as 100 mu g/ml. Because of its significant
   antimicrobial activity at low MIC values coupled with its non haemolytic
   property, it may prove to be a novel antimicrobial lead molecule.}},

Abstract = {{Calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand (CAML) is an endoplasmic reticulum
   resident protein that is widely expressed. Although it has been
   demonstrated to participate in the tail-anchored protein insertion
   pathway, its physiological role in the mature immune system is unknown.
   In this work, we show that mature, peripheral T cells require CAML for
   survival specifically following TCR-induced activation. In this study,
   we examined mature T cells from spleen and lymph nodes of
   tamoxifen-inducible CAML knockout mice (tCAML(-/-)). Whereas
   CAML-deficient T cells were able to express the early activation markers
   CD25 and CD69, and produce IL-2 normally upon stimulation, deficient
   cells proliferated less and died. Cells did not require CAML for entry
   into the S phase of the cell cycle, thus implicating its survival
   function at a relatively late step in the T cell activation sequence. In
   addition, CAML was required for homeostatic proliferation and for
   Ag-dependent cell killing in vivo. These results demonstrate that CAML
   critically supports T cell survival and cell division downstream of T
   cell activation.}},

Abstract = {{The nanocrystalline Ni3Fe (around Permalloy composition) powders were
   prepared by dry mechanical alloying. The nanocrystalline (NiFe)-Fe-3 and
   carbonyl Fe mixture powders and green compacts have been subjected to
   heat treatments in an argon atmosphere in order to obtain
   pseudo-core-shell like particles by micro-alloying in the temperature
   range of 400-900 degrees C. The large Permalloy particles are partially
   covered by very small Fe particles and at the interface a layer of
   Rhometal is formed by micro-alloying. The Permalloy particles remain in
   the nanocrystalline/nanostructured state after the annealing independent
   on the annealing temperature up to 900 degrees C. Structural,
   microstructural characterisation and local elemental chemical analysis
   have been performed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy
   and X-ray microanalysis. The Rhometal interface was studied and
   evidenced by Fe and Ni concentration profile (EDX microanalysis) and
   X-ray diffraction. It was found that by a heat treatment up to 900
   degrees C the interface is in the iron zone and at the heat treatment
   temperature of 900 degrees C the interface is in both Permalloy and iron
   zones. By XRD the bcc and fcc structures of the Rhometal have been
   evidenced. The interface length in iron zones is about 0.8 mu m for the
   heat treatment at 400 degrees C and reaches 2.5 mu m for heat treatment
   at 900 degrees C. The interface reaches 10 mu m for a temperature of a
   heat treatment of 900 degrees C. The iron zones welded by Permalloy
   zones is evidenced the presence of the Ni atoms up to 4.7 at\%. Also, in
   Permalloy particles are evidenced two zones with a different amount of
   Ni: one around Ni0.6Fe0.4 composition close to the interface and the
   second in the centre of the Permalloy particle with composition close to
   Ni3Fe - Ni-3-iFe(3+delta). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, composite journal bearings were fabricated using a
   carbon-fiber/phenol composite and carbon-fiber/epoxy composite to solve
   the seizure problem of a metallic journal bearing under the oil cut
   situation. Friction coefficients of two composite materials were
   measured through the wear test under the same conditions as the oil cut
   situation, and the material properties were measured at the elevated
   temperature of the oil cut situation. Next, the stress distribution of
   the composite journal bearings was investigated by using finite element
   analysis (FEA) with respect to the friction coefficients between the
   rotor and bearing, and the Tsai-Wu failure index was calculated to
   investigate the possibility of failure. To verify the failure analysis
   results, the oil cut tests for the composite journal bearings were
   conducted using the industrial test bench. The oil cut test results
   indicate that the carbon fiber/epoxy composite journal bearing is more
   durable than the carbon fiber/phenol composite journal bearing. (C) 2015

   Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety (KINS) as a participant of the
   IRIS-2010 and 2012 benchmark projects, which have been organized by
   OECD/NEA IAGE working group. Within the scope of the IRIS-2012 project,
   uniaxial and tri-axial concrete tests were performed and the results
   were supplied. With these material test data, impact simulations of
   IRIS-2010 experiments (Punching P1 and Bending B1) were re-performed to
   improve the accuracy of the simulation results and to reduce the
   computation time.
   Numerical impact simulations were performed using an explicit dynamic
   code, LS-DYNA, and the initial FE model was updated through numerous
   parametric studies. Considering the symmetry of the structure, an
   updated model was constructed for 1/4 of the structure, and the
   stiffness and mass of the supporting structure was considered. Loading
   function with a fictitious loading plate was applied instead of modeling
   projectiles to reduce the computation time. Three concrete models,
   Concrete damage rel. 3 ({*}MAT\_072R3), Winfrith concrete
   ({*}MAT\_084-085), and CSCM concrete ({*}MATA\_159), were used for the
   impact simulations and the results were compared. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Successful conservation of pollination services depends upon an
   understanding of the processes that influence pollinator diversity
   within the landscape, as well as the relationship between pollinator
   community composition and the provision of services. In this study, the
   influence of landscape simplification on the composition of pollinator
   communities and the provisioning of pollination services to cultivated
   strawberry was evaluated (Fragaria x ananassa). Additionally the
   relative pollination efficiency for the five most common bee genera
   visiting strawberry flowers was measured. Pollinators were collected
   during bloom with pan traps on 14 commercial farms all growing the same
   strawberry variety in the Finger Lakes Region, NY, USA. The farms were
   chosen to represent a gradient in the proportion of agricultural land
   uses in the surrounding landscape from 0.09 to 0.60. Landscapes with
   greater proportions of agricultural area had lower pollinator abundances
   and species richness. While yield was positively correlated with
   pollinator abundance, species richness had little effect on the level of
   pollination services. This conclusion was supported by the finding that
   visitor identity did not explain pollination efficiency in strawberry.
   Our results show that a high proportion of agricultural land in the
   landscape negatively impacts wild pollinators and pollination services
   to strawberry. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective:To improve current understanding of the mechanisms behind
   thalamic amnesia, as it is unclear whether it is directly related to
   damage to specific nuclei, in particular to the anterior or mediodorsal
   nuclei, or indirectly related to lesions of the mammillothalamic tract
   (MTT).Methods:We recruited 12 patients with a left thalamic infarction
   and 25 healthy matched controls. All underwent a comprehensive
   neuropsychological assessment of verbal and visual memory, executive
   functions, language, and affect, and a high-resolution structural
   volumetric MRI scan. Thalamic lesions were manually segmented and
   automatically localized with a computerized thalamic atlas. As well as
   comparing patients with controls, we divided patients into subgroups
   with intact or damaged MTT.Results:Only one patient had a small lesion
   of the anterior nucleus. Most of the lesions included the mediodorsal (n
   = 11) and intralaminar nuclei (n = 12). Patients performed worse than
   controls on the verbal memory tasks, but the 5 patients with intact MTT
   who showed isolated lesions of the mediodorsal nucleus (MD) only
   displayed moderate memory impairment. The 7 patients with a damaged MTT
   performed worse on the verbal memory tasks than those whose MTT was
   intact.Conclusions:Lesions in the MTT and in the MD result in memory
   impairment, severely in the case of MTT and to a lesser extent in the
   case of MD, thus highlighting the roles played by these 2 structures in
   memory circuits.}},

   the textiles, the tensile behaviour of the composites and the shear bond
   performance on different substrates, including historic and modern
   bricks and tuff units, were investigated. The role of the layout of the

Abstract = {{CVD diamond is irradiated by 5 MeV carbon ions, with each sample held at
   a different temperature (300-873 K) during irradiations. The defect
   structures resulting from the irradiations are evident as vacancy,
   interstitial and amorphous carbon signals in Raman spectra. The observed
   variation of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) and peak position of
   the diamond peak suggests that disorder in the diamond lattice is
   reduced for high temperature irradiations. The dumbbell interstitial
   signal is reduced for irradiations at 873 K, which suggests this defect
   is unstable at these temperatures and that interstitials have migrated
   to crystal surfaces. Near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS)
   spectroscopy results indicate that damage to the diamond structure at
   the surface has occurred for room temperature irradiations, however,
   this structure is at least partially recovered for irradiations
   performed at 473 K and above. The results suggest that, in a high
   temperature irradiation environment such as a nuclear fusion device, in
   situ annealing of radiation-created defects can maintain the diamond
   structure and prolong the lifetime of diamond components. Crown

Abstract = {{Chronic exposure to arsenic in drinking water causes cancer and
   non-cancer diseases. However, mechanisms for chronic arsenic-induced
   pathogenesis, especially in response to lower exposure levels, are
   unclear. In addition, the importance of health impacts from
   xeniobiotic-promoted microbiome changes is just being realized and
   effects of arsenic on the microbiome with relation to disease promotion
   are unknown. To investigate impact of arsenic exposure on both
   microbiome and host metabolism, the stucture and composition of colonic
   microbiota, their metabolic phenotype, and host tissue and plasma
   metabolite levels were compared in mice exposed for 2, 5, or 10 weeks to
   0, 10 (low) or 250 (high) ppb arsenite (As(III)). Genotyping of colonic
   bacteria revealed time and arsenic concentration dependent shifts in
   community composition, particularly the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes,
   relative to those seen in the time-matched controls. Arsenic-induced
   erosion of bacterial biofilms adjacent to the mucosal lining and changes
   in the diversity and abundance of morphologically distinct species
   indicated changes in microbial community structure. Bacterical spores
   increased in abundance and intracellular inclusions decreased with high
   dose arsenic. Interestingly, expression of arsenate reductase (arsA) and
   the As(III) exporter arsB, remained unchanged, while the dissimilatory
   nitrite reductase (nrfA) gene expression increased. In keeping with the
   change in nitrogen metabolism, colonic and liver nitrite and nitrate
   levels and ratios changed with time. In addition, there was a
   concomitant increase in pathogenic arginine metabolites in the mouse
   circulation. These data suggest that arsenic exposure impacts the
   microbiome and microbiome/host nitrogen metabolism to support disease
   enhancing pathogenic phenotypes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Due to the unprecedented permeation properties of the recently developed
   thermally rearranged (TR) polymers, previous models developed for
   conventional less permeable membranes are no longer suitable to predict

   more accurate simulation for TR membrane. The model demonstrates the
   feasibility of using industrial size thermally-rearranged
   polybenzoxazole (TR-PBO) hollow fiber membrane modules in various gas
   separation applications. The optimal operating conditions for each
   application in a single-stage configuration were identified, and flue
   gas carbon capture was used as an example to demonstrate the
   substantially higher process capacity which the TR-PBO hollow fiber
   membranes can offer over conventional polymeric membranes. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper presents two-dimensional simulations of an adiabatic

   (User Defined Scalars) interfaces for extra terms involving turbulence
   and thermoelectric quantities. The study includes the production of
   thermal NOx modeled by the extended Zeldovich mechanism with
   postprocessing computation. Flow and electric field computations were
   obtained considering as variables gas inlet velocity and composition,
   porous media thermal conductivity and inner wall insulation material.
   Flammability limits for stable combustion were found alongside with the
   electric potential generated within the system. Higher values of
   electrical potential, thermoelectric efficiency and flame temperatures
   were reached when the gas mixture energy content and heat recovery
   capacity of the system were increased. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The sorting of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to lysosomes is
   critical for proper signaling and cellular responses. We previously
   showed that the adaptor protein ALIX regulates lysosomal degradation of
   protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1), a GPCR for thrombin, independent
   of ubiquitin-binding ESCRTs and receptor ubiquitination. However, the
   mechanisms that regulate ALIX function during PAR1 lysosomal sorting are
   not known. Here we show that the mammalian a-arrestin arrestin
   domain-containing protein-3 (ARRDC3) regulates ALIX function in GPCR
   sorting via ubiquitination. ARRDC3 colocalizes with ALIX and is required
   for PAR1 sorting at late endosomes and degradation. Depletion of ARRDC3
   by small interfering RNA disrupts ALIX interaction with activated PAR1
   and the CHMP4B ESCRT-III subunit, suggesting that ARRDC3 regulates ALIX
   activity. We found that ARRDC3 is required for ALIX ubiquitination
   induced by activation of PAR1. A screen of nine mammalian NEDD4-family
   E3 ubiquitin ligases revealed a critical role for WWP2. WWP2 interacts
   with ARRDC3 and not ALIX. Depletion of WWP2 inhibited ALIX
   ubiquitination and blocked ALIX interaction with activated PAR1 and
   CHMP4B. These findings demonstrate a new role for the a-arrestin ARRDC3
   and the E3 ubiquitin ligase WWP2 in regulation of ALIX ubiquitination
   and lysosomal sorting of GPCRs.}},

Abstract = {{Serotonin 1A receptors (5-HT1ARs), which are widely distributed in the
   mammalian brain, participate in cognitive and emotional functions. In
   birds, 5-HT1ARs, are expressed in prosencephalic areas involved in
   visual and cognitive functions. Diverse evidence supports
   5-HT1AR-mediated 5-HT-induced ingestive and sleep behaviors in birds.
   Here, we describe the distribution of 5-HT1ARs in the hypothalamus and
   brainstem of birds, analyze their potential roles in sleep and ingestive
   behaviors, and attempt to determine the involvement of
   auto-lhetero-5-HT1ARs in these behaviors. In 6 pigeons, the anatomical
   distribution of {[}H-3]8-OH-DPAT binding in the rostral brainstem and
   hypothalamus was examined. Ingestive/sleep behaviors were recorded (1 h)
   in 16 pigeons pretreated with MM77 (a heterosynaptic 5-HT1AR antagonist;
   23 or 69 nmol) for 20 min, followed by intracerebroventricular ICV
   injection of 5-HT (N:8; 150 nmol), 8-OH-DPAT (DPAT, a 5-HT1A,7R agonist,
   30 nmol N:8) or vehicle. 5-HT- and DPAT-induced sleep and ingestive
   behaviors, brainstem 5-HT neuronal density and brain 5-HT content were
   examined in 12 pigeons, pretreated by ICV with the 5-HT neurotoxin
   5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) or vehicle (N:6/group). The
   distribution of brainstem and diencephalic c-Fos immunoreactivity after
   ICV injection of 5-HT, DPAT or vehicle (N:5/group) into birds provided
   with or denied access to water is also described. 5-HT1ARs, are
   concentrated in the brainstem 5-HTergic areas and throughout the
   periventricular hypothalamus, preoptic nuclei and circumventricular
   organs. 5-HT and DPAT produced a complex c-Fos expression pattern in the
   5-HT1AR-enriched preoptic hypothalamus and the circumventricular organs,
   which are related to drinking and sleep regulation, but modestly
   affected c-Fos expression-in 5-HTergic neurons. The 5-HT-induced
   ingestive behaviors and the 5-HT- and DPAT-induced sleep behaviors were
   reduced by MM77 pretreatment. 5,7-DHT increased sleep per se, decreased
   tryptophan hydroxylase expression in the raphe nuclei and decreased
   prosencephalic 5-HT release but failed to affect 5-HT- or DPAT-induced
   drinking or sleep behavior. 5-HT- and DPAT-induced ingestive and sleep
   behaviors in pigeons appear to be mediated by heterosynaptic and/or
   non-somatodendritic presynaptic 5-HT1ARs localized to periventricular
   diencephalic circuits. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to study the uniaxial-compressive crush
   performance of thin-walled structures filled with Advanced Pore
   Morphology (APM) foam elements, exploring their deformation and failure
   mechanisms. The APM-foam elements are integral-skin closed-cell foams of
   near spherical shape fabricated through the Powder-Compacting-Foaming
   method by heating precursor in a continuous belt furnace. Two
   lightweight structures using the APM-foam elements were assembled,
   tested and evaluated: (i) Al-alloy tube filled with non-bonded APM-foam
   elements and (ii) Al-alloy tube filled with polyamide-bonded APM-foam
   elements. Non-bonded APM-foam filled tubes were prepared by pouring the
   APM-foam elements into an empty Al-alloy tube (without any bonding).
   Polyamide-bonded APM foam filled tubes were prepared by pouring the

   performance of the APM foam filled tubes was compared to that of the

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{171}},

Abstract = {{Marine ammonia-oxidizing archaea of the phylum Thaumarchaeota are a
   cosmopolitan group of microorganisms representing a major fraction of
   the picoplankton in the ocean. The cytoplasmic membranes of
   Thaumarchaeota consist predominantly of intact polar isoprenoid glycerol
   dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) lipids, which may be used as
   biomarkers for living Thaumarchaeota. Fossil thaumarchaeal GDGT core
   lipids accumulate in marine sediments and serve as the basis for
   geochemical proxies such as the TEX86 paleothermometer. Here, we
   demonstrate that the responses of membrane lipid compositions and
   resulting TEX86 values to growth temperature strongly diverge in three
   closely related thaumarchaeal pure cultures, i.e., Nitrosopumilus
   maritimus and two novel strains isolated from South Atlantic surface
   water, although the inventories of intact polar lipids and core lipids
   were overall similar in the three strains. N. maritimus and its closely
   related strain NAOA6 showed linear relationships of TEX86 and growth
   temperature but no correlation of TEX86 and temperature was observed in
   the more distantly related strain NAOA2. In contrast, the weighted
   average number of cycloalkyl moieties (ring index) was linearly
   correlated with growth temperature in all strains. This disparate
   relationship of TEX86 to growth temperature among closely related
   Thaumarchaeota suggests that the ring index but not the TEX86 ratio
   represents a universal response to growth temperature in marine
   planktonic Thaumarchaeota. Furthermore, the distinct TEX86-temperature
   relationships in the cultivated strains indicate that environmental GDGT
   signals may include an ecological component, which has important
   implications for ocean temperature reconstructions using the TEX86
   proxy. In contrast, different growth medium salinities in the range
   27-51 parts per thousand tested for N. maritimus showed no systematic
   effect on intact polar GDGT composition and TEX86. Similarly, N.
   maritimus showed only small changes in intact polar GDGT composition and
   TEX86 when grown at different medium pH in the range 7.3-7.9. Overall,
   our pure culture studies suggest that the TEX86 paleotemperature proxy
   is not solely dependent on growth temperature, but may amalgamate
   physiological, environmental, and ecological factors. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Analysis of the solar event on 16 February 2011 (SOL2011-02-16T14:19)
   allows to classify it as an ``impulsive{''} coronal mass ejection (CME)
   event. It is argued that the observed deviation of a streamer ray from
   its pre-event state and generation of a metric type II radio burst in
   this event was a result of a ``CME-streamer{''} interaction in the lower
   corona (r less than or similar to 1.5 R-circle dot). Most probably, it
   was a consequence of an impulsive action of a compressed magnetic field
   to the streamer. This compression of the coronal magnetic field was due
   to a moving and expanding magnetic flux rope, which was a core of the
   CME. The estimated radial speed of the type II burst sources was
   significantly (approximate to 2-8 times) larger than the radial speed of
   the erupting flux rope, and it decreased rapidly with time. This
   indicates that during the ``CME streamer{''} interaction a blast shock
   wave could be excited and propagated along the streamer. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A novel type of ``dual-potential{''} electrochemiluminescence (ECL)
   aptasensor array was fabricated on a homemade screen-printed carbon
   electrode (SPCE) for simultaneous detection of malachite green (MG) and
   chloramphenicol (CAP) in one single assay. The SPCE substrate consisted
   of a common Ag/AgCl reference electrode, carbon counter electrode and
   two carbon working electrodes (WEI and WE2). In the system, CdS quantum
   dots (QDs) were modified on WE1 as cathode ECL emitters and luminol-gold
   nanoparticles (L-Au NPs) were modified on WE2 as anode ECL emitters.
   Then the MG aptamer complementary strand (MG cDNA) and CAP aptamer
   complementary strand (CAP cDNA) were attached on CdS QDs and L-Au NPs,
   respectively. The cDNA would hybridize with corresponding aptamer that
   was respectively tagged with cyanine dye (Cy5) (as quenchers of CdS QDs)
   and chlorogenic acid (CA) (as quenchers of L-Au NPs) using
   poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) as a bridging agent. PEI could lead to a large
   number of quenchers on the aptamer, which increased the quenching
   efficiency. Upon MG and CAP adding, the targets could induce strand
   release due to the highly affinity of analytes toward aptamers.
   Meanwhile, it could release the Cy5 and CA, which recovered cathode ECL
   of CdS QDs and anode ECL of L-Au NPs simultaneously. This
   ``dual-potential{''} ECL strategy could be used to detect MG and CAP
   with the linear ranges of 0.1-100 nM and 0.2-150 nM, with detection
   limits of 0.03 nM and 0.07 nM (at 3(SB)), respectively. More
   importantly, this designed method was successfully applied to determine
   MG and CAP in real fish samples and held great potential in the food
   analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the thermoeconomic multi-objective optimization and decision
   makings, considering both exergy efficiency and LEC (levelized energy
   cost), the performance comparison of low-grade ORCs (organic Rankine
   cycles) using R245fa, pentane and their mixtures has been investigated.
   The effects of mass fraction of R245fa and four key parameters on the
   exergy efficiency and LEC are examined. The Pareto-optimal solutions are
   selected from the Pareto optimal frontier obtained by NSGA-II algorithm
   using three decision makings, including Shannon Entropy, LINMAP and
   TOPSIS. The deviation index is introduced to evaluate different decision
   makings. Research demonstrates that as the mass fraction of R245fa
   increasing, the exergy efficiency decreases first and then increases,
   while LEC presents a reverse trend. The optimum values from TOPSIS
   decision making are selected as the preferred Pareto-optimal solution
   for its lowest deviation index. The Pareto-optimal solutions for
   pentane, R245fa, and 0.5pentane/0.5R245fa in pairs of (exergy
   efficiency, LEC) are (0.5425, 0.104), (0.5502, 0.111), and (0.5212,
   0.108), respectively. The mixture working fluids present lower
   thermodynamic performance and moderate economic performance than the
   pure working fluids under the Pareto optimization. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Improving OWC performance prediction using polychromatic waves}},
Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Pages = {{1943-1952}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The performance of wave energy converters using model scale testing has
   been assessed primarily using regular waves with limited testing in
   irregular waves. A viable alternative is the use of polychromatic waves,
   superposition of discrete regular waves with a definite period.
   Polychromatic waves allow well proven phase-averaging techniques to be
   applied to a wave which is more random and therefore representing a more
   realistic sea-state than regular waves. This paper presents results from
   model test experiments on a generic forward-facing bent-duct oscillating
   water column in polychromatic waves from a series of experiments using a
   wave probe array within the device and secondly with the addition of
   particle image velocimetry. By adapting phase averaging methodology the
   results showed that more reliable predictions of the device's operation
   are obtained when testing in polychromatic waves. Results from wave
   probe array showed that a longitudinal array is required to capture
   sloshing within the chamber. Velocity fields revealed a reduction in the
   proportion of kinetic energy within vortices in polychromatic waves
   compared with regular waves. This study highlights the importance of
   performing experiments in sea-states that are more realistic than simple
   regular waves to ensure an accurate representation of the device's
   performance and operation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Resonance Microscopy Studies on Living Tissue Explants}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Spectrometers now offer the field strengths necessary to visualize
   mammalian cells but were not designed to accommodate imaging of live
   tissues. As such, spectrometers pose significant challenges-the most
   evident of which are spatial limitations-to conducting experiments in
   living tissue. This limitation becomes problematic upon trying to employ
   commercial perfusion equipment which is bulky and-being designed almost
   exclusively for light microscopy or electrophysiology studies-seldom
   includes MR-compatibility as a design criterion. To overcome problems
   exclusive to ultra-high magnetic field environments with limited spatial
   access, we have designed microperfusion and in-bore oxygenation systems
   capable of interfacing with Bruker's series of micro surface-coils.
   These devices are designed for supporting cellular resolution imaging in
   MR studies of excised, living tissue. The combined system allows for
   precise control of both dissolved gas and pH levels in the perfusate
   thus demonstrating applicability for a wide range of tissue types. Its
   compactness, linear architecture, and MR-compatible material content are
   key design features intended to provide a versatile hardware interface
   compatible with any NMR spectrometer. Such attributes will ensure the
   microperfusion rig's continued utility as it may be used with a
   multitude of contemporary NMR systems in addition to those which are
   currently in development.}},

Abstract = {{Although it appears biologically plausible for iron to be associated
   with gastric carcinogenesis, the evidence is insufficient to lead to any
   conclusions. To further investigate the relationship between body iron
   status and gastric cancer risk, we conducted a nested case-control study
   in the multicentric European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and
   Nutrition (EPIC) study. The study included 456 primary incident gastric
   adenocarcinoma cases and 900 matched controls that occurred during an
   average of 11 years of follow-up. We measured prediagnostic serum iron,
   ferritin, transferrin and C-reactive protein, and further estimated
   total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) and transferrin saturation (TS). Odds
   ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of gastric
   cancer by iron metrics were estimated from multivariable conditional
   logistic regression models. After adjusting for relevant confounders, we
   observed a statistically significant inverse association between gastric
   cancer and ferritin and TS indices (ORlog2=0.80, 95\% CI=0.72-0.88;
   OR10\%increment=0.87, 95\% CI=0.78-0.97, respectively). These
   associations appear to be restricted to noncardia gastric cancer
   (ferritin showed a p for heterogeneity=0.04 and TS had a p for
   heterogeneity=0.02), and no differences were found by histological type.
   TIBC increased risk of overall gastric cancer (OR50 mu g/dl=1.13, 95\%
   CI=1.02-1.2) and also with noncardia gastric cancer (p for
   heterogeneity=0.04). Additional analysis suggests that time between
   blood draw and gastric cancer diagnosis could modify these findings. In
   conclusion, our results showed a decreased risk of gastric cancer
   related to higher body iron stores as measured by serum iron and
   ferritin. Further investigation is needed to clarify the role of iron in
   gastric carcinogenesis.
   What's new? Iron is highly reactive, iron levels in the body rise with
   inflammation, and the iron-overload disorder hemochromatosis is
   associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer. Thus, one might
   predict that high levels of iron will increase the risk of cancer.
   However, in this study from a large European population, the authors
   found that increased body iron stores actually decreased the risk of
   gastric cancer. These results suggest that further investigation is
   needed to clarify the role of iron in gastric carcinogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Paediatric opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (OMS) is in 50\% of the cases
   associated with a neuroblastoma as a paraneoplastic syndrome and is
   associated with surface-binding antibodies against cerebellar granular
   neurons (CGN). To evaluate possible pathogenic effects of these
   autoantibodies on CGN we examined their influence on the MAPKinase
   enzymes ERK-1/2 and p38 using flow cytometry and phospho-specific
   antibodies. OMS IgG but not IgG from neuroblastoma without OMS or
   healthy controls induced phosphorylation of ERK-1/2 in cerebellar
   granular neurons (p < 0.01). No effect on p38 phosphorylation or on
   HEK293 control cell line could be detected. IgG-mediated phosphorylation
   of ERK-1/2 was associated with an increased cytotoxicity of CGN, which
   could be blocked by ERK-1/2 pathway inhibitor U0126. We here show that
   IgG-mediated anti-neuronal cytotoxicity in OMS is mediated by ERK-1/2
   phosphorylation in CGN. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{We start the systematic study of Frechet spaces which are N-spaces in
   the weak topology. A topological space X is an N-0-space or an N-space
   if X has a countable k-network or a sigma-locally finite k-network,
   respectively. We are motivated by the following result of Corson (1966):
   If the space C-c(X) of continuous real-valued functions on a Tychonoff
   space X endowed with the compact-open topology is a Banach space, then
   C-c(X) endowed with the weak topology is an N-0-space if and only if X
   is countable. We extend Corson's result as follows: If the space E :=
   C-c(X) is a Frechet les, then E endowed with its weak topology sigma(E,
   E') is an N-space if and only if (E, sigma(E, E')) is an N-0-space if
   and only if X is countable. We obtain a necessary and some sufficient
   conditions on a Frechet lcs to be an N-space in the weak topology. We
   prove that a reflexive Frechet lcs E in the weak topology sigma(E, E')
   is an N-space if and only if (E, sigma(E, E')) is an N-0-space if and
   only if E is separable. We show however that the nonseparable Banach
   space l(1)(R) with the weak topology is an N-space. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Solubilization of herbicides by single and mixed commercial surfactants}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{538}},

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The solubilization capabilities of micellar solutions of three single
   surfactants, two alcohol alkoxylates B048 and 0266, and the tallow alkyl
   ethoxylated amine ET15, and their equimolar mixed solutions toward the
   herbicides flurtamone (FL), metribuzin (MTZ) and mesotrione (MST) were
   investigated. The solubilization capacity was quantified in terms of the
   molar solubilization ratio (MSR), critical micellar concentration (CMC),
   micelle-water partition coefficient (K-mc), binding constant (K-1),
   number of aggregation (Nagg) and Stern-Volmer constant (Ksv). The
   herbicides were greatly solubilized into different loci of the micelles:
   FL within the inner hydrophobic core, MST at the micelle/water interface
   and MTZ in the palisade region. Equimolar binary surfactant mixtures did
   not improve the solubilization of herbicides over those of single
   components, with the exception of MTZ by the B266/ET15 system which
   enhanced solubilization by 10-20\%. This enhanced solubilization of MTZ
   was due to an increased number of micelles that arise from both the
   intermediate Nagg relative to that of the single surfactants and the
   lower CMC The use of Ksv values was a better predictor of the
   solubilization of polar molecules within binary mixtures of these
   surfactants than the interaction parameter pm from regular solution
   theory (RST). The results herein suggest that the use of mixed
   surfactant systems for the solubilization of polar molecules in
   environmental remediation technologies may be very limited in scope,
   without clear advantages over the use of single surfactant systems. (C)

   substrates}},
Journal = {{BIOSENSORS \& BIOELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{1069-1075}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Gallium nanoparticles (GaNPs) of different sizes are deposited on
   Si(100) substrates by thermal evaporation. Through ellipsometric
   analysis, it is possible to investigate the plasmonic effects in the
   GaNPs and exploit them to develop biosensors. The excitation of the
   resonant modes for certain incidence angles leads to negative values of
   the imaginary part of the pseudodielectric function ( < epsilon(i) >)
   obtained in ellipsometry. Furthermore, there is an abrupt sign change
   when the difference between the phase shifts of p- and s-polarization
   components reaches 180 degrees at an energy of around 3.15 eV. At that
   energy, reversal of the polarization handedness (RPH) occurs for an
   elliptically-polarized input beam. The energy of the RPH condition
   reduces as the evaporation time increases. The slope of < epsilon(i) >
   at the RPH condition is extremely sensitive to changes in the
   surrounding medium of the NP surface and prompts the use of the GaNP/Si
   system as sensor platform. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy
   (FTIR) is used before and after functionalization with
   3,3'-dithiodipropionic acid di(N-succinimidyl ester) and a
   glutathione-specific antibody to confirm the chemical modification of
   the sample surface. The developed immunosensor is exposed to different
   concentrations of glutathione (GSH) showing a linear relationship
   between the slope of the pseudodielectric function at the RPH condition
   and the GSH concentration. The immunosensor shows a limit of detection
   of 10 nM enabling its use for the detection of low GSH levels in
   different medical conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The Miller cycle has been applied into the ICEs (internal combustion
   engines) to reduce NOx emissions, in the recent years. However, this
   method may decrease the engine power. The most common technique which
   improves the engine power is application of turbo charging. Thus, these
   two methods can be combined to make up for power loss and decrease
   emissions. In this study, the application of the Miller cycle and turbo
   charging methods into a single cylinder, four-stroke, DI (direct
   injection) diesel engine has been experimentally carried out. Two
   different versions of the Miller cycle, which provide 5 and 10 CA (crank
   angle) retarding compared to standard condition, are applied using two
   different camshafts. Turbo charging is applied at two different
   pressures, which are 1.1 and 1.2 bar, using a screw type compressor. In
   the results, the effective power and efficiency increased by 5.1\% and
   6.3\%, NO, HC, CO and CO2 decreased by 27\%, 28\%, 55\% and 10\%,
   respectively. The results show that combination of the proposed methods
   may be applied into the diesel engines to minimize NO and improve engine
   performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sulfur K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy
   is used to measure how the speciation of sulfur compounds evolves within
   a warm-mix asphalt as a consequence of the Rolling Thin-Film Oven (RTFO)
   and Pressure Aging Vessel (PAV) oxidative aging procedures. Identifying
   the types of sulfur compounds present is important for quantifying the
   growth in polar sulfur-containing species that can alter the asphalt's
   mechanical properties over time. Elemental analysis indicates that the
   sulfur content of the asphalt holds constant at 5 wt\% during aging.
   XANES analysis indicates that thiophenic sulfur compounds are most
   prevalent (62\%), followed by sulfide and elemental sulfur compounds.
   RTFO and PAV aging cause smaller and larger shifts, respectively, from
   sulfide to sulfoxide. The amount of unreacted sulfide remains larger
   than the amount of sulfoxide, even with PAV aging. The XANES spectra
   lack features that would be expected if engine oil additives indicative
   of recycled engine oil bottoms were present. The results indicate the
   importance of including thiophene, sulfide, and sulfoxide chemistries
   within molecular asphalt models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Salmonella enterica serovars Enteritidis and Kentucky differ greatly in
   epidemiology. We wanted to know if the non-pathogenic serotype Kentucky
   impacted the recovery of the pathogen Enteritidis from chickens. To
   explore this issue, 4 groups of hens were treated as follows: (i) hens
   were inoculated orally with Kentucky and injected intramuscularly 2
   weeks later with Enteritidis, (ii) hens were contact infected with
   Kentucky and then with Enteritidis, (iii) hens were injected with
   Enteritidis only, and (iv) hens were contact infected with Enteritidis
   only. Hens exposed orally to serotype Kentucky received 10 exp9 CFU, and
   hens injected with serotype Enteritidis received 10 exp7 CFU
   intramuscularly. Contact infected hens were kept in rooms with
   deliberately infected hens. Droppings, cecal tonsils and 5 internal
   organs were sampled and cultured at 6, 13 and 20 days post-infection
   from the 4 groups. Egg production was monitored. Results suggest that
   non-pathogenic serotypes of Salmonella may mitigate recovery of
   Enteritidis from chickens exposed by contact. In summary, we show
   results from an initial experiment intended to investigate if multiple
   serotypes impact the ecology of pathogenic S. enterica on-farm.

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{494-502}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{A four-cell anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) was operated for two years
   treating raw municipal wastewater at ambient water and air temperatures
   of 12-23 degrees C and -10 to 35 degrees C, respectively. The 1000-L
   pilot reactor operated at a 12-h hydraulic residence time and was
   located in the Headworks building of the Plum Creek Water Reclamation
   Authority. The average influent was TSS = 510 +/- 400 mg/L, BOD5 = 320
   +/- 80 mg/L and the average removal of TSS and BOD5 was 83 +/- 10\% and
   47 +/- 15\%, respectively. The TSS and BOD removal exceeded that of
   conventional primary clarification, with no wasting of the settled
   solids over the two-years and stoichiometric production of methane. The
   estimated energy content of the biogas produced per unit volume of
   wastewater treated averaged 0.45 kWh/m(3). The TSS and total COD removal
   in the first cell averaged 75 +/- 15\% and 43 +/- 14\%, respectively,
   but methane production was only 20\% of the total observed for the full
   ABR. The performance of the ABR relative to the extent of solids
   hydrolysis and methane production can be varied by the number of cells
   and hydraulic residence time. The anaerobic baffled reactor is an
   energy-positive technology that can be used for biologically enhanced
   primary treatment of raw municipal wastewater in cold climates. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{It is believed that multi attribute decision making problem is an
   ill-defined and unstructured problem. This difficulty intensifies while
   considering the uncertainty of decision makers' information about the
   problem. In recent years, interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets
   (hereafter IVIFs) as a generalization of ordinal fuzzy sets, became a
   well-known and widely applied framework for dealing with uncertainty of
   decision making problems. However, the mathematical programming aspects
   of interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets besides their applications
   in decision making problems are neglected. To reinforce the mathematical
   programming approach in IVIF environment, an IVIF multi attribute group
   decision making problem is formulated as a linear programming model.
   Using a variable transformation and the notion of aggregation operators,
   the proposed model is transformed into an equivalent linear programming
   model solvable by common approaches. Application of the proposed method
   is represented in a group decision making problem and the results are
   compared with similar methods, proving the compatibility of the proposed
   method with previous ones. The solid and understandable logic with
   computational easiness are the main advantages of the proposed method.
   Solving interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy linear programming problems
   can be applied lucratively in other problems being formulated in this
   context. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the surface states of topological insulator (TI) Bi2Se3
   thin films grown on Si nanocrystals and Al2O3 substrates by using
   terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy. Compared to bulk crystalline
   Bi2Te2Se, film TIs exhibit distinct behaviors in the phase and amplitude
   of emitted THz radiation. In particular, Bi2Se3 grown on Al2O3 shows an
   anisotropic response with a strong modulation of the THz signal in its
   phase. From x-ray diffraction, we find that the crystal plane of the
   Bi2Se3 films is inclined with respect to the plane of the Al2O3
   substrate by about 0.27 degrees. This structural anisotropy affects the
   dynamics of photocarriers and hence leads to the observed anisotropic
   response in the THz emission. Such relevance demonstrates that THz
   emission spectroscopy can be a sensitive tool to investigate the fine
   details of the surface crystallography and electrostatics of thin film
   TIs.}},

Abstract = {{Steryl esters are high molecular weight compounds (600-700 g/mol)
   regularly present as a minor lipid class in animal and plant lipids.
   Different sterol backbones (e.g., cholesterol, beta-sitosterol and
   brassicasterol) which can be esterified with various fatty acids can
   result in highly complex steryl ester patterns in food samples. The gas
   chromatographic (GC) analysis of intact steryl esters is challenging,
   since high elution temperatures are required for their elution. On
   nonpolar GC phases, steryl esters with fatty acids with differing degree
   of unsaturation (e.g., oleate and linoleate) cannot be separated and
   there are only few polar columns available with sufficient temperature
   stability. In this study, we used gas chromatography with mass
   spectrometry (GC/MS) and analyzed intact steryl esters on a commercial
   room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) column which was shortened to a
   length of 12 m. The column separated the steryl esters both by total
   carbon number and by degree of unsaturation of the fatty acid. For
   instance, cholesteryl esters with stearic acid (18:0), oleic acid
   (18:1n-9), linoleic acid (18:2n-6) and alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3)
   could be resolved (R >= 1.3) from each other. By analysis of synthesized
   standard substances, the elution orders for different steryl backbones
   and different fatty acids on a given sterol backbone could be
   determined. Analysis of spreads and plant oils allowed to determine
   retention times for 37 steryl esters, although a few co-elutions were
   observed. The ionic liquid column proved to be well-suited for the
   analysis of intact steryl esters. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{CAtalytic upgrading PRocess In-situ (CAPRI) incorporated with
   Toe-to-Heel Air Injection (THAI) for heavy oil and bitumen recovery and
   upgrading was studied for fixed-bed and dispersed catalysts. The extent
   of upgrading was evaluated in terms of API gravity, viscosity reduction,
   impurity removal, and true boiling point (TBP) distribution. The test
   was carried out using Co-Mo/Al2O3 at temperature of 425 degrees C,
   pressure 20 bar, and residence time of 10 min. The dispersed catalyst
   was tested in a batch reactor. However, the residence time,
   catalyst-to-oil (CTO) ratios as well as the Reynolds numbers of both
   contacting patterns were kept the same to ensure dynamic similitude. It
   was found that the produced oil from dispersed ultrafine Co-Mo/Al2O3
   catalyst (d(p) = 2.6 mu m) exhibited superior light oil characteristics
   and quality than that produced with the fixed-bed of pelleted
   Co-Mo/Al2O3 (1.2 mm diameter x 2-5 mm length). The API gravity of the
   feed oil was 13.8 degrees and the produced oil showed an increase of 5.6
   degrees in the fixed bed and 8.7 degrees with the dispersed catalyst.
   Unlike the fixed-bed of pelleted Co-Mo/Al2O3 which may suffer from
   diffusion limitations, rapid deactivation, and channelling effect, the
   ultrafine particles presented high surface area to volume ratio,
   reducing the chances of pore plugging, have more accessible reaction
   sites per unit mass, and lead to enhanced cracking of macromolecules.
   Moreover, the reduction of sulphur of 38.6\% and (Ni + V) content of
   85.2\% in the produced oil show greater heteroatom removal compared to
   29\% (sulphur) and 45.6\% (Ni + V) observed in the product from the
   fixed-bed. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   patients receiving bevacizumab: Results from the randomized phase III

Abstract = {{Studies assessing the effect of bevacizumab (BEV) on breast cancer (BC)
   outcome have shown different effects on progression-free and overall
   survival, suggesting that a subgroup of patients may benefit from this
   treatment. Unfortunately, no biomarkers exist to identify these
   patients. Here, we investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms
   (SNPs) in VEGF pathway genes correlate with pathological complete
   response (pCR) in the neoadjuvant GeparQuinto trial. HER2-negative
   patients were randomized into treatment arms receiving either BEV
   combined with standard chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone. In a
   pre-planned biomarker study, DNA was collected from 729 and 724
   patients, respectively from both treatment arms, and genotyped for 125
   SNPs. Logistic regression assessed interaction between individual SNPs
   and both treatment arms to predict pCR. Five SNPs may be associated with
   a better response to BEV, but none of them remained significant after
   correction for multiple testing. The two SNPs most strongly associated,
   rs833058 and rs699947, were located upstream of the VEGF-A promoter.
   Odds ratios for the homozygous common, heterozygous and homozygous rare
   rs833058 genotypes were 2.36 (95\% CI, 1.49-3.75), 1.20 (95\% CI,
   0.88-1.64) and 0.61 (95\% CI, 0.34-1.12). Notably, some SNPs in VEGF-A
   exhibited a more pronounced effect in the triple-negative subgroup.
   Several SNPs in VEGF-A may be associated with improved pCR when
   receiving BEV in the neoadjuvant setting. Although none of the observed
   effects survived correction for multiple testing, our observations are
   consistent with previous studies on BEV efficacy in BC. Further research
   is warranted to clarify the predictive value of these markers.
   What's new? Bevacizumab (BEV) is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the
   growth of tumor blood vessels, by inhibiting VEGF-A. Although BEV was
   the first anti-angiogenic drug to be approved for breast cancer, the FDA
   later withdrew approval because of toxicity and the lack of biomarkers
   to indicate which patients would benefit. In this study, the authors
   found that five variants of specific VEGF-pathway genes were associated
   with a positive response to BEV, especially in triple-negative breast
   cancer. These gene variants may thus serve as useful biomarkers for
   treatment with BEV.}},

Title = {{Influence of the wet-well nodalization of a BWR3 Mark I on the
   containment thermal-hydraulic response during an SBO accident}},
Journal = {{NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{295}},
Pages = {{138-147}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{In the field of severe accidents simulation one of the most challenging
   issues is nodalization. This paper explores the effect of the wet well
   modeling on significant variables describing the sequence evolution. The
   code used for the study has been MELCOR 2.1 and the scenario chosen has
   been a prolonged SBO occurring in a BWR3 Mark I. The results indicate
   that some significant magnitudes show a moderate scatter depending on WW
   nodalization (i.e., core uncovery, RPV failure, hydrogen production),
   whereas the SP thermal state might display outstanding deviations, which
   sometimes affect significantly key variables like containment pressure.
   The difficulties and uncertainties around defining a suitable WW
   nodalization have been highlighted and the need to properly balance the
   entire plant meshing has been stressed.
   Even though a number of noding schemes has been explored, the results
   discussion underlines the importance of having a deep understanding of
   the potential phenomena governing the scenario and of mastering the code
   facilities to better model it. Some insights into WW nodalization in
   MELCOR 2.1 have been gained for the specific scenario (i.e., a prolonged
   SBO in a BWR3 Mark I) explored: a single node assumption might
   underestimate PCV pressurization; a loose coupling of water and gas
   exchanges in the WW nodalization would be preferred if the drift flux
   model is chosen for momentum exchange in the flow pathways between WW
   nodes; the potential of some axial thermal stratification in the pool
   should be taken into account when noding the WW; sensitivity analyses on
   physically supported WW nodalization schemes should be conducted and
   focused on key magnitudes describing containment evolution (i.e.,
   pressure). Finally, it is stated that some uncertainties in WW
   nodalization might be reduced and/or moved if a properly scaled-down
   experimental project was launched on potential stratification in BWR3
   Mark I SP during SBO accidents. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   the energy consumption and the bio-diesel cost. Thermochemical models
   were developed for both HTL and pyrolysis of C. reinhardtii based on
   experimental results. The pathways using heat exchangers between the
   inlet and outlet of the HTL reactor were the only scenarios to be net
   energy producers. The other pathways consumed more energy than they
   produced. The costs of production of renewable diesel from HTL or
   pyrolysis were significantly higher than petroleum diesel (average of
   70.4 (sic)/GJ). The most expensive step was the microalgae cultivation
   (nutrients cost and raceway capital cost). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The composition of major hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) diastereoisomers,
   i.e. alpha-, beta-, and gamma-HBCDs, in marine biota is different from
   that of the commercially available form (technical HBCD), which is used
   extensively for toxicological studies. To properly evaluate the impact
   of HBCDs, the embryos of Oryzias melastigma were used to examine the
   developmental toxicity of the individual diastereoisomers. Results
   showed that HBCD diastereoisomers at the environmentally realistic
   concentrations in the embryos induced malformation rate and heartbeat,
   and caused the appearance of apoptotic heart. In addition, alpha-,
   beta-, and gamma-HBCDs had similar potency to stimulate the generation
   of reactive oxygen species, consequently leading to apoptosis in O.
   melastigma embryos. The order of the developmental toxicity of alpha-,
   beta-, and gamma-HBCDs in O. melastigma embryos was different from that
   in zebrafish embryos studied previously, which highlighted the
   importance of using species from both fresh and salt water for toxicity
   assessment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{In this work, a sensitivity analysis framework is presented to identify
   the relevant input variables of a severe accident code, based on an
   incremental Bayesian ensemble updating method. The proposed methodology
   entails: (i) the propagation of the uncertainty in the input variables
   through the severe accident code; (ii) the collection of bootstrap
   replicates of the input and output of limited number of simulations for
   building a set of finite mixture models (FMMs) for approximating the
   probability density function (pdf) of the severe accident code output of
   the replicates; (iii) for each FMM, the calculation of an ensemble of
   sensitivity measures (i.e., input saliency, Hellinger distance and
   Kullback-Leibler divergence) and the updating when a new piece of
   evidence arrives, by a Bayesian scheme, based on the Bradley-Terry model
   for ranking the most relevant input model variables. An application is
   given with respect to a limited number of simulations of a MELCOR severe
   accident model describing the fission products release in the LP-FP-2
   experiment of the loss of fluid test (LOFT) facility, which is a
   scaled-down facility of a pressurized water reactor (PWR). (C) 2015

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{The beta-NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+/g-C3N4 (NYT/C3N4) photocatalyst has been
   successfully fabricated by a stepwise method. Firstly, the advanced
   near-infrared (NIR) driven photocatalyst was characterized by X-ray
   diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron
   microscopy, and UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. It was
   found that NYT/C3N4 photocatalyst consisted of uniform hexagonal phase
   NaYF4 nanocrystals with about 20 nm diameter distributed on surface of
   g-C3N4 sheets, and the NYT/C3N4 composite exhibited strong near-infrared
   light absorption and the energy transfer from beta-NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ to
   g-C3N4 was confirmed. Secondly, the photocatalytic activities of the
   catalysts were evaluated by the degradation of methyl blue dye and
   colorless phenol under the irradiation of 980 nm laser. The results
   suggested that NYT/C3N4 nanocomposite is an advanced NIR-driven
   photocatalyst. Moreover the NYT/C3N4 photocatalyst showed good stability
   for photocatalytic decoloration of dye in the recycled tests. This study
   suggested a promising system to utilize the NIR energy of sunlight for
   photochemical and photoelectrical applications based on g-C3N4, which
   will contribute to the utilization of solar energy in the future. (C)

Title = {{Superposed deformation in the Helanshan Structural Belt: Implications
   for Mesozoic intracontinental deformation of the North China Plate}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{114}},
Number = {{1, SI}},

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The North China Plate (NCP) underwent multi-phase intracontinental
   deformation during the Mesozoic, which is a much-debated research
   subject. Here we present a case study of this deformation inferred from
   regional-scale Helanshan superposed folds in the west of the NCP. New
   structural analyses and fault kinematic analyses in the Helanshan
   Structural Belt (HSB) indicate a two-stage syn-folding paleo-stress
   field, comprising early NNE-SSW compression, with mean orientations 190
   degrees/01 degrees (plunge direction/plunge) for sigma(1), 283
   degrees/26 degrees for sigma(2), and 100 degrees/63 degrees for
   sigma(3), and later WNW-ESE compression with mean orientations of
   sigma(1), sigma(2), and sigma(3) at 124 degrees/07 degrees, 213
   degrees/04 degrees, and 001 degrees/75 degrees, respectively. These
   results, combined with geochronological analysis, indicate two episodes
   of shortening in this belt during the Mesozoic. Late Triassic-Early
   Jurassic NNE-SSW shortening, which produced similar to 8.1 km of
   horizontal shortening, led to the development of open WNW-trending fold
   structures. Subsequent Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous WNW-ESE
   shortening, which produced similar to 18.7 km of horizontal shortening,
   reshaped the early WNW-trending structures and generated close,
   overprinting NNE-trending folds that resulted in the development of the
   regional-scale superposed folds in this area. In terms of geodynamics,
   the early NNE-SSW shortening is likely to be related to Indosinian
   intercontinental convergence between the North China Plate and the
   Yangtze Plate, and the later WNW-ESE shortening is likely to have been
   related to subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate. The regional
   structural analysis indicates that the whole of the western North China
   Plate experienced two-phase contractional deformation during the
   Mesozoic, as manifest by the early NNE-SSW and the late WNW-ESE
   shortening that characterized Mesozoic intracontinental deformation in
   the western NCP. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Growth-arrest-specific 7 (Gas7) is preferentially expressed in the
   nervous system and plays an important role during neuritogenesis in
   vertebrates. We recently demonstrated that gas7 is highly expressed in
   zebrafish neurons, where it regulates neural development. The
   possibility that gas7 may also regulate the development of other tissues
   remains to be examined. In this study, we investigate the role of Gas7
   in the development of craniofacial tissues. Knockdown of gas7 using
   morpholino oligomers produced abnormal phenotypes in neural crest (NC)
   cells and their derivatives. NC-derived cartilage maturation was altered
   in Gas7 morphants as revealed by aberrant sox9b and dlx2 expression, a
   phenotype that could be rescued by coinjection of gas7 mRNA. While
   rhombomere morphology remained normal in Gas7 morphants, we observed
   reduced expression of the prechondrogenic genes sox9b and dlx2 in cells
   populating the posterior pharyngeal arches, but the fundamental
   structure of pharyngeal arches was preserved. In addition, NC cell
   sublineages that migrate to form neurons, glial cells, and melanocytes
   were altered in Gas7 morphants as revealed by aberrant expression of
   neurod, foxd3, and mitfa, respectively. Development of NC progenitors
   was also examined in Gas7 morphants at 12hpf, and we observed that the
   reduction of cell precursors in Gas7 morphants was due to increased
   apoptosis level. These results indicate that the formation of NC
   progenitors and derivatives depends on Gas7 expression. Our observations
   also suggest that Gas7 regulates the formation of NC derivatives
   constituting the internal tissues of pharyngeal arches, without
   affecting the fundamental structure of mesodermal-derived pharyngeal
   arches.}},

   works, lattice-based open cell structures have exhibited higher specific
   strength compared to closed cell structures, such as a honeycomb
   structure. Generally, a kagome structure is more effective than other
   lattice structures for compression and bending. In this work,
   cross-sections of the strut of pyramidal kagome (PK) structure are
   developed to strengthen the sandwich structure. A PK structure based on
   a semi-circular cross-section (SCC) was applied to the bending load
   calculation. The bending deformation modes of the SCC-based PK sandwich
   structure were investigated. The bending load was calculated when the PK
   sandwich structure was bent as stable shear mode and the equation could
   express the non-linear elastic characteristics during the bending
   process by applying the effective shear modulus of inner PR cores. The
   calculated bending load deflection curve was compared with the bending
   load deflection curve obtained by FEM. The tendency of the calculated
   bending load deflection curve was similar to the FEM result. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper discusses application of Carbon Footprint (CF) for
   quantification of the 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP(100))
   associated with the life cycle of polylactic acid (PLA) trays for
   packaging of fresh foods. A comparison with polystyrene (PS)-based trays
   was done considering two different transport system scenarios for
   PLA-granule supply to the tray production firm: a transoceanic freight
   vessel and an intercontinental freight aircraft. Doing so enabled
   estimation of the influence of the transportation phase on the
   GHG-emission rate associated with the PLA-trays' life cycle. From the
   assessment, the GWP(100) resulted to be mainly due to PLA-granulate
   production and to its transportation to the tray manufacturing facility.
   Also, the study documented that, depending upon the transport system
   considered, the CF associated with the life cycle of the PLA trays can
   worsen so much that the latter are no longer GHG-emission saving as they
   are expected to be compared to the PS ones. Therefore, based upon the
   findings of the study, it was possible for the authors to understand the
   importance and the need of accounting for the transport-related issues
   in the design of PLA-based products, thus preserving their environmental
   soundness compared to traditional petroleum-based products.
   In this context, the study could be used as the base to reconsider the
   merits of PLA usage for product manufacturing, especially when high
   distances are implied, as in this analysed case. So, the authors believe
   that new research and policy frameworks should be designed and
   implemented for both development and promotion of more globally
   sustainable options. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Presynaptic protein Synaptotagmin1 regulates the neuronal polarity and
   axon differentiation in cultured hippocampal neurons}},
Journal = {{BMC NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Hippocampal neurons in the brain polarize to form multiple
   dendrites and one long axon. The formation of central synapses remains
   poorly understood. Although several of the intracellular proteins
   involved in the clustering of central neurotransmitter receptors and ion
   channels have been identified, the signals involved in pre- and
   postsynaptic differentiation remain elusive. Synaptotagmin1 is an
   abundant and important presynaptic vesicle protein that binds Ca2+ (J
   Biol Chem 277:7629-7632, 2002) in regulation of synaptic vesicle
   exocytosis at the synapse. Synapse consists of the formation of synaptic
   connections and requires precise coordination of Synaptotagmin1. It was
   reported Synaptotagmin1 plays an important roles in the formation of
   axonal filopodia and branches in chicken forebrain neurons (Dev
   Neurobiol 73:27-44, 2013). To determine if Synaptotagmin1 could have a
   role in formation of axon in hippocampal neurons, we investigated the
   effects of Synaptotagmin1 overexpression and knockdown using the shRNA
   on the growth and branching of the axons of primary hippocampal neurons.
   We showed that overexpression of Synaptotagmin1 leads to abnormal
   multiple axon formation in cultured rat hippocampal neurons.
   Results: We first examined the effects of Synaptotagmin1 on the numbers
   of axon and dendrites. We found that the overexpression of
   Synaptotagmin1 led to the formation of multiple axons and induced an
   increase in the number of endogenous postsynaptic protein Homer1c
   clusters in cultured hippocampal neurons. Endogenous initial segment of
   axon was detected with anti-sodium channel (anti-NaCh) antibody and with
   anti-Tau1 (J Neurosci 24:4605-4613, 2004). The endogenous initial
   segment of axon was stained with anti-NaCh antibodies and with anti-Tau1
   antibodies. Then the numbers of prominence dyed positive were counted as
   axon. We attempted to specifically knockdown the endogenous
   Synaptotagmin1 with small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). To further dissect the
   functions of endogenous Synaptotagmin1 in neuronal polarity, we used the
   shRNA of Synaptotagmin1 that specifically blocks the existence of
   endogenous Synaptotagmin1. When the shRNA of Synaptotagmin1 was
   introduced to the cells, the number of axons and dendrites did not
   change.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that the accumulation of
   Synaptotagmin1 may play an important role in axon/dendrite
   differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem-scale methane (CH4) exchange was observed in a poorly-drained
   black spruce forest over permafrost in interior Alaska during the
   snow-free seasons of 2011-2013, using the eddy covariance technique. The
   magnitude of average CH4 exchange differed depending on wind direction,
   reflecting spatial variation in soil moisture condition around the
   observation tower, due to elevation change within the small catchment.
   In the drier upper position, the seasonal variation in CH4 emission was
   explained by the variation in soil water content only. In the wetter
   bottom, however, in addition to soil temperature and soil water content,
   seasonal thaw depth of frozen soil was also an important variable
   explaining the seasonal variation in CH4 exchange for this ecosystem.
   Total snow-free season (day of year 134-280) CH4 exchanges were 12.0 +/-
   1.0, 19.6 +/- 3.0, and 36.6 +/- 4.4 mmol m(-2) season(-1) for the drier
   upper position, moderately wet area, and wetter bottom of the catchment,
   respectively. Observed total season CH4 emission was nearly one order
   smaller than those reported in other northern wetlands, due probably to
   the relatively low ground water level and low soil temperature. The
   interannual variation of total snow-free season CH4 emission in the
   wetter bottom of the catchment was influenced by the amount of rainfall
   and thaw depth. On the other hand, in the drier upper position the
   amount of rainfall did not strongly affect the total season CH4
   emission. Different responses of CH4 exchange to environmental
   conditions, depending on the position of a small catchment, should be
   considered when estimating the spatial variation in CH4 exchange
   accurately in ecosystems over permafrost. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

   transparency}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{We describe a Josephson device composed of two superconductors separated
   by two interacting quantum dots in parallel, where clear manifestations
   of Cooper pair splitting and subsequent recombination occur. Indeed, in
   addition to sequential tunneling of electrons through each dot, an
   additional transport channel exists in this system: crossed Andreev
   reflection, where a Cooper pair from the source is split between the two
   dots and recombined in the drain superconductor. Unlike nonequilibrium
   scenarios for Cooper pair splitting which involve superconducting/normal
   metal ``forks{''}, our proposal relies on an Aharonov-Bohm measurement
   of the DC Josephson current when a flux is inserted between the two
   dots. We provide a path integral approach to treat arbitrary
   transparencies, and we explore all contributions for the individual
   phases (0 or pi) of the quantum dots. We propose a definition of the
   Cooper pair splitting efficiency (the fraction of the electron transfer
   processes which involve the splitting of a Cooper pair) for arbitrary
   transparencies, which allows us to find the phase associations which
   favor the crossed Andreev process. Possible applications to experiments
   using nanowires as quantum dots are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Compared to most bulk materials, open-cell aluminium (Al) foams (OCAFs)
   are light-weight and can absorb a significant amount of energy in
   compression, e.g. during impact. When coated with nickel (Ni), OCAFs can
   absorb even more energy, making them more appropriate for impacts at
   higher velocities than uncoated OCAFs. When Ni-coated OCAFs experience
   low-velocity impact however, the stopping distance during the impact is
   small compared to that of uncoated OCAFs and hence, deceleration occurs
   fast. This exposes devices (and possibly human beings) protected by
   OCAFs to large internal forces leading to internal damage. An OCAF that
   combines the properties of uncoated and coated OCAFs can absorb energy
   during both low-velocity and high-velocity impact scenarios. This
   contribution introduces two of such OCAFs which are created by partially
   and gradually coating OCAFs. The general mechanics of the two OCAFs are
   revealed using experimental and numerical observation methods. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Tight coordination of cell proliferation and differentiation is central
   to red blood cell formation. Erythropoietin controls the proliferation
   and survival of red blood cell precursors, while variations in
   GATA-1/FOG-1 complex composition and concentrations drive
   theirmaturation. However, clear evidence of cross-talk between molecular
   pathways is lacking. Here, we show that erythropoietin activates AKT,
   which phosphorylates GATA-1 at Ser310, thereby increasing GATA-1
   affinity for FOG-1. In turn, FOG-1 displaces pRb/E2F-2 from GATA-1,
   ultimately releasing free, proproliferative E2F-2. Mice bearing a
   Gata-1S310A mutation suffer from fatal anemia when a compensatory
   pathway for E2F-2 production involving insulin-like growth factor-1
   (IGF-1) signaling is simultaneously abolished. In the context of the
   GATA-1V205G mutation resulting in lethal anemia, we show that the Ser310
   cannot be phosphorylated and that constitutive phosphorylation at this
   position restores partial erythroid differentiation. This study sheds
   light on the GATA-1 pathways that synchronize cell proliferation and
   differentiation for tissue homeostasis.}},

Abstract = {{To develop reverse genetics system of RNA viruses, cloning of
   full-length viral genome is required which is often challenging due to
   many steps involved. In this study, we report cloning of full-length
   cDNA from an Indian field isolate (CSFV/IVRI/VB-131) of classical swine
   fever virus (CSFV) using in vitro overlap extension PCR and
   recombination which drastically reduced the number of cloning steps. The
   genome of CSFV was amplified in six overlapping cDNA fragments, linked
   by overlap extension PCR and cloned in a bacterial artificial chromosome
   (BAC) vector using in vitro recombination method to generate full-length
   cDNA clone. The full-length CSFV cDNA clone was found stable in E. coli
   Stellar and DH10B cells. The full-length RNA was transcribed in vitro
   using T7 RNA polymerase and transfected in PK15 cells using Neon-tip
   electroporator to rescue infectious CSFV. The progeny CSFV was
   propagated in PK15 cells and found indistinguishable from the parent
   virus. The expression of CSFV proteins were detected in cytoplasm of
   PK15 cells infected with progeny CSFV at 72 h post-infection. We
   concluded that the in vitro overlap extension PCR and recombination
   method is useful to construct stable full-length cDNA clone of RNA virus

Abstract = {{Background: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical
   infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is characterized by the
   involvement of cerebral small arteries. Although cerebral large artery
   disease has been reported in CADASIL patients, the prevalence and
   location of relevant cerebral arterial disease have not been elucidated.
   In this study, we aim to characterize infarctions associated with
   cerebral large artery disease in CADASIL patients.
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 49 consecutive symptomatic patients
   with genetically confirmed CADASIL, who visited the Asan Medical Center
   between December 2002 and December 2013. Infarctions located within the
   territory of a relevant, large cerebral artery were identified with the
   use of magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography.
   Patients with or without territorial patterns associated with large
   artery disease were compared.
   Results: Out of a total of 49 patients, 23 patients had cerebral
   infarction. Among these, seven had infarction associated with cerebral
   large artery disease. The corresponding vascular lesions were located in
   the intracranial arteries in all seven patients. There were no
   differences between patients with or without territorial infarction in
   terms of vascular risk factors, microbleeds, white matter changes, or
   mutations involving cysteine. A literature review illustrates that
   symptomatic intracranial diseases are present in CADASIL patients at
   least in East Asia.
   Conclusion: Infarction in association with intracranial arterial disease
   may be a manifestation of CADASIL. Further studies are needed to
   elucidate the pathologic characteristics and to see whether this occurs
   exclusively in East Asia. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The prevalence of cameras in consumer electric devices has led not only
   to many visual-sensing applications, but also potential use of cameras
   for communication purposes. With the increasing interest in optical
   camera communication technology and quick response codes, the
   display-to-camera (D2C) link has become a valuable side channel in
   ubiquitous computing environments. This paper proposes a new concept of
   display field communication (DFC), where the image on the electronic
   display is a transmitter and the camera is a receiver, meaning that data
   can be transmitted via the D2C links and image sequences can be
   displayed for their original purpose without serious visible artifacts.
   Because the proposed scheme embeds data at a designated spectral band,
   the hidden data do not reveal itself through normal displays and can
   only be revealed via the proposed decoding process. To observe the
   practical performance of the proposed DFC, the geometric distortion
   based on the various vision transformation parameters was considered and
   its effects on the communication performance according to the spectral
   bands were addressed. The simulation results showed that the maximum
   achievable data rate of approximately 9.5 kbps could be achieved for all
   perspective parameter cases when a gray-scale image size of 256 x 256
   was used for embedding data, consisting of eight individual information
   vectors with their elements of 16-QAM modulated data. The proposed DFC
   algorithm showed satisfactory performance, providing a high data rate in
   the D2C communication link while the data embedded on the images was
   unobtrusive to the human eye.}},

Abstract = {{Eight early-mid Pelsonian (Middle Triassic) marine sedimentary
   successions, an outcrop and subsurface sections of the Ra'af Formation
   from the northwest Gondwana margins facing the southeast corner of the
   tropical western Tethyan seaway assigned to the southern Intertropical
   Convergence Zone (ITCZ) (south Israel, Levant Basin, north Arabian
   plate) are the focus of this work. The successions, especially with the
   exclusive outcrop at Har `Arief, are a golden opportunity to observe the
   still connected transitional zone between the huge siliciclastic domains
   derived from Gondwana hinterland parts (north Arabian plate) and the
   open, tropical Tethyan marine carbonate domain and their mutual
   relationships.
   This multidiscipline research tracks a carbonate recovery attempt in a
   dominant silicidastic system. The recovery effort was characterized by
   starved sedimentary conditions, basin-constrained oxygen-stressed
   environments, and low-diverse, autochthonous burrowed sediments barren
   of other faunal remains. Low-diverse fossiliferous allochthonous beds,
   transported from higher sites on the slopes, revealed differential
   distributions of echinoids, mollusks and especially foraminifera (large
   Pilammina-Pilamminella versus small glomospirids); these variances were
   attributed to different environmental conditions on the slopes of each
   basin-type and illuminate some constraints on their distribution pattern
   and climate affinity in the Triassic, southern ITCZ mixed carbonate/
   siliciclastic, sedimentary system. The carbonate recovery phase is
   ascribed to a relatively dry period in the hinterland rather than to
   sea-level rise; this dry period, which interrupted the relatively humid
   climate in the northern tropical Gondwana during the Pelsonian, is
   represented by the constant, although with some perturbations,
   siliciclastic sedimentary system that prevailed in the southeastern
   corner of the Tethys seaway during the Anisian. Insights from the
   symmetric and asymmetric correlation of climate fluctuations in the
   hinterlands of the southeastern European basins (northern hemisphere)
   and this work (from the southern hemisphere), both embracing basins
   ascribed to the western tropical Tethyan seaway, illuminate the possible
   effects of the ICTZ behavior pattern and possible extra-tropical forces
   on the climate variations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Personal identification approaches using finger knuckle patterns are
   receiving increasing attention in the biometrics literature. Several
   approaches have been explored and these methods consider knuckle
   patterns as textured-like patterns, similar to the iris, and illustrate
   promising results. However much of the law-enforcement and forensic
   analysis for hand biometrics still relies on recovery and matching of
   minutiae patterns which has matured in last several decades. This is
   largely due to the fact that the identification of minutiae patterns is
   believed to be more scientific and pervasive in connecting with the
   anatomy/uniqueness of individuals. Availability of high resolution
   finger dorsal images acquired for recreational or covert imaging can
   provide important cues for forensic investigation and analysis,
   especially when finger dorsal patterns are only the piece of evidence
   available for the identification. Identification of finger knuckle
   patterns using minutiae recovery and matching is expected to
   significantly help in prosecution of such suspects. This paper therefore
   investigates recovery and matching of minutiae patterns using finger
   knuckle images. We investigate effective use of minutiae quality in
   improving performance for the knuckle pattern matching. Our study
   detailed in this paper also presents comparative evaluation of
   performance using three popular minutiae matching approaches. The
   experimental results presented in this paper from a database from 120
   different subjects are highly encouraging and validate such first
   attempt to study minutiae recovery and matching from finger knuckle
   images. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of chemical, physical, and cooking treatments on the
   reduction of aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)), B-2, G(1), and G(2) in soybean
   matrix were investigated. A HPLC-FLD with a Kobra cell system was used
   for the quantitative analysis of aflatoxins (AFs). To decrease the level
   of AFs during the soaking process, the contaminated soybeans were
   submerged in organic acid solutions. The reduction rates of AFB(1) in
   1.0 N citric acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, and tartaric acid for 18
   h were 94.1\%, 92.7\%, 62.0\%, and 95.1\%, respectively. In the case of
   pH and autoclave treatment, the level of AFB(1) was significantly
   decreased during autoclaving process at pH 7.4, 9.0, and 11.1, compared
   with the non-autoclaved samples (p < 0.05). In the case of physical
   treatment, the heating process at 100 and 150 degrees C for 90 min
   significantly decreased the level of AFB(1) by 41.9\% and 81.2\%,
   respectively (p < 0.05). The reduction rate of AFB(1) after cooking was
   97.9\% for soybean milk and 33.6\% for steamed soybeans. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Phase transitions and thermal-expansion behavior were investigated in
   (001)(-cut) 0.69Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3) O-3-0.31PbTiO(3) (PMN-31PT) single

   (R) -> orthorhombic (O) transition. The transition behavior of the
   sample during heating is considerably more complex than during cooling.
   These transitions are associated with a change in local symmetry based
   on a model of stress-induced polarization rotation. Thermal expansion
   behavior of the sample strongly depends on stress. Under 14 MPa, the
   sample displays linear-contraction behavior, and a large contraction
   coefficient alpha = -17 x 10(-6) K-1 is obtained within a wide

   Converter with Ultrathin Single-layer Metasurface}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The arbitrary control of the polarization states of light has attracted
   the interest of the scientific community because of the wide range of
   modern optical applications that such control can afford. However,
   conventional polarization control setups are bulky and very often
   operate only within a narrow wavelength range, thereby resisting optical
   system miniaturization and integration. Here, we present the basic
   theory, simulated demonstration, and in-depth analysis of a
   high-performance broadband and invertible linear-to-circular (LTC)
   polarization converter composed of a single-layer gold nanorod array
   with a total thickness of similar to lambda/70 for the near-infrared
   regime. This setup can transform a circularly polarized wave into a
   linearly polarized one or a linearly polarized wave with a
   wavelength-dependent electric field polarization angle into a circularly
   polarized one in the transmission mode. The broadband and invertible LTC
   polarization conversion can be attributed to the tailoring of the light
   interference at the subwavelength scale via the induction of the
   anisotropic optical resonance mode. This ultrathin single-layer
   metasurface relaxes the high-precision requirements of the structure
   parameters in general metasurfaces while retaining the polarization
   conversion performance. Our findings open up intriguing possibilities
   towards the realization of novel integrated metasurface-based photonics
   devices for polarization manipulation, modulation, and phase
   retardation.}},

Abstract = {{The self-enhanced electrochemiluminescence (ECL) with high sensitivity

   first synthesized through simple hydrolysis of a novel precursor
   containing luminescent and intracoreactant groups in one molecule, which
   presented higher emission efficiency and enhanced ECL intensity due to
   the shorter electron-transfer path and less energy loss. Moreover, the
   as-proposed ECL cytosensor was successfully used to investigate
   efficiency of paclitaxel toward MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell in the
   range from 1 nM to 200 nM with a detection limit of 0.3 nM and a
   correlation coefficient of 0.9917. The improved accuracy and excellent

Abstract = {{Heart disease is the leading cause of human death in the 21st century.
   Heart transplantation is a promising way to treat this. Because donor
   resources are limited, cell-based therapy has been developed as an
   alternative. Therefore, genes that trigger cardiogenesis could have
   potential in the treatment of heart disease. Fibroblast growth factor 1
   (FGF1) is reported to stimulate cardiomyocyte proliferation under
   conditions of myocardial infarction, but little is known about its
   function during cardiac differentiation. In this study, we established
   an in vitro cardiogenesis model through a reliable chemical induction
   protocol to determine whether FGF1 and its gene expression are involved
   in cardiogenesis. Oxytocin, not only a well-known hormone but also a
   cardiac differentiation inducer, was used in a mouse embryonic stem cell
   line, E14Tg2a, to achieve cardiac differentiation. After
   differentiation, beating cell clusters appeared and the expression of
   FGF1B mRNA was upregulated in the late differentiation stage
   (differentiation days 8-14). Interestingly, FGF1B expression patterns
   during cardiac differentiation were similar to those of a mature
   cardiomyocyte marker, troponin T2, cardiac. The blockage of FGF1-FGF
   receptor (FGFR) signaling reduced not only the appearance of beating
   cluster formation but also the expression levels of
   cardiomyocyte-associated genes. Moreover, by investigating FGF1
   downstream signaling cascades, we observed that the efficiency of
   beating cluster formation was mainly regulated through the FGF1-FGFR-PKC
   signaling axis. Taken together, we provide evidence to support that FGF1
   could regulate cardiogenesis primarily through the protein kinase C
   signaling, but not through the mitogen-activated protein kinase
   signaling, pathway.}},

Abstract = {{A novel competitive-type immunosensing strategy based on target-induced
   displacement reaction with antibody-functionalized mesoporous carbon
   (MSC) nanoparticles was designed for sensitive and rapid electrochemical
   detection of aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1), used as a model) on the
   Nafion-functionalized sensing interface. Electroactive thionine
   molecules were initially decorated to the mesoporous carbon, and
   polyclonal anti-AFB(1) antibody was then covalently conjugated to the
   nanostructures. The immunosensor was simply prepared via the
   electrostatic interaction between negatively charged Nafion film and
   positively charged anti-AFB(1) antibody accompanying the nanostructures.
   The electrochemical signal originated from the carried thionine to
   mesoporous carbon. Upon target AFB(1) introduction, the analyte reacted
   with the labeled anti-AFB(1) antibody on the MSC based on specific
   antigen-antibody reaction and induced the dissociation of thionine-MSN
   nanostructures from the sensing interface, thus decreasing the cathodic
   current of the carried thionine molecules. Under optimal conditions, the
   immunosensor exhibited good electrochemical responses for determination
   of target AFB(1) at a concentration as low as 3.0 pg mL(-1) (3.0 ppt).
   Importantly, the non-conventional sensing system provides a promising
   immunosensing strategy for rapid screening of small molecules because of
   its simplicity, low cost and sensitivity without the needs of sample
   separation and washing step. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A pilot study was performed to evaluate formation, distribution and
   emission of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans
   (PCDD/Fs) from cement kilns that co-process fly ash from municipal solid
   waste incineration (MSWI). Stack gas and particulate samples from
   multiple stages in the process were collected and analyzed for PCDD/Fs.
   Stack emissions of PCDD/Fs were below the European Union limit for
   cement kilns (0.1 ngTEQm(-3)). PCDD/F concentrations in particulates
   from the cyclone preheater outlet, suspension preheater boiler,
   humidifier tower, and back-end bag filter were much higher than in other
   samples, which suggests that these areas are the major sites of PCDD/F
   formation. Comparison of PCDD/F homolog and congener profiles from
   different stages suggested that tetra- and penta-chlorinated furans were
   mainly formed during cement kiln co-processing of MSWI fly ash. Three
   lower chlorinated furan congeners, including
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran, 1,2,3,7,8-pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin
   and 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran, were identified as dominant
   contributors to the toxic equivalents (TEQ) of the PCDD/Fs. The
   concentration of PCDD/Fs in particulates was correlated with chloride
   content, which is consistent with its positive effect on PCDD/F
   formation. This could be mitigated by pretreating the feedstock to
   remove chloride and metals. Mass balance indicated that cement kilns
   eliminated about 94\% of the PCDD/F TEQ input from the feedstock. (C)

Title = {{Predictors of antiretroviral therapy initiation: a cross-sectional study
   among Chinese HIV-infected men who have sex with men}},
Journal = {{BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Early antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation is crucial to
   achieve HIV viral suppression and reduce transmission. HIV-infected
   Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM) were less likely to initiate ART
   than other HIV-infected individuals. We assessed predictors of ART
   initiation among Chinese MSM.
   Methods: In 2010-2011, a cross-sectional study was conducted among MSM
   in Beijing, China. We examined ART initiation within the subgroup who
   were diagnosed with HIV infection prior to participation in the survey.
   Logistic regression models were fitted to evaluate socio-demographic and
   behavioral factors associated with ART initiation. The eligibility
   criterion in the 2010/2011 national HIV treatment guidelines was CD4
   cell count < 350 cells/mu L or World Health Organization (WHO) clinical
   stage III/IV.
   Results: Of 238 eligible HIV-infected participants, the median duration
   of HIV infection was 15 months (range: 31 days-12 years); 62 (26.1 \%)
   had initiated ART. Among 103 men with CD4 counts < 350 cells/mu L, 38
   (36.9 \%) initiated ART. Being married to a woman (adjusted odd ratios
   {[}aOR]: 2.50; 95 \% confidence interval {[}CI]: 1.07-5.87), longer
   duration of HIV infection (aOR: 10.71; 95 \% CI: 3.66-31.32), and
   syphilis co-infection (aOR: 2.58; 95 \% CI: 1.04-6.37) were associated
   with a higher likelihood of ART initiation. Of 135 men with CD4 count >=
   350 cells/mu L, 24 (18 \%) initiated ART. Being married to a woman (aOR:
   4.21; 95 \% CI: 1.60-11.06), longer duration of HIV infection (aOR:
   22.4; 95 \% CI: 2.79-180), older age (aOR: 1.26; 95 \% CI: 1.1-1.44),
   Beijing Hukou (aOR: 4.93; 95 \% CI: 1.25-19.33), presence of AIDS-like
   clinical symptoms (aOR: 3.97; 95 \% CI: 1.32-14.0), and history of
   sexually transmitted infections (aOR: 4.93; 95 \% CI: 1.25-19.43) were
   associated with ART initiation. Compared with men who did not initiated
   ART, those with ART were more likely to receive counseling on benefits
   of ART (96.8 \% vs. 66.4 \%, P = 0 < 0.01), HIV stigma coping strategy
   (75.8 \% vs. 65.9 \%, P = 0.04), mental health (66.1 \% vs. 52.9 \%, P =
   0.02), and substance use (46.7 \% vs. 36.6 \%, P = 0.04).
   Conclusions: We documented low rates of ART initiation among Chinese
   MSM. Policy changes for expanding ART eligibility and interventions to
   improve the continuum of HIV care are in progress in China. Impact
   evaluations can help assess continuing barriers to ART initiation among
   MSM.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiac cachexia (CC) is the clinical entity at the end of chronic
   natural course of heart failure (HF). Despite the efforts, even the most
   recent definition of cardiac cachexia has been challenged, more
   precisely the addition of new criteria on top of obligatory weight loss.
   The pathophysiology of CC is complex and multifactorial. Better
   understanding of pathophysiological pathways in body wasting will
   contribute to establish potentially novel treatment strategies. The
   complex biochemical network related with CC and HF pathophysiology
   underlines that a single biomarker cannot reflect all of the features of
   the disease. Biomarkers that could pick-up the changes in body
   composition before they convey into clinical manifestations of CC would
   be of great importance. The development of preventive and therapeutic
   strategies against cachexia, sarcopenia and wasting disorders is
   perceived as an urgent need by healthcare professionals. The treatment
   of body wasting remains an unresolved challenge to this day. As CC is a
   multifactorial disorder, it is unlikely that any single agent will be
   completely effective in treating this condition. Among all investigated
   therapeutic strategies, aerobic exercise training in HF patients is the
   most proved to counteract skeletal muscle wasting and is recommended by
   treatment guidelines for HF. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

   revealed that there exists an optimal SOE operating temperature leading
   to the maximum power output and maximum electrical efficiency

   larger power output and higher efficiency. There also existed optimal
   direct irradiation intensities leading to the maximum power output and

Abstract = {{The functions of microbial and animal rhodopsins are triggered by the
   isomerization of their all-trans and 11-cis retinal chromophores,
   respectively. To lay the molecular basis driving the evolutionary
   transition from the all-trans to the 11-cis chromophore,
   multiconfigurational quantum chemistry is used to compare the
   isomerization mechanisms of the sensory rhodopsin from the
   cyanobacterium Anabaena PCC 7120 (ASR) and of the bovine rhodopsin (Rh).
   It is found that, despite their evolutionary distance, these eubacterial
   and vertebrate rhodopsins start to isomerize via distinct
   implementations of the same bicycle-pedal mechanism originally proposed
   by Warshel {[}Warshel A (1976) Nature 260:678-683]. However, by
   following the electronic structure changes of ASR (featuring the
   all-trans chromophore) during the isomerization, we find that ASR enters
   a region of degeneracy between the first and second excited states not
   found in Rh (featuring the 11-cis chromophore). We show that such
   degeneracy is modulated by the preorganized structure of the chromophore
   and by the position of the reactive double bond. It is argued that the
   optimization of the electronic properties of the chromophore, which
   affects the photoisomerization efficiency and the thermal isomerization
   barrier, provided a key factor for the emergence of the striking amino
   acid sequence divergence observed between the microbial and animal
   rhodopsins.}},

Title = {{Prebiotic oligosaccharides from artichoke industrial waste: evaluation
   of different extraction methods}},

Abstract = {{Artichoke industrial wastes, which are about 70\% of the total artichoke
   flower, contain prebiotic sugar, such as fructooligosaccharides. In this
   study, the effect of ultrasound by two different modes (direct and
   indirect sonication) to enhance the conventional extraction has been
   evaluated, in terms of yield of prebiotic sugar from artichoke
   industrial waste. The ultrasound with direct sonication showed to be
   more efficient to produce rich-prebiotic sugars extracts than
   conventional and indirect sonication processes. Therefore, variables
   such as extraction temperature (50-70 degrees C), time (5-120 min) and
   power (240-480W) have been investigated for the ultrasound extraction
   with direct sonication, in order to improve the prebiotic sugars yield.
   The chosen extraction conditions were: 10 min, 60 degrees C and 360W.
   Ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS)
   method was used to identify and quantify the sugar extracted. The
   artichoke waste extract is a potential source of prebiotic sugars,
   containing 1-kestose, nystose, fructofuranosylnystose and raffinose. (C)

Abstract = {{The equilibrium measure of a compact set is a fundamental object in
   logarithmic potential theory. We compute numerically this measure and
   its orthogonal polynomials, when the compact set is a Cantor set,
   defined by an Iterated Function System.
   We first construct sequences of discrete measures, via the solution of
   large systems of non-linear equations, that converge weakly to the
   equilibrium measure. Successively, we compute their Jacobi matrices via
   standard procedures, enhanced for the scope. Numerical estimates of the
   convergence rate to the limit Jacobi matrix are provided, which show
   stability and efficiency of the whole procedure. As a companion result,
   we also compute Jacobi matrices in two other cases: equilibrium measures
   on finite sets of intervals, and balanced measures of Iterated Function
   Systems.
   These algorithms can reach large polynomial orders: therefore, we study
   the asymptotic behavior of the orthogonal polynomials and, by a natural
   extension of the concept of regular root asymptotics, we derive an
   efficient scheme for the computation of complex Green's functions and of
   related conformal mappings. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Usefulness of arterial spin-labeling images in periictal state diagnosis

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{359}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Arterial spin-labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI, a noninvasive
   method of assessing cerebral blood flow, is becoming a diagnostic tool
   of epilepsy. This study was undertaken to evaluate the diagnostic
   validity of ASL in patients with status epilepticus (SE) in a periictal
   state.
   Method: Twenty cases with SE were studied. Patients were imaged at a 3 T
   MRI including ASL and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and were also
   examined using electroencephalography (EEG). The abnormal findings of
   ASL were compared with those obtained from DWI and EEG.
   Result: Focal hyperperfusion was found in the cortical territory of 13
   cases (65\%). In 10 of those 13 cases, the ASL hyperperfusion region
   corresponded to DWI high intensity and EEG abnormality. Two cases showed
   hyperperfusion corresponding to EEG abnormalities in ASL despite the
   absence of high intensity in DWI. The remaining single case showed
   hyperperfusion in ASL despite the absence of high intensity in DWI and
   EEG abnormalities. Hyperperfusion in the subcortical territory was
   observed in the ipsilateral thalamus in three cases and in the
   contralateral cerebellum in one case.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that ASL is a useful tool to diagnose
   status epilepticus and localization of the epilepsy focus. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Open plan classrooms, where several class bases share the same space,
   have recently re-emerged in Australian primary schools. This study
   compared the acoustics of four different Kindergarten classrooms: an
   enclosed classroom with 25 students, a double classroom with 44
   students, a linear fully open plan triple classroom with 91 students,
   and a semi-open plan K-6 classroom with 205 students. Ambient noise
   levels, intrusive noise levels, occupied background noise levels, and
   teacher's speech levels were recorded during different activities. Room
   impulse responses using logarithmic sweeps were also recorded for
   different teaching scenarios. From these recordings, signal-to-noise
   ratios, speech transmission index scores, and reverberation times were
   calculated. The results revealed much higher intrusive noise levels in
   the two largest open plan classrooms, resulting in signal-to-noise
   ratios and speech transmission index scores to be well below those
   recommended in classrooms with students of this age. Additionally,
   occupied background noise levels in all classrooms were well above
   recommended levels. These results suggest noise in classrooms needs to
   be better controlled, and open plan classrooms are unlikely to be
   appropriate learning environments for young children due to their high
   intrusive noise levels. The impact of noise on children's learning and
   teacher's vocal health are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Several spectral efficient solutions for next-generation flexible
   optical networks are under investigation in order to cope with
   scalability issues while traffic demand is continuously increasing.
   Concerning transmission, Nyquist wavelength-division multiplexing
   (NWDM)-that confines the bandwidth within the Nyquist frequency of the
   signal-recently gained a momentum as one of the most suitable solutions
   for transmission over backbone networks and commercial solutions are
   available by now. Besides NWDM, other transmission techniques have been
   proposed to approach or overcome the Nyquist limit, thus further
   increasing the spectral efficiency (SE). Among them, time-frequency
   packing (TFP) is one candidate. This method builds a superchannel, whose
   subcarriers significantly overlap in frequency or time or both. This
   leads to an increased SE at the expenses of additional complexity within
   the transceiver to compensate for the introduced intersymbol
   interference. In this paper, we experimentally compare, for the first
   time, NWDM and TFP when employing the same identical test-bed. The
   experiment considered the two different terabit superchannels: a
   polarization multiplexed (PM)-16 quadrature amplitude modulation for the
   case of NWDM case, and a PM-quadrature phase-shift keying for TFP. The
   comparison and assessment of the results is carried out first in
   back-to-back configuration and, afterward, by propagating them over a
   recirculating loop consisting of a standard single-mode fiber, including
   spectrum selective switch to emulate node filtering.}},

Abstract = {{Nonsettleable grit from wastewater streams is an important fraction of
   wastewater. In this study, the effects of model grit on the performance
   of the reactor, the characteristics of the sludge and the structure of
   the bacterial community in membrane bioreactors (MBRs) were explored.
   The results show that the presence of grit in the mixed liquor displayed
   no significant influence on the removal of chemical oxygen demand,
   nitrogenous species and phosphorous. The grit, however, improved the
   sludge settleablity and decreased the sludge floc size. Additionally,
   adding grit into the mixed liquor displayed no significant influence On
   the concentration of soluble microbial products (SMP). However, the grit
   addition increased the concentration of extracellular polymeric
   substances (EPS). For instance, the concentration of polysaccharides in
   the EPS were determined to be 105.0 mg/L, 115.0 mg/L and 153.5 mg/L on
   average in the control MBR-A, MBR-B (0.2 g/L of model grit in the mixed
   liquor) and MEW-C (1.0 g/L of model grit in the mixed liquor),
   respectively. The long-term MBR operation and short-term filtration
   tests show that the presence of microscale grit in the mixed liquor can
   accelerate membrane fouling as a result of the deposition of biopolymers
   and grit on the membranes. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
   analysis further corroborated these phenomena. A 165 rRNA-targeted
   high-throughput pyrosequencing analysis revealed that the presence of
   grit decreased the abundance of the Bacteroidetes phylum and increased
   the abundance of the Verrucomicrobia and Nitrospiro phylum in the mixed
   liquor. In addition, the higher grit content in the mixed liquor (1 g/L)
   trigged a sharp decrease in filamentous bacteria (i.e., Thiothrix),
   corroborating the good settleablity of sludge flocs. This study expands
   our knowledge of MBRs treating wastewater involved with storm water,
   assisting engineering applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is
   synthesized through decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine (PS),
   catalysed by PS decarboxylase 1 (Psd1p) and 2 (Psd2p) and the cytidine
   5'-diphosphate (CDP)-ethanolamine (CDP-Etn) pathway. PSD1 null (psd1
   Delta) and PSD2 null (psd2 Delta) mutants are viable in a synthetic
   minimal medium, but a psd1 Delta psd2. double mutant exhibits Etn
   auxotrophy, which is incorporated into PE through the CDP-Etn pathway.
   We have previously shown that psd1. is synthetic lethal with deletion of
   VID22 (vid22 Delta) {[}Kuroda et al. (2011) Mol. Microbiol. 80, 248265].
   In the present study, we found that vid22 Delta mutant exhibits Etn
   auxotrophy under PSD1-depressed conditions. Deletion of VID22 in
   wild-type and PSD1-depressed cells caused partial defects in PE
   formation through decarboxylation of PS. The enzyme activity of PS
   decarboxylase in an extract of vid22 Delta cells was similar to 70\% of
   that in wild-type cells and similar to that in psd2. cells and the PS
   decarboxylase activity remaining in the PSD1-depressed cells became
   almost negligible with deletion of vid22 Delta Thus, the vid22 Delta
   mutation was suggested to cause a defect in the Psd2p activity.
   Furthermore, vid22 Delta cells were shown to be defective in expression
   of the PSD2 gene tagged with 6xHA, the defect being ameliorated by
   replacement of the native promoter of the PSD2 gene with a CYC1
   promoter. In addition, an alpha-galactosidase reporter assay revealed
   that the activity of the promoter of the PSD2 gene in vid22 Delta cells
   was similar to 5\% of that in wild-type cells. These results showed that
   VID22 is required for transcriptional activation of the PSD2 gene.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel method is proposed for unconstrained pose
   invariant face recognition from only an image in a gallery. A 3D face is
   initially reconstructed using only a 2D frontal image. Then, for each
   person in the gallery, a Triplet Collaborative Dictionary Matrix (TCDM)
   is created from all face poses by rotating the 3D reconstructed models
   and extracting features in rotated face. Each TCDM is subsequently
   rendered based On triplet angles of face poses. Finally, the
   classification is performed by Collaborative Representation
   Classification (CRC) with Regularized Least Square (RLS). Promising
   results were acquired to handle pose changes on the FERET, LFW and video
   face databases compared to state-of-the-art methods in pose-invariant
   face recognition. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of risk factors on the amount of time taken to reach an
   endpoint is a common parameter of interest. Hazard ratios are often
   estimated using a discrete-time approximation, which works well when the
   by-interval event rate is low. However, if the intervals are made more
   frequent than the observation times, missing values will arise. We
   investigated common analytical approaches, including available-case (AC)
   analysis, last observation carried forward (LOCF), and multiple
   imputation (MI), in a setting where time-dependent covariates also act
   as mediators. We generated complete data to obtain monthly information
   for all individuals, and from the complete data, we selected
   ``observed{''} data by assuming that follow-up visits occurred every 6
   months. MI proved superior to LOCF and AC analyses when only data on
   confounding variables were missing; AC analysis also performed well when
   data for additional variables were missing completely at random. We
   applied the 3 approaches to data from the Canadian HIV-Hepatitis C
   Co-infection Cohort Study (2003-2014) to estimate the association of
   alcohol abuse with liver fibrosis. The AC and LOCF estimates were larger
   but less precise than those obtained from the analysis that employed MI.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{201}},
Pages = {{302-307}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Compared to many other cardiovascular diseases, there is a
   paucity of data on the characteristics of successfully resuscitated
   cardiac arrest (CA) patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
   infection. We investigated causes, clinical features and outcome of
   these patients, and assessed the specific burden of HIV on outcome.
   Methods: Retrospective analysis of HIV-infected patients admitted to 20
   French ICUs for successfully resuscitated CA (2000-2012).
   Characteristics and outcome of HIV-infected patients were compared to
   those of a large cohort of HIV-uninfected patients admitted after CA in
   the Cochin Hospital ICU during the same period.
   Results: 99 patients were included (median CD4 lymphocyte count
   233/mm(3), viral load 43 copies/ml). When compared with the control
   cohort of 1701 patients, HIV-infected patients were younger, with a
   predominance of male, a majority of in-hospital CA (52\%), and
   non-shockable initial rhythm (80.8\%). CA was mostly related to
   respiratory cause (n=36, including 23 pneumonia), cardiac cause (n=33,
   including 16 acute myocardial infarction), neurologic cause (n=8) and
   toxic cause (n=5). CA was deemed directly related to HIV infection in 18
   cases. Seventy-one patients died in the ICU, mostly for care withdrawal
   after post-anoxic encephalopathy. After propensity score matching, ICU
   mortality was not significantly affected by HIV infection. Similarly,
   HIV disease characteristics had no impact on ICU outcome.
   Conclusions: Etiologies of CA in HIV-infected patients are miscellaneous
   and mostly not related to HIV infection. Outcome remains bleak but is
   similar to outcome of HIV-negative patients. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {{The degradation of two organic pollutants (amoxicillin and diclofenac)
   in 0.1 mM aqueous solutions was studied by using advanced oxidation
   processes, namely ozonation, photolysis, photolytic ozonation,
   photocatalysis and photocatalytic ozonation. Diclofenac was degraded
   quickly under direct photolysis by artificial light (medium-pressure
   vapor arc, lambda(exc) > 300 nm), while amoxicillin remained very
   stable. In the presence of ozone, regardless of the type of process,
   complete degradation of both organic pollutants was observed in less
   than 20 min. Photolysis or ozonation on their own led to modest values
   of total organic carbon (TOC) removal (<6\% or 41\%, respectively in 180
   min), while for photocatalysis (no ozone present) a significant fraction
   of nonoxidizable compounds remained in the treated water (similar to
   15\% after 180 min). In the case of photolytic ozonation, the kinetics
   of TOC removal was slow.
   In contrast, a relatively fast and complete mineralization of
   amoxicillin and diclofenac (30 and 120 min, respectively) was achieved
   when applying the photocatalytic ozonation process. The absence of
   toxicity of the treated waters was confirmed by growth inhibition assays
   using two different microorganisms, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus
   aureus. Photocatalytic ozonation was also applied to an urban wastewater
   spiked with both amoxicillin and diclofenac. The parent pollutants were
   easily oxidized, but the TOC removal was only as much as 68\%, mainly
   due to the persistent presence of oxamic acid in the treated sample. The
   same treatment allowed the effective degradation of a wide group of
   micropollutants (pesticides, pharmaceuticals, hormones and an industrial
   compound) detected in non-spiked urban wastewater. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Antimicrobial susceptibility trends among gram-positive and -negative
   clinical isolates collected between 2005 and 2012 in Mexico: results
   from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND ANTIMICROBIALS}},

Abstract = {{Background: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T)
   is a global antimicrobial surveillance study of both gram-positive and
   gram-negative organisms. This report presents data on antimicrobial
   susceptibility among organisms collected in Mexico between 2005 and 2012
   as part of T.E.S.T., and compares rates between 2005-2007 and 2008-2012.
   Method: Each center in Mexico submitted at least 200 isolates per
   collection year; including 65 gram-positive isolates and 135
   gram-negative isolates. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were
   determined using Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth
   microdilution methodology and antimicrobial susceptibility was
   established using the 2013 CLSI-approved breakpoints. For tigecycline US
   Food and Drug Administration (FDA) breakpoints were applied. Isolates of
   E. coli and K. pneumoniae with a MIC for ceftriaxone of >1 mg/L were
   screened for ESBL production using the phenotypic confirmatory disk test
   according to CLSI guidelines.
   Results: The rates of some key resistant phenotypes changed during this
   study: vancomycin resistance among Enterococcus faecium decreased from
   28.6 \% in 2005-2007 to 19.1 \% in 2008-2012, while beta-lactamase
   production among Haemophilus influenzae decreased from 37.6 to 18.9 \%.
   Conversely, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus increased from
   38.1 to 47.9 \%, meropenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. increased from
   17.7 to 33.0 \% and multidrugresistant Acinetobacter spp. increased from
   25.6 to 49.7 \%. The prevalence of other resistant pathogens was stable
   over the study period, including extended-spectrum
   beta-lactamase-positive Escherichia coli (39.0 \%) and Klebsiella
   pneumoniae (25.0 \%). The activity of tigecycline was maintained across
   the study years with MIC(90)s of <= 2 mg/L against Enterococcus spp., S.
   aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter
   spp., E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens,
   H. influenzae, and Acinetobacter spp. All gram-positive organisms were
   susceptible to tigecycline and susceptibility among gram-negatives
   ranged from 95.0 \% for K. pneumoniae to 99.7 \% for E. coli.
   Conclusion: Antimicrobial resistance continues to be high in Mexico.
   Tigecycline was active against gram-positive and gram-negative
   organisms, including resistant phenotypes, collected during the study.}},

Abstract = {{Using density functional theory, amorphous Nb0.27Ru0.06O0.56N0.10 was

   ductile behavior is expected. To verify these predictions, the transport
   and mechanical properties of amorphous thin films were evaluated.
   Metallic electrical resistivity and the Seebeck coefficient of -94 mu V
   K-1 are obtained, which is consistent with our predictions. As there is
   no crack formation, these samples can be perceived as ductile. We
   demonstrate that the power factor can be increased by an order of

Title = {{Models for projecting supply and demand for nurses in Israel}},
Journal = {{ISRAEL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Concern is growing over serious shortages in the nursing
   workforce and imbalance between supply and demand. Projections indicate
   that the demand for the nursing workforce will increase due to the aging
   population and an increase of the percentage of elderly people requiring
   assistance.
   Study goals: To examine the expected balance between supply and several
   demand projections for nurses in Israel in order to contribute to
   planning the nursing workforce.
   Methods: 1. Open interviews with key figures in the healthcare and
   nursing care systems; 2. Examination of supply and demand for nurses; 3.
   Examination of the balance between supply and demand projections.
   Main findings: A considerable gap was found between the supply and
   demand projections for registered nurses, which will increase over time
   according to each of the demand projection models up to 2030. All of the
   models indicate that the projected shortage will be significantly
   affected by the age at which the nurses retire. Models based on a fixed
   ratio of nurses or infrastructure (beds, positions) per population show
   a particularly great gap between demand and supply. However, a more
   conservative model (based on hospital utilization), that takes the
   system's infrastructures and limitations, as well as the growing
   population and changes in its composition into account, without an
   increase in the direct ratio of the number of nurses, also predict a
   significant shortage of nurses within 20 years.
   Conclusions: The gaps between the demand and supply projections indicate
   the need to augment the workforce in addition to the steps currently
   taken to recruit nursing staff and increase the number of training
   institutions for nurses. The relatively simple supply prediction models,
   which are based on available sources of information that can be easily
   revised, will make it possible to monitor and update projections
   regularly over time. The models developed in this study should help the
   process of long-term strategic planning for the number of nurses in
   Israel.}},

Abstract = {{Background. We evaluated the immunogenicity of trivalent inactivated
   influenza vaccine (IIV3) in pregnant women with and those without human
   immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the persistence of
   hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies in mothers and infants.
   Methods. Antibodies were measured before vaccination, 1 month after
   vaccination, at delivery, and at postpartum week 24 in mothers and
   within 1 week of birth and at 8, 16, and 24 weeks of age in infants.
   Results. We enrolled 98 HIV-uninfected and 100 HIV-infected pregnant
   women, including 93\% with a CD4(+) T-cell count of <= 200 cells/mu L.
   Compared with HIV-uninfected women, HIV-infected women had lower
   seroconversion rates (ranging from 63\%-92\% vs 36\%-40\%), lower
   antibody titers through postpartum week 24, and overlapping antibody
   half-lives (ranging from 106-121 vs 87-153 days). Infant titers were
   lower than the maternal titers within 1 week of delivery, regardless of
   vaccine strain and HIV exposure status. Compared with HIV-unexposed
   infants, HIV-exposed infants had a similar transplacental influenza
   virus antibody transfer ratio, lower titers, and a lower frequency of
   titers >= 1:40 (ranging from 82\%-95\% vs 43\%-79\%) at birth and higher
   antibody half-lives (ranging from 43-45 vs 56-65 days).
   Conclusions. Compared with HIV-uninfected pregnant women, HIV-infected
   pregnant women had lower antibody responses and persistence. Compared
   with HIV-unexposed infants, HIV-exposed infants had lower antibody
   levels at birth but similar antibody levels after 8 weeks of life. Early
   IIV3 administration during pregnancy did not decrease antibody titers
   among infants at birth.}},

Abstract = {{The depositional palaeoenvironment of the Neogene Achlada lignite
   deposit (western Makedonia, Greece) was deciphered with respect to the
   evaluation of the macro-petrographic characteristics, and the data
   resulted from coal petrographic analyses.
   The total thickness of the studied lignite seam is similar to 26 m and
   consists of organic and inorganic alternations. The macro-petrographic
   observations suggest extremely high contributions of woody-originated
   tissue (xylite) from a single tree type, among the lignite layers,
   whereas, numerous in situ stems and trunks were observed. The results of
   the coal petrographic analysis indicate the dominance of huminite (883
   vol.\%), whereas liptinite and inertinite show much lower values (11.0
   vol.\% and 0.7 vol.\% respectively). High contribution of mineral matter
   is also observed in many cases. Ulminite types A and B are the most
   abundant macerals, whereas the content of ulminite B is followed by the
   xylite content. Facies modeling using maceral composition and maceral
   indices suggested the alternation of forest swamp and reed-moor
   environments where peat accumulated under highly-saturated and
   intensely-anoxic conditions. A terrestrial origin with wet forest to
   piedmont plain depositional conditions was suggested by the Gelification
   Index (GI) and Tissue Preservation Index (TPI) plot. A cross-plot of the
   ground water index (GWI) vs. the vegetation index (VI) suggested swamps
   under mesotrophic and rheotrophic hydrogeological conditions, where the
   dominant source for the peat was woody vegetation and vegetation high in
   preservation potential.
   The overall macro and micro characteristics of the Achlada lignite
   suggest a depositional palaeoenvironment that includes three independent
   parts: a) the main channel of a meandering river system; b) the
   floodplain area; and c) the oxbow lake. The establishment of
   telmatic/limnotelmatic conditions in this palaeoenvironment resulted in
   the formation of the entire Achlada lignite deposit, whereas numerous
   flood episodes interrupted the peat accumulation and resulted in the
   deposition of clay-rich sediments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   observed which loses its periodicity at sufficiently high strengths of

   in Rayleigh-Benard (RB) cells. Opposing to that more generic case, the
   remaining amplitude of the temperature fluctuations stays significantly
   higher. Le., the suppression of the fluctuations, which are detrimental
   to the growth of a mono-crystal, is weaker in the model under

Abstract = {{In this work, crumpled reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanostructures were
   produced using spray pyrolysis technique. Graphite oxide (GtO) prepared
   through a modified Hummers method was used as starting material. Water
   dispersions of graphene oxide (GO) were prepared and sprayed in a tube
   furnace at 300 degrees C, 500 degrees C and 700 degrees C using Argon
   (Ar) as carrier gas. Also, precursor dispersions with different AgNO3
   concentrations were processed at the same conditions. During the
   treatment, the sprayed droplets underwent rapid heating and then gradual
   cooling until the exit of the oven, where crumpled rGO and Ag/rGO
   powders were collected. The prepared materials were characterized by
   X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman and FT-IR spectroscopy. It
   was established that the crumpling of the nanosheets was slightly
   affected by the increase of the process temperature. Crumpled
   morphologies were obtained even at low temperature of 300 degrees C. In
   contrast, the degree of GO reduction was temperature dependent and
   increased with the increase of the temperature. The incorporation of Ag
   nanoparticles was evidenced by the XRD and TEM analysis with the size of
   the Ag nanoparticles to grow as the concentration of AgNO3 and/or the
   process temperature increased. SERS effect in the Raman spectra of the
   Ag/rGO materials was observed that reached a maximum at 500 degrees C.
   Spray pyrolysis was suggested as a simple, controllable and scalable
   route for the instantaneous crumpling, reduction and decoration of GO
   nanosheets with metal/metal oxide nanoparticles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{460}},
Pages = {{173-180}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Quantum dots (QDs) can be used for a wide range of practical
   applications including solar energy conversion, light-emitting display,
   bio-imaging, and sensing. However, toxic heavy metal elements of Pb- and
   Cd-based QDs cause potential environmental problems and limit their wide
   applicability. To overcome this limitation, CuInS2 (CIS) QDs, which have
   a bulk bandgap energy of 1.5 eV and relatively high absorptivity, can be
   a good alternative. However the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY)
   of CIS QDs is too low for practical applications. Here we investigate
   the effects of experimental factors in the solution synthesis of CIS/ZnS
   QDs on intrinsic defects and surface defects from photoluminescence (PL)
   analysis. A heating-up method is used with dodecanethiol as a sulfur
   source, a ligand, and a medium. The Cu-to-In feeding ratio is changed to
   control the PL spectrum in the range of visible to near infrared (NIR)
   frequencies. The PLQY is increased above 40\% in all of the ranges
   through ZnS shell passivation and additional process optimization (e.g.,
   controlled cooling rate and additional feeding of In3+ ion precursor).
   This work demonstrates the role of intrinsic defects in PL and the
   importance of suppressing the formation of the surface defects to
   increase the PLQY. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the effect of contralateral electrographic
   involvement on memory performance (measured by neuropsychological and
   Wada memory testing) in patients with epilepsy associated with
   unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS).
   Methods: We studied 51 patients with medically-refractory epilepsy
   associated with unilateral MTS (27 women, 30/51, left MTS) submitted to
   prolonged non-invasive video-EEG monitoring and bilateral Wada testing.
   According to ictal electrographic involvement, patients were classified
   as: Contralateral ictal involvement, when one or more seizures evolved
   with rhythmic activity in the temporal region contralateral to the MTS
   or exclusive ipsilateral ictal involvement if all seizures showed ictal
   EEG activity exclusively on the MTS side. Wada testing involved a
   twelve-item memory paradigm. Wada memory asymmetry score was calculated
   for each patient subtracting the number of recalled items after
   injection on the lesion side from the number of recalled items after
   contralateral injection. Expected asymmetry (EA) was considered if Wade
   memory asymmetry > 0, and Symmetrical or Reversed memory asymmetry
   (S-RA) when <= 0. Neuropsychological testing was applied in the 51
   patients and in 40 healthy controls. Verbal Memory was evaluated with
   the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), considering the number of
   recalled items on immediate recall after the initial five consecutive
   encoding trials (RAVLT 6), a post-interference delayed (30 min) recall
   (RAVLT 7), and recall after 7 days. Nonverbal memory was tested with
   Wechsler Memory Scale-III (WMS-III) Faces subtests 1 e 2.
   Results: Groups did not differ in demographic, clinical and video-EEG
   monitoring variables. S-RA was observed more frequently in the group
   with contralateral ictal involvement (57.2\% vs. 27.0\%; p: 0.03).
   Logistic regression analysis considering demographic, clinical,
   hippocampal volume and video-EEG monitoring variables showed
   contralateral ictal involvement as the only independent variable
   associated with S-RA (coefficient = 1.32, p = 0.029, odds ratio 3.77;
   95\% CI 1.1-12.47). Additionally, the patient group with contralateral
   ictal EEG involvement displayed worse verbal and nonverbal memory scores
   compared to healthy controls.
   Conclusion: In this cohort of unilateral MTS patients, contralateral
   ictal involvement was associated with decreased memory performance on
   Wada and on neuropsychological testing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Volume = {{87}},

Abstract = {{Photocatalytic degradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) using TiO2
   as a catalyst and UVA as a light source was examined under various
   experimental settings with different TiO2 doses, solution pH, and the
   light intensities. The changes in UV absorbance and fluorescence with
   the irradiation time followed a pseudo-first order model much better
   than those of dissolved organic carbon. In general, the degradation
   rates were increased by higher TiO(2)doses and light intensities.
   However, the exact photocatalytic responses of DOM to the irradiation
   were affected by many other factors such as aggregation of TiO2, light
   scattering, hydroxyl radicals produced, and DOM sorption on TiO2.
   Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) coupled with parallel
   factor analysis (PARAFAC) revealed that the DOM changes in fluorescence
   could be described by the combinations of four dissimilar components
   including one protein-like, two humic-like, and one terrestrial
   humic-like components, each of which followed well the pseudo-first
   order model. The photocatalytic degradation rates were higher for
   protein-like versus humic-like component, whereas the opposite order was
   displayed for the degradation rates in the absence of TiO2, suggesting
   different dominant mechanisms operating between the systems with and
   without TiO2. Our results based on EEM-PARAFAC provided new insights
   into the underlying mechanisms associated with the photocatalytic
   degradation of DOM as well as the potential environmental impact of the
   treated water. This study demonstrated a successful application of
   EEM-PARAFAC for photocatalytic systems via directly comparing the
   kinetic rates of the individual DOM components with different
   compositions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a frequent anxiety
   disorder with higher prevalence rates infemale patients than in male
   patients (2.5: 1). Association with a single nucleotide polymorphism
   (rs2267735) in the gene ADCYAP1R1 encoding the type I receptor (PAC1-R)
   of the pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide has been
   reported with PTSD in female patients. We sought to identify the neural
   correlates of the described PAC1-R effects on associative learning.
   METHODS: In a reverse genetic approach, we examined two independent
   healthy samples (N-1 = 112, N-2 = 73) using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging during cued and contextual fear conditioning. Skin
   conductance responses and verbal self-reports of arousal, valence, and
   contingency were recorded.
   RESULTS: We found that PAC1-R modulates the blood oxygenation
   level-dependent response of the hippocampus. Specifically, we observed
   decreased hippocampal activity during contextual, but not during cued,
   fear conditioning in female participants carrying the PAC1-R risk
   allele. We observed no significant differences in conditionability for
   skin conductance responses, verbal reports, or activation in other brain
   regions between the genotype groups in female participants.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that impaired contextual conditioning
   in the hippocampal formation may mediate the association between PAC1-R
   and PTSD symptoms. Our findings potentially identify a missing link
   between the involvement of PAC1-R in PTSD and the well-established
   structural and functional hippocampal deficits in these patients.}},

Abstract = {{Two-phase cooling systems (e.g., pump-loops, vapor compression cycles)
   present a promising approach to the cooling of modern high power
   electronic systems. Such systems can achieve high coefficient of heat
   transfer but may incur dangerously high temperature when the imposed
   heat flux exceeds the critical heat flux (CHF). This paper presents a
   new control strategy that provides robust CHF avoidance in two-phase
   cooling for multiple evaporators under dynamic heat loads. This approach
   operates near the CHF to allow reduced coolant flow rates and greater
   system efficiency compared with the typical, and more conservative,
   open-loop or worst-case control strategies. The control architecture
   consists of two loops: an outer loop to determine evaporator mass flow
   rate demand, and an inner loop to supply and distribute the coolant
   using system actuators. Each control loop is implemented with
   feedforward based on static models as well as proportional integral (PI)
   feedback controllers, and the decentralized approach allows scalable
   control design without the need for high fidelity nonlinear dynamic
   models. Simulations and corresponding experimental controller
   validations were conducted using a three-evaporator vapor compression
   cycle (VCC) testbed with transient imposed heat flux. The full
   closed-loop system is shown to be able to operate near CHF while
   avoiding CHF under transient heat flux, demonstrating both efficiency
   and robustness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) is a virtually ubiquitous, but
   poorly defined, disorder of the small intestine among people living in
   conditions of poverty, which begins early in infancy and persists. EED
   is characterized by altered gut structure and function, leading to
   reduced absorptive surface area and impaired intestinal barrier
   function. It is hypothesized that recurrent exposure to fecal pathogens
   and changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota initiate
   this process, which leads to a self-perpetuating cycle of pathology. We
   view EED as a primary gut disorder that drives chronic systemic
   inflammation, leading to growth hormone resistance and impaired linear
   growth. There is currently no accepted case definition or gold-standard
   biomarker of EED, making field studies challenging. The Sanitation
   Hygiene Infant Nutrition Efficacy (SHINE) trial in Zimbabwe is
   evaluating the independent and combined effects of a package of infant
   feeding and/or water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions on stunting
   and anemia. SHINE therefore provides an opportunity to longitudinally
   evaluate EED in a well-characterized cohort of infants, using a panel of
   biomarkers along the hypothesized causal pathway. Our aims are to
   describe the evolution of EED during infancy, ascertain its contribution
   to stunting, and investigate the impact of the randomized interventions
   on the EED pathway. In this article, we describe current concepts of
   EED, challenges in defining the condition, and our approach to
   evaluating EED in the SHINE trial.}},

Abstract = {{Anaerobic membrane bioreactors (AnMBRs) enable energy recovery from
   wastewater while simultaneously achieving high levels of treatment. The
   objective of this study was to elucidate how detailed design and
   operational decisions of submerged AnMBRs influence the technological,
   environmental, and economic sustainability of the system across its life
   cycle. Specific design and operational decisions evaluated included:
   solids retention time (SRT), mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS)
   concentration, sludge recycling ratio (r), flux (J), and specific gas
   demand per membrane area (SGD). The possibility of methane recovery
   (both as biogas and as soluble methane in reactor effluent) and
   bioenergy production, nutrient recovery, and final destination of the
   sludge (land application, landfill, or incineration) were also
   evaluated. The implications of these design and operational decisions
   were characterized by leveraging a quantitative sustainable design (QSD)
   framework which integrated steady-state performance modeling across
   seasonal temperatures (using pilot-scale experimental data and the
   simulating software DESASS), life cycle cost (LCC) analysis, and life
   cycle assessment (LCA). Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses were used
   to characterize the relative importance of individual design decisions,
   and to navigate trade-offs across environmental, economic, and
   technological criteria. Based on this analysis, there are design and
   operational conditions under which submerged AnMBRs could be net energy
   positive and contribute to the pursuit of carbon negative wastewater
   treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Forty-eight sediment samples collected in the Upper Gulf of Thailand
   (UGOT) and its nearby rivers including the Mae Klong, Tha Chin, Chao
   Phraya, and Bang Pakong were analyzed for grain size, heavy metals (Cu,
   Pb, Zn, Cr, and Cd), and clay minerals. The results reveal that
   fine-grained sediments with Mz < 30 mu m concentrate in the northern
   coastal area and coarse-grained fractions increase in a seaward
   direction. The grain size of the sediments mainly controls heavy metal
   concentrations. The concentrations of Cu, Pb, Zn, and Cr are higher in
   the northern part of UGOT, with ranges above 20, 23, 45, and 50 mg
   kg(-1), than in other sampling areas. Meanwhile, Cd content is greater
   than 120 mu g kg-(1) in sediments near the Bang Pakong River mouth and
   area between the Tha Chin and Mae Klong rivers mouth. The concentrations
   of heavy metals are higher than background data, and statistical
   analysis of geo-accumulation index indicates that the study area is
   either unpolluted to moderately polluted or moderately polluted by heavy
   metals. Our results also verify that illite is the dominant clay
   mineral, followed by kaolinite, chlorite, and smectite in terms of
   semi-quantitative content. Smectite/kaolinite can be used as an
   indicator to trace the riverine sediment in the study area, which
   present a counterclockwise dispersion pattern of sediment from the Chao
   Phraya River. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Expression of artemisinin biosynthesis genes in eight Artemisia species

Pages = {{836-843}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the researchers have chosen eight species of Artemisia in
   order to find out their artemisinin content and also the expression
   levels of eight genes involved in the artemisinin biosynthetic pathway
   at three different developmental stages, i.e., vegetative, budding and
   flowering stages. Artemisinin was produced in all the species, albeit in
   various amounts (0.45-5.3 mg/g DW). In four species (Artemisia
   absinthium, Artemisia diffusa, Artemisia sieberi and Artemisia
   spicigeria), maximum level of artemisinin production was observed at the
   flowering stage, while in the other three species (Artemisia annua,
   Artemisia campestris and Artemisia vulgaris) artemisinin production
   reached its maximum level at the budding stage. However, Artemisia
   scoparia is the only species showing highest artemisinin content at the
   vegetative stage that was correlated with high density of glandular
   trichomes in leaf tissue. The higher amount of artemisinin, produced in
   A. annua, was mainly a result of higher expression of the
   amorpha-4,11-diene synthase (ADS) and artemisinic aldehyde Delta 11(13)
   reductase (DBR2) genes. While, for A absinthium an increased expression
   of alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) gene along with decreased expression
   of dihydroartemisinic aldehyde reductase (RED1) gene resulted in a
   desirable increase in artemisinin yield. The results of the study
   indicate that there is a relationship between increased expression of
   some genes and enhancement of artemisinin content. However, in order to
   validate the relationship, further enzymatic analysis needs to be
   performed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{High-field response of gated graphene at terahertz frequencies}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{We study the Fermi energy level dependence of the nonlinear terahertz
   (THz) transmission of gated multilayer and single-layer graphene
   transferred onto sapphire and quartz substrates. The two samples
   represent two limits of low-field impurity scattering: short-range
   neutral and long-range charged impurity scattering, respectively. We
   observe an increase in the transmission as the field amplitude is
   increased due to intraband absorption bleaching starting at THz fields
   above 8 kV/cm. This effect arises from a field-induced reduction in THz
   conductivity that depends strongly on the Fermi energy. We account for
   intraband absorption using a free carrier Drude model that includes
   neutral and charged impurity scattering as well as optical phonon
   scattering. We find that although the Fermi-level dependence in the
   monolayer and five-layer samples is quite different due to the dominance
   of long- and short-range momentum scattering, respectively, both exhibit
   a strong dependence on the field amplitude that cannot be explained on
   the basis of an increase in the lattice temperature alone. Our results
   provide a deeper understanding of transport in graphene devices
   operating at THz frequencies and in modest kV/cm field strengths where
   nonlinearities exist.}},

   The special amorphous/amorphous structure exhibited large plasticity.
   The plastic strain is 10.6\% for the coated pillars with a coating
   thickness of 86.5 mu m, which is 5.9 times of 1.8\% of the bare Vit.1
   pillars. The amorphous Ni-P films provide high radial confinement
   stress, which leads to more homogeneous formation of a high density of
   smaller shear bands at the Ni-P/Vit.1 interface. The technique provides
   an effective way to enhance the plasticity without obvious sacrifice of

   Further investigation with different amounts of metallic nanorods shows

Title = {{Significance of structure-soil-structure interaction for closely spaced
   structures}},
Journal = {{NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{295}},
Pages = {{680-687}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Nuclear facilities typically consist of many closely spaced structures
   with different sizes and depths of embedment. Seismic response of each
   structure could be influenced by dynamic structure soil structure
   interaction (SSSI) behavior of adjacent closely spaced structures. This
   paper examines the impact of SSSI on the in-structure response spectra
   (ISRS) and peak accelerations of a light structure adjacent to a heavy
   structure and of a heavy structure adjacent to a similar heavy structure
   for several soil cases, foundation embedment depths, and separation
   distances. The impacts of a heavy surface or embedded structure on
   adjacent ground motions were studied. The analyses demonstrated the
   adjacent ground motions are sensitive to foundation embedment, soil
   profile, response frequency, and distance from the structure. Seismic
   responses of a light structure located near a heavy structure are
   calculated either by modeling both structures subjected to free field
   motions, or performing a cascade analysis by considering the light
   structure model subjected to modified ground motions due to the heavy
   structure. Cascade SSSI analyses are shown to adequately account for the
   effect of the heavy structure on the light structure without explicitly
   modeling both structures together in a single analysis. To further study
   the influence of SSSI behavior, this paper examines dynamic response of
   two adjacent heavy structures and compares this response to response of
   a single heavy structure neglecting adjacent structures. The SSSI
   responses of the two heavy structures are evaluated for varying soil
   conditions and structure separation distances using three-dimensional
   linear SSI analyses and considering anti-symmetry boundary conditions.
   The analyses demonstrate that the SSSI response of a light or a heavy
   structure can be influenced by the presence of a nearby heavy structure.
   Although this study considers linear analysis methodology, the
   conclusion of SSSI influences on dynamic behavior is similar to that
   reported in nonlinear experimental SSSI studies (Trombetta et al.,
   2012). (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   2006-2011 United States Nationwide Emergency Department Sample were
   included in these analyses. Outcomes assessed include triage to
   non-trauma centers (NTC), which is referred to as under-triage, and ED
   mortality. Of 117,444 adults with TSCI, 33.4\% were under-triaged to
   NTC. Under-triage was more prevalent with increasing age. Among patients
   under-triaged to NTC, 37.4\% had new injury severity score (NISS) >15,
   representing severe injuries or polytrauma. Among patients with NISS
   >15, the odds of ED mortality in NTC were four-fold greater compared to
   level I trauma centers (TC-I) (adjusted odds ratio {[}AOR]=4.06; 95\%
   confidence interval=1.87-8.79; p<0.001). In conclusion, under-triage of
   adults with acute TSCI occurred in at least one-third of the cases.
   Patients triaged to NTC rather than TC-I experienced higher likelihood
   of death in the ED even after controlling for personal and injury
   characteristics. Further research is necessary to elucidate detailed
   clinical and logistical factors that may be associated with under-triage
   of acute TSCI, to facilitate interventions aimed at improving patient
   experience and outcomes.}},

Title = {{An improved human anxiety process biomarker: characterization of
   frequency band, personality and pharmacology}},
Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental illness in the
   western world with a major impact on disability. But their diagnosis has
   lacked objective biomarkers. We previously demonstrated a human anxiety
   process biomarker, goal-conflict-specific electroencephalography (EEG)
   rhythmicity (GCSR) in the stop-signal task (SST). Here we have developed
   and characterized an improved test appropriate for clinical group
   testing. We modified the SST to produce balanced numbers of trials in
   clearly separated stop-signal delay groups. As previously, right frontal
   (F8) GCSR was extracted as the difference in EEG log Fourier power
   between matching stop and go trials (that is, stop-signal-specific
   power) of a quadratic contrast of the three delay values (that is, power
   when stopping and going are in balanced conflict compared with the
   average of when stopping or going is greater). Separate experiments
   assessed drug sensitivity (n = 34) and personality relations (n = 59).
   GCSR in this new SST was reduced by three chemically distinct anxiolytic
   drugs (administered double-blind): buspirone (10 mg), triazolam (0.25
   mg) and pregabalin (75 mg); had a frequency range (4-12 Hz) consistent
   with rodent model data; and positively correlated significantly with
   neuroticism and nonsignificantly with trait anxiety scores. GCSR,
   measured in our new form of the SST, should be suitable as a biomarker
   for one specific anxiety process in the testing of clinical groups and
   novel drugs and in the development of measures suitable for individual
   diagnosis.}},

Title = {{Biochemical and biophysical characterization of maize-derived HBsAg for
   the development of an oral vaccine}},

Abstract = {{Although a vaccine against hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been available
   since 1982, it is estimated that 600,000 people die every year due to
   HBV. An affordable oral vaccine could help alleviate the disease burden
   and to this end the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was expressed in
   maize. Orally delivered maize material induced the strongest immune
   response in mice when lipid was extracted by CO2 supercritical fluid
   extraction (SFE), compared to full fat and hexane-extracted material.
   The present study provides a biochemical and biophysical basis for these
   immunological differences by comparing the active ingredient in the
   differently treated maize material. Purified maize-derived HBsAg
   underwent biophysical characterization by gel filtration, transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS). UV-CD, and
   fluorescence. Gel filtration showed that HBsAg forms higher-order
   oligomers and TEM demonstrated virus-like particle (VLP) formation. The
   VLPs obtained from SFE were more regular in shape and size compared to
   hexane or full fat material. In addition, SFE-derived HBsAg showed the
   greatest extent of cc-helical structure by far UV-CD spectrum.
   Fluorescence experiments also revealed differences in protein
   conformation. This work establishes SFE-treated maize material as a
   viable oral vaccine candidate and advances the development of the first
   oral subunit vaccine. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A sensitive and stable electroless-plated gold film for the preparation
   of an optical fiber surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor is presented
   in this work, together with a facile antibody immobilization method.
   Gold nanoparticles were uniformly adsorbed onto the surface of an
   optical fiber forming a film with a thickness of approximately 563 nm.
   The sensor had a high sensitivity with 2054 nm/RIU and 3980 nm/RIU in
   the refractive index ranges of 1.333-1.359 and 1.359-1386, respectively.
   An SPR biosensor was developed based on polydopamine-modified gold film
   (PDA-Au), which was fabricated by a simple and quick spontaneous
   polymerization of dopamine (DA) on the gold film. When goat anti-human
   IgG antibodies were immobilized, the FDA-Au surface had a larger
   resonant wavelength shift of 66.21 nm compared with the traditional
   11-mercaptoundecanoic acid-modified gold film (MUA-Au) surface. In
   addition, the PDA-Au surface enabled the sensitive and selective
   determination of human IgG down to a concentration of 2 mu g mL(-1) with
   a high sensitivity of 0.41 nm per mu g mL(-1). The FDA-Au surface
   exhibited an approximately four fold higher sensitivity and an about
   seven fold lower LOD than the MUA-Au surface to human IgG. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{We have developed a tractable numerical method in which large-amplitude
   quantum lattice fluctuations can be described beyond the adiabatic
   approximation using the coherent state representation of phonons. A
   many-body wave function is constructed by the superposition of direct
   products of non-orthogonal Slater determinants for electrons and
   coherent states of phonons. Both orbitals in all the Slater determinants
   and the amplitudes of all the coherent states are simultaneously
   optimized. We apply the method to the one-dimensional
   Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with the on-site and nearest-neighbor-site
   Coulomb interactions. It is shown the lattice fluctuations in doped
   charge density wave (CDW) systems are described by the translational and
   vibrational motion of lattice solitons. Such lattice solitons induce
   bond alternation in the doped CDW system while the lattice becomes
   equidistant in the half-filled CDW system.}},

Abstract = {{Eichhornia crassipes is an invasive plant whose individual morphological
   parts (roots, stalks, leaves, flowers) were studied for the first time
   in terms of polar and lipophilic extractives. The former attained yields
   between 10.0\% (wt.), for roots, and 28.84\% (wt.), for stalks.
   Concerning lipophilic extracts, 29 compounds were identified by GC MS
   and yields ranged from 1.12\% (wt.) for roots to 4.45\% (wt.).for
   flowers. Among these compounds, stigmasterol obtained from stalks and
   leaves exhibited values up to 4437 mg kg(biomass)(-1) and concentrations
   up to 15.15 wt.\%, placing E. crassipes as one of the richest vegetal
   sources for this molecule. Moreover, polar extracts from leaves
   exhibited very strong antioxidant activity as well as the highest
   concentration in phenolics, rendering leaves the major provision of this
   family of compounds within the studied morphological parts. In the
   whole, this study suggests that leaves and stalks of E. crassipes are a
   noteworthy source of stigmasterol and antioxidant extracts, which may
   open the way for the valorization of this fast growing invasive species.

Abstract = {{Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is linked to the
   pathophysiology of depression. We hypothesized that BDNF is one of the
   neurobiological pathways related to the augmentation effect of
   alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) when associated with antidepressants. Female
   mice were administered vehicle or CORT 20 mg/kg during 14 days. From the
   15th to 21st days the animals were divided in groups that were further
   administered: vehicle, desvenlafaxine (DVS) 10 or 20 mg/kg, ALA 100 or
   200 mg/kg or the combinations of DVS10+ALA100, DVS20+ALA100,
   DVS10+ALA200 or DVS20+ALA200. ALA or DVS alone or in combination
   reversed CORT-induced increase in immobility time in the forced swimming
   test and decrease in sucrose preference, presenting, thus, an
   antidepressant-like effect. DVS10 alone reversed CORT-induced decrease
   in BDNF in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus (HC) and striatum
   (ST). The same was observed in the HC and ST of ALA200 treated animals.
   The combination of DVS and ALA200 reversed CORT-induced alterations in
   BDNF and even, in some cases, increased the levels of this neurotrophin
   when compared to vehicle-treated animals in HC and ST. Taken together,
   these results suggest that the combination of the DVS+ALA may be
   valuable for treating conditions in which BDNF levels are decreased,
   such as depression. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A bioelectronic nose for the real-time assessment of water quality was
   constructed with human olfactory receptor (hOR) and single-walled carbon
   nanotube field-effect transistor (swCNT-FET). Geosmin (GSM) and
   2-methylisoborneol (MIB), mainly produced by bacteria, are
   representative odor compounds and also indicators of contamination in
   the water supply system. For the screening of hORs which respond to
   these compounds, we performed CRE-luciferase assays of the two odorants
   in heterologous cell system. Human OR51S1 for GSM and OR3A4 for MIB were
   selected, and nanovesicles expressing the hORs on surface were produced
   from HEK-293 cell. Carbon nanotube field-effect transistor was
   functionalized with the nanovesicles. The bioelectronic nose was able to
   selectively detect GSM and MIB at concentrations as low as a 10 ng L-1.
   Furthermore, detection of these compounds from the real samples such as
   tap water, bottled water and river water was available without any
   pretreatment processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of CDC light traps for mosquito surveillance in a malaria
   endemic area on the Thai-Myanmar border}},
Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention miniature light
   traps (CDC-LT) baited with CO2 are a routine tool for adult mosquito
   sampling used in entomological surveys, and for monitoring and
   surveillance of disease vectors. The present study was aimed at
   evaluating the performance of baited and unbaited CDC-LT for indoor and
   outdoor trapping of endemic mosquito species in northwestern Thailand.
   Methods: CDC-LT (n = 112) with and without dry ice baits were set both
   indoors and outdoors in 88 selected houses for stretches of 5
   consecutive nights per month in 7 villages in Tha Song Yang district,
   Tak province between January 2011 and March 2013. Individual traps were
   repeatedly placed in the same location for a median of 6 (range 1-10)
   times. Mosquitoes were identified by morphological characteristics and
   classified into blood-fed, empty, male/female and gravid. Absolute
   mosquito numbers were converted to capture rates (i.e., mosquitoes per
   trap and year). Capture rates were compared using multilevel negative
   binomial regression to account for multiple trap placements and adjust
   for regional and seasonal differences.
   Results: A total of 6,668 mosquitoes from 9 genera were collected from
   576 individual CDC-LT placements. Culex was the predominant captured
   genus (46 \%), followed by anopheline mosquitoes (45 \%). Overall, CO2
   baited traps captured significantly more Culex (especially Culex vishnui
   Theobald) and Anopheles mosquitoes per unit time (adjusted capture rate
   ratio (aCRR) 1.64 and 1.38, respectively). Armigeres spp. mosquitoes
   were trapped in outdoor traps with significantly higher frequency (aCRR:
   1.50), whereas Aedes albopictus (Skuse) had a tendency to be trapped
   more frequently indoors (aCRR: 1.89, p = 0.07). Furthermore, capture
   rate ratios between CO2 baited and non-baited CDC-LT were significantly
   influenced by seasonality and indoor vs. outdoor trap placement.
   Conclusion: The present study shows that CDC-LT with CO2 baiting capture
   significantly more Culex and Anopheles mosquitoes, some of which (e.g.,
   Cx. vishnui, Cx. quinquefasciatus Say, An. minimus s.l. Theobald, An.
   maculatus s.l. Theobald) represent important disease vectors in
   Thailand. This study also shows significant differences in the capture
   efficiency of CDC-LT when placed indoors or outdoors and in different
   seasons. Our study thus provides important guidelines for more targeted
   future vector trapping studies on the Thai-Myanmar border, which is an
   important cross-border malaria transmission region in Thailand.}},

   selection by Dicer}},
Journal = {{NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The ribonuclease Dicer excises mature miRNAs from a diverse group of
   precursors (pre-miRNAs), most of which contain various secondary
   structure motifs in their hairpin stem. In this study, we analyzed Dicer
   cleavage in hairpin substrates deprived of such motifs. We searched for
   the factors other than the secondary structure, which may influence the
   length diversity and heterogeneity of miRNAs. We found that the
   nucleotide sequence at the Dicer cleavage site influences both of these
   miRNA characteristics. With regard to cleavage mechanism, we demonstrate
   that the Dicer RNase IIIA domain that cleaves within the 3' arm of the
   pre-miRNA is more sensitive to the nucleotide sequence of its substrate
   than is the RNase IIIB domain. The RNase IIIA domain avoids releasing
   miRNAs with G nucleotide and prefers to generate miRNAs with a U
   nucleotide at the 5' end. We also propose that the sequence restrictions
   at the Dicer cleavage site might be the factor that contributes to the
   generation of miRNA duplexes with 3' overhangs of atypical lengths. This
   finding implies that the two RNase III domains forming the single
   processing center of Dicer may exhibit some degree of flexibility, which
   allows for the formation of these non-standard 3' overhangs.}},

Journal = {{GENE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{574}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The MTT assay (to a less degree MTS, XTT or WST) is a widely exploited
   approach for measuring cell viability/drug cytotoxicity. MTT reduction
   occurs throughout a cell and can be significantly affected by a number
   of factors, including metabolic and energy perturbations, changes in the
   activity of oxidoreductases, endo-/exocytosis and intracellular
   trafficking. Over/underestimation of cell viability by the MTT assay may
   be due to both adaptive metabolic and mitochondrial reprogramming of
   cells subjected to drug treatment-mediated stress and inhibitor
   off-target effects. Previously, imatinib, rottlerin, ursolic acid,
   verapamil, resveratrol, genistein nanoparticles and some polypeptides
   were shown to interfere with MTT reduction rate resulting in
   inconsistent results between the MTT assay and alternative assays. Here,
   to test the under/overestimation of viability by the MTT assay, we
   compared results derived from the MTT assay with the trypan blue
   exclusion assay after treatment of glioblastoma U251, T98G and C6 cells
   with three widely used inhibitors with the known direct and side effects
   on energy and metabolic homeostasis temozolomide (TMZ), a
   DNA-methylating agent, temsirolimus (TEM), an inhibitor of mTOR kinase,
   and U0126, an inhibitor of MEK1/2 kinases. Inhibitors were applied
   shortly as in IC50 evaluating studies or long as in studies focusing on
   drug resistance acquisition. We showed that over/underestimation of cell
   viability by the MTT assay and its significance depends on a cell line,
   a time point of viability measurement and other experimental parameters.
   Furthermore, we provided a comprehensive survey of factors that should
   be accounted in the MTT assay. To avoid result misinterpretation,
   supplementation of the tetrazolium salt-based assays with other
   non-metabolic assays is recommended. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Steam explosion is one of the leading and most promising biorefinery
   technologies for lignocellulosic biomass. Water as the only transfer
   medium participated in steam explosion process is closely correlated
   with refining efficacy and energy consumption, while researches on steam
   explosion are neglected from transfer mechanism. In this work, from
   water transfer perspective, steam explosion process was innovatively
   divided into four specific stages and the multi-stage mass transfer
   model of steam explosion process was firstly established. From this
   model, quantitative relation of water composition in each stage and
   final water content formula were evaluated, which is efficient to guide
   the process energy efficiency with several proposed regulation
   strategies. By combining transfer process simulation with pretreatment
   efficacy evaluation, much water in feedstock presented a buffering
   effect on reaction and transfer issues during steam explosion process,
   thereby weakening the actual severity of treatment. 40\% water content
   of cellulosic biomass was optimized from the compromise between
   treatment efficacy and energy efficiency. The yield of overall glucose
   through pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis was increased by over 20\%
   with a potential cost savings of steam consumption by simply
   coordinating water content of cellulosic biomass prior to steam
   explosion treatment. Thus, results in the work emphasize the water
   transfer and regulation during steam explosion process on understanding
   water reaction mechanism, enhancing pretreatment efficacy and saving
   energy, leading to more efficient use of biomass. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A transparent yttrium alumina garnet (YAG) ceramic was successfully
   prepared by gelcasting a mixture of Al2O3 and Y2O3 powders aided by a
   reactive sintering process. A water-soluble epoxy resin gelling system

   slurry with 75 wt\% solid loading and low viscosity was prepared. After
   casting, drying, and pre-sintering, vacuum sintering was performed at
   1720 degrees C for 6 h. Homogeneous microstructures of both pre-sintered
   and sintered bodies were obtained. The resulting YAG ceramic (60 x 50 x
   0.5 mm(3)) with an average grain size of 10 mm had an in-line
   transmittance of 83.0\% and 80.7\% at the wavelength of 1064 nm and 400

Abstract = {{Herein, a label free electrochemical aptasensor based on ordered
   mesoporous carbon-gold nano-composite modified screen printed electrode
   has been fabricated for the detection of vascular endothelial growth
   factor (VEGF(165)) as a tumor marker. The electrochemical behavior of
   prepared biosensor was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The principle of operation of
   the proposed aptasensor is based on the changes in the interfacial
   properties of the electrode due to interaction of the immobilized
   antiVEGF(165) aptamer at the electrode surface with VEGF(165) tumor
   marker in the sample solution, which results in a change in the
   interfacial charge transfer resistance as detected by electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy. The calibration curve for VEGF(165)
   determination was linear over 10.0-300.0 pg mL(-1) with a limit of
   detection (3 sigma/S) of 1.0 pg mL(-l). The prepared aptasensor
   exhibited high sensitivity and good selectivity and reproducibility. The
   aptasensor was successfully applied to the determination of VEGF(165) in

Title = {{Acceptance of interventions to promote primary care: What do physicians
   prioritize?}},
Journal = {{BMC FAMILY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Switzerland is facing a shortage of primary care physicians
   (PCPs); government organizations therefore suggested a broad variety of
   interventions to promote primary care. The aim of the study was to
   prioritize these interventions according to the acceptance and perceived
   barriers of most relevant groups of physicians in this context (hospital
   physicians and PCPs).
   Methods: The study was conducted during summer 2014. An online-based
   questionnaire assessed demographic data, working conditions and future
   plans. Participants were asked to rank the usefulness of 22
   interventions to promote primary care. Interventions to promote primary
   care that received ratings of 4 or 5 on the Likert scale (corresponding
   to ``useful{''} or ``very useful{''}) by at least 80 \% of the
   participants were categorized as interventions with very high
   acceptance. We analyzed whether the groups (PCPs, hospital physicians)
   ranked the interventions differently using the Mann-Whitney U test. We
   assumed a two tailed p < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction for multiple
   testing as statistically significant.
   Results: Two hundred thirty physicians (response rate 58.4 \%) completed
   the survey. Among those 69 PCPs and 66 hospital physicians were included
   in the analysis. Among those 14 PCPs were planning to leave clinical
   practice due to retirement, whereas only 8 hospital physicians planned a
   career as PCPs. Among PCPs the intervention with the highest acceptance
   was the increase of reimbursement, whereas family friendly measures
   achieved highest acceptance among hospital physicians. Financial support
   for primary care traineeships was considered to be very useful by both
   groups.
   Conclusions: Interventions on PCPs close to retirement or on PCPs
   considering an early retirement will not adequately prevent shortage of
   primary care providers. Governmental interventions should therefore also
   aim at encouraging hospital physicians to start a career in primary care
   by governmental support for traineeships in primary care and investments
   in family friendly measures.}},

Abstract = {{The cement sector is one of the fast growing economic sectors in
   Ethiopia. In 2010, it consumed 7 PJ of primary energy. We evaluate the
   potential for energy savings and CO2 emission reductions. We start by
   benchmarking the energy performance of 8 operating plants in 2010, and
   12 plants under construction. The benchmarldng shows that the energy
   intensity of local cement facilities is high, when compared to the
   international best practice, indicating a significant potential for
   energy efficiency improvement. The average electricity intensity and
   fuel intensity of the operating plants is 34\% and 36\% higher. For
   plants under construction, electricity use is 36\% and fuel use 27\%
   higher. We identified 26 energy efficiency measures. By constructing
   energy conservation supply curves, the energy-efficiency improvement
   potential is assessed. For the 8 operating.plants in 2010, the
   cost-effective energy savings equal 11 GWh electricity and 1.2 PJ fuel,
   resulting in 0.1 Mt CO2 emissions reduction. For the 20 cement plants
   expected to be in operation by 2020, the cost-effective energy saving
   potentials is 159 GWh for electricity and 7.2 PJ for fuel, reducing CO2
   emissions by about 0.6 Mt We discuss key barriers and recommendations to
   realize energy savings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To compare the use of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride, xylazine
   hydrochloride, and hydrogen peroxide for emesis induction in cats.
   Design-Retrospective case series. Animals-43 client-owned cats for which
   emesis induction was attempted because of known or suspected toxicant
   ingestion or recent ingestion of a string foreign body.
   Procedures-Data collected from the cats' medical records included type,
   dose, and route of administration of emetic agent; outcome of attempted
   emesis induction; time until emesis or postemesis administration of a
   reversal agent (to counter sedative effects of the emetic agent); and
   adverse events.
   Results-Emesis induction was attempted by oral administration of
   hydrogen peroxide (n = 3) or IM or IV administration of xylazine (25
   {[}including 1 cat that had already received hydrogen peroxide]) or
   dexmedetomidine (16). No cat that received hydrogen peroxide vomited.
   Emesis was induced in 11 of 25 xylazine-treated cats and in 13 of 16
   dexmedetomidine-treated cats. Dexmedetomidine was more likely to cause
   vomiting than xylazine (OR, 5.5; 95\% confidence interval, 1.1 to 36).
   The median dose of dexmedetomidine that caused emesis was 7.0 mu g/kg
   (3.2 mu g/lb; range, 0.96 to 10.0 mu g/kg {[}0.44 to 4.55 mu g/lb]). The
   elapsed time until emesis or postemesis reversal agent administration
   was recorded for 5 xylazine-treated cats (median interval, 10 minutes
   {[}range, 5 to 175 minutes]) and 10 dexmedetomidine-treated cats (median
   interval, 5 minutes {[}range, 1 to 12 minutes]). Sedation was the only
   adverse effect, occurring in 2 xylazine-treated cats and 1
   dexmedetomidine-treated cat.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results indicated that
   dexmedetomidine can be used successfully to induce emesis in cats.}},

Abstract = {{The compound BaZn2Si2O7 shows a high coefficient of thermal expansion up
   to a temperature of 280 degrees C, then a transition to a high
   temperature phase is observed. This high temperature phase exhibits
   negative thermal expansion. If Ba2+ is successively replaced by Sr2+, a
   new phase with a structure, similar to that of the high temperature
   phase of BaZn2Si2O7, forms. At the composition Ba0.8Sr0.2Zn2Si2O7, this
   new phase is completely stabilized. The crystal structure was determined
   with single crystal X-ray diffraction using the composition
   Ba0.6Sr0.4Zn2Si2O7, which crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group
   Cmcm. The negative thermal expansion is a result of motions and
   distortions inside the crystal lattice, especially inside the chains of
   ZnO4 tetrahedra. Dilatometry and high temperature X-ray powder
   diffraction were used to verify the negative thermal expansion.
   Coefficients of thermal expansion partially smaller than -10.10(-6) K-1

   bioelectrochemical system that converts cellulose into energy through
   cellulose-hydrolyzing and electrogenic activity of bacteria. In the
   paper it has been presented that Enterobacter cloacae isolated from
   termite gut exhibited both cellulose-degrading and exoelectrogenic
   activities that make it a valuable strain to be used in a cellulose-fed
   MFC. The maximum power and current densities obtained from the
   cellulose-fed MFC were 185 mW/m(2) and 2.4 A/m(2), respectively. SEM
   micrographs of the anode showed that E. cloacae formed an expanded
   fibria system bounding bacteria cells into network attached to the
   electrode surface. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although many people use the internet to diagnose mental health
   problems, little is known about the relationship between internet
   self-diagnosis and treatment-seeking. The MACSCREEN (a validated,
   self-report screening tool for anxiety and depression) was posted on our
   clinic homepage and respondents were invited to take an anxiety test.
   Three months after completing the MACSREEN and a variety of symptom
   severity scales, respondents were emailed a follow up questionnaire
   asking about treatment-seeking behaviours. Of the 770 MACSCREEN
   respondents, 103 completed the follow-up questionnaire. Of these, 100\%
   met criteria for at least one anxiety or mood disorder diagnosis and
   51\% sought treatment after completing the MACSCREEN. In the 49\% who
   did not seek treatment, fear of medication (57\%), discomfort talking to
   their doctor about anxiety (28\%) and the belief that symptoms were not
   severe enough (28\%) were cited as barriers. Compared to non-seekers,
   treatment-seekers were significantly more likely to meet screening
   criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive
   Disorder, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Depression. Higher Sheehan
   Disability Scale scores and being married (versus single) significantly
   increased the odds of treatment-seeking, suggesting that functional
   impairment and disease burden on the family may be stronger predictors
   of treatment seeking than overall severity of symptoms. (C) 2015

Title = {{Recognizing and reporting domestic violence: attitudes, experiences and
   behavior of Dutch dentists}},
Journal = {{BMC ORAL HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: On July 1st 2013 the Mandatory Reporting Code Act came into
   force in the Netherlands, making it compulsory for health professionals
   to adhere to a reporting code when they suspect patients to be victims
   of domestic violence (DV) or child abuse (CA). The Royal Dutch Dental
   Association (KNMT) developed a reporting code for dental professionals
   (RCD). Moreover, an e-learning module about DV has been developed. A
   web-survey was conducted to investigate how general dental practitioners
   (GDPs) deal with the RCD and what their experiences are with (signs of)
   DV and CA.
   Methods: In April 2014 1038 GDPs were invited by e-mail to participate
   in a web-survey consisting of 24 items, through the KNMT Data Stations
   Project. The data was analyzed using SPSS (RELIABILITY, CHISQ and
   ANOVA).
   Results: Of all GDPs invited to participate 264 (25 \%) responded. 82 \%
   of these GDPs are aware of their obligation to use the reporting code.
   54 \% of the GDPs are in favor of this obligation. 76 \% of the GDPs
   have taken notice of the KNMT's RCD and 51 \% of the GDPs have
   implemented the reporting code in one form or another in their practice.
   24 \% of the GDPs stated having suspected DV during the last twelve
   months in the case of 2.4 patients on average. 81 \% took note of this
   in the patient's record and 58 \% also took action in different ways. 54
   \% wants to complete the e-learning module.
   Conclusions: Most GDPs are aware of the new legislation and have taken
   cognizance of the RCD. Even though the majority of GDPs are not opposed
   to using a reporting code, over half of them have not yet implemented
   the code in practice. An important factor in this regard seems to be
   that a substantial minority of the GDPs says they are not sufficiently
   informed about aspects of reporting a case and about the steps they have
   to take.}},

Abstract = {{Barium hexaferrite (BaFe12O19) thick films (similar to 60 mu m) with
   different BaO center dot xFe(2)O(3) mole ratio (x=5.0-6.0) were prepared
   by screen printing method. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the
   formation of single phase BaFe12O19 (BaM). Preferential site occupation
   of Fe3+ ion at five different crystallographic sites, with varied mole
   ratio was measured by Mossbauer spectroscopy. Vacancy fraction found to
   be higher at 4f(1), 4f(2) and 2b sites for mole ratio 5.5 and 5.0
   respectively. Magnetic measurement shows that the magnetization (M) and
   magnetocrystalline anisotropy field (H-a) depends upon mole ratio. M and
   Ha are found to be maximum for mole ratio 5.5, while the coercivity
   (H-c) remains constant. Reflection losses (R-L) in the frequency range
   of 12-18 GHz were also studied. Present investigation demonstrates the
   effect of mole ratio on structural, magnetic and microwave absorption
   properties of BaM thick films for microwave device applications. (C)

Abstract = {{In recent times, we experimentally realized quite an efficient modeling
   of the shape of diffraction-resistant optical beams, thus generating for
   the first time the so-called frozen waves (FW), whose longitudinal
   intensity pattern can be arbitrarily chosen within a prefixed space
   interval of the propagation axis. In this Letter, we extend our theory
   of FWs, which led to beams endowed with a static envelope, through a
   dynamic modeling of the FWs whose shape is now allowed to evolve in time
   in a predetermined way. Further, we experimentally create such dynamic
   FWs (DFWs) in optics via a computational holographic technique and a
   spatial light modulator. Experimental results are presented here for two
   cases of DFWs, one of zeroth order and the other of higher order, the
   latter being the most interesting exhibiting a cylindrical surface of
   light whose geometry changes in space and time. (C) 2015 Optical Society

Abstract = {{The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is used worldwide for water
   quality assessment and planning. This paper aimed to assess and adapt
   SWAT hillslope sediment yield model (Modified Universal Soil Loss
   Equation, MUSLE) for applications in large basins, i.e. when spatial
   data is coarse and model units are large; and to develop a robust
   sediment calibration method for large regions. The Upper Danube Basin
   (132,000 km(2)) was used as case study representative of large European
   Basins. The MUSLE was modified to reduce sensitivity of sediment yields
   to the Hydrologic Response Unit (HRU) size, and to identify appropriate
   algorithms for estimating hillslope length (L) and slope-length factor
   (LS). HRUs gross erosion was broadly calibrated against plot data and
   soil erosion map estimates. Next, mean annual SWAT suspended sediment
   concentrations (SSC, mg/L) were calibrated and validated against SSC
   data at 55 gauging stations (622 station-years). SWAT annual specific
   sediment yields in subbasin reaches (RSSY, t/km(2)/year) were compared
   to yields measured at 33 gauging stations (87 station-years). The best
   SWAT configuration combined a MUSLE equation modified by the
   introduction of a threshold area of 0.01 km(2) where Land LS were
   estimated with flow accumulation algorithms. For this configuration, the
   SSC residual interquartile was less than +/-15 mg/L both for the
   calibration (1995-2004) and the validation (2005-2009) periods. The mean
   SSC percent bias for 1995-2009 was 24\%. RSSY residual interquartile was
   within +/-10 t/km(2)/year, with a mean RSSY percent bias of 12\%.
   Residuals showed no bias with respect to drainage area, slope, or
   spatial distribution. The use of multiple data types at multiple sites
   enabled robust simulation of sediment concentrations and yields of the
   region. The MUSLE modifications are recommended for use in large basins.
   Based on SWAT simulations, we present a sediment budget for the Upper
   Danube Basin. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of extraction pressure on peony seeds (Paeonia
   suffruticosa Andr.) oil yield and quality was investigated using GC-MS,
   and the results indicated that the extraction of peony seeds oil under
   atmospheric pressure had the lowest oil yield and led to the absence of
   9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid in the oil. Ultrahigh pressure (UHP) of
   350, 400, 450, 500 and 550 MPa was used in this study and the analysis
   demonstrated that all the extracted peony seeds oils using UHP
   technology had the common compounds including hexadecanoic acid,
   9,12-octadecadienoic acid, 9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid, and
   octadecanoic acid, but their proportions in the extracted oils greatly
   differed. Although the oil yield was the highest, the extraction at a
   lower pressure of 350 MPa achieved the greatest saturated fatty acids
   content of 49.49\% and also the highest fatty acids number of 11, which
   might be due to the activated enzymes during the extraction. In
   contrast, the unsaturated fatty acids content in the extracted oil was
   up to be the highest of 87.57\% when the extraction pressure of 500 MPa
   was used, and its corresponding fat acidity was found to the lowest
   level of 3.5 mg 100 g(-1) among all the extracted oils. This study
   suggests that the both oil yield and, in particular the oil quality are
   greatly sensitive to the extraction pressure. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Characteristics and transformation of nitrous acid (HONO) and
   particulate nitrite were investigated with high time-resolution field
   measurements at an urban site in Ji'nan, China from Nov. 2013 to Jan.
   2014. During the sampling period, averages of 0.35 ppbv HONO and 2.08 mu
   g m(-3) fine particulate nitrite were observed. HONO and particulate
   nitrite exhibited similar diurnal variation patterns but differed in the
   time at which concentration peaks and valleys occurred. Elevated
   nocturnal HONO concentration peaks were mainly associated with primary
   emissions from vehicle exhaust and secondary formation via heterogeneous
   reactions of NO2. In fresh air masses dominated by vehicle emissions,
   the average HONO/NOx ratio was 0.58\%. The nocturnal heterogeneous
   reactions of NO2 contributed to about half of the elevated HONO
   concentration peaks, with the conversion rates in the range of 0.05\% to
   0.96\% h(-1). Meanwhile, a large amount of particulate nitrite, which
   greatly exceeded the concentration of the gas-phase HONO, was also
   produced through the heterogeneous reactions of NO2. The large yields of
   particulate nitrite were facilitated by abundant ammonia and particulate
   cations in urban Ji'nan. Notably, in the daytime, particulate nitrite
   acted as a potential source of HONO, especially in conditions of low
   humidity and acidic aerosols, which possibly has subsequent effects on
   photochemistry in the boundary layer. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},

Abstract = {{Despite the economic and ecological importance of key carbon (C) traits
   (concentration, sequestration, and allocation to different tree
   components), there are few studies on their variation among populations
   of a tree species and the possible adaptive significance of these
   traits. We investigated differences in the C traits among 16 white birch
   populations grown in two provenance trials in northeastern China.
   Effects of provenance were significant for most combinations of C trait,
   tree portion, and trial site. Substantial differences among provenances
   were found in (I) C concentration in the bole wood and in bark, in fine
   roots, and at the whole tree scale; (2) C amount sequestered in each
   studied tree component and in the whole tree; and (3) ratios of C
   partitioning to bole wood, bole bark, leaves, and existing fine roots.
   Mostly, significant variations in C concentration and partitioning
   ratios were independent of provenance volume growth, while those in C
   amount were strongly positively correlated with volume growth. Summer
   climate at the provenance origin was the best predictor, of C
   concentration and allocation but clinal patterns in these traits were
   found for only some tree components. The C sequestration showed a clinal
   pattern following the mean annual temperature at the provenance origin.
   While this suggests an adaptive nature of C traits in white birch, site
   conditions and/or tree density act strongly on expression of these
   traits. Implications of this study to C budgeting, trading C credits,
   and to genetic selection are discussed. Our results may interest
   ecologists studying dynamics of ecosystems in times of climate change.

Abstract = {{A molecularly imprinted polymer film was in situ polymerized on a
   carboxyl functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes modified glassy
   carbon electrode surface under room temperature. This technique provides
   a promising imprinting approach for protein in an aqueous solution using
   3-(3-aminopropy1)-1-vinylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ionic liquid as
   functional monomer, N, N'-methylenebisacrylamide as crossing linker,
   ammonium persulfate and N,N,N',W-tetramethylethylenediamine as
   initiator, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) as template. The molecularly
   imprinted polymerized ionic liquid film shows enhanced accessibility,
   high specificity and sensitivity towards BSA. Electrochemical sensing
   performance of the imprinted sensor was thoroughly investigated using
   K3Fe{[}CN](6)/K4Fe{[}CN](6) as electroactive probes. Under optimal
   conditions, the current difference before and after specific recognition
   of BSA was found linearly related to its concentration in the range from
   1.50 x 10(-9) to 1.50 x 10(-6) mol L-1. The detection limit was
   calculated to be 3.91 x 10(-19) mol L-1 (S/N=3). The practical
   application of the imprinted sensor was demonstrated by determining BSA

Abstract = {{The five-factor model of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
   (PANSS) for schizophrenia symptoms is the most common multiple-factor
   model used in analyses; its use may improve evaluation of symptoms in
   schizophrenia patients. Plasma monoamine metabolite levels are possible
   indicators of clinical symptoms or response to antipsychotics in
   schizophrenia. We investigated the association between five-factor model
   components and plasma monoamine metabolites levels to explore the
   model's biological basis. Plasma levels of homovanillic acid (HVA),
   3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid
   (5-HIAA) were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography in
   65 Japanese patients with schizophrenia. Significant negative
   correlation between plasma 5-HIAA levels and the depression/anxiety
   component was found. Furthermore, significant positive correlation was
   found between plasma MHPG levels and the excitement component. Plasma
   HVA levels were not correlated with any five-factor model component.
   These results suggest that the five-factor model of the PANSS may have a
   biological basis, and may be useful for elucidating the psychopathology
   of schizophrenia. Assessment using the five-factor model may enable
   understanding of monoaminergic dysfunction, possibly allowing more
   appropriate medication selection. Further studies of a larger number of
   first-episode schizophrenia patients are needed to confirm and extend
   these results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This contribution deals with the FastICA algorithm in the domain of
   Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The focus is on the asymptotic
   behavior of the generalized symmetric variant of the algorithm. The
   latter has already been shown to possess the potential to achieve the
   Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) by allowing the usage of different nonlinearity
   functions in its implementation. Although the FastICA algorithm along
   with its variants are among the most extensively studied methods in the
   domain of ICA, a rigorous study of the asymptotic distribution of the
   generalized symmetric FastICA algorithm is still missing. In fact, all
   the existing results exhibit certain limitations. Some ignores the
   impact of data standardization on the asymptotic statistics; others are
   only based on heuristic arguments. In this work, we aim at deriving
   general and rigorous results on the limiting distribution and the
   asymptotic statistics of the FastICA algorithm. We begin by showing that
   the generalized symmetric FastICA optimizes a function that is a sum of
   the contrast functions of traditional one-unit FastICA with a correction
   of the sign. Based on this characterization, we established the
   asymptotic normality and derived a closed-form analytic expression of
   the asymptotic covariance matrix of the generalized symmetric FastICA
   estimator using the method of estimating equation and M-estimator.
   Computer simulations are also provided, which support the theoretical
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Lyme disease patients with erythema migrans are said to have
   post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms (PTLDS) if there is persistence of
   subjective symptoms for at least 6 months following antibiotic treatment
   and resolution of the skin lesion. The purpose of this study was to
   characterize PTLDS in patients with culture-confirmed early Lyme disease
   followed for >10 years.
   Methods. Adult patients with erythema migrans with a positive skin or
   blood culture for Borrelia burgdorferi were enrolled in a prospective
   study beginning in 1991 and followed up at 6 months and annually
   thereafter to determine the long-term outcome of this infection. The
   genotype of the infecting strain of B. burgdorferi was evaluated in
   subjects with PTLDS.
   Results. One hundred twenty-eight subjects with culture-confirmed early
   Lyme disease, of whom 55\% were male, were followed for a mean +/- SD of
   14.98 +/- 2.71 years (median = 15 years; range = 11-20 years). Fourteen
   (10.9\%) were regarded as having possible PTLDS, but only 6 (4.7\%) had
   PTLDS documented at their last study visit. Nine (64.3\%) had only a
   single symptom. None of the 6 with PTLDS at their last visit was
   considered to be functionally impaired by the symptom(s). PTLDS was not
   associated with a particular genotype of B. burgdorferi.
   Conclusions. PTLDS may persist for >10 years in some patients with
   culture-confirmed early Lyme disease. Such long-standing symptoms were
   not associated with functional impairment or a particular strain of B.

Journal = {{BMC BIOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Triple helical collagens are the most abundant structural
   protein in vertebrates and are widely used as biomaterials for a variety
   of applications including drug delivery and cellular and tissue
   engineering. In these applications, the mechanics of this hierarchically
   structured protein play a key role, as does its chemical composition. To
   facilitate investigation into how gene mutations of collagen lead to
   disease as well as the rational development of tunable mechanical and
   chemical properties of this full-length protein, production of
   recombinant expressed protein is required.
   Results: Here, we present a human type II procollagen expression system
   that produces full-length procollagen utilizing a previously
   characterized human fibrosarcoma cell line for production. The system
   exploits a non-covalently linked fluorescence readout for gene
   expression to facilitate screening of cell lines. Biochemical and
   biophysical characterization of the secreted, purified protein are used
   to demonstrate the proper formation and function of the protein. Assays
   to demonstrate fidelity include proteolytic digestion, mass
   spectrometric sequence and posttranslational composition analysis,
   circular dichroism spectroscopy, single-molecule stretching with optical
   tweezers, atomic-force microscopy imaging of fibril assembly, and
   transmission electron microscopy imaging of self-assembled fibrils.
   Conclusions: Using a mammalian expression system, we produced
   full-length recombinant human type II procollagen. The integrity of the
   collagen preparation was verified by various structural and degradation
   assays. This system provides a platform from which to explore new
   directions in collagen manipulation.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of vineyard
   proximity to riparian habitat on the biological control and population
   densities of the Western grape leafhopper, Erythroneura elegantula
   Osborn (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae). Natural enemy and pest populations
   were monitored over a two-year period at multiple vineyard sites
   adjacent to riparian habitat in northern California. At each site,
   natural enemy and pest population data were collected along a transect
   that extended from the riparian habitat into the vineyard. Additionally,
   a subset of the original research sites were further evaluated for crop
   vigor, pest density and parasitism rates between the vineyard edge and
   interior. Results from this study indicate that lower E. elegantula egg
   deposition and nymph abundance at the vineyard edge were primarily due
   to reduced crop vigor at the sampled sites and that the most likely
   cause for these changes were differences in microclimate and soil
   fertility that were found to be associated with proximity to the
   riparian habitat. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   0.5\% formic acid water solution, and detected by a triple quadrupole
   mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization source. It is a
   challenge to design different calibration ranges for different analytes
   in a bioanalytical method for simultaneous determination of
   multi-analytes in bio-samples. To ensure that each alkaloid in the
   plasma was determined accurately by the simultaneous quantitation
   method, the upper limits of quantification for the nine alkaloids were
   designed at 100, 300, 800, 1800 and 5000 pg/mL, respectively, according
   to the maximum plasma concentration value of each alkaloid obtained from
   the pilot pharmacokinetic study. The lower limit of quantification was
   15 pg/mL for berberine, epiberberine, coptisine, magnoflorine,
   berberrubine, corynoline and acetylcorynoline, while for palmatine and
   jatrorrhizine it was 1.5 pg/mL. This method was successfully applied to
   investigate the pharmacokinetic profiles of the nine alkaloids in
   healthy Chinese volunteers after a single oral administration of SBT.

Abstract = {{We propose a perpendicular elliptical silicon nanohole (PESiNH) array
   for light absorption in thin film silicon solar cells. Our analysis
   shows that this architecture is capable of increasing the absorption of
   a thin film silicon solar cell by 11.3\% in comparison to that of the
   optimal circular SiNH array. The process of breaking the mirror
   symmetries is responsible for the increase of the coupled modes. The
   PESiNH structures show additional near-zero spatial Fourier components
   compared with the circular SiNH structure, which helps to couple more
   incident light into slow Bloch modes. The mode interaction between
   adjacent elliptical nanoholes is in favor of the coupling of the
   incident light into channeling modes and, therefore, enhances light
   absorption in the short wavelength region. (C) 2015 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{Heavy metals present in landfill leachate have infrequently been related
   to complete anaerobic degradation municipal solid waste (MSW) due to
   discrete ages of deposited MSW layers and leachate channelling in
   landfills. In this study, anaerobic digestion of MSW was performed in
   two enclosed 1000 tonne bioreactors using a unique flood and drain
   process. Leachates were characterised in terms of pH, soluble chemical
   oxygen demand, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), ammonium nitrogen and heavy
   metals over the entire course of digestion. All parameters, including
   pH, fluctuated during acidogenesis, acetogenesis and methanogenesis,
   which strongly impacted on the dynamics of dissolved heavy metal
   concentrations. The simulation of dissolution and precipitation
   processes indicated that metal sulphide precipitation was not a factor
   as metal concentrations exceeded solubility limits. The correlation of
   pH and dissolved heavy metal concentrations indicated that other,
   mechanisms were involved in the homogenised conditions within the
   bioreactors. Beside dissolution and precipitation, the main processes
   most likely involved in metal distributions were adsorption (Zn, Cu, Ni,
   Pb and Cd), complexation (Cr) or combinations of both process (As and
   Co). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The creep properties of modified 9Cr-1Mo steel specimens, undoped and
   doped with 0.053 wt\% Ce, which were normalized at 1055 degrees C and
   tempered at 760 degrees C, were examined under different engineering
   stresses (150-210 MPa) and temperatures (600-650 degrees C). The creep
   behavior of the steel followed the temperature-compensated power law and
   Monkman-Grant equations. The creep activation energy for the Ce-doped
   steel (662 kJ/mol) was apparently higher than that for the undoped one
   (541 kJ/mol). The 100 MPa-stress creep lifetime and 10(5) h creep
   rupture strength were estimated between 600 and 650 degrees C. At
   similar to 600 degrees C where the steel component was usually operated
   in engineering practice, the 100 MPa-stress creep lifetime of the
   Ce-doped steel was about 23 times as long as that of the undoped steel
   and the 10(5) h creep rupture strength of the former was about 7\%
   higher than that of the latter. These indicated that Ce could
   substantially improve the creep properties of the steel. The segregation
   of Ce to grain or subgrain boundaries, carbide/matrix interfaces and
   dislocations could account for the improvement in the creep properties.

Abstract = {{Accumulating evidence suggests that mitochondrial dynamics is crucial
   for the maintenance of cellular quality control and function in response
   to various stresses. However, the role of mitochondrial dynamics in
   cellular responses to ionizing radiation (IR) is still largely unknown.
   In this study, we provide evidence that IR triggers mitochondrial
   fission mediated by the mitochondrial fission protein dynamin-related
   protein 1 (Drp1). We also show IR-induced mitotic catastrophe (MC),
   which is a type of cell death associated with defective mitosis, and
   aberrant centrosome amplification in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).
   These are attenuated by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Drp1.
   Whereas radiation-induced aberrant centrosome amplification and MC are
   suppressed by the inhibition of Plk1 and CDK2 in wild-type MEFs, the
   inhibition of these kinases is ineffective in Drp1-deficient MEFs.
   Furthermore, the cyclin B1 level after irradiation is significantly
   higher throughout the time course in Drp1-deficient MEFs than in
   wild-type MEFs, implying that Drp1 is involved in the regulation of
   cyclin B1 level. These findings strongly suggest that Drp1 plays an
   important role in determining the fate of cells after irradiation via
   the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{A novel cathodic ``signal-off' strategy was proposed for
   photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensing of oxytetracycline (OTC). The PEC
   sensor was constructed by employing a p-type semiconductor BiOI doped
   with graphene (G) as photoactive species and OTC-binding aptamer as a
   recognition element. The morphological structure and crystalline phases
   of obtained BiOI-G nanocomposites were characterized by scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The UV-visible
   absorption spectroscopic analysis indicated that doping of BiOI with
   graphene improved the absorption of materials in the visible light
   region. Moreover, graphene could facilitate the electron transfer of
   BiOI modified electrode. As a result, the cathodic photocurrent response
   of BiOI under visible light irradiation was significantly promoted when
   a suitable amount of graphene was doped. When amine-functionalized
   OTC-binding aptamer was immobilized on the BiOi-G modified electrode, a
   cathodic PEC aptasensor was fabricated, which exhibited a declined
   photocurrent response to OTC. Under the optimized conditions, the
   photocurrent response of aptamer/BiOI-G/FTO was linearly proportional to
   the concentration of OTC ranging from 4.0 to 150 nM, with a detection
   limit (3S/N) of 0.9 nM. This novel PEC sensing strategy demonstrated an
   ultrasensitive method for OTC detection with high selectivity and good
   stability.}},

Journal = {{EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS}},

Abstract = {{Silicic eruptive units can constitute a substantive component in
   flood-basalts-dominated large igneous provinces, but usually constitute
   only a small proportion of the preserved volume due to poor
   preservation. Thus, their environmental impact can be underestimated or
   ignored. Establishing the original volume and potential
   climate-sensitive gas emissions of silicic eruptions is generally
   lacking for most large igneous provinces. We present a case study for
   the similar to 260 Ma Emeishan province, where silicic volcanic rocks
   are a very minor component of the preserved rock archive due to
   extensive erosion during the Late Permian. Modal and geochemical data
   from Late Permian sandstones derived from the province suggest that
   silicic volcanic rocks constituted some similar to 30\% by volume of the
   total eroded Emeishan volcanic source rocks. This volume corresponds to
   > 3 x 10(4) km(3) on the basis of two independent estimate methods.
   Detrital zircon trace element and Hf isotopic data require the silicic
   source rocks to be formed mainly by fractional crystallization from
   associated basaltic magmas. Based on experimental and theoretical
   calculations, these basalt-derived 104 km3 silicic eruptions released
   similar to 10(17) g sulfur gases into the higher atmosphere and
   contribute to the contemporaneous climate cooling at the
   Capitanian-Wuchiapingian transition (similar to 260 Ma). This study
   highlights the potentially important impact on climate of silicic
   eruptions associated with large igneous province volcanism. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Building a map of the environment is a prerequisite for mobile robot
   navigation. In this paper, we present a semantic map building method for
   indoor navigation of a robot using only the image sequence acquired by a
   monocular camera installed on the robot. First, a topological map of the
   environment is created, where each key frame forms a node of the map
   represented as visual words (VWs). The edges between two adjacent nodes
   are built from relative poses obtained by performing a novel pose
   estimation approach, called one-point RANSAC camera pose estimation
   (ORPE). Then, taking advantage of an improved deformable part model
   (iDPM) for object detection, the topological map is extended by
   assigning semantic attributes to the nodes. Extensive experimental
   evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed monocular SLAM
   method.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from diesel passenger cars
   during real-world driving is one of the major technical challenges
   facing diesel auto manufacturers. Three main technologies are available
   for this purpose: exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), lean-burn NOx traps
   (LNT), and selective catalytic reduction (SCR). Seventy-three Euro 6
   diesel passenger cars (8 EGR only, 40 LNT, and 25 SCR) were tested on a
   chassis dynamometer over both the European type-approval cycle (NEDC,
   cold engine start) and the more realistic Worldwide harmonized
   light-duty test cycle (WLTC version 2.0, hot start) between 2012 and
   2015. Most vehicles met the legislative limit of 0.08 g/km of NOx over
   NEDC (average emission factors by technology: EGR-only 0.07 g/km, LNT
   0.04 g/km, and SCR 0.05 g/km), but the average emission factors rose
   dramatically over WLTC (EGR-only 0.17 g/km, LNT 0.21 g/km, and SCR 0.13
   g/km). Five LNT-equipped vehicles exhibited very poor performance over
   the WLTC, emitting 7-15 times the regulated limit. These results
   illustrate how diesel NOx emissions are not properly controlled under
   the current, NEDC-based homologation framework. The upcoming
   real-driving emissions (RDE) regulation, which mandates an additional
   on-road emissions test for EU type approvals, could be a step in the
   right direction to address this problem.}},

Abstract = {{The long term performance of GRP pipes after 50 years was predicted from
   failure pressure and time to failure tested up to 10,000 h through
   sustained internal pressure test. GRP pipes made of glass chopped
   fibers, polyester resin, and sand were manufactured by continuous
   filament winding technique. Different pressure conditions were
   considered to 19 GRP pipes to induce damage at the specified time to
   failure. According to the results, the linear regression analysis was
   applicable to predict failure pressure of GRP pipes after 50 years as
   the correlation coefficient was 0.842 and the ratio of regression
   coefficient and its variance was 6.451. Based on the regression ratio
   between failure pressure for first 6 min and that of 50 years, the long
   term performance of GRP pipes after 50 years was degraded up to 57\% of
   the initial performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Observed variations in drug responses among patients may result from
   differences in heritable genetic traits or from alterations in the
   epigenetic regulation of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters
   (DMETs). MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a group of small non-coding RNAs, provide
   an epigenetic mechanism for fine-tuning the expression of targeted DMET
   genes by regulating the efficiency of protein translation and by
   decreasing mRNA stability via enhanced degradation. In the current study
   we systematically screened 374 important genes encoding DMETs for
   potential response elements to hsa-miR-29a-3p, a highly abundant miRNA
   in human liver. RNA electrophoresis mobility shift assays displayed
   direct interactions between hsa-miR-29a-3p and its cognate targets
   within the mRNA transcripts for the ABCC6, SLC22A7 and ALDH5A1 genes.
   The expression of luciferase reporter genes containing the 3'-UTRs of
   SLC22A7 or ALDH5A1 and the expression of endogenous SLC22A7 and ALDH5A1
   were each suppressed by transfection with hsa-miR-29a-3p mimics.
   Importantly, chemically-induced up-regulation of hsa-miR-29a-3p
   correlated inversely with the expression of SLC22A7 and ALDH5A1.
   However, our studies failed to detect suppressive effects of
   hsa-miR-29a-3p on ABCC6 expression, which might be explained by the
   notion that the interaction of hsa-miR-29a-3p and ABCC6 mRNA was unable
   to recruit ribonucleoproteins to form a RNA-induced silencing complex.

Abstract = {{High-level resistance to antimicrobial drugs is a major factor in the
   pathogenesis of chronic Staphylococcus aureus biofilm-associated,
   medical device-related infections. Antimicrobial susceptibility analysis
   revealed that biofilms grown for <= 24 hours on biomaterials conditioned
   with human plasma under venous shear in iron-free cell culture medium
   were significantly more susceptible to antistaphylococcal antibiotics.
   Biofilms formed under these physiologically relevant conditions were
   regulated by SaeRS and dependent on coagulase-catalyzed conversion of
   fibrinogen into fibrin. In contrast, SarA-regulated biofilms formed on
   uncoated polystyrene in nutrient-rich bacteriological medium were
   mediated by the previously characterized biofilm factors poly-N-acetyl
   glucosamine, fibronectin-binding proteins, or autolytic activity and
   were antibiotic resistant. Coagulase-mediated biofilms exhibited
   increased antimicrobial resistance over time (>48 hours) but were always
   susceptible to dispersal by the fibrinolytic enzymes plasmin or
   nattokinase. Biofilms recovered from infected central venous catheters
   in a rat model of device-related infection were dispersed by
   nattokinase, supporting the important role of the biofilm phenotype and
   identifying a potentially new therapeutic approach with anti-microbials

   fuel bundle geometry}},

Volume = {{295}},
Pages = {{305-316}},

Abstract = {{Predicting temperature distributions in fuel rod bundles is an important
   component of nuclear reactor safety analysis. Intersubchannel mixing
   acts to homogenize coolant temperatures thus reducing the likelihood of
   localized regions of high fuel temperature. Previous research has shown
   that intersubchannel mixing in nuclear fuel rod bundles is enhanced by a
   large-scale quasi-periodic energetic fluid motion, which transports
   fluid on the cross-plane between the narrow gaps connecting subchannels.
   This phenomenon has also been observed in laminar flows. Unsteady
   laminar flow simulations were performed in a simplified bundle of three
   rods with a pipe. Three similar geometries of varying gap width were
   examined, and a thermal trace was implemented on the first geometry.
   Thermal mixing was driven by the advection of energy between subchannels
   by the cross-plane flow. Flow through the rod-to-wall gaps in the wall
   subchannels alternated with a dominant frequency, particularly when
   rod-to-wall gaps were smaller than rod-to-rod gaps. Significant
   phase-linking between rod-to-wall gaps was also observed such that a
   peripheral circulation occurred through each gap simultaneously.
   Cross-plane flow through the rod-to-rod gaps in the triangular
   subchannel was irregular in each case. This was due to the fundamental
   irregularity of the triangular subchannel geometry. Vortices were
   continually broken up by cross-plane flow from other gaps due to the odd
   number of fluid pathways within the central subchannel. Cross-plane flow
   in subchannel geometries is highly interconnected between gaps. The flow
   structure through the gaps is more complex than has been previously
   reported and depends very much on the subchannel geometry. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Crosslinked poly(ST-co-DVB-co-NaSS) latex nanoparticles (LNPs) with
   average particle size were used as template to prepare porous carbonized
   electrospun nanofibers (CENFs) with pore size about 10 nm on the surface
   and inside by electrospinning and carbonization. The porous CENFs
   without and with MWCNTs exhibited high specific surface area of 505 and
   535 m(2)/g and high mesoporosity percentage of 80\% and 84\%
   respectively. The porous CENFs as electrode materials for
   electrochemical capacitors in 1 M H2SO4 showed a specific capacitance of
   235 F/g while the addition of MWCNTs led to an increase to 262 Fig.
   These free-standing and binder-free mesoporous CENFs with outstanding
   capacitance could be good candidates as electrode materials for
   supercapacitors. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{For half a century, complexometric titrations of metal ions have been
   performed with water-soluble chelators and indicators that typically
   require careful pH control. Very recently, ion-selective nanosphere
   emulsions were introduced that exhibit ion-exchange properties and are
   doped with lipophilic ionophores originally developed for chemical ion
   sensors. They may serve as novel, highly selective and pH independent
   complexometric reagents. While ion optode emulsions have been
   demonstrated as useful indicators for such titrations, they exhibit a pH
   cross-response that unfortunately complicates the identification of the
   end point. Here, we present pH-independent optode nanospheres as
   indicators for complexometric titrations, with calcium as an initial
   example. The nanospheres incorporate an ionic solvatochromic dye (SD),
   ion exchanger and ionophore. The solvatochromic dye will be only
   expelled from the core of the nanosphere into the aqueous solution at
   the end point at which point it results in an optical signal change. The
   titration curves are demonstrated to be pH-independent and with sharper
   end points than with previously reported chromoionophore-based optical
   nanospheres as indicator. The calcium concentration in mineral water was
   successfully determined using this method.}},

Abstract = {{The augmenting necessity of energy saving and environmental protection
   has led to the increasing technical requirements about on-line
   monitoring of key parameters and elements in coal. In this study,
   terahertz spectroscopy combined with PCA (principal components analysis)
   was employed to analyze nine kinds of coal materials. Due to the strong
   absorption of the organics with the relatively high C/H ratio, such as
   aromatic compounds, coals with lower hydrogen content show higher
   absorption effects in terahertz range. Based on PC1 score calculated by
   PCA, the anthracite and bituminous coal can be clearly classified, and
   the clean as well as meagre coals were also distinguished by opposite
   trends. All the critical points in PCA system are in agreement with
   those (volatile matter and ash, respectively) classified in
   international standard of coal classification. In addition, significant
   elements, including carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulfur, can be
   directly characterized using PC1 score with linear and non-linear
   models. This research indicates that the terahertz spectral analysis of
   key parameters and elements of coal is a promising tool for improving
   the detection method and advancing the technical innovation in coal
   processing industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Overuse or underuse? An observation of pesticide use in China}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{538}},
Pages = {{1-6}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Pesticide use has experienced a dramatic increase worldwide, especially
   in China, where a wide variety of pesticides are used in large amounts
   by farmers to control crop pests. While Chinese farmers are often
   criticized for pesticide overuse, this study shows the coexistence of
   overuse and underuse of pesticide based on the survey data of pesticide
   use in rice, cotton, maize, and wheat production in three provinces in
   China. A novel index amount approach is proposed to convert the amount
   of multiple pesticides used to control the same pest into an index
   amount of a referenced pesticide. We compare the summed index amount
   with the recommended dosage range of the referenced pesticide to
   classify whether pesticides are overused or underused. Using this new
   approach, the following main results were obtained. Pesticide overuse
   and underuse coexist after examining a total of 107 pesticides used to
   control up to 54 crop pests in rice, cotton, maize, and wheat
   production. In particular, pesticide overuse in more than half of the
   total cases for 9 crop pest species is detected. In contrast, pesticide
   underuse accounts for more than 20\% of the total cases for 11 pests. We
   further indicate that the lack of knowledge and information on pesticide
   use and pest control among Chinese farmers may cause the coexistence of
   pesticide overuse and underuse. Our analysis provides indirect evidence
   that the commercialized agricultural extension system in China probably
   contributes to the coexistence of overuse and underuse. To improve
   pesticide use, it is urgent to reestablish the monitoring and
   forecasting system regarding pest control in China. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Salmonella typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus are most common causes
   of food-associated disease. A Raman based biosensor was developed for S.
   typhimurium and S. aureus detection simultaneously. The biosensor was
   based on nanoparticles enhanced Raman intensity and the specific
   recognition of aptamer. The Raman signal probe and the capture probe are
   built. Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) modified with Raman molecules
   (Mercaptobenzoic acid and 5,5'-Dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)) and
   aptamer are used as the signal probe for S. typhimurium and S. aureus,
   respectively. Fe3O4 magnetic gold nanoparticles (MGNPs) immobilized with
   both aptamer of S. typhimurium and S. aureus are used as the capture
   probe. When S. typhimurium and S. aureus are added in the reaction
   system, the capture probe will capture the target bacteria through the
   specific binding effect of aptamer. And then the signal probe will be
   connected to the bacteria also by the effect of aptamer to form the
   sandwich like detection structure. The Raman intensified spectrum was
   measured to quantify S. typhimurium and S. aureus. Under optimal
   conditions, the SERS intensity of MBA at 1582 cm(-1) are used to measure
   S. typhimurium (y=186.4762 + 704.8571x, R-2=0.9921) and the SERS
   intensity of DNTB at 1333 cm(-1) are used to measure S. aureus (y
   =135.2381+211.4286x, R-2=0.9946) in the range of 10(2)-10(7) cfu mL(-1).
   The LOD is 35 cfu mL(-1) for S. aureus and 15 cfu mL(-1) for S.
   typhimurium. This method is simple and rapid, results in high
   sensitivity and specificity, and can be used to detect actual samples.

Abstract = {{In the Early Jurassic, the epicontinental Central European Basin (CEB),
   including the North German Basin (NGB), was covered with a semi-enclosed
   inland sea that was in the late Middle Jurassic transferred to a
   continental shelf sea connected with the Boreal and the Tethyan oceans.
   The pronounced facies architectures of Lower to Middle Jurassic
   coastal-deltaic and basinal deposits challenged many workers to apply
   sequence stratigraphic methods. However, resulting regional schemes are
   in places contradicting, which is caused by both common problems with
   precise dating and processes of regional to local scale obliterating the
   sea-level signal, such as tectonically enhanced subsidence, enhanced
   sediment supply, thermal doming, or salt diapirism. This paper proposes
   a Lower to Middle Jurassic sequence stratigraphic framework of the NGB.
   The application of a multi-method approach, including intensive macro-
   and micropalaeontological dating as well as mapping of biofacies and
   lithofacies architecture to an extensive data set of cored and logged
   wells resulted in a hierarchical framework of 2nd-, 3rd-, and 4th-order
   epicontinental sequences. This approach enabled the identification and
   exclusion of areas and locations where subordinated controls, such as
   salt diapirism, superimposed the signature of sea-level fluctuations
   within stratal pattern architectures. The proposed sequence
   stratigraphic framework correlates well with the Boreal Standard but to
   much lesser extent with the Tethyan Standard and, thus, demonstrates the
   principle control of Boreal cycles on epicontinental stratal pattern
   architectures of the NGB. This coincides with more significant faunal
   exchanges between the Boreal and Subboreal provinces. In particular, the
   opening of a marine strait via the Russian Platform in the late Middle
   Jurassic enabled the immigration of Boreal ammonites and ostracods into
   the NGB and the northern CEB and illustrates the change from a
   semienclosed inland sea to a continental shelf sea. Furthermore, the
   recognition of Lower and Middle Jurassic 4th- order sequences supports
   suggestions of glacio-eustatic sea-level changes in the Jurassic. (C)

Abstract = {{Aim of this study is to compare the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound
   versus MRI in detecting rotator cuff pathology. Rotator cuff pathology
   involves group of disorder, which progresses from bursitis to tendinitis
   to partial tear and full thickenss tear. The most commonly affected
   tendon is the supraspinatus tendon. In our prospective study of 35
   patients as initial ultrasound was followed by MRI sensitivity,
   specificity and accuracy for diagnosis of full thickness tear of
   supraspinatus when USG was compared to MRI was 100\%, whereas
   sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of diagnosing partial thickness
   tear using ultrasound compared to MRI are 100\%, 78\% and 84\%. There is
   no significant p value difference on comparing ultrasound with MRI on
   detecting tears. Ultrasound and MRI showed almost similar diagnostic
   accuracy in associated findings like tendon retraction, muscle atrophy,
   bursal effusion. Ultrasound also has additional value of dynamic
   evaluation, which is useful in evaluating subacromial and subcoracoid
   impingement. Modality choice for the evaluation of rotator cuff
   pathology should be based on several factors like availability, patient
   preference and clinical information being sought. The high resolution
   sonography is an attractive screening modality for rotator cuff in
   patients presenting with painful shoulder. A well performed ultrasound
   examination in most cases obviates the need for more invasive diagnostic
   tests like arthrography and cumbersome and expensive MRI examinations.}},

Title = {{Domain walls inside localised orientifolds}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{The equations of motion of toroidal orientifold compactifications with
   fluxes are in one-to-one correspondence with gauged supergravity if the
   orientifold (and D-brane) sources are smeared over the compact space.
   This smeared limit is identical to the approximation that ignores
   warping. It is therefore relevant to compare quantities obtained from
   the gauged supergravity with the true 10d solution with localised
   sources. In this paper we find the correspondence between BPS domain
   walls in gauged SUGRA and 10D SUGRA with localised sources. Our model is
   the simplest orientifold with fluxes we are aware of: an O6/D6
   compactification on T-3/Z(2) in massive IIA with H-3-flux. The BPS
   domain walls correspond to a O6/D6/NS5/D8 bound state. Our analysis
   reveals that the domain wall energy computed in gauged SUGRA is
   unaffected by the localisation of the O6/D6 sources.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Design of novel artificial materials based on ferroelectric perovskites
   relies on the basic principles of electrostatic coupling and in-plane
   lattice matching. These rules state that the out-of-plane component of
   the electric displacement field and the in-plane components of the
   strain are preserved across a layered superlattice, provided that
   certain growth conditions are respected. Intense research is currently
   directed at optimizing materials functionalities based on these
   guidelines, often with remarkable success. Such principles, however, are
   of limited practical use unless one disposes of reliable data on how a
   given material behaves under arbitrary electrical and mechanical
   boundary conditions. Here we demonstrate, by focusing on the
   prototypical ferroelectrics PbTiO3 and BiFeO3 as test cases, how such
   information can be calculated from first principles in a systematic and
   efficient way. In particular, we construct a series of two-dimensional
   maps that describe the behavior of either compound (e.g., concerning the
   ferroelectric polarization and antiferrodistortive instabilities) at any
   conceivable choice of the in-plane lattice parameter, a, and
   out-of-plane electric displacement, D. In addition to being of immediate
   practical applicability to superlattice design, our results bring new
   insight into the complex interplay of competing degrees of freedom in
   perovskite materials and reveal some notable instances where the
   behavior of these materials depart from what naively is expected.}},

Title = {{Non-Darcy's law-based analytical models for data interpretation of
   high-pressure packer tests in fractured rocks}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{199}},
Pages = {{91-106}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{High-pressure packer test (HPPT) is an enhanced constant head packer
   test for characterizing the permeability or coupled hydromechanical
   properties of fractured rocks under high-pressure groundwater flow
   conditions. The interpretation of the HPPT data, however, requires
   further investigations due to the non-Darcy flow prone to occur in the
   tested rocks at high flow velocities. In this study, two analytical
   models were presented based on the Forchheimer's law and Izbash's law,
   respectively, for interpretation of the HPPT data, which can be readily
   reduced to Hvorslev equation in laminar flow condition. The proposed
   models were applied to data interpretation and hydraulic parameter
   estimation for the HPPTs performed in fractured sedimentary rocks
   located at about 450 m depth in central Hainan Island, and validated by
   numerical simulations on the tests. The results indicate that both of
   the proposed models well reproduce the non-Darcy flow behavior observed
   in the HPPTs before the initiation of hydraulic fracturing, Overall, the
   Forchheimer's law-based model is advantageous for its clear physical
   meanings, but the Izbash's law-based model could be more convenient when
   the obtained P-Q, curves are divided into different phases according to
   the flow conditions in the fracture system. Also pointed out were the
   theoretical flaws in an existing Izbash's law-based analytical model,
   which lead to a misestimate of hydraulic conductivity and an
   inconsistency between the analytical solutions and numerical results.

Title = {{Optimal Skin-to-Stone Distance Is a Positive Predictor for Successful
   Outcomes in Upper Ureter Calculi following Extracorporeal Shock Wave
   Lithotripsy: A Bayesian Model Averaging Approach}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Objectives
   To investigate whether skin-to-stone distance (SSD), which remains
   controversial in patients with ureter stones, can be a predicting factor
   for one session success following extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy
   (ESWL) in patients with upper ureter stones.
   Patients and Methods
   We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 1,519 patients who
   underwent their first ESWL between January 2005 and December 2013. Among
   these patients, 492 had upper ureter stones that measured 4-20 mm and
   were eligible for our analyses. Maximal stone length, mean stone density
   (HU), and SSD were determined on pretreatment non-contrast computed
   tomography (NCCT). For subgroup analyses, patients were divided into
   four groups. Group 1 consisted of patients with SSD<25th percentile,
   group 2 consisted of patients with SSD in the 25th to 50th percentile,
   group 3 patients had SSD in the 50th to 75th percentile, and group 4
   patients had SSD >= 75th percentile.
   Results
   In analyses of group 2 patients versus others, there were no statistical
   differences in mean age, stone length and density. However, the one
   session success rate in group 2 was higher than other groups (77.9\% vs.
   67.0\%; P = 0.032). The multivariate logistic regression model revealed
   that shorter stone length, lower stone density, and the group 2 SSD were
   positive predictors for successful outcomes in ESWL. Using the Bayesian
   model-averaging approach, longer stone length, lower stone density, and
   group 2 SSD can be also positive predictors for successful outcomes
   following ESWL.
   Conclusions
   Our data indicate that a group 2 SSD of approximately 10 cm is a
   positive predictor for success following ESWL.}},

Abstract = {{The mixing of aluminum nanoparticles with a metal containing oxidizer

   from 0.2 to 3.5 km/s, through their explosive content. They were used to
   initiate the detonation of a high explosive, the pentaerythritol
   tetranitrate. The pyrotechnic transduction of combustion into detonation
   was achieved with short length systems (<2 cm) and small amounts of
   energetic nanocomposites (similar to 100 mg) in semi-confined systems.

Abstract = {{Combining exothermic catalytic combustion heat on one side of a very
   high heat convective thin flat plate and endothermic catalytic reforming
   reaction on the other side, catalytic flat plate provides excellent heat
   integration into a compact fuel reformer system. Based on a
   two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model simulation
   results, a real world compact catalytic flat plate fuel reformer was
   built and experimentally evaluated its performance, for generating fuel
   cell grade hydrogen, in an actual high temperature polymer electrolyte
   membrane (PEM) fuel cell system. The two-dimensional CFD model helps to
   optimize various design parameters necessary to build the actual compact
   reformer and eliminated the uncertainties of heat and mass transfer
   coefficient values arise in one-dimensional CFD model. The performance
   of the compact catalytic flat plate fuel reformer was evaluated using a
   5-cell high temperature PEM fuel cell stack at 160 degrees C with
   reformate fed directly from the reformer to the anode stream of fuel
   cell stack. For performance comparison, a 5-cell high temperature PEM
   fuel cell stack was first evaluated with industry-standard pure hydrogen
   (0\% CO) as well as with various percentage of CO mixed hydrogen (2\% CO
   and 5\% CO). Experimental results showed that if the average cell
   voltage drop within 0.03-0.05 mV of a 5-cell high temperature PEM fuel
   cell stack would be acceptable then the reformate can be used at 160
   degrees C instead of pure hydrogen. The experimental results also
   indicated that the reformer will be able to provide actual fuel cell
   grade hydrogen that could be directly pumped from the compact catalytic
   flat plate fuel reformer into the high temperature PEM fuel cell stack.

Abstract = {{Multipolar electromagnetic phenomena in subwavelength resonators are at
   the heart of metamaterial science and technology. In this Rapid

   this analytical technique, we demonstrate the ability to drastically
   manipulate the scattering properties of a spherical NP by varying
   illumination properties and demonstrate the excitation of a longitudinal
   quadrupole mode that cannot be accessed with conventional illumination.
   This work enhances the understanding of fundamental light-matter

Abstract = {{This study presents a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) study of
   Dimethyl Ether steam reforming (DME-SR) in a large scale Circulating
   Fluidized Bed (CFB) reactor. The CFD model is based on Eulerian Eulerian
   dispersed flow and solved using commercial software (ANSYS FLUENT). The
   DME-SR reactions scheme and kinetics in the presence of a bifunctional
   catalyst of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3+ZSM-5 were incorporated in the model using
   in-house developed user-defined function. The model was validated by
   comparing the predictions with experimental data from the literature.
   The results revealed for the first time detailed CFB reactor
   hydrodynamics, gas residence time, temperature distribution and product
   gas composition at a selected operating condition of 300 degrees C and
   steam to DME mass ratio of 3 (molar ratio of 7.62). The spatial
   variation in the gas species concentrations suggests the existence of
   three distinct reaction zones but limited temperature variations. The
   DME conversion and hydrogen yield were found to be 87\% and 59\%
   respectively, resulting in a product gas consisting of 72 mol\%
   hydrogen. In part II of this study, the model presented here will be
   used to optimize the reactor design and study the effect of operating
   conditions on the reactor performance and products. (C) Copyright 2015,

Abstract = {{Coupled metasurfaces may refer to a composite plasmonic structure, which
   consists of multilayered but usually different metasurfaces. A pair of
   orthogonal plasmonic polarizers, which represents one of such systems,
   can induce a transmission of light and 90-degree polarization rotation.
   We explored the effect systematically and found that such effect may be
   highly efficient and broadband in the near-infrared region. By combining
   the low-loss metal (silver), the longer operating wavelength, and a work
   style using propagating waveguide mode, conversion efficiency more than
   80\% has been suggested near the telecom wavelength. We also suggested
   that, by overlapping the internal surface-plasmon (2, 0) and (1, 1)
   modes, an efficient and wideband polarization rotation can be realized.
   The maximal efficiency is 83\% around the wavelength 1340 nm, and the
   working bandwidth reaches 300 nm. Similar effect has also been revealed
   in the THz band. The results are useful for constructing compact and
   high-performance polarization rotators. (C) 2015 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{Purpose
   Ultrasound (US)-guided high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been
   proposed for noninvasive treatment of neuropathic pain and has been
   investigated in in-vivo studies. However, ultrasound has important
   limitations regarding treatment guidance and temperature monitoring.
   Magnetic resonance (MR)-imaging guidance may overcome these limitations
   and MR-guided HIFU (MR-HIFU) has been used successfully for other
   clinical indications. The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate
   the feasibility of utilizing 3D MR neurography to identify and guide
   ablation of peripheral nerves using a clinical MR-HIFU system.
   Methods
   Volumetric MR-HIFU was used to induce lesions in the peripheral nerves
   of the lower limbs in three pigs. Diffusion-prep MR neurography and
   T1-weighted images were utilized to identify the target, plan treatment
   and immediate post-treatment evaluation. For each treatment, one 8 or 12
   mm diameter treatment cell was used (sonication duration 20 s and 36 s,
   power 160-300 W). Peripheral nerves were extracted <3 hours after
   treatment. Ablation dimensions were calculated from thermal maps,
   post-contrast MRI and macroscopy. Histological analysis included
   standard H\&E staining, Masson's trichrome and toluidine blue staining.
   Results
   All targeted peripheral nerves were identifiable on MR neurography and
   T1-weighted images and could be accurately ablated with a single
   exposure of focused ultrasound, with peak temperatures of 60.3 to 85.7
   degrees C. The lesion dimensions as measured on MR neurography were
   similar to the lesion dimensions as measured on CE-T1, thermal dose
   maps, and macroscopy. Histology indicated major hyperacute peripheral
   nerve damage, mostly confined to the location targeted for ablation.
   Conclusion
   Our preliminary results indicate that targeted peripheral nerve ablation
   is feasible with MR-HIFU. Diffusion-prep 3D MR neurography has potential
   for guiding therapy procedures where either nerve targeting or avoidance
   is desired, and may also have potential for post-treatment verification
   of thermal lesions without contrast injection.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a dynamic Matlab SIMULINK model of the relationship
   between the fuel cell current set point of a Reformed Methanol Fuel Cell
   system and the output current of the system is developed. The model
   contains an estimated fuel cell model, based on a polarization curve and
   assumed first order dynamics, as well as a battery model based on an
   equivalent circuit model and a balance of plant power consumption model.
   The models are tuned with experimental data and verified using a
   verification data set. The model is used to develop an output current
   controller which can control the charge current of the battery. The
   controller is a PI controller with feedforward and anti-windup. The
   performance of the controller is tested and verified on the physical
   system. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published

Abstract = {{Photoionization is a process where absorption of one or several photons
   liberates an electron and creates a hole in a quantum system, such as an
   atom or a molecule. Is it faster to remove an electron using one or many
   photons, and how to define this time? Here we introduce a clock that
   allows us to define ionization time for both one-photon and many-photon
   ionization regimes. The clock uses the interaction of the electron or
   hole spin with the magnetic field created by their orbital motion, known
   as the spin-orbit interaction. The angle of spin precession in the
   magnetic field records time. We use the combination of analytical theory
   and ab initio calculations to show how ionization delay depends on the
   number of absorbed photons, how it appears in the experiment and what
   electron dynamics it signifies. In particular, we apply our method to
   calculate the derived time delays in tunneling regime of strong-field
   ionization.}},

Abstract = {{A one-step in situ tailoring of NiCo2S4 nanostructures is demonstrated
   on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) as Pt-free counter electrodes (CEs)
   for dyesensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with performance surpassing that
   of a conventional Pt-sputtered CE. An interconnected NiCo2S4 nanosheet
   network is successfully constructed on the FTO glass via a hydrothermal
   method, attributed to the synergistic effect of structure-directing
   hexamethylenetetramine and L-cysteine. A growth mechanism is proposed,
   and the effects of nanostructures and sulfur atomic percentages on the
   electrocatalytic performance are discussed in depth. A DSSC with the
   optimized interconnected NiCo2S4 nanosheet CE exhibits higher power
   conversion efficiency (7.22\%) compared to that with a conventional
   Pt-sputtered CE (6.87\%) due to excellent charge transport properties
   and enhanced electrocatalytic activity of the NiCo2S4 nanostructures.
   This work showcases the strong potential of nanostructured ternary
   chalcogenides, which are composed of earth-abundant elements and
   prepared through a single-step hydrothermal process without tedious
   posttreatments, to reduce the dependence of platinum in DSSCs and other
   electrochemical devices.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents experimental studies involving high pressure gaseous
   releases with specific attention to the non-adiabatic character of the
   process approaching cryogenic temperatures, especially when the
   influence of heat exchange with ambient air becomes important. A
   small-scale facility is designed and constructed to simulate the
   transient blow-down of a cryogenic fluid through a small break. Gaseous
   and liquid nitrogen were planned to be used as a surrogate material for
   GH2 and LH2. The experimental results complement the quasi-stationary
   safety regulation tests and provide time-dependent data for verification
   of the theoretical models. Different orifice sizes (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 mm)
   and initial vessel (over-) pressures 30-200 bar are used in the tests.
   The measured time-dependent data for vessel discharge pressure, thrust,
   discharge mass flow rate, and gas temperatures are compared with a
   theoretical model for high pressure nitrogen release. This verification
   for nitrogen also assures the equation of state for hydrogen, which is
   based on the same methodology. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy

   the radiative decay of intersubband plasmon excitations, which are

   well into a three terminal field effect transistor with a leaky gate.
   Depending on the current pathway, we observe either a purely thermal
   excitation (source to drain injection) or a combination between thermal
   and resonant excitations (gate to source and drain injection). The
   scaling of the optical power with the density of electrons in the
   channel is in excellent agreement with the superradiant nature of the

Abstract = {{Current efforts to characterize and study interstellar polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) rely heavily on theoretically predicted
   infrared (IR) spectra. Generally, such studies use the scaled harmonic
   frequencies for band positions and double harmonic approximation for
   intensities of species, and then compare these calculated spectra with
   experimental spectra obtained under matrix isolation conditions.
   High-resolution gas-phase experimental spectroscopic studies have
   recently revealed that the double harmonic approximation is not
   sufficient for reliable spectra prediction. In this paper, we present
   the anharmonic theoretical spectra of three PAHs: naphthalene,
   anthracene, and tetracene, computed with a locally modified version of
   the SPECTRO program using Cartesian derivatives transformed from
   Gaussian 09 normal coordinate force constants. Proper treatments of
   Fermi resonances lead to an impressive improvement on the agreement
   between the observed and theoretical spectra, especially in the C-H
   stretching region. All major IR absorption features in the full-scale
   matrix-isolated spectra, the high-temperature gas-phase spectra, and the
   most recent high-resolution gas-phase spectra obtained under
   supersonically cooled molecular beam conditions in the CH-stretching
   region are assigned. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The structural and optical properties of sputter deposited nitrogen (N)
   doped CuO (CuO(N)) thin films are systematically investigated. It is
   found that the incorporation of N into CuO causes an enlargement of
   optical bandgap and reduction in resistivity of the CuO(N) films.
   Furthermore, a gradual phase transformation from CuO to Cu2O is observed
   with the increase in N concentration. The effects of annealing
   temperature on the structural properties of CuO (N) and its dependence
   on N concentration are also investigated. It is observed that the phase
   transformation process from CuO to Cu2O significantly depends on the N
   concentration and the annealing temperature. Heterojunction solar cells
   of p-type CuO(N) on n-type silicon (Si) substrate, p-CuO(N)/n-Si, are
   fabricated to investigate the impact of N doping on its photovoltaic

Abstract = {{Small ruminant lentiviruses include viruses with diverse genotypes that
   frequently cross the species barrier between sheep and goats and that
   display a great genetic variability. These characteristics stress the
   need to consider the whole host range and to perform local surveillance
   of the viruses to opt for optimum diagnostic tests, in order to
   establish control programes. In the absence of effective vaccines, a
   comprehensive knowledge of the epidemiology of these infections is of
   major importance to limit their spread. This article intends to cover
   these aspects and to summarise information related to characteristics of
   the viruses, pathogenesis of the infection and description of the
   various syndromes produced, as well as the diagnostic tools available,
   the mechanisms involved in transmission of the pathogens and, finally,
   the control strategies that have been designed until now, with remarks
   on the drawbacks and the advantages of each one. We conclude that there
   are many variables influencing the expected cost and benefits of control
   programs that must be evaluated, in order to put into practice measures
   that might lead to control of these infections. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

   characterization in fluid}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{The characterization of nanoparticles is an important problem in many
   areas of applied physics, chemistry, medicine, and biology.
   Micromechanical resonators with embedded fluidic channels represent a
   powerful new technology for particle characterization through direct
   measurement of the buoyant mass of nanoparticles in solution with
   attogram resolution (1 ag = 10(-18) g). We recently showed that
   correlation analysis greatly expands the range of applications by
   enabling measurements of mass even when the individual particles are far
   lighter than the conventional detection limit. Here, we extend the
   concept of mass correlation spectroscopy further to simultaneously
   measure the ensemble-averaged size and mass of nanoparticles by
   exploiting size-dependent differences in hydrodynamic dispersion. To do
   so, we first derive an approximate model of the dispersion of
   finite-size particles flowing through amicro-fluidic channel of
   rectangular cross-section, valid in a large range of dispersion regimes.
   By including this solution into the model describing the correlation
   function of the time-domain mass signal acquired with a micromechanical
   resonator, information on particle size can be obtained during mass
   characterization without requiring anymodification of the devices. The
   validity of the analysis is corroborated both by numerical simulations
   and experimental measurements on nanoparticles of differentmaterials
   ranging from 15nm to 500 nm. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{n-3 PUFA such as EPA and DHA as well as oestrogen have been reported to
   decrease blood levels of cholesterol, but their underlying mechanism is
   unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of the
   combination of n-3 PUFA supplementation and oestrogen injection on
   hepatic cholesterol metabolism. Rats were fed a modified AIN-93G diet
   with 0, 1 or 2 \% n-3 PUFA (EPA+DHA) relative to the total energy intake
   for 12 weeks. Rats were surgically ovariectomised at week 8, and, after
   1-week recovery, rats were injected with 17 beta-oestradiol-3-benzoate
   (E-2) or maize oil for the last 3 weeks. Supplementation with n-3 PUFA
   and E-2 injection significantly increased the ratio of the hepatic
   expression of phosphorylated AMP activated protein kinase (p-AMPK):AMP
   activated protein kinase (AMPK) and decreased sterol regulatory
   element-binding protein-2, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A
   reductase and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9.
   Supplementation with n-3 PUFA increased hepatic expression of
   cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), sterol 12 alpha-hydroxylase
   (CYP8B1) and sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1); however, E-2 injection
   decreased CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 but not CYP27A1. Additionally, E-2 injection
   increased hepatic expression of oestrogen receptor-alpha and beta. In
   conclusion, n-3 PUFA supplementation and E-2 injection had synergic
   hypocholesterolaemic effects by down-regulating hepatic cholesterol
   synthesis (n-3 PUFA and oestrogen) and up-regulating bile acid synthesis
   (n-3 PUFA) in ovariectomised rats.}},

Abstract = {{Nuclear spin relaxation rates of H-2 and La-139 in LaCl3+(H2O)-H-2 and
   La(ClO4)(3)+(H2O)-H-2 solutions were determined as a function of
   pressure in order to demonstrate a new NMR probe designed for solution
   spectroscopy at geochemical pressures. The H-2 longitudinal relaxation
   rates (T-1) vary linearly to 1.6 GPa, consistent with previous work at
   lower pressures. The La-139 T-1 values vary both with solution chemistry
   and pressure, but converge with pressure, suggesting that the combined
   effects of increased viscosity and enhanced rates of ligand exchange
   control relaxation. This simple NMR probe design allows experiments on
   aqueous solutions to pressures corresponding roughly to those at the
   base of the Earth I s continental crust.}},

Abstract = {{Many natural cyclic peptides have potent and potentially useful
   biological activities. Their use as therapeutic starting points is often
   limited by the quantities available, the lack of known biological
   targets and the practical limits on diversification to fine-tune their
   properties. We report the use of enzymes from the cyanobactin family to
   heterocyclise and macrocyclise chemically synthesised substrates so as
   to allow larger-scale syntheses and better control over derivatisation.
   We have made cyclic peptides containing orthogonal reactive groups,
   azide or dehydroalanine, that allow chemical diversification, including
   the use of fluorescent labels that can help in target identification. We
   show that the enzymes are compatible and efficient with such unnatural
   substrates. The combination of chemical synthesis and enzymatic
   transformation could help renew interest in investigating natural cyclic
   peptides with biological activity, as well as their unnatural analogues,
   as therapeutics.}},

Title = {{Anti-Biofilm Activities from Marine Cold Adapted Bacteria Against
   Staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Microbial biofilms have great negative impacts on the world's economy
   and pose serious problems to industry, public health and medicine. The
   interest in the development of new approaches for the prevention and
   treatment of bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation has increased.
   Since, bacterial pathogens living in biofilm induce persistent chronic
   infections due to the resistance to antibiotics and host immune system.
   A viable approach should target adhesive properties without affecting
   bacterial vitality in order to avoid the appearance of resistant
   mutants. Many bacteria secrete anti-biofilm molecules that function in
   regulating biofilm architecture or mediating the release of cells from
   it during the dispersal stage of biofilm life cycle. Cold adapted marine
   bacteria represent an untapped reservoir of biodiversity able to
   synthesize a broad range of bioactive compounds, including anti-biofilm
   molecules. The anti-biofilm activity of cell-free supernatants derived
   from sessile and planktonic cultures of cold-adapted bacteria belonging
   to Pseudoalteromonas, Psychrobacter, and Psychromonas species were
   tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidertnidis, and
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. Reported results demonstrate that we
   have selected supernatants, from cold-adapted marine bacteria,
   containing non-biocidal agents able to destabilize biofilm matrix of all
   tested pathogens without killing cells. A preliminary physico-chemical
   characterization of supernatants was also performed, and these analyses
   highlighted the presence of molecules of different nature that act by
   inhibiting biofilm formation. Some of them are also able to impair the
   initial attachment of the bacterial cells to the surface, thus likely
   containing molecules acting as anti-biofilm surfactant molecules. The
   described ability of cold-adapted bacteria to produce effective
   anti-biofilm molecules paves the way to further characterization of the
   most promising molecules and to test their use in combination with
   conventional antibiotics.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{The Hubbard and spinless fermion chains are paradigms of strongly
   correlated systems, very well understood using the Bethe ansatz, density
   matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and field theory/renormalization
   group (RG) methods. They have been applied to one-dimensional materials
   and have provided important insights for understanding
   higher-dimensional cases. Recently, an interacting fermion model has
   been introduced, with possible applications to topological materials. It
   has a single Majorana fermion operator on each lattice site and
   interactions with the shortest possible range that involve four sites.
   We present a thorough analysis of the phase diagram of this model in one
   dimension using field-theory/RG and DMRG methods. It includes a gapped
   supersymmetric region and a gapless phase with coexisting Luttinger
   liquid and Ising degrees of freedom. In addition to a first-order
   transition, three critical points occur: tricritical Ising, Lifshitz,
   and a generalization of the commensurate-incommensurate transition. We
   also survey various gapped phases of the system that arise when the
   translation symmetry is broken by dimerization and find both trivial and
   topological phases with 0, 1, and 2 Majorana zero modes bound to the
   edges of the chain with open boundary conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The movement demands of the soccer extra time period are unknown despite
   the importance of this period of play. Data are presented for five
   English Premier League reserve team players who wore GPS ( 10 Hz)
   monitors during an official soccer match that required extra time to be
   played. Countermovement jump performance ( peak power output ( PPO) and
   jump height) and creatine kinase ( CK) concentrations were assessed
   before (- 24 h; baseline) and after (+ 24 h, + 48 h) match play. Players
   covered 14,106 +/- 859 m ( 109 +/- 7 m center dot min- 1) throughout the
   game. From 90 to 120 min, 3213 +/- 286 m were covered and 12 +/- 6
   sprints, 221 +/- 14 accelerations and 207 +/- 16 decelerations occurred.
   From 105 to 120 min, acceleration and deceleration parameters reduced by

   by 416.1 +/- 199.9W( 10.9\% +/- 4.4\%) and 155.1 +/- 34.8 W ( 4.1\% +/-

   performance markers reduced throughout match play and countermovement
   jump performance was impaired, while CK remained elevated, for at least
   48 h after the game. Interventions which maintain performance throughout
   a game and which enhance recovery in the days after 120 min of soccer
   match play warrant further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{The suitability of hydrogen as an energy management solution in a
   run-of-river hydropower plant in Central Italy is evaluated from a
   life-cycle perspective. Hydrogen production at off-peak hours via
   electrolysis is considered, as well as potential hydrogen storage in
   metal hydrides followed by hydrogen use at peak hours for power
   generation using fuel cell technology. Hydropower generation and
   hydrogen production are identified as the subsystems contributing most
   to the nine evaluated impact categories (e.g., global warming, abiotic
   depletion and cumulative energy demand). The renewable hydrogen produced
   shows a more favourable life-cycle environmental and energy performance
   than conventional hydrogen generated via steam methane reforming.
   Furthermore, when enlarging the system with hydrogen use for power
   generation, the renewable electricity product shows a better life-cycle
   profile than conventional electricity for the Italian electrical grid.
   Overall, under life-cycle aspects, hydrogen is found to be a suitable
   energy solution in hydropower plants both as a hydrogen product itself
   (e.g., for transportation) and as a feedstock for subsequent power
   generation at peak hours. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{We aimed to report environmental and blood lead level (BLL) in China,
   and investigate the relationship of BLL with body mass index (BMI) and
   obesity. 5558 subjects were enrolled from 16 sites in China. BLL was
   measured by atomic absorption spectrometry. Obesity was defined as BMI
   >= 30 kg/m(2). Median (interquartile range) of BLL was 44.00 mu g/L
   (29.00-62.16) for men and 37.79 mu g/L (25.13-54.35) for women, about
   twice higher than in U.S. population. Subjects in rural and
   high-economic-status areas had significantly greater BLL (P < 0.001).
   However, in these areas, the lead levels in drinking water, river water
   and rice were comparable to or significantly lower than those in urban
   and low-economic-status areas. After adjustment for age, urbanization,
   economic status and metabolic factors, BLL was independently associated
   with BMI in women (P for trend < 0.001), but not in men. In fully
   adjusted model, increased quartiles of BLL were associated with
   significantly increased odds ratios of obesity (P for trend < 0.01) in
   women. In conclusion, BLLs in Chinese adults were much higher than in
   developed countries. There was a sex-specific association between BLL
   and BMI. Elevated BLL does not appear to be associated with lead levels
   in drinking water or rice, suggesting some other exposure source.}},

Abstract = {{We propose and fabricate a wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM)
   compatible and multi-functional mode-division-multiplexing (MDM)
   integrated circuit, which can perform the mode conversion and
   multiplexing for the incoming multipath WDM signals, avoiding the
   wavelength conflict. An phase-to-intensity demodulation function can be
   optionally applied within the circuit while performing the mode
   multiplexing. For demonstration, 4 x 10 Gb/s non-return-to-zero
   differential phase shift keying (NRZ-DPSK) signals are successfully
   processed, with open and clear eye diagrams. Measured bit error ratio
   (BER) results show less than 1dB receive sensitivity variation for three
   modes and four wavelengths with demodulation. In the case without
   demodulation, the average power penalties at 4 wavelengths are -1.5, -3
   and -3.5 dB for TE0-TE0, TE0-TE1 and TE0-TE2 mode conversions,
   respectively. The proposed flexible scheme can be used at the interface
   of long-haul and on-chip communication systems. (C)2015 Optical Society

Abstract = {{We study two-dimensional bosonic symmetry-protected topological ( SPT)

   classified as Z(2) x Z(2) for even N and 0 ( no SPT phase) for odd N,
   while those protected by U(1) x R symmetry are Z(2). We point out that
   the two-dimensional Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki state of S = 2 spins on
   the square lattice is a Z(2) SPT phase protected by reflection and

Abstract = {{Single-phase inverters employ LC filters for the purpose of reducing
   pulse-width modulation harmonics. The drawback of LC filter is its
   stability problem at resonance frequency. Passive damping offers simple
   and reliable solution, but it decreases the overall system efficiency.
   Active damping is lossless and provides flexibility of controlling the
   damping performance; however, it is sensitive to parameters variation.
   This article presents stability analysis of a single-phase full-bridge
   inverter to improve dynamic performance and stability. Design of LC
   filter is carried out considering both undamped and damped structures.
   The effect of filter parameters on pole-zero locations of the inverter
   is presented, and variation of the phase margin over a wide range of
   parameters variation is examined. Active damping using closed-loop
   current control of the full-bridge inverter to mitigate the resonance
   oscillation is designed and compared with passive damping. The
   disturbance rejection via dynamic stiffness with and without active
   damping is examined to justify the proposed current controller.
   Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the
   effectiveness of the proposed design. It is found that the proposed
   control of the inverter provides excellent voltage regulation with low
   total harmonic distortion and ensures good performance and robust
   stability under parameters variation.}},

Abstract = {{Various genetic markers such as IS-elements, DR-elements, variable
   number tandem repeats (VNTR), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
   housekeeping genes and other groups of genes are being used for
   genotyping. We propose a different approach. We suggest the type II
   toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems, which play a significant role in the
   formation of pathogenicity, tolerance and persistence phenotypes, and
   thus in the survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the host organism
   at various developmental stages (colonization, infection of macrophages,
   etc.), as the marker genes. Most genes of TA systems function together,
   forming a single network: an antitoxin from one pair may interact with
   toxins from other pairs and even from other families. In this work a
   bioinformatics analysis of genes of the type II TA systems from 173
   sequenced genomes of M. tuberculosis was performed. A number of genes of
   type II TA systems were found to carry SNPs that correlate with specific
   genotypes. We propose a minimally sufficient set of genes of TA systems
   for separation of M. tuberculosis strains at nine basic genotype and for
   further division into subtypes. Using this set of genes, we genotyped a
   collection consisting of 62 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis. The
   possibility of using our set of genes for genotyping using PCR is also
   demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated numerically and experimentally the achievement of
   strongly localized electric field and significantly enhanced second
   harmonic generation (SHG) in two-dimensional (2D) materials by using
   dielectric-metal hybrid substrates. Based on the theory of thin film
   interference, it was revealed that the strongest localization of
   electric field in a 2D material, which corresponds to the largest
   absorption in the metal film, could be achieved by minimizing the
   reflection of the combined structure (i.e., 2D material + hybrid
   substrate) because the transmission through the combined structure was
   negligible. By using MoS2 as an example, it was demonstrated that a SHG
   enhancement factor of similar to 6 could be achieved in the 17-nm-thick
   MoS2 layer on an Au/SiO2 substrate as compared with the single-layer
   MoS2 on the commonly used SiO2/Si substrates with highly efficient SHG.
   By employing a SiO2-SnO2/Ag/SiO2 substrate in which a 20-nm-thick
   dielectric film of SiO2-SnO2 was inserted in between the MoS2 layer and
   the Ag film, a SHG enhancement factor as large as similar to 18 could be
   realized in the 9-nm-thick MoS2 layer. Numerical simulations based on
   the finite-difference time-domain technique were employed to derive the
   enhancement factors for SHG and it was revealed that for thick MoS2
   layers the SHG intensity is dominated mainly by the localization of
   electric field induced by the dielectric-metal hybrid substrates. The
   dependence of the SHG enhancement factor on the thickness of the MoS2
   layer was found to be modified when the dielectric-metal hybrid
   substrates were adopted. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Journal = {{DIAGNOSTIC PATHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Regulation of MMP expression by activation of mTOR
   signalling has been demonstrated for several tumor types, but has thus
   far not been confirmed in gastric cancer.
   Findings: The study compromised 128 patients who underwent gastric
   resection for cancer (66.4 \% male; 86 intestinal, 42 diffuse type).
   Immunohistochemical staining of MMPs was performed to analyse the
   topographical pattern of MMP expression at the tumor center and the
   invasive front, respectively. MMP2 showed higher expression at the
   invasive front compared to the tumor center, whereas MMP7 staining
   scores were higher in the tumor center, and there was no difference for
   MMP9. The expression of p-mTOR was higher in the tumor center than at
   the invasive front, with a similar trend for mTOR. For intestinal type
   gastric cancer there was a weak correlation of MMP9 with expression of
   mTOR in the tumor center. Otherwise, there was no correlation of the
   MMPs with mTOR. By treatment of MKN45 gastric cancer cells with
   rapamycin, a reduction of p-mTOR in the Western blot was achieved;
   however, expression of MMPs remained unaffected.
   Conclusions: Expression of MMP2 and MMP7 in gastric cancer is not
   associated with mTOR, MMP9 expression might be related to mTOR
   signalling in a subset of tumors.}},

Journal = {{CANCER CELL INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 12}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The incidence of gastric cancer is high in Chinese Tibetan.
   This study aimed to identify the differentially expressed microRNAs
   (miRNAs) and further explore their potential roles in Tibetan with
   gastric cancer so as to predict potential therapeutic targets.
   Methods: A total of 10 Tibetan patients (male: female = 6: 4) with
   gastric cancer were enrolled for isolation of matched gastric cancer and
   adjacent non-cancerous tissue samples. Affymetrix GeneChip microRNA 3.0
   Array was employed for detection of miRNA expression in samples.
   Differential expression analysis between two sample groups was analyzed
   using Limma package. Then, MultiMiR package was used to predict targets
   for miRNAs. Following, the target genes were put into DAVID (Database
   for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) to identify the
   significant pathways of miRNAs.
   Results: Using Limma package in R, a total of 27 differentially
   expressed miRNAs were screened out in gastric cancer, including 25
   down-regulated (e.g. hsa-miR-148a-3p, hsa-miR-148b-3p and
   hsa-miR-363-3p) and 2 up-regulated miRNAs. According to multiMiR
   package, a number of 1445 target genes (e.g. Wnt1, KLF4 and S1PR1) of 13
   differentially expressed miRNAs were screened out. Among those miRNAs,
   hsa-miR-148a-3p, hsa-miR-148b-3p and hsa-miR-363-3p were identified with
   the most target genes. Furthermore, three miRNAs were significantly
   enriched in numerous common cancer-related pathways, including ``Wnt
   signaling pathway{''}, ``MAPK signaling pathway{''} and ``Jak-STAT
   signaling pathway{''}.
   Conclusions: The present study identified a downregulation and
   enrichment in cancer-related pathways of hsa-miR148a-3p, hsa-miR-148b-3p
   and hsa-miR-363-3p in Tibetan with gastric cancer, which can be
   suggested as therapeutic targets.}},

Abstract = {{Ferroelectric Ba(Zr0.15Ti0.85)O-3 (BZT) thin films were deposited on

   temperature and oxygen gas pressure on the structural properties of the

   deposited at substrate temperature >= 600 degrees C, exhibited
   crystalline nature corresponding to perovskite phase structure. The
   mechanism explaining the dependence of the crystallinity of the BZT
   films on the substrate temperature is discussed. AFM data show the
   dependence of grain growth on oxygen partial pressure of the BZT thin
   films. The films deposited at 200 mT were found to have an average grain
   size of about 40 nm. The results were found to be in accordance with SEM
   analysis. Raman scattering spectral data were used to characterize the
   phonon modes of the BZT films at room temperature. Raman studies reveal
   the occurrence of multiple phases corresponding to the pinched-phase

Abstract = {{Background: Persistent airway infection is a hallmark feature of cystic

   demographics, medical and pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) histories were
   evaluated. The primary outcome was PEx occurrence at incident GAS
   culture. Secondary outcomes evaluated were changes in lung function and
   PEx frequency following GAS isolation. Isolates were assessed for
   extra-cellular virulence factor production capacity and ability to
   produce quorum sensing (AI-2). Isolates were genotyped using pulse-field
   gel electrophoresis (PFGE).
   Results: Fifteen individuals who cultured GAS twenty times were
   identified. At the time of GAS isolation, 47 \% (7/15) of subjects
   experienced a PEx and half of these (4/7) were severe. Individuals were
   more likely to have a PEx at the time of the index GAS isolate compared
   to the preceding visit (RR = 6.0, 95 \% CI 0.82-43.0, p = 0.08),
   particularly if GAS was the numerically dominant sputum pathogen (RR =
   6.5, 95 \% CI 1.00-43.0, p = 0.009). There were no changes in PEx
   frequency or rate of lung function decline following GAS. None of the
   patients developed chronic airways infection, bacteremia, necrotizing
   pneumonia or empyema. Susceptibility was universal to common
   anti-Streptococcal antibiotics and anti-Pseudomonal antibiotics commonly
   used in CF, with the exception of azithromycin. GAS isolates varied in
   their production of protease, DNase, and AI 2 but these did not
   correlate with PEx, and none produced elastase, chrondrotin sulfatase or
   H2O2. One patient had prolonged carriage with the same isolate and two
   patients had isolates with similar PFGE patterns.
   Conclusions: GAS was an uncommon lower respiratory pathogen of adults
   with CF. Identification of GAS in sputum was frequently associated with
   PEx, particularly when numerically dominant. However, transient GAS
   infection did not result in chronic infection nor appreciably change
   long-term disease trajectory.}},

Title = {{mGlu2 Receptor Agonism, but Not Positive Allosteric Modulation, Elicits
   Rapid Tolerance towards Their Primary Efficacy on Sleep Measures in Rats}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists are known to induce both
   cellular adaptations resulting in tolerance to therapeutic effects and
   withdrawal symptoms upon treatment discontinuation. Glutamate
   neurotransmission is an integral part of sleep-wake mechanisms, which
   processes have translational relevance for central activity and target
   engagement. Here, we investigated the efficacy and tolerance potential
   of the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR2/3) agonist LY354740
   versus mGluR2 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) JNJ-42153605 on
   sleep-wake organisation in rats. In vitro, the selectivity and potency
   of JNJ-42153605 were characterized. In vivo, effects on sleep measures
   were investigated in rats after once daily oral repeated treatment for 7
   days, withdrawal and consecutive re-administration of LY354740 (1-10
   mg/kg) and JNJ-42153605 (3-30 mg/kg). JNJ-42153605 showed high affinity,
   potency and selectivity at mGluR2. Binding site analyses and
   knowledge-based docking confirmed the specificity of JNJ-42153605 at the
   mGluR2 allosteric binding site. Acute LY354740 and JNJ-42153605
   dose-dependently decreased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time and
   prolonged its onset latency. Sub chronic effects of LY354740 on REM
   sleep measures disappeared from day 3 onwards, whereas those of
   JNJ-42153605 were maintained after repeated exposure. LY354740
   attenuated REM sleep homeostatic recovery, while this was preserved
   after JNJ-42153605 administration. JNJ-42153605 enhanced sleep
   continuity and efficiency, suggesting its potential as an add-on
   medication for impaired sleep quality during early stages of treatment.
   Abrupt cessation of JNJ-42153605 did not induce withdrawal phenomena and
   sleep disturbances, while the initial drug effect was fully reinstated
   after re-administration. Collectively, long-term treatment with
   JNJ-42153605 did not induce tolerance phenomena to its primary
   functional effects on sleep measures, nor adverse effects at withdrawal,
   while it promoted homeostatic recovery sleep. From the translational
   perspective, the present rodent findings suggest that mGluR2 positive
   allosteric modulation has therapeutic potential based on its superior
   long term efficacy over agonists in psychiatric disorders, particularly
   of those commonly occurring with REM sleep overdrive.}},

Journal = {{TRIALS}},

Abstract = {{Background: Physical activity (PA)/exercise have become an integral part
   of the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, current
   guidelines are difficult to put into action in this population due to a
   number of barriers, especially the lack of acceptable, feasible, and
   validated behavioral intervention strategies. The present manuscript
   reports the rationale, study design and methods, and design
   considerations of the Italian Diabetes and Exercise Study (IDES)-2, a
   randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of a behavior change
   strategy in increasing total daily PA and reducing sedentary time
   (SED-time) in patients with T2DM.
   Methods/Design: Starting 7 January 2014, the IDES\_2 began enrolling 300
   patients with known T2DM of at least 1-year duration in three tertiary
   referral outpatient Diabetes Clinics in Rome. Additional requirements
   are age 40 to 80 years, body mass index 27 to 40 kg/m(2), sedentary
   lifestyle, and physically inactive for at least 6 months, ability to
   walk 1.6 km without assistance, and eligibility after cardiovascular
   evaluation. Patients are randomized by center and within each center, by
   age and type of diabetes treatment to either the intervention or the
   control group. Patients in the intervention (INT) group (n = 150)
   receive theoretical and practical exercise counseling consisting of
   aggregated behavior change techniques (one individual theoretical
   counseling session plus eight twice-a-week individual theoretical and
   practical exercise counseling sessions) once a year for 3 years.
   Patients in the control (CON) group (n = 150), receive standard care,
   including general physician recommendations for daily PA. The primary
   outcomes are total daily PA and SED-time, as measured objectively by the
   use of an accelerometer. Secondary outcomes include physical fitness,
   modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, musculoskeletal disturbances,
   well-being/depression, and health-related quality of life.
   Discussion: The behavioral intervention strategy tested in the IDES\_2
   is based on solid theoretical grounds and uses several behavioral change
   techniques, two factors which were found to improve effectiveness of
   behavioral intervention. In addition, physicians and exercise
   specialists have been specifically trained for counselling/prescribing
   and supervising PA/exercise, respectively, in subjects suffering from
   metabolic disorders. Finally, the large sample size, the long study
   duration, and the objective measurement of PA allow statistically
   significant and scientifically robust conclusions to be drawn on the
   feasibility and efficacy of this intervention in T2DM patients.}},

   state energies and properties froma characteristic pattern found in
   frequency-domain spectra of isomerizing systems. This pattern-a dip in
   the spacings of certain barrier-proximal vibrational levels-can be
   understood using the concept of effective frequency, omega(eff). The
   method is applied to the cis-trans conformational change in the S-1
   state of C2H2 and the bond-breaking HCN-HNC isomerization. In both
   cases, the barrier heights derived from spectroscopic data agree
   extremely well with previous ab initio calculations. We also show that
   it is possible to distinguish between vibrational modes that are
   actively involved in the isomerization process and those that are
   passive bystanders.}},

Title = {{Chronic Stress During Adolescence Impairs and Improves Learning and
   Memory in Adulthood}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{HIGHLIGHTS
   This study tested the effects of adolescent-stress on adult learning and
   memory.
   Adolescent-stressed rats had enhanced reversal learning compared to
   unstressed rats.
   Adolescent stress exposure made working memory more vulnerable to
   disturbance.
   Adolescent-stress did not affect adult associative learning or reference
   memory.
   Exposure to acute stress can cause a myriad of cognitive impairments,
   but whether negative experiences continue to hinder individual as they
   age is not as well understood. We determined how chronic unpredictable
   stress during adolescence affects multiple learning and memory processes
   in adulthood. Using male Sprague Dawley rats, we measured learning (both
   associative and reversal) and memory (both reference and working)
   starting 110 days after completion of an adolescent-stress treatment. We
   found that adolescent-stress affected adult cognitive abilities in a
   context-dependent way. Compared to rats reared without stress,
   adolescent stressed rats exhibited enhanced reversal learning, an
   indicator of behavioral flexibility, but showed no change in associative
   learning and reference memory abilities. Working memory, which in humans
   is thought to underpin reasoning, mathematical skills, and reading
   comprehension, may be enhanced by exposure to adolescent stress.
   However, when adolescent stressed animals were tested after a novel
   disturbance, they exhibited a 5-fold decrease in working memory
   performance while unstressed rats continued to exhibit a linear learning
   curve. These results emphasize the capacity for stress during
   adolescence to transform the cognitive abilities of adult animals, even
   after stress exposure has ceased and animals have resided in safe
   environments for the majority of their lifespans.}},

Abstract = {{Baryon number density perturbations offer a possible route to

   Bjorken expansion. To that end we use a background-fluctuation splitting
   and a Bessel-Fourier decomposition for the fluctuating part of the fluid
   dynamical fields with respect to the azimuthal angle, the radius in the
   transverse plane, and rapidity. We examine how the time evolution of
   linear perturbations depends on the equation of state as well as on
   shear viscosity, bulk viscosity, and heat conductivity for modes with
   different azimuthal, radial, and rapidity wave numbers. Finally we
   discuss how this information is accessible to experiments in terms of
   the transverse and rapidity dependence of correlation functions for
   baryonic particles in high energy nuclear collisions.}},

Abstract = {{Transthyretin (TTR) is an amyloidogenic protein, the amyloidogenic
   potential of which is enhanced by a number of specific point mutations.
   The ability to inhibit TTR fibrillogenesis is known for several classes
   of compounds, including natural polyphenols, which protect the native
   state of TTR by specifically interacting with its thyroxine binding
   sites. Comparative analyses of the interaction and of the ability to
   protect the TTR native state for polyphenols, both stilbenoids and
   flavonoids, and some of their main metabolites have been carried out. A
   main finding of this investigation was the highly preferential binding
   of resveratrol and thyroxine, both characterized by negative binding
   cooperativity, to distinct sites in TTR, consistent with the data of
   x-ray analysis of TTR in complex with both ligands. Although revealing
   the ability of the two thyroxine binding sites of TTR to discriminate
   between different ligands, this feature has allowed us to evaluate the
   interactions of polyphenols with both resveratrol and thyroxine
   preferential binding sites, by using resveratrol and radiolabeled T4 as
   probes. Among flavonoids, genistein and apigenin were able to
   effectively displace resveratrol from its preferential binding site,
   whereas genistein also showed the ability to interact, albeit weakly,
   with the preferential thyroxine binding site. Several glucuronidated
   polyphenol metabolites did not exhibit significant competition for
   resveratrol and thyroxine preferential binding sites and lacked the
   ability to stabilize TTR. However, resveratrol-3-O-sulfate was able to
   significantly protect the protein native state. A rationale for the in
   vitro properties found for polyphenol metabolites was provided by x-ray
   analysis of their complexes with TTR.}},

Abstract = {{Photochemical vapor generation (PVG) sample introduction coupled to
   inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) is described for
   the determination of As in seawater. A Plackett-Burman design (PBD) and
   central composite design (CCD) were employed to evaluate the
   significance of experimental variables relevant to the optimization of
   PVG-ICPMS detection. The impact of the saline matrix on the suppression
   of analyte signal was eliminated by use of a mixture of 20\% (v/v)
   formic and 20\% acetic acid (v/v) as the photochemical reductants.
   Optimized conditions yielded equivalent PVG generation efficiencies for
   As(III), As(V), monomethylarsonic acids (MMAs) and dimethylarsinic acids
   (DMAs), permitting direct and rapid determination of total arsenic in
   seawater without any other sample pretreatment. Quantitation was
   accomplished using one point gravimetric standard addition along with a
   spike of Se-82 internal standard to compensate for signal drift and
   fluctuation during analysis. The resulting method detection limit of 3
   pg g(-1) (3 sigma) provided a 15-fold improvement over that obtained
   using direct solution nebulization, and is comparable to that for
   conventional chemical hydride generation (HG)-ICPMS. Accuracy was
   demonstrated by analysis of two Certified Reference Materials (NASS-6
   and CASS-5 seawater) with satisfying results characterized by precisions
   of 3.5\% and 3.2\% RSD for CASS-5 and NASS-6, respectively. Crown

Abstract = {{Manufacturing high-value added biotech biopharmaceutical products (e.g.
   therapeutic proteins) requires quick-to-develop, GMP-compliant,
   easy-to-scale and cost effective preparatory chromatography
   technologies. In this work, we describe the construction and testing of
   a set of 5-mm inner diameter stainless steel toroidal columns for use on
   commercially available preparatory scale synchronous J-type
   countercurrent chromatography (CCC) machinery. We used a 20.2 m long
   column with an aqueous two-phase system containing 14\% (w/w) PEG1000
   and 14\% (w/w) potassium phosphate at pH 7, and tested a sample loading
   of 5\% column volume and a mobile phase flow rate of 20 ml/min. We then
   satisfactorily demonstrated the potential for a weekly protein
   separation and preparation throughput of ca. 11 g based on a normal
   weekly routine for separating a pair of model proteins by making five
   stacked injections on a single portion of stationary phase with no

Abstract = {{We study the sources of biases and systematics in the derivation of
   galaxy properties from observational studies, focusing on stellar
   masses, star formation rates, gas and stellar metallicities, stellar
   ages, magnitudes and colours. We use hydrodynamical cosmological
   simulations of galaxy formation, for which the real quantities are
   known, and apply observational techniques to derive the observables. We
   also analyse biases that are relevant for a proper comparison between
   simulations and observations. For our study, we post-process the
   simulation outputs to calculate the galaxies' spectral energy
   distributions (SEDs) using stellar population synthesis models and also
   generate the fully consistent far-UV-submillimetre wavelength SEDs with
   the radiative transfer code SUNRISE. We compared the direct results of
   simulations with the observationally derived quantities obtained in
   various ways, and found that systematic differences in all studied
   galaxy properties appear, which are caused by: (1) purely observational
   biases, (2) the use of mass-weighted and luminosity-weighted quantities,
   with preferential sampling of more massive and luminous regions, (3) the
   different ways of constructing the template of models when a fit to the
   spectra is performed, and (4) variations due to different calibrations,
   most notably for gas metallicities and star formation rates. Our results
   show that large differences can appear depending on the technique used
   to derive galaxy properties. Understanding these differences is of
   primary importance both for simulators, to allow a better judgement of
   similarities and differences with observations, and for observers, to
   allow a proper interpretation of the data.}},

   Base Discrimination}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{Nanopores are a promising platform in next generation DNA sequencing. In
   this platform, an individual DNA strand is threaded into nanopore using
   an electric field, and enzyme-based ratcheting is used to move the
   strand through the detector. During this process the residual ion
   current through the pore is measured, which exhibits unique levels for
   different base combinations inside the pore. While this approach has
   shown great promise, accuracy is not optimal because the four bases are
   chemically comparable to one another, leading to small differences in
   current obstruction. Nucleobase-specific chemical tagging can be a
   viable approach to enhancing the contrast between different bases in the
   sequence. Herein we show that covalent modification of one or both of
   the pyrimidine bases by an osmium bipyridine complex leads to
   measureable differences in the blockade amplitudes of DNA molecules. We
   qualitatively determine the degree of osmylation of a DNA strand by
   passing it through a solid-state nanopore, and are thus able to gauge T
   and C base content. In addition, we show that osmium bipyridine reacts
   with dsDNA, leading to substantially different current blockade levels
   than exhibited for bare dsDNA. This work serves as a proof of principle
   for nanopore sequencing and mapping via base-specific DNA osmylation.}},

Title = {{The Impact of Ambulance and Patient Diversion on Crowdedness of Multiple
   Emergency Departments in a Region}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{Emergency department (ED) overcrowding threatens healthcare quality.
   Ambulance diversion (AD) may relieve ED overcrowding; however, diverting
   patients from an overcrowded ED will load neighboring EDs with more
   patients and may result in regional overcrowding. The purpose of this
   study was to evaluate the impact of different diversion strategies on
   the crowdedness of multiple EDs in a region. The importance of regional
   coordination was also explored. A queuing model for patient flow was
   utilized to develop a computer program for simulating AD among EDs in a
   region. Key parameters, including patient arrival rates, percentages of
   patients of different acuity levels, percentage of patients transported
   by ambulance, and total resources of EDs, were assigned based on real
   data. The crowdedness indices of each ED and the regional crowdedness
   index were assessed to evaluate the effectiveness of various AD
   strategies. Diverting patients equally to all other EDs in a region is
   better than diverting patients only to EDs with more resources. The
   effect of diverting all ambulance-transported patients is similar to
   that of diverting only low-acuity patients. To minimize regional
   crowdedness, ambulatory patients should be sent to proper EDs when AD is
   initiated. Based on a queuing model with parameters calibrated by real
   data, patient flows of EDs in a region were simulated by a computer
   program. From a regional point of view, randomly diverting ambulatory
   patients provides almost no benefit. With regards to minimizing the
   crowdedness of the whole region, the most promising strategy is to
   divert all patients equally to all other EDs that are not already
   crowded. This result implies that communication and coordination among
   regional hospitals are crucial to relieve overall crowdedness. A
   regional coordination center may prioritize AD strategies to optimize ED
   utility.}},

Volume = {{418}},
Pages = {{89-97}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative H-1 selective saturation transfer NMR spectroscopy (H-1 SST
   qNMR) was used to fully describe the milieu dependent dynamics of the
   isomeric system of D-erythrose. Thermodynamic activation parameters are
   calculated for acidic as well as for basic catalysis combining
   McConnell's modified Bloch equations for the chemical exchange solved
   for the constraint of saturating the non-hydrated acyclic isomer, the
   Eyring equation and Hudson's equation for pH dependent catalysis. A
   detailed mathematical examination describing the milieu dependent
   dynamics of sugar isomerisation is provided. Thermodynamic data show
   evidence that photo-catalysed sugar isomerisation as well as degradation
   has to be considered. Approximations describing the pH and temperature
   dependence of thermodynamic activation parameters are derived that
   indicate the possibility of photo-affecting equilibrium constants.
   Moreover, the results show that isomerisation dynamics are closely
   related to degradation kinetics and that sugars' reactivities are
   altered by the concentration of acyclic carbonyl isomer and the sum of
   its ring closing rate constants. Additionally, it is concluded that
   sugar solutions show a limited self-stabilising behaviour. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Eclipsing binaries play pivotal roles in our understanding of stellar
   properties. In the era of all-sky surveys, thousands of eclipsing
   binaries have been charted, yet their light curves remain unexplored.
   The goal of this work is to use time series and colour information to
   extract physical parameters of the binary systems when the spectroscopic
   information is not available. Inspired by the work of Devor et al., we
   use the Detached Eclipsing Binary Light curve fitter (DEBiL) and the
   Method for Eclipsing Component Identification (MECI) to derive basic
   properties of the binary systems identified by the Catalina Sky Surveys.
   We derive the mass, fractional radius, and age for 2170 binary systems.
   We report 211 eccentric systems and compare their properties to the
   tidal circularization theory. From the mass estimate, we present a
   subsample of low-mass M-dwarfs which warrant further follow-up to test
   the stellar models at the low-mass regime. With MECI, we are able to
   estimate the distance to individual eclipsing binary system and use them
   to probe the large-scale structure of the Milky Way. We demonstrate that
   DEBiL and MECI are instrumental to investigate eclipsing binary light
   curves in the era of all-sky surveys, and provide estimates of stellar
   parameters when the spectroscopic information is not available.}},

Abstract = {{Among lentiviruses, HIV Type 2 (HIV-2) and many simian immunodeficiency
   virus (SIV) strains replicate rapidly in nondividing macrophages,
   whereas HIV Type 1 (HIV-1) replication in this cell type is kinetically
   delayed. The efficient replication capability of HIV-2/SIV in
   non-dividing cells is induced by a unique, virally encoded accessory
   protein, Vpx, which proteasomally degrades the host antiviral
   restriction factor, SAM domain-and HD domain-containing protein 1
   (SAMHD1). SAMHD1 is a dNTPase and kinetically suppresses the reverse
   transcription step of HIV-1 in macrophages by hydrolyzing and depleting
   cellular dNTPs. In contrast, Vpx, which is encoded by HIV-2/SIV,
   kinetically accelerates reverse transcription by counteracting SAMHD1
   and then elevating cellular dNTP concentration in non-dividing cells.
   Here, we conducted the presteady-state kinetic analysis of reverse
   transcriptases (RTs) from two Vpx non-coding and two Vpx coding
   lentiviruses. At all three sites of the template tested, the two RTs of
   the Vpx noncoding viruses (HIV-1) displayed higher k(pol) values than
   the RTs of the Vpx coding HIV-2/SIV, whereas there was no significant
   difference in the K-d values of these two groups of RTs. When we
   employed viral RNA templates that induce RT pausing by their secondary
   structures, the HIV-1 RTs showed more efficient DNA synthesis through
   pause sites than the HIV-2/SIV RTs, particularly at low dNTP
   concentrations found in macrophages. This kinetic study suggests that
   RTs of the Vpx non-coding HIV-1 may have evolved to execute a faster
   k(pol) step, which includes the conformational changes and incorporation
   chemistry, to counteract the limited dNTP concentration found in
   non-dividing cells and still promote efficient viral reverse
   transcription.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the growth of matter fluctuations in holographic dark
   energy cosmologies. First, we use an overall statistical analysis
   involving the latest observational data in order to place constraints on
   the cosmological parameters. Then we test the range of validity of the
   holographic dark energy models at the perturbation level and its
   variants from the concordance Lambda cosmology. Specifically, we provide
   a new analytical approach in order to derive, for the first time, the
   growth index of matter perturbations. Considering a homogeneous
   holographic dark energy, we find that the growth index is gamma
   approximate to 4/7 which is somewhat larger (similar to 4.8\%) than that
   of the usual Lambda cosmology, gamma((Lambda)) approximate to 6/11.
   Finally, if we allow clustering in the holographic dark energy models,
   then the asymptotic value of the growth index is given in terms of the
   effective sound speed c(eff)(2), namely, gamma approximate to
   3(1-c(eff)(2))/7.}},

Abstract = {{Labyrinthine patterns arise in two-dimensional physical systems
   submitted to competing interactions, in fields ranging from solid-state
   physics to hydrodynamics. For systems of interacting particles,
   labyrinthine and stripe phases were studied in the context of colloidal
   particles confined into a monolayer, both numerically by means of Monte
   Carlo simulations and experimentally using superparamagnetic particles.
   Here we report an experimental observation of a labyrinthine phase in an
   out-of-equilibrium system constituted of macroscopic particles. Once
   sufficiently magnetized, they organize into short chains of particles in
   contact and randomly orientated. We characterize the transition from a
   granular gas state towards a solid labyrinthine phase, as a function of
   the ratio of the interaction strength to the kinetic agitation. The
   spatial local structure is analyzed by means of accurate particle
   tracking. Moreover, we explain the formation of these chains using a
   simple model.}},

Abstract = {{Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is the largest desalinated water producer
   in the world, and it currently produces about one-fifth of the world
   productions. KSA government considers seawater desalination as the
   strategic option to alleviate water scarcity problem, and to meet the
   country's ever-growing domestic water demand. This research reviews the
   KSA desalination industry performance since inception to date; forecasts
   desalination water demand up to year 2040 in the context of three
   scenarios optimistic, moderate, and pessimistic; discusses the future of
   desalination industry as a strategic domestic water supply source and
   highlights its challenges. Results show that KSA will need about 2.0,
   3.2, and 4.5 billion m(3)/year of desalinated water in the year 2040
   based on optimistic, moderate, and pessimistic scenarios, respectively.
   The review of Saudi initiatives shows that KSA government effectively
   considered seawater desalination as strategic option, and implemented a
   comprehensive set of initiatives to realize this option. Moreover, the
   on-going desalination industry initiatives, coupled with some
   improvements, will satisfy the desalinated water demand on short-term
   basis. However, the long-term ability of desalination industry to meet
   the ever-increasing domestic water demand remains a valid concern,
   especially, if the moderate or pessimistic scenario is realized.}},

Abstract = {{We extend the halo occupation distribution ( HOD) framework to generate
   mock galaxy catalogues exhibiting varying levels of `galactic
   conformity', which has emerged as a potentially powerful probe of
   environmental effects in galaxy evolution. Our model correlates galaxy
   colours in a group with the concentration of the common parent dark halo
   through a `group quenching efficiency'. rho which makes older, more
   concentrated haloes at fixed mass preferentially host redder galaxies.
   We find that, for a specific value of rho this 1-halo conformity matches
   corresponding measurements in a group catalogue based on the Sloan
   Digital Sky Survey. Our mocks also display conformity at large
   separations from isolated objects, potentially an imprint of halo
   assembly bias. A detailed study - using mocks with assembly bias erased
   while keeping 1-halo conformity intact - reveals a rather nuanced
   situation, however. At separations less than or similar to 4 Mpc,
   conformity is mainly a 1-halo effect dominated by the largest haloes and
   is not a robust indicator of assembly bias. Only at very large
   separations (greater than or similar to 8 Mpc) does genuine 2-halo
   conformity, driven by the assembly bias of small haloes, manifest
   distinctly. We explain all these trends in standard halo model terms.
   Our model opens the door to parametrized HOD analyses that
   self-consistently account for galactic conformity at all scales.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-dimensional proteomic analyses provide different layers of protein
   information, including protein abundance and post-translational
   modifications. Here, we report an integrated analysis of protein
   expression, phosphorylation, and N-glycosylation by serial enrichments
   of phosphorylation and N-glycosylation (SEPG) from the same tissue
   samples. On average, the SEPG identified 142,106 unmodified peptides of
   8,625 protein groups, 18,846 phosphopeptides (15,647 phosphosites), and
   4,019 N-glycopeptides (2,634 N-glycosites) in tumor and adjacent normal
   tissues from three gastric cancer patients. The combined analysis of
   these data showed that the integrated analysis additively improved the
   coverages of gastric cancer-related protein networks; phosphoproteome
   and N-glycoproteome captured predominantly low abundant signal proteins,
   and membranous or secreted proteins, respectively, while global proteome
   provided abundances for general population of the proteome. Therefore,
   our results demonstrate that the SEPG can serve as an effective approach
   for multi-dimensional proteome analyses, and the holistic profiles of
   protein expression and PTMs enabled improved interpretation of
   disease-related networks by providing complementary information.}},

Title = {{Airway Segmentation and Centerline Extraction from Thoracic CT -
   Comparison of a New Method to State of the Art Commercialized Methods}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Introduction
   Our motivation is increased bronchoscopic diagnostic yield and optimized
   preparation, for navigated bronchoscopy. In navigated bronchoscopy,
   virtual 3D airway visualization is often used to guide a bronchoscopic
   tool to peripheral lesions, synchronized with the real time video
   bronchoscopy. Visualization during navigated bronchoscopy, the
   segmentation time and methods, differs. Time consumption and logistics
   are two essential aspects that need to be optimized when integrating
   such technologies in the interventional room. We compared three
   different approaches to obtain airway centerlines and surface.
   Method
   CT lung dataset of 17 patients were processed in Mimics (Materialize,
   Leuven, Belgium), which provides a Basic module and a Pulmonology module
   (beta version) (MPM), OsiriX (Pixmeo, Geneva, Switzerland) and our Tube
   Segmentation Framework (TSF) method. Both MPM and TSF were evaluated
   with reference segmentation. Automatic and manual settings allowed us to
   segment the airways and obtain 3D models as well as the centrelines in
   all datasets. We compared the different procedures by user interactions
   such as number of clicks needed to process the data and quantitative
   measures concerning the quality of the segmentation and centrelines such
   as total length of the branches, number of branches, number of
   generations, and volume of the 3D model.
   Results
   The TSF method was the most automatic, while the Mimics Pulmonology
   Module (MPM) and the Mimics Basic Module (MBM) resulted in the highest
   number of branches. MPM is the software which demands the least number
   of clicks to process the data. We found that the freely available OsiriX
   was less accurate compared to the other methods regarding segmentation
   results. However, the TSF method provided results fastest regarding
   number of clicks. The MPM was able to find the highest number of
   branches and generations. On the other hand, the TSF is fully automatic
   and it provides the user with both segmentation of the airways and the
   centerlines. Reference segmentation comparison averages and standard
   deviations for MPM and TSF correspond to literature.
   Conclusion
   The TSF is able to segment the airways and extract the centerlines in
   one single step. The number of branches found is lower for the TSF
   method than in Mimics. OsiriX demands the highest number of clicks to
   process the data, the segmentation is often sparse and extracting the
   centerline requires the use of another software system. Two of the
   software systems performed satisfactory with respect to be used in
   preprocessing CT images for navigated bronchoscopy, i.e. the TSF method
   and the MPM. According to reference segmentation both TSF and MPM are
   comparable with other segmentation methods. The level of automaticity
   and the resulting high number of branches plus the fact that both
   centerline and the surface of the airways were extracted, are
   requirements we considered particularly important. The in house method
   has the advantage of being an integrated part of a navigation platform
   for bronchoscopy, whilst the other methods can be considered
   preprocessing tools to a navigation system.}},

   Communities of the Tapajos River Basin, Amazon, Brazil: Exposure to
   Methylmercury Is Possibly Involved}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this work was to evaluate the somatosensory system of
   methylmercury-exposed inhabitants living in the communities of the
   Tapajos river basin by using psychophysical tests and to compare with
   measurements performed in inhabitants of the Tocantins river basin. We
   studied 108 subjects from Barreiras and Sao Luiz do Tapajos, two
   communities of the Tapajos river basin, State of Para, Amazon, Brazil,
   aged 13-53 years old. Mercury analysis was performed in head hair
   samples weighting 0.1-0.2 g by using atomic absorption spectrometry.
   Three somatosensory psychophysical tests were performed: tactile
   sensation threshold, vibration sensation duration, and two-point
   discrimination. Semmes-Weinstein 20 monofilaments with different
   diameters were used to test the tactile sensation in the lower lip,
   right and left breasts, right and left index fingers, and right and left
   hallux. The threshold was the thinner monofilament perceived by the
   subject. Vibration sensation was investigated using a 128 Hz diapason
   applied to the sternum, right and left radial sides of the wrist, and
   right and left outer malleoli. Two trials were performed at each place.
   A stopwatch recorded the vibration sensation duration. The two-point
   discrimination test was performed using a two-point discriminator. Head
   hair mercury concentration was significantly higher in mercury-exposed
   inhabitants of Tapajos than in non-exposed inhabitants of Tocantins (p <
   0.01). When all subjects were divided in two groups independently of
   age-mercury-exposed and non-exposed-the following results were found:
   tactile sensation thresholds in mercury-exposed subjects were higher
   than in non-exposed subjects at all body parts, except at the left
   chest; vibration sensation durations were shorter in mercury-exposed
   than in non-exposed subjects, at all locations except in the upper
   sternum; two-point discrimination thresholds were higher in mercury
   exposed than in non-exposed subjects at all body parts. There was a weak
   linear correlation between tactile sensation threshold and mercury
   concentration in the head hair samples. No correlation was found for the
   other two measurements. Mercury-exposed subjects had impaired
   somatosensory function compared with non-exposed control subjects.
   Long-term mercury exposure of riverside communities in the Tapajos river
   basin is a possible but not a definitely proven cause for psychophysical
   somatosensory losses observed in their population. Additionally, the
   relatively simple psychophysical measures used in this work should be
   followed by more rigorous measures of the same population.}},

Abstract = {{Recent observations of the Crab nebula (Rudy et al.) have maintained its
   reputation for high-energy astrophysical enlightenment and its use as a
   test-bed for theories of the behaviour of magnetized, relativistic
   plasma. In particular, new observations of the inner knot located 0.65
   arcsec SE from the pulsar confirm that it is compact, elongated
   transversely to the symmetry axis and curved concave towards the pulsar.
   60 per cent polarization has been measured along the symmetry axis
   (Moran et al.). The knot does not appear to be involved in the gamma-ray
   flares. The new observations both reinforce the interpretation of the
   knot as dissipation of the pulsar wind at a strong shock and challenge
   the details of existing models of this process. In particular, it is
   argued that the compactness, high polarization, and curvature are
   difficult to reconcile with simple relativistic shock models.
   Alternative possibilities include deflection of the outflow ahead of the
   shock and spatial variation in which the knot is interpreted as a
   caustic. Some future observations are proposed and new theoretical
   investigations are suggested.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of premating ewe
   weight and age on ewe reproductive performance, lamb growth and survival
   in Central Anatolian Merino (CAM) sheep.
   The trial included 4935 ewes and 5548 lambs from 23 breeder flocks in
   Eskisehir Province. The live weights (LWs) and ages of the ewes were
   recorded 1 week before the mating season. The number of lambs born,
   fertility rate, multiple birth rate (MBR), and lamb survival rate (SR)
   at days 75 and 120 were determined. The effects of the LW and age of the
   ewe were found to be important for the reproductive performance of ewes
   and for the lamb's growth rate (P < 0.05-0.001). Ewe MBRs and the birth
   weight (BW) and LW of the lambs at days 75 and 120 increased
   proportionally with the increase in LW in ewes prior to mating. The
   fertility rate and MBR were lower (P < 0.05-0.001) in 1.5-year-old ewes
   than in older ewes. However, lambs' SR at days 75 and 120 were not
   affected by the premating LW and age of the ewe. In summary, a better
   reproductive performance and lamb growth rate in CAM flocks may be
   achieved by the selection of breeding ewes from ewes weighing more than
   60 kg.}},

Title = {{Assessing Ebola-related web search behaviour: insights and implications
   from an analytical study of Google Trends-based query volumes}},
Journal = {{INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: The 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa has attracted public
   interest worldwide, leading to millions of Ebola-related Internet
   searches being performed during the period of the epidemic. This study
   aimed to evaluate and interpret Google search queries for terms related
   to the Ebola outbreak both at the global level and in all countries
   where primary cases of Ebola occurred. The study also endeavoured to
   look at the correlation between the number of overall and weekly web
   searches and the number of overall and weekly new cases of Ebola.
   Methods: Google Trends (GT) was used to explore Internet activity
   related to Ebola. The study period was from 29 December 2013 to 14 June
   2015. Pearson's correlation was performed to correlate Ebola-related
   relative search volumes (RSVs) with the number of weekly and overall
   Ebola cases. Multivariate regression was performed using Ebola-related
   RSV as a dependent variable, and the overall number of Ebola cases and
   the Human Development Index were used as predictor variables.
   Results: The greatest RSV was registered in the three West African
   countries mainly affected by the Ebola epidemic. The queries varied in
   the different countries. Both quantitative and qualitative differences
   between the affected African countries and other Western countries with
   primary cases were noted, in relation to the different flux volumes and
   different time courses. In the affected African countries, web query
   search volumes were mostly concentrated in the capital areas. However,
   in Western countries, web queries were uniformly distributed over the
   national territory. In terms of the three countries mainly affected by
   the Ebola epidemic, the correlation between the number of new weekly
   cases of Ebola and the weekly GT index varied from weak to moderate. The
   correlation between the number of Ebola cases registered in all
   countries during the study period and the GT index was very high.
   Conclusion: Google Trends showed a coarse-grained nature, strongly
   correlating with global epidemiological data, but was weaker at country
   level, as it was prone to distortions induced by unbalanced media
   coverage and the digital divide. Global and local health agencies could
   usefully exploit GT data to identify disease-related information needs
   and plan proper communication strategies, particularly in the case of
   health-threatening events.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, we have synthesized biocompatible hybrid blend of
   cellulosic polymers of hydroxypropyl-methyl-cellulose (HPMC) and
   chitosan (CHY) for the immobilization of Candida rugosa lipase (CRL).
   The immobilized biocatalyst HPMC:CHY:CRL was subjected for
   characterization such as SEM, TGA, water content analysis, lipase
   activity, specific activity and protein content analysis. The kinetic
   parameter study (R-max/K-m) demonstrated improved biocatalytic activity
   of lipase after immobilization on carbohydrate co-polymers of HPMC:CHY.
   This biocatalyst was then employed to study practical biocatalytic
   applications for kinetic resolution which provided 50\% conversion and
   >94\% enantiomeric excess of substrate/product (ees/eep). The protocol
   demonstrated excellent recyclability upto five cycles. Finally, we
   studied influence of immobilization on cellulosic polymers for
   substrate, structure and reactivity for kinetic resolution. Hence, we
   investigated R-0 (initial reaction rate), E-value (enantioselectivity)
   and E-a (activation energy). This study confirms that, lipase
   immobilized on carbohydrate polymers had 3-4 folds higher biocatalytic
   activity as compared to crude CRL. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Given a first set of observations from a design of experiments sampled
   randomly in the design space, the corresponding set of non-dominated
   points usually does not give a good approximation of the Pareto front.
   We propose here to study this problem from the point of view of
   multivariate analysis, introducing a probabilistic framework with the
   use of copulas. This approach enables the expression of level lines in
   the objective space, giving an estimation of the position of the Pareto
   front when the level tends to zero. In particular, when it is possible
   to use Archimedean copulas, analytical expressions for Pareto front
   estimators are available. Several case studies illustrate the interest
   of the approach, which can be used at the beginning of the optimization
   when sampling randomly in the design space. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Academic and corporate interest in reverse logistics (RL) has risen
   considerably in recent years. In this context, the objective of this
   study was to identify the drivers that enable RL practice in an emerging
   economy. Firstly, international peer-reviewed publications on RL were
   used to develop a RL environment framework representing the main RL
   internal and external influences. Secondly, a case-based research was
   conducted in a large manufacturing company located in Southern Brazil.
   The results indicated that the most cited driver in the RL literature,
   the government and legislation, was not a main influence on the studied
   company. Environmental legislation is still limited in the country and
   struggles to provide incentives to increase materials recycling. An
   economic factor related to materials value recovery was also found to
   drive the backward flow. Finally, knowledge of the RL driving forces may
   support industries to better implement and manage reverse flows and to
   bridge the gap between existing and future solutions for reverse supply
   chains.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we describe the most promising small synthetic organic compounds

   amino acids, which catalyzes two sequential reactions: (i)
   thioesterification and (ii) transpeptidation. Sortase A is involved in
   the process of bacterial adhesion by anchoring LPXTG-containing proteins
   to lipid II. Sortase A inhibitors do not affect bacterial growth, but
   they restrain the virulence of pathogenic bacterial strains, thereby
   preventing infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus or other
   Gram-positive bacteria. The efficacy of the most promising inhibitors
   needs to be comprehensively evaluated in in vivo models of infection, in
   order to select compounds eligible for the treatment of bacterial
   infections in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Glioblastoma is the most lethal brain tumor. Failure of conventional
   chemotherapies prompted the search for natural compounds for treatment
   of glioblastoma. Plant-derived flavonoids could be alternative medicine
   for inhibiting not only glioblastoma cells but also glioblastoma stem
   cells (GSC). Two plant-derived flavonoids are luteolin (LUT) and
   silibinin (SIL). We investigated anti-tumor mechanisms of LUT and SIL in
   different human glioblastoma cells and GSC and found significant
   synergistic inhibition of human glioblastoma LN18 and SNB19 cells and
   GSC following treatment with combination of 20 mu M LUT and 50 mu M SIL.
   Combination of 20 mu M LUT and 50 mu M SIL was more effective than a
   conventional chemotherapeutic agent (BCNU or TMZ). We continued our
   studies with SNB19 cells and GSC and found dramatic inhibition of cell
   migration from spheroids and also cell invasion through matrigel
   following treatment with combination of LUT and SIL. This combination
   was highly effective to block angiogenesis and survival pathways leading
   to induction of apoptosis. Inhibition of PKC alpha, XIAP, and iNOS
   ultimately caused induction of extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of
   apoptosis. Collectively, synergistic efficacy of LUT and SIL could be a
   promising therapy to inhibit cell migration and invasion and induce
   apoptosis in different glioblastoma cells including GSC. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A novel facial feature descriptor, termed discriminative local
   difference patterns (DLDP), is proposed for robust face recognition.
   DLDP extracts local difference patterns (LDP) based on directional
   texture operators. To improve the compactness and discriminability of
   LDP, a two-stage linear discriminant analysis for dimensionality
   reduction is further applied. The proposed DLDP effectively captures the
   local and holistic characteristics of the face image and shows great
   tolerance to illumination changes, robustness to variations in pose and
   facial expression, and computational efficiency. Experimental results on
   challenging face databases show that DLDP consistently outperforms
   current state-of-the-art facial feature descriptors.}},

Abstract = {{Highly soluble air-stable conjugated decamers and polymers (compounds
   1-6) with alternating ``sulfur-overrich{''}
   bis(3,4'-S-alkyl)-2,2'-bithiophenes as the donor units and
   2,1,3-benzothiadiazoles as the acceptor units were designed and
   expediently synthesized with the aid of microwave and ultrasound
   enabling technologies. Solid-state cyclovoltammetry showed that 1-6 had
   oxidation and reduction potentials in the range 0.6-0.9 V and -1/-1.2 V
   (vs SCE), respectively, with energy gaps below 2 eV. The electronic
   properties of spin-coated films of pure 1-6 were investigated with
   nanoscale resolution by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). KPFM
   measurements showed that charge generation and separation were obtained
   for all films under illumination. Consequently, 1-6 were tested on
   single-material organic solar cells (SMOCs). In agreement with KPFM
   results, photovoltaic behavior was observed for all compounds with power
   conversion efficiencies in line with the best results obtained so far
   for the few donor-acceptor molecules already shown to perform in
   single-component solar cells. To our knowledge, this is the first time
   in which thiophene-benzothiadiazole co-oligomers and copolymers are
   shown to be photoactive materials in SMOCs.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most challenging and clinically important goals in
   nanomedicine is to deliver imaging and therapeutic agents to solid
   tumors. Here we discuss the recent design and development of
   stimuli-responsive smart nanoparticles for targeting the common
   attributes of solid tumors such as their acidic and hypoxic
   microenvironments. This class of stimuli-responsive nanoparticles is
   inactive during blood circulation and under normal physiological
   conditions, but is activated by acidic pH, enzymatic up-regulation, or
   hypoxia once they extravasate into the tumor microenvironment. The
   nanoparticles are often designed to first ``navigate{''} the body's
   vascular system, ``dock{''} at the tumor sites, and then ``activate{''}
   for action inside the tumor interstitial space. They combine the
   favorable biodistribution and pharmacokinetic properties of nanodelivery
   vehicles and the rapid diffusion and penetration properties of smaller
   drug cargos. By targeting the broad tumor habitats rather than
   tumor-specific receptors, this strategy has the potential to overcome
   the tumor heterogeneity problem and could be used to design diagnostic
   and therapeutic nanoparticles for a broad range of solid tumors. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper the effects of fling-step and forward-directivity on the
   seismic performance of steel eccentrically braced frames (EBFs) are
   addressed. Four EBFs with various numbers of stories (4-, 8-, 12- and
   15-story) were designed for an area with high seismic hazard. Fourteen
   near-fault ground motions including seven with forward-directivity and
   seven with fling-step effects are selected to carry out nonlinear time
   history (NTH) analyses of the frames. Furthermore, seven more far-field
   records were selected for comparison. Findings from the study reveal
   that the median maximum links rotation of the frames subjected to three
   set of ground motions are in acceptable range and the links completely
   satisfy the requirement stated in FEMA 356 for LS performance level. The
   arrival of the velocity pulse in a near-fault record causes few
   significant plastic deformations, while many reversed inelastic cycles
   result in low-cycle fatigue damage in far-fault records. Near-fault
   records in some cases are more destructive and the results of these
   records are so dispersed, especially the records having fling-step
   effects.}},

Abstract = {{In order to find an efficient enzymatic tool for curdlan degradation to
   produce (1 -> 3)-linked beta-D-glucan oligosaccharides, strain E4-5
   (registration number JN089883, Genbank) was isolated from seaside soil.
   The 16S rRNA gene sequencing classified it as Cellulosimicrobium
   cellulans. It was the first reported microorganism that succeeded in
   degrading high-set heated curdlan blocks. The ferments of strain E4-5
   also showed good degradation effects on laminaran and alkali-neutralized
   curdlan. Due to the products with less amount of glucose, it was assumed
   that endo-1,3-beta-glucanases of strain E4-5 had a greater hydrolyzing
   effect than exo-1,3-beta-glucanases. This indicated that strain E4-5 was
   a promising microorganism to hydrolyze (1 -> 3)-linked beta-D-glucan.
   Moreover, alkali-neutralization pretreatment was effective for promoting
   a more diversified degree of polymerization (DP) of (1 -> 3)-linked
   beta-D-glucan oligosaccharides under enzymatic hydrolysis and will pave
   the way for making full use of curdlan for production of glucan
   oligosaccharides. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many bacteria secrete a highly hydrated framework of extracellular
   polymer matrix on suitable substrates and embed within the matrix to
   form a biofilm. Bacterial biofilms are observed on many medical devices,
   endocarditis, periodontitis and lung infections in cystic fibrosis
   patients. Bacteria in biofilm are protected from antibiotics and >1,000
   times of the minimum inhibitory concentration may be required to treat
   biofilm infections. Here, we demonstrated that shock waves could be used
   to remove Salmonella, Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus biofilms in urinary
   catheters. The studies were extended to a Pseudomonas chronic pneumonia
   lung infection and Staphylococcus skin suture infection model in mice.
   The biofilm infections in mice, treated with shock waves became
   susceptible to antibiotics, unlike untreated biofilms. Mice exposed to
   shock waves responded to ciprofloxacin treatment, while ciprofloxacin
   alone was ineffective in treating the infection. These results
   demonstrate for the first time that, shock waves, combined with
   antibiotic treatment can be used to treat biofilm infection on medical
   devices as well as in situ infections.}},

Title = {{Adaptive dualISO HDR reconstruction}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Pages = {{1-13}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{With the development of modern image sensors enabling flexible image
   acquisition, single shot high dynamic range (HDR) imaging is becoming
   increasingly popular. In this work, we capture single shot HDR images
   using an imaging sensor with spatially varying gain/ISO. This allows all
   incoming photons to be used in the imaging. Previous methods on single
   shot HDR capture use spatially varying neutral density (ND) filters
   which lead to wasting incoming light. The main technical contribution in
   this work is an extension of previous HDR reconstruction approaches for
   single shot HDR imaging based on local polynomial approximations
   (Kronander et al., Unified HDR reconstruction from raw CFA data, 2013;
   Hajisharif et al., HDR reconstruction for alternating gain (ISO) sensor
   readout, 2014). Using a sensor noise model, these works deploy a
   statistically informed filtering operation to reconstruct HDR pixel
   values. However, instead of using a fixed filter size, we introduce two
   novel algorithms for adaptive filter kernel selection. Unlike a previous
   work, using adaptive filter kernels (Signal Process Image Commun
   29(2):203-215, 2014), our algorithms are based on analyzing the model
   fit and the expected statistical deviation of the estimate based on the
   sensor noise model. Using an iterative procedure, we can then adapt the
   filter kernel according to the image structure and the statistical image
   noise. Experimental results show that the proposed filter de-noises the
   noisy image carefully while well preserving the important image features
   such as edges and corners, outperforming previous methods. To
   demonstrate the robustness of our approach, we have exploited input
   images from raw sensor data using a commercial off-the-shelf camera. To
   further analyze our algorithm, we have also implemented a camera
   simulator to evaluate different gain patterns and noise properties of
   the sensor.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanisms underlying ovarian cancer initiation and progression are
   unclear. Herein, we report that the Yes-associated protein (YAP), a
   major effector of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway, interacts with
   ERBB signaling pathways to regulate the initiation and progression of
   ovarian cancer. Immunohistochemistry studies indicate that YAP
   expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients.
   Overexpression or constitutive activation of YAP leads to transformation
   and tumorigenesis in human ovarian surface epithelial cells, and
   promotes growth of cancer cells in vivo and in vitro. YAP induces the
   expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors (EGFR, ERBB3) and
   production of EGF-like ligands (HBEGF, NRG1 and NRG2). HBEGF or NRG1, in
   turn, activates YAP and stimulates cancer cell growth. Knockdown of
   ERBB3 or HBEGF eliminates YAP effects on cell growth and transformation,
   whereas knockdown of YAP abrogates NRG1- and HBEGF-stimulated cell
   proliferation. Collectively, our study demonstrates the existence of
   HBEGF \& NRGs/ERBBs/YAP/HBEGF \& NRGs autocrine loop that controls
   ovarian cell tumorigenesis and cancer progression.}},

Abstract = {{By effectively bypassing the common problem of the loss of contact of
   platinum nanoparticles to carbon black support involved in the
   traditional methodology, supportless Pt, Au@Pt 3D-porous nanostructures
   (PtNBs and Au@PtNBs), and Au-core-Pt-shell nanoparticles
   (Au(50)Pt(50)NPs) were synthesized. The radiolytic synthesis provides a
   high control on the size, morphology, and composition of the
   nanoparticles. Nanoballs, 85 +/- 5 nm for PtNBs and 75 +/- 5 nm for
   Au@PtNBs, are formed by 3D-interconnected nanowires leading to a giant
   mesoporous structure. A single Au@PtNB is formed by an ca. 30 nm
   Au-core, surrounded by a porous Pt-shell of 15 nm thickness made by
   3D-connected nanowires of 2 nm diameter. The high catalytic activity of
   these nanostructures toward organic electrooxidation was highlighted in
   aqueous media and attributed to their particular core-shell structure.
   The Au@PtNBs mesoporous materials exhibit improved kinetics toward
   glucose electrooxidation compared to their counterpart PtNBs and are a
   promising anode material for direct glucose fuel cells. For formic acid
   electromidation, Au(50)Pt(50)NPs (3 nm diameter) exhibit the most
   specific activity. The radiolysis enables the effective synthesis of
   various core-shell nanostructures ranging from simple to mesoporous
   ones. The present work continues the research line where advanced
   methods are used to prepare highly active nanostructures with improved
   catalytic kinetics.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to investigate the protective effects of
   adrenomedullin (ADM) on interleukin-lf3 (IL-1 beta)-induced inflammation
   and apoptosis in rat Leydig cells and its underlying molecular
   mechanisms. Leydig cells were isolated from adult Sprague-Dawley rats.
   The cell culture was established by adding ADM 2 h prior to 24 h
   treatment with IL-1 beta-induced cytotoxicity. We detected cell
   viability and concentrations of testosterone, reactive oxygen species
   (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and reduced glutathione (GSH). Gene
   expression levels were measured for inducible nitric oxide synthase
   (iNOS) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2). Concentrations were detected for
   nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Apoptosis was assessed
   using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling
   (TUNEL). Levels of gene expression and protein were detected for BcI-2,
   Bax, caspase-3, and poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase (PARP).
   Protein levels were measured for nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) p65
   and linoc. ADM reduced IL-1 I3-induced cytotoxicity. ADM pretreatment
   significantly increased testosterone concentrations and decreased ROS,
   MDA, and GSH concentrations. ADM pretreatment inhibited IL-1
   beta-induced inflammation in Leydig cells by decreasing the gene
   expression levels of iNOS and COX-2, as well as the concentrations of NO
   and PGE2. ADM pretreatment further decreased the number of
   TUNEL-positive stained Leydig cells, as confirmed by the increase in
   gene expression and protein levels of Bc1-2 and the decrease of Bax,
   caspase-3, and PARP levels. Moreover, ADM pretreatment inhibited NF-KB
   p65 phosphorylation and hcBcc phosphorylation and degradation. ADM has
   potential anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties in IL-1
   beta-induced rat Leydig cells, which might be related to NF--KB
   signaling pathway. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With a deep Chandra/HETGS exposure of WR 6, we have resolved emission
   lines whose profiles show that the X-rays originate from a uniformly
   expanding spherical wind of high X-ray-continuum optical depth. The
   presence of strong helium-like forbidden lines places the source of
   X-ray emission at tens to hundreds of stellar radii from the
   photosphere. Variability was present in X-rays and simultaneous optical
   photometry, but neither were correlated with the known period of the
   system or with each other. An enhanced abundance of sodium revealed
   nuclear-processed material, a quantity related to the evolutionary state
   of the star. The characterization of the extent and nature of the hot
   plasma in WR 6 will help to pave the way to a more fundamental
   theoretical understanding of the winds and evolution of massive stars.}},

Title = {{ARCADO - Adding random case analysis to direct observation in
   workplace-based formative assessment of general practice registrars}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Workplace-based formative assessments using consultation
   observation are currently conducted during the Australian general
   practice training program. Assessment reliability is improved by using
   multiple assessment methods. The aim of this study was to explore
   experiences of general practice medical educator assessors and
   registrars (trainees) when adding random case analysis to direct
   observation (ARCADO) during formative workplace-based assessments.
   Methods: A sample of general practice medical educators and matched
   registrars were recruited. Following the ARCADO workplace assessment,
   semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted. The data was
   analysed thematically.
   Results: Ten registrars and eight medical educators participated. Four
   major themes emerged - formative versus summative assessment; strengths
   (acceptability, flexibility, time efficiency, complementarity and
   authenticity); weaknesses (reduced observation and integrity risks); and
   contextual factors (variation in assessment content, assessment timing,
   registrar-medical educator relationship, medical educator's approach and
   registrar ability).
   Conclusion: ARCADO is a well-accepted workplace-based formative
   assessment perceived by registrars and assessors to be valid and
   flexible. The use of ARCADO enabled complementary insights that would
   not have been achieved with direct observation alone. Whilst there are
   some contextual factors to be considered in its implementation, ARCADO
   appears to have utility as formative assessment and, subject to further
   evaluation, high-stakes assessment.}},

   condition at pH 10 favored its aggregation in water, while KGM
   maintained a random coil conformation in the whole pH range. Associated
   with the pH effects were changes in the rheological behavior during
   heating from 20 to 80 degrees C. The significant differences in the
   colloidal and rheological characteristics were mainly attributed to
   alteration of intermolecular interaction (attractive or repulsive)
   rather than deacetylation at various pH levels. Deacetylation occurred
   in both acidic and alkaline condition. The second virial value was
   positive in acidic and negative in alkaline condition. The results
   showed that hydro colloidal characteristics of KGM in water were
   significantly affected by pH. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Metagenome-Based Metabolic Reconstruction Reveals the Ecophysiological
   Function of Epsilonproteobacteria in a Hydrocarbon-Contaminated Sulfidic
   Aquifer}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{The population genome of an uncultured bacterium assigned to the
   Campylobacterales (Epsilonproteobacteria) was reconstructed from a
   metagenome dataset obtained by whole-genome shotgun pyrosequencing.
   Genomic DNA was extracted from a sulfate-reducing, m-xylene-mineralizing
   enrichment culture isolated from groundwater of a benzene contaminated
   sulfidic aquifer. The identical epsilonproteobacterial phylotype has
   previously been detected in toluene- or benzene-mineralizing,
   sulfate-reducing consortia enriched from the same site. Previous stable
   isotope probing (SIP) experiments with C-13(6)-labeled benzene suggested
   that this phylotype assimilates benzene derived carbon in a syntrophic
   benzene mineralizing consortium that uses sulfate as terminal electron
   acceptor. However, the type of energy metabolism and the
   ecophysiological function of this epsilonproteobacterium within aromatic
   hydrocarbon-degrading consortia and in the sulfidic aquifer are poorly
   understood. Annotation of the epsilonproteobacterial population genome
   suggests that the bacterium plays a key role in sulfur cycling as
   indicated by the presence of an sqr gene encoding a sulfide quinone
   oxidoreductase and psr genes encoding a polysulfide reductase. It may
   gain energy by using sulfide or hydrogen/formate as electron donors.
   Polysulfide, fumarate, as well as oxygen are potential electron
   acceptors. Auto- or mixotrophic carbon metabolism seems plausible since
   a complete reductive citric acid cycle was detected. Thus the bacterium
   can thrive in pristine groundwater as well as in
   hydrocarbon-contaminated aquifers. In hydrocarbon contaminated sulfidic
   habitats, the epsilonproteobacterium may generate energy by coupling the
   oxidation of hydrogen or formate and highly abundant sulfide with the
   reduction of fumarate and/or polysulfide, accompanied by efficient
   assimilation of acetate produced during fermentation or incomplete
   oxidation of hydrocarbons. The highly efficient assimilation of acetate
   was recently demonstrated by a pulsed C-13(2)-acetate protein SIP
   experiment. The capability of nitrogen fixation as indicated by the
   presence of nil genes may provide a selective advantage in
   nitrogen-depleted habitats. Based on this metabolic reconstruction, we
   propose acetate capture and sulfur cycling as key functions of
   Epsilonproteobacteria within the intermediary ecosystem metabolism of
   hydrocarbon-rich sulfidic sediments.}},

Title = {{A case report of primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the perihilar bile
   duct}},
Journal = {{BMC SURGERY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although neuroendocrine tumors are most commonly found in
   the digestive system, neuroendocrine tumors originating from the bile
   duct are rare, and neuroendocrine carcinomas derived from the perihilar
   bile duct are extremely rare. This report presents the clinical course
   and clinicopathological features of neuroendocrine carcinomas arising
   from the extrahepatic bile duct.
   Case presentation: A 70-year-old Japanese woman was preoperatively
   diagnosed with perihilar cholangiocarcinoma, and a radical resection
   with an extended left hepatic lobectomy and a choledochojejunostomy was
   performed. From the histopathological findings, we diagnosed the tumor
   as a neuroendocrine carcinoma of the bile duct (small cell type) with
   lymph node metastasis. The patient was treated with the same adjuvant
   chemotherapy as that used for small cell carcinoma of the lung. At 10
   months after surgery, there was no recurrence of the disease.
   Conclusion: Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the extrahepatic biliary tracts
   is a very rare and highly malignant disease with a poor prognosis. A
   multidisciplinary approach could improve the prognosis for this
   neoplasm.}},

   metal-metal transition without spontaneous symmetry breaking}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Ordered phases such as charge- and spin-density wave state accompany
   either full or partial gapping of Fermi surface (FS) leading a
   metal-insulator or metal-metal transition (MMT). However, there are
   examples of MMT without any signatures of symmetry breaking. One example
   is Na2Ti2Sb2O, where a partial gapping of FS is observed but a density
   wave ordering has not been found. Here we propose a microscopic
   mechanism of such a MMT, which occurs due to a momentum-dependent
   spin-orbit-coupled molecular orbital polarization. Since a molecular d
   orbital polarization is present due to a small spin-orbit coupling of
   Ti, there is no spontaneous symmetry breaking involved. However, a sharp
   increase of polarization happens above a critical electron interaction
   which gaps out the d orbtial FS and reduces the density of states
   significantly, while the rest of FS associated with Sb p orbtials is
   almost intact across MMT. Experimental implications to test our proposal
   and applications to other systems are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the glass transition as a kinetic process and
   establish one universal equation for the pressure coefficient of the

   characteristic of this process. Our findings challenge the common
   previous expectations concerning key characteristics of the
   transformation from the liquid to the glassy state, because it suggests
   that without employing an additional condition, met in the glass
   transition, derivation of the two independent equations for dT(g)/dp is
   not possible. Hence, the relation among the thermodynamic coefficients,
   which could be equivalent to the well-known Prigogine-Defay ratio for
   the process under consideration, cannot be obtained. Besides, by
   comparing the predictions of our universal equation for dT(g)/dp and
   Ehrenfest equations, we find the aforementioned supplementary
   restriction, which must be met to use the Prigogine-Defay ratio for the

Abstract = {{Production of recombinant proteins with microalgae represents an
   alternative platform over plantor bacterial-based expression systems for
   certain target proteins. Secretion of recombinant proteins allows
   accumulation of the target product physically separate from the valuable
   algal biomass. To date, there has been little investigation into the
   dynamics of recombinant protein secretion from microalgal hosts the
   culture parameters that encourage secreted product accumulation and
   stability, while encouraging biomass production. In this work, the
   efficiency of recombinant protein production was optimized by adjusting
   cultivation parameters for a strain of Chlamydomonas reinhardth
   previously engineered to secrete a functional recombinant Lolium perenne
   ice binding protein (LpIBP), which has applications as a frozen food
   texturing and cryopreservation additive, into its culture medium. Three
   media and several cultivation styles were investigated for effects on
   secreted LpIBP titres and culture growth. A combination of acetate and
   carbon dioxide feeding with illumination resulted in the highest overall
   biomass and recombinant protein titres up to 10 mg L-1 in the culture
   medium. Pure photoautotrophic production was possible using two media
   types, with recombinant protein accumulation in all cultivations
   correlating to culture cell density. Two different cultivation systems
   were used for scale-up to 10 L cultivations, one of which produced
   yields of secreted recombinant protein up to 12 mg L-1 within six
   cultivation days. Functional ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) of
   the LpIBP from total concentrated extracellular protein extracts was
   demonstrated in a sucrose solution used as a simplified ice cream model.
   IRI lasted up to 7 days, demonstrating the potential of secreted
   products from microalgae for use as food additives. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   dependent on the molar ratio of AlCl3/(urea + acetamide). The nucleation
   mechanism of aluminum on the tungsten electrode was determined to be
   three-dimensional instantaneous nucleation with diffusion-controlled
   growth at 333 K. Aluminum coatings were prepared at different cathodic
   potentials (from -0.10 V to -0.25 V) and different temperatures (from
   313 K to 343 K) in urea-acetamide-LiBr molten salt. Scanning electron
   microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize
   the surface of the deposits. The SEM images indicate that the
   morphologies of the aluminum deposits are dependent on the deposition
   potential and temperature. The XRD analysis confirms that the obtained
   deposits are pure aluminum. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although lithium-selenium batteries have attracted significant attention
   for high-energy-density energy storage systems due to their high
   volumetric capacity, their implementation has been hampered by the
   dissolution of polyselenide intermediates into electrolyte. Herein, we
   report a novel selenium/microporous carbon nanofiber composite as a
   high-performance cathode for lithium-selenium batteries through binding
   selenium in microporous carbon nanofibers. Under vacuum and heat
   treatment, selenium particles are easily transformed into chainlike Se-n
   molecules that chemically bond with the inner surfaces of microporous
   carbon nanofibers. This chemical bonding can not only promote robust and
   intimate contact between selenium and carbonaceous nanofiber matrix but
   also alleviate the active material dissolution during cycling. Moreover,
   selenium is homogeneously distributed in the micropores of the highly
   conductive carbonaceous nanofiber matrix, which is favorable for the
   fast diffusions of both lithium ions and electrons. As a result, a high
   reversible capacity of 581 mA h g(-1) in the first cycle at 0.1 C and
   over 400 mA h g(-1) after 2000 cycles at 1 C with excellent cyclability
   and high rate performance (over 420 mA h g(-1) at 5 C, 3.39 A g(-1)) are
   achieved with the selenium/microporous carbon nanofibers composite as a
   cathode for lithium-selenium batteries, performing among the best of
   current selenium-carbon cathodes. This simple preparation method and
   strongly coupling hybrid nanostructure can be extended to other
   selenium-based alloy cathode materials for lithium-selenium batteries.}},

Abstract = {{This review focuses on a dengue virus (DENV) vaccine candidate based on
   a recombinant subunit approach which targets the DENV envelope
   glycoprotein (E). Truncated versions of E consisting of the N-terminal
   portion of E (DEN-80E) have been expressed recombinantly in the
   Drosophila S2 expression system and shown to have native-like
   conformation. Preclinical studies demonstrate that formulations
   containing tetravalent DEN-80E adjuvanted with ISCOMATRIX (TM) adjuvant
   induce high titer virus neutralizing anti-bodies and IFN-gamma producing
   T cells in flavivirus-naive non-human primates. The preclinical data
   further suggest that administration of such formulations on a 0, 1,6
   month schedule may result in higher maximum virus neutralizing antibody
   titers and better durability of those titers compared to administration
   on a 0, 1, 2 month schedule. In addition, the virus neutralizing
   antibody titers induced by adjuvanted tetravalent DEN-80E compare
   favorably to the titers induced by a tetravalent live virus comparator.
   Furthermore, DEN-80E was demonstrated to be able to boost virus
   neutralizing antibody titers in macaques that have had a prior DENV
   exposure. A monovalent version of the vaccine candidate, DEN1-80E, was
   formulated with Alhydrogel (TM) and studied in a proof-of-principle
   Phase I clinical trial by Hawaii Biotech, Inc. (NCT00936429). The
   clinical trial results demonstrate that both the 10 mu g and 50 mu g
   formulations of DEN1-80E with 1.25 mg of elemental aluminum were
   immunogenic when administered in a 3-injection series (0, 1, 2 months)
   to healthy, flavivirus-naive adults. The vaccine formulations induced
   DENV-1 neutralizing antibodies in the majority of subjects, although the
   titers in most subjects were modest and waned over time. Both the 10 mu
   g DEN 1-80E and the 50 mu g DEN1-80E formulations with Alhydrogel (TM)
   were generally well tolerated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We investigate molecular adsorption, film growth, and self-assembly for
   titanyl phthalocyanine (TiOPc) on Cu(110) in ultrahigh vacuum using
   low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (LT-STM). Three unique
   molecular adsorption configurations are identified, two of which are
   referred to as ``O-down{''} and one as ``O-up{''}, each differing in the
   molecular registry with the surface. Even though disorder dominates film
   growth to coverages in excess of 1 monolayer in the native thin film,
   extended self-assembled 1D configuration-dependent nanoribbons form upon
   annealing of the film. The STM data reveal that the nanoribbons consist
   of ``O-down{''} TiOPc and a Cu skeleton, anchoring cooperatively on the
   Cu(110) terraces. Agent-based simulations show that nanoribbons grow and
   elongate due to anisotropic adatom attachment rates along the two major
   surface directions. The study reveals the importance of molecule adatom
   interactions for novel approaches toward nanostructuring organic
   semiconductor/metal interfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   Adipose Tissue Stromal Cells (ASCs) have important clinical applications
   in the regenerative medicine, cell replacement and gene therapies.
   Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue (SAT) is the most common source of these
   cells. The adult human thymus degenerates into adipose tissue (TAT).
   However, it has never been studied before as a source of stem cells.
   Material and Methods
   We performed a comparative characterization of TAT-ASCs and SAT-ASCs
   from myocardial ischemic subjects (n = 32) according to the age of the
   subjects.
   Results
   TAT-ASCs and SAT-ASCs showed similar features regarding their adherence,
   morphology and in their capacity to form CFU-F. Moreover, they have the
   capacity to differentiate into osteocyte and adipocyte lineages; and
   they present a surface marker profile corresponding with stem cells
   derived from AT; CD73(+)CD90(+)CD105(+)CD14(-)CD19(-)CD45(-)HLA-DR.
   Interestingly, and in opposition to SAT-ASCs, TAT-ASCs have
   CD14(+)CD34(+)CD133(+)CD45(-) cells. Moreover, TAT-ASCs from elderly
   subjects showed higher adipogenic and osteogenic capacities compared to
   middle aged subjects, indicating that, rather than impairing; aging
   seems to increase adipogenic and osteogenic capacities of TAT-ASCs.
   Conclusions
   This study describes the human TAT as a source of mesenchymal stem
   cells, which may have an enormous potential for regenerative medicine.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a simple and dry technique to functionalize and dope
   single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with ozone. The doping under
   ozone-controlled conditions (300 mg/h) during 30 min was shown to give a
   4-fold decrease in the sheet resistance of SWCNT films (148 Omega/square
   at the transmittance of 90\%). Further ozone treatment of the SWCNTs
   leads to deterioration in the film conductance. The conductivity
   alteration is discussed in the light of the Criegee mechanism, oxidation
   and charge transfer during the ozone exposure. The samples were
   characterized by TEM, FTIR, Raman, UV vis NIR, and XPS to confirm the
   findings of the work. The ozone-treated samples show increased
   hydrophilicity with increasing ozone treatment time, which makes
   possible to coat the SWCNT samples with inorganic materials. SWCNTs
   after ozone treatment can be successfully and uniformly coated by ZnO
   with the help of atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique.}},

Abstract = {{We determine the regime where the widespread classical field description
   for quantum Bose gases is quantitatively accurate in one dimension (1D),
   2D, and 3D by a careful study of the ideal gas limit. Numerical
   benchmarking in 1D shows that the ideal gas results carry over unchanged
   into the weakly interacting gas. The optimum high-energy cutoff is in
   general shown to depend strongly on the observable in question (e.g.,
   energy, density fluctuations, phase coherence length, condensate
   fraction). This explains the wide range of past results. A consistent
   classical field representation with less than 10\% deviation in all
   typical observables can be given for systems at temperatures below
   0.0064 degeneracy temperature in 1D, and 0.49 critical temperature in
   3D. Surprisingly, this is not possible for the two-dimensional ideal gas
   even at zero temperature because mean density, density fluctuations, and
   energy cannot be simultaneously matched to the quantum results.}},

Abstract = {{The M 7.8 earthquake of 25 April 2015 was a significant event in the
   long seismic history of the Eastern Himalayas, which caused more than
   8000 casualties and widespread destruction of various structures in the
   western and central regions of Nepal. This article discusses the general
   observations in the earthquake affected regions, with special emphasis
   on the seismic performance of residential structures in the Kathmandu
   valley region. Widespread damage was observed in unreinforced masonry
   and reinforced concrete structures in this region which lacked adequate
   lateral strength and seismic load resisting features. Lack of
   engineering input was evident from the poor structural configuration of
   the buildings and non-compliance with the building codes, which
   aggravated the seismic vulnerability of these structures. Since maximum
   shaking intensity on Indian side was between V and VI, most structures
   did escape serious damage, but they continue to remain vulnerable for
   future design level earthquakes. Despite the knowledge of the high
   seismicity of the Himalayan region, the present lack of preparedness is
   unacceptable and it is necessary to implement good earthquake-resistant
   practices to minimize losses in future earthquakes.}},

Title = {{Differential expression of small RNAs under chemical stress and
   fed-batch fermentation in E-coli}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) are recognized as
   posttranscriptional regulators involved in the control of bacterial
   lifestyle and adaptation to stressful conditions. Although chemical
   stress due to the toxicity of precursor and product compounds is
   frequently encountered in microbial bioprocessing applications, the
   involvement of sRNAs in this process is not well understood. We have
   used RNA sequencing to map sRNA expression in E. coli under chemical
   stress and high cell density fermentation conditions with the aim of
   identifying sRNAs involved in the transcriptional response and those
   with potential roles in stress tolerance.
   Results: RNA sequencing libraries were prepared from RNA isolated from
   E. coli K-12 MG1655 cells grown under high cell density fermentation
   conditions or subjected to chemical stress with twelve compounds
   including four organic solvent-like compounds, four organic acids, two
   amino acids, geraniol and decanoic acid. We have discovered 253 novel
   intergenic transcripts with this approach, adding to the roughly 200
   intergenic sRNAs previously reported in E. coli. There are eighty-four
   differentially expressed sRNAs during fermentation, of which the
   majority are novel, supporting possible regulatory roles for these
   transcripts in adaptation during different fermentation stages. There
   are a total of 139 differentially expressed sRNAs under chemical stress
   conditions, where twenty-nine exhibit significant expression changes in
   multiple tested conditions, suggesting that they may be involved in a
   more general chemical stress response. Among those with known functions
   are sRNAs involved in regulation of outer membrane proteins, iron
   availability, maintaining envelope homeostasis, as well as sRNAs
   incorporated into complex networks controlling motility and biofilm
   formation.
   Conclusions: This study has used deep sequencing to reveal a wealth of
   hitherto undescribed sRNAs in E. coli and provides an atlas of sRNA
   expression during seventeen different growth and stress conditions.
   Although the number of novel sRNAs with regulatory functions is unknown,
   several exhibit specific expression patterns during high cell density
   fermentation and are differentially expressed in the presence of
   multiple chemicals, suggesting they may play regulatory roles during
   these stress conditions. These novel sRNAs, together with specific known
   sRNAs, are candidates for improving stress tolerance and our
   understanding of the E. coli regulatory network during fedbatch
   fermentation.}},

Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{815}},

Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Heavily obscured accretion is believed to represent an important stage
   in the growth of supermassive black holes and to play an important role
   in shaping the observed spectrum of the cosmic X-ray background. Hard
   X-ray (E > 10 keV) selected samples are less affected by absorption than
   samples selected at lower energies, and are therefore one of the best
   ways to detect and identify Compton-thick (CT, log N-H >= 24) active
   galactic nuclei (AGNs). In this letter we present the first results of
   the largest broadband (0.3-150 keV) X-ray spectral study of hard X-ray
   selected AGNs to date, focusing on the properties of heavily obscured
   sources. Our sample includes the 834 AGNs (728 non-blazar, average
   redshift z similar or equal to 0.055) reported in the 70-month catalog
   of the all-sky hard X-ray Swift/Burst Alert Monitor survey. We find 55
   CT AGNs, which represent 7.6(-2.1)(+1.1)\% of our non-blazar sample. Of
   these, 26 are reported as candidate CT AGNs for the first time. We
   correct for selection bias and derive the intrinsic column density
   distribution of AGNs in the local universe in two different luminosity
   ranges. We find a significant decrease in the fraction of obscured
   Compton-thin AGNs for increasing luminosity, from 46 +/- 3\% (for log
   L14-195 = 40-43.7) to 39 +/- 3\% (for log L14-195 = 43.7-46). A similar
   trend is also found for CT AGNs. The intrinsic fraction of CT AGNs with
   log N-H = 24-25 normalized to unity in the log N-H = 20-25 range is 27
   +/- 4\%, and is consistent with the observed value obtained for AGNs
   located within 20 Mpc.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of weak measurement and associated weak value amplification
   has sharpened our understanding of the measurement process in quantum
   mechanics. Recent experiments show that elastic scattering events in
   resonance fluorescence experiments can exhibit weak value amplification
   effect, by post-selecting a particular measurement outcome. In this
   article, we theoretically analyse the physics behind this amplification
   process. We show that, in general, weak interaction and the associated
   weak value amplification in resonance fluorescence can be derived from
   the well-known theory of spontaneous emission put forth by Wigner and
   Weiskopff. Using this theory we show that in the elastic scattering
   regime of resonance fluorescence, weak value amplification helps in
   segregating rare events. To our knowledge, weak value amplification has
   not been applied earlier in the time domain as a potential tool to study
   rare events.}},

Title = {{Mobility of power-law and Carreau fluids through fibrous media}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{The flow of generalized Newtonian fluids with a rate-dependent viscosity
   through fibrous media is studied, with a focus on developing
   relationships for evaluating the effective fluid mobility. Three methods
   are used here: (i) a numerical solution of the Cauchy momentum equation
   with the Carreau or power-law constitutive equations for pressure-driven
   flow in a fiber bed consisting of a periodic array of cylindrical
   fibers, (ii) an analytical solution for a unit cell model representing
   the flow characteristics of a periodic fibrous medium, and (iii) a
   scaling analysis of characteristic bulk parameters such as the effective
   shear rate, the effective viscosity, geometrical parameters of the
   system, and the fluid rheology. Our scaling analysis yields simple
   expressions for evaluating the transverse mobility functions for each
   model, which can be used for a wide range of medium porosity and fluid
   rheological parameters. While the dimensionless mobility is, in general,
   a function of the Carreau number and the medium porosity, our results
   show that for porosities less than epsilon similar or equal to 0.65, the
   dimensionless mobility becomes independent of the Carreau number and the
   mobility function exhibits power-law characteristics as a result of the
   high shear rates at the pore scale. We derive a suitable criterion for
   determining the flow regime and the transition from a constant viscosity
   Newtonian response to a power-law regime in terms of a new Carreau
   number rescaled with a dimensionless function which incorporates the
   medium porosity and the arrangement of fibers.}},

Title = {{The gizzard plates in the Cephalaspidean gastropod Philine
   quadripartita: Analysis of structure and function}},
Journal = {{QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{390}},
Pages = {{4-14}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Cephalaspidean gastropods are common marine mollusks with a unique
   digestive apparatus containing 3 hardened plates of millimeter size
   inside the muscular esophageal crop (gizzard). The gizzard plates are
   reported to either grind or crush shelled prey. The current study aims
   at better understanding the manner in which the gizzard plates of the
   cephalaspid Philine quadripartita function in the overall digestion
   process by relating their structural and mechanical properties. Philitie
   quadripartita possesses 3 gizzard plates which have one of the common
   configurations of cephalaspidean gizzard plates: two paired plates that
   are mirror images of each other and one smaller unpaired plate. We used
   micro-CT to characterize the gizzard musculature, the food which is
   present at different stages of the digestion process and the working
   surface of the gizzard plates. We show that the gizzard plates are used
   to crush the shelled prey, and that the functional mode of the small
   unpaired plate is different from the larger plates. All 3 plates are
   composed of a mixture of amorphous calcium carbonate and amorphous
   calcium phosphate embedded in a chitinous matrix. The proportions of
   these two mineral phases vary systematically within the plate. The
   plates have a complex layered structure, whose elastic moduli and
   hardness also vary in a continuous systematic manner. We observed that
   the stiffest layer is below the working surface, unlike most teeth where
   the stiffest layer is at the surface. Rigorous analysis of the
   elasticity indices of the gizzard plates as compared with sea urchin
   teeth and synthetic calcite provided insights into the connection
   between the biological function and the mechanical properties of
   biological composites. Specifically, we show that materials used for
   grinding require harder surfaces to avoid excessive wear compared to
   materials for crushing, whereas both of these functions require high
   toughness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{When Feelings Arise with Meanings: How Emotion and Meaning of a Native
   Language Affect Second Language Processing in Adult Learners}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{To determine when and how L2 learners start to process L2 words
   affectively and semantically, we conducted a longitudinal study on their
   interaction in adult L2 learners. In four test sessions, spanning half a
   year of L2 learning, we monitored behavioral and ERP learning-related
   changes for one and the same set of words by means of a primed
   lexical-decision paradigm with L1 primes and L2 targets. Sensitivity
   rates, accuracy rates, RTs, and N400 amplitude to L2 words and
   pseudowords improved significantly across sessions. A semantic priming
   effect (e.g, prime ``driver{''} facilitating response to target
   ``street{''}) was found in accuracy rates and RTs when collapsing
   Sessions 1 to 4, while this effect modulated ERP amplitudes within the
   first 300 ms of L2 target processing. An overall affective priming
   effect (e.g., ``sweet{''} facilitating{''}taste{''}) was also found in
   RTs and ERPs (posterior P1). Importantly, the ERPs showed an L2 valence
   effect across sessions (e.g., positive words were easier to process than
   neutral words), indicating that L2 learners were sensitive to L2
   affective meaning. Semantic and affective priming interacted in the N400
   time-window only in Session 4, implying that they affected meaning
   integration during L2 immersion together. The results suggest that L1
   and L2 are initially processed semantically and affectively via
   relatively separate channels that are more and more linked contingent on
   L2 exposure.}},

Abstract = {{During electricity production, the fly ash (FA) is generated from the

   carried out for the recovery of iron oxide and alumina from fly ash. The
   fly ash was subjected to magnetic separation where part of iron oxide
   was separated. After this the fly ash was leached with hydrochloric acid
   followed by precipitating the leached liquor with ammonia hydroxide to
   get hydroxides of alumina and iron which are dehydrated at high
   temperature (1100 degrees C) to obtain iron and aluminium oxides as a
   mixed powder. Leaching of alumina and iron oxides from fly ash with
   hydrochloric add, the effects of four parameters viz, acid concentration
   and acid to fly ash ratio, leaching temperature and time were
   investigated and optimum conditions were (i) concentration of HCl 6 N,
   (ii) fly ash (g) to HCl acid (ml) ratio 1:4, (iii) temperature of
   leaching 107 degrees C, and (iv) duration of leaching 5 h. The total

Abstract = {{Chemical beneficiation route for improvement of coal quality was
   demonstrated in pilot scale to produce low ash (8-10\%) clean coal with
   a yield more than 70\% by demineralization of high ash content flotation
   tailings obtained in a typical Indian coal washery. A Box-Behnken based
   design of experiment (DOE) method was used to generate data for
   development of a model. This model has been used to portray the effect
   of variables on reduction of ash content of coal tailings subjected to
   chemical leaching process. In this study, the functional relationship
   between process parameters (reaction temperature and time as well as
   reagent concentration) and the ash content of the final product was
   mapped using a second order non-linear model equation. The regression
   analysis was carried out using STATISTICA software for evolving
   appropriate equation to develop a commensurate model. The model
   predicted values of product coal ash content were in good agreement with
   the experiment values (R-2 = 0.9671). Moreover, the main effects,
   two-way interaction effects as well as sensitivity of process parameters
   were investigated with the help of the model. Finally, model based
   optimization was carried out to identify the operating parameters
   (reaction temperature = 160 degrees C; reaction time = 60.6 min; reagent
   concentration = 17.6\%) at which the product coal with minimum ash
   content could be produced. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Removal of reproductive suppression reveals latent sex differences in
   brain steroid hormone receptors in naked mole-rats, Heterocephalus
   glaber}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGY OF SEX DIFFERENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Naked mole-rats are eusocial mammals, living in large
   colonies with a single breeding female and 1-3 breeding males. Breeders
   are socially dominant, and only the breeders exhibit traditional sex
   differences in circulating gonadal steroid hormones and reproductive
   behaviors. Non-reproductive subordinates also fail to show sex
   differences in overall body size, external genital morphology, and
   non-reproductive behaviors. However, subordinates can transition to
   breeding status if removed from their colony and housed with an
   opposite-sex conspecific, suggesting the presence of latent sex
   differences. Here, we assessed the expression of steroid hormone
   receptor and aromatase messenger RNA (mRNA) in the brains of males and
   females as they transitioned in social and reproductive status.
   Methods: We compared in-colony subordinates to opposite-sex subordinate
   pairs that were removed from their colony for either 1 day, 1 week, 1
   month, or until they became breeders (i.e., produced a litter).
   Diencephalic tissue was collected and mRNA of androgen receptor (Ar),
   estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1), progesterone receptor (Pgr), and
   aromatase (Cyp19a1) was measured using qPCR. Testosterone, 17
   beta-estradiol, and progesterone from serum were also measured.
   Results: As early as 1 week post-removal, males exhibited increased
   diencephalic Ar mRNA and circulating testosterone, whereas females had
   increased Cyp19a1 mRNA in the diencephalon. At 1 month post-removal,
   females exhibited increased 17 beta-estradiol and progesterone. The
   largest changes in steroid hormone receptors were observed in breeders.
   Breeding females had a threefold increase in Cyp19a1 and fivefold
   increases in Esr1 and Pgr, whereas breeding males had reduced Pgr and
   increased Ar.
   Conclusions: These data demonstrate that sex differences in circulating
   gonadal steroids and hypothalamic gene expression emerge weeks to months
   after subordinate animals are removed from reproductive suppression in
   their home colony.}},

Title = {{Generation of contractile actomyosin bundles depends on mechanosensitive
   actin filament assembly and disassembly}},
Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Adhesion and morphogenesis of many non-muscle cells are guided by
   contractile actomyosin bundles called ventral stress fibers. While it is
   well established that stress fibers are mechanosensitive structures,
   physical mechanisms by which they assemble, align, and mature have
   remained elusive. Here we show that arcs, which serve as precursors for
   ventral stress fibers, undergo lateral fusion during their centripetal
   flow to form thick actomyosin bundles that apply tension to focal
   adhesions at their ends. Importantly, this myosin II-derived force
   inhibits vectorial actin polymerization at focal adhesions through
   AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of VASP, and thereby halts stress fiber
   elongation and ensures their proper contractility. Stress fiber
   maturation additionally requires ADF/cofilin-mediated disassembly of
   non-contractile stress fibers, whereas contractile fibers are protected
   from severing. Taken together, these data reveal that myosin-derived
   tension precisely controls both actin filament assembly and disassembly
   to ensure generation and proper alignment of contractile stress fibers
   in migrating cells.}},

Title = {{Identification of gene variants related to the nitric oxide pathway in

Abstract = {{Dysfunction of vascular endothelium is known to have an essential role
   in the atherosclerotic process by releasing mediators including nitric
   oxide (NO). Nitric oxide maintains endothelial balance by controlling
   cellular processes of vascular smooth muscle cells. Evidence suggests
   that variations in the NO pathway could include atherosclerotic events.
   The objective of this study was to determine the possible effects of
   genes on the nitric oxide pathway in the development of acute coronary
   syndrome (ACS). The blood samples of 100 patients with ACS and 100
   controls were collected at Istanbul University, Department of
   Cardiology. DNA samples were genotyped by using Illumina Cyto-SNP-12
   BeadChip. The additive model and Correlation/Trend Test were selected
   for association analysis. Afterwards, a Q-Q graphic was drawn to compare
   expected and obtained values. A Manhattan plot was produced to display
   p-values that were generated by - log(10)(P) function for each SNP. The
   p-values under 1 x 10(-4) were selected as statistically significant
   SNPs while p-values under 5 x 10(-2) were considered as suspicious
   biomarker candidates. Nitric oxide pathway analysis was then used to
   find the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to ACS. As a
   result, death-associated protein kinase 3 (DAPK) (rs10426955) was found
   to be most statistically significant SNP. The most suspicious biomarker
   candidates associated with the nitric oxide pathway analysis were
   vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), methionine sulfoxide
   reductase A (MSRA), nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1), and GTP
   cyclohydrolase I (GCH-1). Further studies with large sample groups are
   necessary to clarify the exact role of nitric oxide in the development
   of disease. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Bilaterally isolated abducens palsy after an aneursym rupture is related
   with intracranial hypertension}},
Journal = {{SPRINGERPLUS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Bilateral and isolated abducens nerve palsy is a rare
   initial presentation after aneurysms rupture. Several possible
   mechanisms including intracranial hypertension have been purposed. To
   date, there have been no reports with objective measurements to
   demonstrate the relationship between intracranial pressure and isolated
   abducens palsy in the setting of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage due to
   aneurysm rupture.
   Findings: A 50 year-old female presented with severe headache and
   bilaterally isolated abducens nerve palsy. A series of image studies
   showed a ruptured aneurysm over right internal carotid artery and
   posterior communicating artery bifurcation with minimal subarachnoid
   hemorrhage. Surgery of aneurysm clipping was performed and intracranial
   pressure monitoring was applied. Postoperatively no new neurological
   deficit developed but persistent headache and increased intracranial
   pressure measured by a fiber-optic device had been observed. The
   intracranial hypertension then decreased gradually with rapid recovery
   from the bilateral abducens palsy 7 days after the surgery. The
   relationship between postoperative intracranial pressure, subarachnoid
   hematoma and isolated abducens palsy are illustrated.
   Conclusions: The report demonstrated the clinical presentation of
   bilaterally isolated abducens palsy after an intracranial aneurysm
   rupture is related with the increased intracranial pressure level,
   rather than the hematoma compression to the nerve or vasospasm of
   pontine branches of basilar artery.}},

Abstract = {{Copper(II) acetylacetonate Cu(acac)(2) as copper source and NH4 Y
   zeolite as support, the chloride-free CuY catalyst was prepared by solid

   and the copper loading(mass fraction) on the catalytic activity for
   oxidative carbonylation of methanol was studied. And the effect of the
   phase structure, reducible copper species and texture on catalytic
   activity was investigated. The results indicates that the exchange
   degree between NH4+ and Cu2+ at first increases and then decreases with
   the increasing of the solid state reactive temperature, and the
   catalytic activity of the as-prepared CuY catalyst has the same changing
   tendency. When copper loading is below 10\%, the selectivity of dimethyl
   carbonate is low by the effect of the residual Br phi nsted acid.
   However, copper loading is above 12\%, the unexchanged Cu(acac)(2)
   decomposed to form CuO nano-particles and the nanometer-sized particles
   grow up, covered some active centers, even blocked pore, resulting in
   the decrease of catalytic activity. The as-prepared CuY catalyst with
   12\% copper loading at 250 degrees C solid state reaction exhibits an
   excellent catalytic activity. Space-time yield(STY) of dimethyl
   carbonate(DMC) up to 267. 3 mg.g(-1).h(-1) was achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Our aim is to model the three-dimensional magnetic field structure of
   the upper solar atmosphere, including regions of non-negligible plasma
   beta. We use high-resolution photospheric magnetic field measurements
   from SUNRISE/IMaX as the boundary condition for a magneto-static
   magnetic field model. The high resolution of IMaX allows us to resolve
   the interface region between the photosphere and corona, but modeling
   this region is challenging for the following reasons. While the coronal
   magnetic field is thought to be force-free (the Lorentz force vanishes),
   this is not the case in the mixed plasma beta environment in the
   photosphere and lower chromosphere. In our model, pressure gradients and
   gravity forces are self-consistently taken into account and compensate
   for the non-vanishing Lorentz force. Above a certain height (about 2 Mm)
   the non-magnetic forces become very weak and consequently the magnetic
   field becomes almost force-free. Here, we apply a linear approach where
   the electric current density consists of a superposition of a field-line
   parallel current and a current perpendicular to the Sun' s gravity
   field. We illustrate the prospects and limitations of this approach and
   give an outlook for an extension toward a nonlinear model.}},

Title = {{Direct Comparison of Immunogenicity Induced by 10-or 13-Valent
   Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine around the 11-Month Booster in Dutch
   Infants}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Background \& Aims
   Since 2009/10, a 10- and a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
   (PCV) are available, but only the 10-valent vaccine is now being used
   for the children in the Netherlands. As the vaccines differ in number of
   serotypes, antigen concentration, and carrier proteins this study was
   designed to directly compare quantity and quality of the antibody
   responses induced by PCV10 and PCV13 before and after the 11-month
   booster.
   Methods
   Dutch infants (n = 132) were immunized with either PCV10 or PCV13 and
   DTaP-IPV-Hib-HepB at the age of 2, 3, 4 and 11 months. Blood samples
   were collected pre-booster and post-booster at one week and one month
   post-booster for quantitative and qualitative immunogenicity against 13
   pneumococcal serotypes, as well as quantitative immunogenicity against
   diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and Haemophilus influenzae type b. We
   compared immunogenicity induced by PCV13 and PCV10 for their ten shared
   serotypes.
   Results
   One month post-booster, pneumococcal serotype-specific IgG geometric
   mean concentrations (GMCs) for the PCV13 group were higher compared with
   the PCV10 group for six serotypes, although avidity was lower. Serotype
   19F showed the most distinct difference in IgG and, in contrast to other
   serotypes, its avidity was higher in the PCV13 group. One week
   post-booster, opsonophagocytosis for serotype 19F did not differ
   significantly between the PCV10- and the PCV13 group.
   Conclusion
   Both PCV10 and PCV13 were immunogenic and induced a booster response.
   Compared to the PCV10 group, the PCV13 group showed higher levels for
   serotype 19F GMCs and avidity, pre-as well as post-booster, although
   opsonophagocytosis did not differ significantly between groups. In our
   study, avidity is not correlated to opsonophagocytotic activity (OPA)
   and correlations between IgG and OPA differ per serotype. Therefore,
   besides assays to determine IgG GMCs, assays to detect
   opsonophagocytotic activity, i.e., the actual killing of the
   pneumococcus, are important for PCV evaluation. How differences between
   the two vaccines relate to long-term protection requires further
   investigation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the problem of disturbance attenuation has been studied
   for a linear time-invariant feedback control system with a first-order
   moving average Gaussian noise channel. By applying the concept of
   entropy power, a lower bound of signal-to-noise ratio has been achieved
   which is necessary for stabilisation of a system with the limited
   channel input power constraint. Moreover, the problem of minimising the
   influence of a stochastic disturbance on the output has also been
   investigated, and the controller design method has been obtained by
   using Youla parameterisation and H-2 theory. It is shown that the
   minimum variance of the system output depends not only on the
   disturbance variance, noise variance and unstable poles, but also on the
   non-minimum phase zeros and channel parameter. Finally, the
   effectiveness of the proposed results is illustrated by a numerical
   example.}},

Abstract = {{Highly ordered mesoporous Al-SBA-15 materials with high aluminum content
   and high hydrothermal stability were synthesized by one. step
   hydrothermal grafting approach under the weak acid medium produced only
   by the hydrolysis of inorganic aluminum salt. By selectively introducing
   inorganic aluminum salt in the synthesis system, and further optimizing
   hydrothermal treatment temperature and the introduced amount of
   inorganic aluminum salt, the hydrolysis of Al ion and the condensation
   of silicon hydroxyl (Si-OH) species within the mesoporous walls could be
   efficiently controlled to adjust the relative amount of Al-OH and Si-OH
   groups and their interaction. As a result, the ordered mesostructure of
   Al-SBA-15 could be assembled at the mesoscale and the coordination
   status/the acidic sites could be controlled at the atomic scale. The
   characteristic results by means of XRD, N-2 adsorption, TEM, EDX, SEM,
   FTIR and NMR techniques showed that when aluminium nitrate was used as
   the aluminum precursor, and hydrothermal treatment temperature and
   initial molar ratio of silicate to aluminium were adjusted as 140
   degrees C and 10, respectively, the synthesized sample exhibited highly
   ordered hexagonal mesostructure and extremely high hydrothermal
   stability. The highly ordered mesostructure can be maintained even after
   steam treatment at 800 degrees C for 2 h with only 18. 82\% and 16. 67\%
   decreases in the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area and total pore
   volume, respectively. Moreover, the hydrothermal grafting process at 140
   degrees C was advantageous for the homogeneous incorporation of Al into
   the silica mesoporous framework to form the Si-OH-Al bond, leading to
   the production of Bronsted and Lewis acid sites with relatively strong
   acidity on the mesoporous walls.}},

Abstract = {{With an explosive growth of the datacenter research, virtual machines
   migration aiming at optimization of virtual machines placement is a
   major technology of improving power efficiency and resource utilization
   in the datacenter. While recent studies have primarily focused on
   maximizing resource utilization or minimizing migration cost separately,
   there has been little attention on jointly taking these two objectives
   into account. In this paper, we present the optimization model taking
   minimum migration cost and maximum resource utilization with
   multi-resources such as storage, bandwidth, CPU, and disk space into
   account. The optimization of our proposed model is non-deterministic
   polynomial-time hard. According to the model, we present an efficient
   approximate algorithm based on bin packing algorithm, called MinCost, to
   resolve our model and obtain a near-optimal solution. Finally, the
   simulation results in this paper show that our model and algorithm is
   efficient. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{As a kind of biomass nanofiller for polymers, cellulose nanocrystal
   (CNC) has good mechanical properties and reinforcing capability. To
   improve the compatibility of poly(butylene succinate-co-butylene
   adipate) (PBSA)/CNC composites, phthalic anhydride was used as a
   compatilizer during melt mixing, leading to the significant improvement
   of the mechanical properties and thermal stability of the composites,
   which is related to the better dispersion of CNC in the composites. The
   addition of phthalic anhydride could accelerate the crystallization of
   PBSA component as evidenced by the curves of isothermal crystallization
   of the composites, but had little effect on the crystalline polymorphs
   of PBSA component. The addition of phthalic anhydride could strongly
   improve the hydrophobicity of the composites. The good mechanical
   properties, fast crystallization and improved hydrophobicity of PBSA/CNC
   composites with phthalic anhydride are favor to their practical
   commercial utilization. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   structures, vibrational densities of states, ionic mobilities, and
   cavity distributions of the amorphous materials are discussed and
   compared with data on crystalline phases where available. The high
   mobility of Ag in solid state electrolyte applications is related to the

Abstract = {{Softening neural interfaces are implanted stiff to enable precise
   insertion, and they soften in physiological conditions to minimize
   modulus mismatch with tissue. In this work, a
   high-charge-injection-capacity iridium electrode fabrication process is
   detailed. For the first time, this process enables integration of
   iridium electrodes onto softening substrates using photolithography to
   define all features in the device. Importantly, no electroplated layers
   are utilized, leading to a highly scalable method for consistent device
   fabrication. The iridium electrode is metallically bonded to the gold
   conductor layer, which is covalently bonded to the softening substrate
   via sulfur-based click chemistry. The resulting shape-memory polymer
   neural interfaces can deliver more than 2 billion symmetric biphasic
   pulses (100 mu s/phase), with a charge of 200 mu C/cm(2) and geometric
   surface area (GSA) of 300 mu m(2). A transfer-by-polymerization method
   is used in combination with standard semiconductor processing techniques
   to fabricate functional neural probes onto a thiol ene-based, thin film
   substrate. Electrical stability is tested under simulated physiological
   conditions in an accelerated electrical aging paradigm with periodic
   measurement of electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and charge
   storage capacity (CSC) at various intervals. Electrochemical
   characterization and both optical and scanning electron microscopy
   suggest significant breakdown of the 600 nm-thick parylene-C insulation,
   although no delamination of the conductors or of the final electrode
   interface was observed. Minor cracking at the edges of the thin film

Abstract = {{The kinetic experiments for the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of methyl
   heptanoate were studied over Rh/ZrO2 catalyst in a three-phase batch
   reactor in the temperature range 250-330 degrees C and in the pressure
   range 60-100 bar with H-2. The complex HDO reaction network of methyl
   heptanoate was simplified and modeled using both empirical power-law
   models and mechanistic models. Surface reaction mechanism was for the
   first time applied to develop a mechanistic model for the key reaction
   pathways in the HDO reaction network. Two types of active sites were
   assumed for the adsorption of oxygenated components (ester, fatty acid,
   and alcohol) and H-2, respectively. Both the power-law model and the
   mechanistic model adequately described the features of HDO kinetics,
   while the mechanistic model outperformed the power-law model. Kinetic
   modeling was performed rigorously by taking into account the vapor
   liquid equilibrium and thermodynamic nonideality in the three-phase
   batch reactor model.}},

Title = {{Characterizing the vulnerability of frequent emergency department users
   by applying a conceptual framework: a controlled, cross-sectional study}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Frequent emergency department (ED) users meet several of the
   criteria of vulnerability, but this needs to be further examined taking
   into consideration all vulnerability's different dimensions. This study
   aimed to characterize frequent ED users and to define risk factors of
   frequent ED use within a universal health care coverage system, applying
   a conceptual framework of vulnerability.
   Methods: A controlled, cross-sectional study comparing frequent ED users
   to a control group of non-frequent users was conducted at the Lausanne
   University Hospital, Switzerland. Frequent users were defined as
   patients with five or more visits to the ED in the previous 12 months.
   The two groups were compared using validated scales for each one of the
   five dimensions of an innovative conceptual framework: socio-demographic
   characteristics; somatic, mental, and risk-behavior indicators; and use
   of health care services. Independent t-tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests,
   Pearson's Chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test were used for the
   comparison. To examine the -related to vulnerability- risk factors for
   being a frequent ED user, univariate and multivariate logistic
   regression models were used.
   Results: We compared 226 frequent users and 173 controls. Frequent users
   had more vulnerabilities in all five dimensions of the conceptual
   framework. They were younger, and more often immigrants from
   low/middle-income countries or unemployed, had more somatic and
   psychiatric comorbidities, were more often tobacco users, and had more
   primary care physician (PCP) visits. The most significant frequent ED
   use risk factors were a history of more than three hospital admissions
   in the previous 12 months (adj OR:23.2, 95\%CI = 9.1-59.2), the absence
   of a PCP (adj OR:8.4, 95\%CI = 2.1-32.7), living less than 5 km from an
   ED (adj OR:4.4, 95\%CI = 2.1-9.0), and household income lower than USD
   2,800/month (adj OR:4.3, 95\%CI = 2.0-9.2).
   Conclusions: Frequent ED users within a universal health coverage system
   form a highly vulnerable population, when taking into account all five
   dimensions of a conceptual framework of vulnerability. The predictive
   factors identified could be useful in the early detection of future
   frequent users, in order to address their specific needs and decrease
   vulnerability, a key priority for health care policy makers. Application
   of the conceptual framework in future research is warranted.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Osteoporosis-related fractures are one of the complications of Graves'
   disease. This study hypothesized that the different actions of
   thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) antibodies, both stimulating
   and blocking activities in Graves' disease patients might oppositely
   impact bone turnover. Newly diagnosed premenopausal Graves' disease
   patients were enrolled (n = 93) and divided into two groups: patients
   with TSHR antibodies with thyroid-stimulating activity (stimulating
   activity group, n = 83) and patients with TSHR antibodies with
   thyroid-stimulating activity combined with blocking activity (blocking
   activity group, n = 10). From the stimulating activity group, patients
   who had matched values for free T4 and TSH binding inhibitor
   immunoglobulin (TBII) to the blocking activity group were further
   classified as stimulating activity-matched control (n = 11). Bone
   turnover markers BS-ALP, Osteocalcin, and C-telopeptide were
   significantly lower in the blocking activity group than in the
   stimulating activity or stimulating activity-matched control groups. The
   TBII level showed positive correlations with BS-ALP and osteocalcin
   levels in the stimulating activity group, while it had a negative
   correlation with the osteocalcin level in the blocking activity group.
   In conclusion, the activation of TSHR antibody-activated TSH signaling
   contributes to high bone turnover, independent of the actions of thyroid
   hormone, and thyroid-stimulation blocking antibody has protective
   effects against bone metabolism in Graves' disease.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding and manipulating the dynamic properties of the magnetic
   vortices stabilized in patterned ferromagnetic structures are of great
   interest owing to the superior resonant features with the high thermal
   stability and their flexible tunability. So far, numerous methods for
   investigating the dynamic properties of the magnetic vortex have been
   proposed and demonstrated. However, those techniques have some
   regulations such as spatial resolution, experimental facility and
   sensitivity. Here, we develop a simple and sensitive method for
   investigating the vortex-core dynamics by using the electrically
   separated excitation and detection circuits. We demonstrate that the
   resonant oscillation of the magnetic vortex induced by the
   amplitude-modulated alternating-sign magnetic field is efficiently
   picked up by the lock-in detection with the modulated frequency. By
   extending this method, we also investigate the size dependence and the
   influence of the magneto-static interaction in the resonant property of
   the magnetic vortex.}},

Title = {{On the stability of the electroweak vacuum in the presence of low-scale
   seesaw models}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{The scale of neutrino masses and the Planck scale are separated by more
   than twenty-seven order of magnitudes. However, they can be linked by
   imposing the stability of the electroweak (EW) vacuum. The crucial
   ingredient is provided by the generation of neutrino masses via a seesaw
   mechanism triggered by Yukawa interactions between the standard model
   (SM) Higgs and lepton doublets and additional heavy right-handed
   neutrinos. These neutrinos participate to the renormalization group (RG)
   running of the dimensionless SM couplings, affecting their high-energy
   behavior. The Higgs quartic coupling is dragged towards negative values,
   thus altering the stability of the EW vacuum. In the usual type-I seesaw
   model, this effect is too small to be a threat since, in order to comply
   with low-energy neutrino data, one is forced to consider either too
   small Yukawa couplings or too heavy right-handed neutrinos. In this
   paper we explore this general idea in the context of low-scale seesaw
   models. These models are characterized by sizable Yukawa couplings and
   right-handed neutrinos with mass of the order of the EW scale, thus
   maximizing their impact on the RG flow. As a general result, we find
   that Yukawa couplings such that Tr((Y nu Y)-Y-dagger nu) greater than or
   similar to 0.4 are excluded. We discuss the impact of this bound on
   several observables, with a special focus on the lepton flavor violating
   process mu -> e gamma and the neutrino-less double beta decay.}},

Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Cleaner fish, i.e. various wrasse (Labridae) species and lumpsucker
   Cyclopterus lumpus, are to an increasing extent used for biocontrol of
   the salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis in European salmon farming.
   Although efficient de-licers, cleaner fish mortality levels in salmon
   farms are often high. Bacterial infections are common, and Vibrio
   splendidus-related strains are frequently identified during diagnostic
   investigations. The population structure of 112 V. splendidus-related
   isolates, derived primarily from wrasse species, was investigated by
   means of multilocus sequence analysis using 5 housekeeping genes (rpoD,
   ftsZ, pyrH, rpoA and atpA). Most isolates were found to be closely
   related to the V. splendidus type strain, yet displayed extensive
   genetic microdiversity. Slide agglutination testing using polyclonal
   rabbit antisera further indicated O-antigen variability. Intra-outbreak
   genetic and antigenic diversity suggests direct infection from seawater,
   rather than fish-to-fish transmission, as the main route of infection.
   The variable nature of isolates involved complicates qualified selection
   of representative candidate strains, e.g. for infection and vaccine
   trials.}},

Abstract = {{Silver ions (Ag+) have strong bactericidal effects and Ag-coated medical
   devices proved their effectiveness in reducing infections in revision
   total joint arthroplasty. We quantitatively determined the antimicrobial
   potency of different surface treatments on a titanium alloy (Ti), which
   had been conversed to diamond-like carbon (DLC-Ti) and doped with high
   (Ag:PVP = 1:2) and low (Ag: PVP = 1:10 and 1:20) concentrations of Ag
   (Ag-DLC-Ti) with a modified technique of ion implantation. Bacterial
   adhesion and planktonic growth of clinically relevant bacterial strains
   (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa) on Ag-DLC-Ti were compared to untreated Ti by quantification
   of colony forming units on the adherent surface and in the growth medium
   as well as semiquantitatively by determining the grade of biofilm
   formation by scanning electron microscopy. (1) A significant (p < 0.05)
   antimicrobial effect could be found for all Ag-DLC-Ti samples (reduced
   growth by 5.6-2.5 logarithmic levels). (2) The antimicrobial effect was
   depending on the tested bacterial strain (most for P. aeruginosa, least
   for S. aureus). (3) Antimicrobial potency was positively correlated with
   Ag concentrations. (4) Biofilm formation was decreased by Ag-DLC-Ti
   surfaces. This study revealed potent antibacterial effects of Ag-DLC-Ti.
   This may serve as a promising novel approach to close the gap in
   antimicrobial protection of musculoskeletal implants.}},

Title = {{RNA interference targeting carbohydrate sulfotransferase 3 diminishes
   macrophage accumulation, inhibits MMP-9 expression and promotes lung
   recovery in murine pulmonary emphysema}},
Journal = {{RESPIRATORY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans are an important mediators
   in inflammation and leukocyte trafficking. However, their roles in
   pulmonary emphysema have not been explored.
   In a murine model of elastase-induced pulmonary emphysema, we found
   increased carbohydrate sulfotransferase 3 (CHST3), a specific enzyme
   that synthesizes chondroitin 6-sulfate proteoglycan (C6SPG). To
   elucidate the role of C6SPG, we investigated the effect of small
   interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting CHST3 that inhibits C6SPG-synthesis on
   the pathogenesis of pulmonary emphysema.
   Methods: Mice were intraperitoneally injected with CHST3 siRNA or
   negative control siRNA on day0 and 7 after intratracheal instillation of
   elastase. Histology, respiratory function, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)
   content, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), elastin staining and gene
   expressions of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and matrix
   metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 mRNA were evaluated on day7 and/or day21.
   Results: CHST3 mRNA increased at day 7 and decreased thereafter in lung.
   CHST3 siRNA successfully inhibited the expression of CHST3 mRNA
   throughout the study and this was associated with significant reduction
   of GAGs and C6SPG. Airway destruction and respiratory function were
   improved by the treatment with CHST3 siRNA. CHST3 siRNA reduced the
   number of macrophages both in BAL and lung parenchyma and also
   suppressed the increased expressions of TNF-alpha and MMP-9 mRNA.
   Futhermore, CHST3 siRNA improved the reduction of the elastin in the
   alveolar walls.
   Conclusions: CHST3 siRNA diminishes accumulation of excessive
   macrophages and the mediators, leading to accelerate the functional
   recovery from airway damage by repair of the elastin network associated
   with pulmonary emphysema.}},

Title = {{Model-Based Tumor Growth Dynamics and Therapy Response in a Mouse Model
   of De Novo Carcinogenesis}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Tumorigenesis is a complex, multistep process that depends on numerous
   alterations within the cell and contribution from the surrounding
   stroma. The ability to model macroscopic tumor evolution with high
   fidelity may contribute to better predictive tools for designing tumor
   therapy in the clinic. However, attempts to model tumor growth have
   mainly been developed and validated using data from xenograft mouse
   models, which fail to capture important aspects of tumorigenesis
   including tumor-initiating events and interactions with the immune
   system. In the present study, we investigate tumor growth and therapy
   dynamics in a mouse model of de novo carcinogenesis that closely
   recapitulates tumor initiation, progression and maintenance in vivo. We
   show that the rate of tumor growth and the effects of therapy are highly
   variable and mouse specific using a Gompertz model to describe tumor
   growth and a two-compartment pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model to
   describe the effects of therapy in mice treated with 5-FU. We show that
   inter-mouse growth variability is considerably larger than intra-mouse
   variability and that there is a correlation between tumor growth and
   drug kill rates. Our results show that in vivo tumor growth and
   regression in a double transgenic mouse model are highly variable both
   within and between subjects and that mathematical models can be used to
   capture the overall characteristics of this variability. In order for
   these models to become useful tools in the design of optimal therapy
   strategies and ultimately in clinical practice, a subject-specific
   modelling strategy is necessary, rather than approaches that are based
   on the average behavior of a given subject population which could
   provide erroneous results.}},

Title = {{Nontoxic colloidal particles impede antibiotic resistance of swarming
   bacteria by disrupting collective motion and speed}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},

Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{A monolayer of swarming B. subtilis on semisolid agar is shown to
   display enhanced resistance against antibacterial drugs due to their
   collective behavior and motility. The dynamics of swarming motion,
   visualized in real time using time-lapse microscopy, prevents the
   bacteria from prolonged exposure to lethal drug concentrations. The
   elevated drug resistance is significantly reduced when the collective
   motion of bacteria is judiciously disrupted using nontoxic polystyrene
   colloidal particles immobilized on the agar surface. The colloidal
   particles block and hinder the motion of the cells, and force large
   swarming rafts to break up into smaller packs in order to maneuver
   across narrow spaces between densely packed particles. In this manner,
   cohesive rafts rapidly lose their collectivity, speed, and group
   dynamics, and the cells become vulnerable to the drugs. The antibiotic
   resistance capability of swarming B. subtilis is experimentally observed
   to be negatively correlated with the number density of colloidal
   particles on the engineered surface. This relationship is further tested
   using an improved self-propelled particle model that takes into account
   interparticle alignment and hard-core repulsion. This work has pertinent
   implications on the design of optimal methods to treat drug resistant
   bacteria commonly found in swarming colonies.}},

Title = {{Microstructural and Electronic Origins of Open-Circuit Voltage Tuning in
   Organic Solar Cells Based on Ternary Blends}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Organic ternary heterojunction photovoltaic blends are sometimes
   observed to undergo a gradual evolution in open-circuit voltage (V-oc)
   with increasing amounts of a second donor or an acceptor. The V-oc is
   strongly correlated with the energy of the charge transfer state in the
   blend, but this value depends on both local and mesoscopic orders. In
   this work, the behavior of V-oc in the presence of a wide range of
   interfacial electronic states is investigated. The key charge transfer
   state interfaces responsible for V-oc in several model systems with
   varying morphology are identified. Systems consisting of one donor with
   two fullerene molecules and of one acceptor with a donor polymer of
   varying regio-regularity are used. The effects from the changing
   energetic disorder in the material and from the variation due to a law
   of simple mixtures are quantified. It has been found that populating the
   higher-energy charge transfer states is not responsible for the observed
   change in V-oc upon the addition of a third component. Aggregating
   polymers and miscible fullerenes are compared, and it has been concluded
   that in both cases charge delocalization, aggregation, and local
   polarization effects shift the lowest-energy charge transfer state
   distribution.}},

Title = {{A 3-day EGCG-supplementation reduces interstitial lactate concentration
   in skeletal muscle of overweight subjects}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Green tea, particularly epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), may affect
   body weight and composition, possibly by enhancing fat oxidation. The
   aim of this double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled cross-over study
   was to investigate whether 3-day supplementation with EGCG (282mg/day)
   stimulates fat oxidation and lipolysis in 24 overweight subjects (age =
   30 +/- 2yrs, BMI = 27.7 +/- 0.3 kg/m(2)). Energy expenditure, substrate
   metabolism and circulating metabolites were determined during fasting
   and postprandial conditions. After 6 h, a fat biopsy was collected to
   examine gene expression. In 12 subjects, skeletal muscle glycerol,
   glucose and lactate concentrations were determined using microdialysis.
   EGCG-supplementation did not alter energy expenditure and substrate
   oxidation compared to placebo. Although EGCG reduced postprandial
   circulating glycerol concentrations (P = 0.015), no difference in
   skeletal muscle lipolysis was observed. Fasting (P = 0.001) and
   postprandial (P = 0.003) skeletal muscle lactate concentrations were
   reduced after EGCG-supplementation compared to placebo, despite similar
   tissue blood flow. Adipose tissue leptin (P = 0.05) and FAT/CD36
   expression (P = 0.08) were increased after EGCG compared to placebo. In
   conclusion, 3-day EGCG-supplementation decreased postprandial plasma
   glycerol concentrations, but had no significant effects on skeletal
   muscle lipolysis and wholebody fat oxidation in overweight individuals.
   Furthermore, EGCG decreased skeletal muscle lactate concentrations,
   which suggest a shift towards a more oxidative muscle phenotype.}},

   {[}3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione unit on the electro-optical properties have
   been investigated. Among polymers developed, two new highly processable

   air-processed polymer solar cells with power conversion efficiencies of
   5.1\% and 7.1\% using the following inverted configuration:

Abstract = {{Immobilization of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) onto flexible
   polymeric substrates as secondary supports expands the versatility of
   MOFs for surface coatings for the development of functional materials.
   In this work, we demonstrate the deposition of copper(II)
   benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate (CuBTC) crystals directly onto the surface
   of carboxyl-functionalized cotton capable of generating the therapeutic
   bioagent nitric oxide (NO) from endogenous sources. Characterization of
   the CuBTC-cotton material by XRD, ATR-IR, and UV-vis indicate that CuBTC
   is successfully immobilized on the cotton fabric. In addition, SEM
   imaging reveals excellent surface coverage with well-defined CuBTC
   crystals. Subsequently, the CuBTC-cotton material was evaluated as a
   supported heterogeneous catalyst for the generation of NO using
   S-nitrosocysteamine as the substrate. The resulting reactivity is
   consistent with the activity observed for unsupported CuBTC particles.
   Overall, this work demonstrates deposition of MOFs onto a flexible
   polymeric material with excellent coverage as well as catalytic NO
   release from S-nitrosocysteamine at therapeutic levels.}},

Title = {{Risk Assessment for Sudden Death in Epilepsy: The SUDEP-7 Inventory}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a major cause
   of death in those with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). There is a need
   for inventories and biomarkers associated with the risk for SUDEP.
   Objective: To explore the revised SUDEP Risk Inventory (SUDEP-7) in a
   cohort with DRE and determine the association with Heart Rate and other
   covariates.
   Methods: Twenty-five subjects with severe DRE were enrolled in a
   clinical trial for epilepsy. Baseline demographics, duration of
   epilepsy, seizure types, seizure frequency, seizure severity, AEDs, and
   vital signs were collected. Heart rate variability (HRV) was calculated
   from 1-h recordings of ECG. A SUDEP Risk Inventory (SUDEP-7) was
   administered, which included seven validated and weighted risk factors
   initially identified by Walczak et al. as factors associated with SUDEP
   risk.
   Results: The total score on the revised SUDEP-7 ranged from 1 to 7, mean
   = 3.4 (SD 1.8). The SUDEP Risk Inventory score was inversely correlated
   with RMSSD (Pearson r = -0.45, p = 0.027). The following variables were
   significantly associated with RMSSD: epilepsy duration (p = 0.02), age
   (p = 0.03), and developmental intellectual disability (p <0.001). The
   correlation between RMSSD and SUDEP-7 tended to persist also after the
   adjustment for patient age (r = -0.40, p = 0.05). Two subjects died of
   SUDEP: their SUDEP-7 scores were above average and in the upper
   twenty-fifth and fiftieth percentiles, respectively (6 and 4, mean =
   3.4).
   Conclusion: RMSSD, a measure of low frequency HRV, was significantly
   associated with SUDEP Risk Inventory (SUDEP-7) scores. Using a
   multivariate model, the covariates of developmental intellectual
   disability, age, and duration of epilepsy were also significantly
   associated with decreased HRV. The correlation between decreased HRV and
   a higher SUDEP-7 score remained unchanged even after the adjustment for
   patient age. The results suggest that older age, greater duration of
   epilepsy, and the presence of developmental intellectual disability may
   increase the risk of SUDEP through their direct influence on decreasing
   the vagus nerve-mediated HRV. Further validation of the SUDEP-7
   inventory is indicated.}},

Title = {{Tracking genetically engineered lymphocytes long-term reveals the

Abstract = {{Long-lasting immune protection from pathogens and cancer requires the
   generation of memory T cells able to survive long-term. To unravel the
   immunological requirements for long-term persistence of human memory T
   cells, we characterized and traced, over several years, T lymphocytes
   genetically modified to express the thymidine kinase (TK) suicide gene
   that were infused in 10 patients after haploidentical hematopoietic stem
   cell transplantation (HSCT). At 2 to 14 years after infusion and in the
   presence of a broad and resting immune system, we could still detect
   effectors/effector memory (TEM/EFF), central memory (T-CM), and stem
   memory (T-SCM) TK+ cells, circulating at low but stable levels in all
   patients. Longitudinal analysis of cytomegalovirus (CMV)- and
   Flu-specific TK+ cells indicated that antigen recognition was dominant
   in driving in vivo expansion and persistence at detectable levels. The
   amount of infused TSCM cells positively correlated with early expansion
   and with the absolute counts of long-term persisting gene-marked cells.
   By combining T cell sorting with sequencing of integration (IS), TCR
   alpha and TCR beta clonal markers, we showed that T cells retrieved
   long-term were enriched in clones originally shared in different memory
   T cell subsets, whereas dominant long-term clonotypes appeared to
   preferentially originate from infused T-SCM and T-CM clones. Together,
   these results indicate that long-term persistence of gene-modified
   memory T cells after haploidentical HSCT is influenced by antigen
   exposure and by the original phenotype of infused cells. Cancer adoptive
   immunotherapy might thus benefit from cellular products enriched in
   lymphocytes with an early-differentiated phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{A novel III-nitride-based light emitting diode (LED) fabrication process
   which is based on selective-area epitaxial growth on Si \{1 1 1\} facets
   etched into Si (1 0 0) substrates is presented. A micro-stripe pattern
   is formed with semi-polar \{1 (1) over bar 0 1\} crystallographic planes
   of GaN evolving from an epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELOG)-like
   process. The \{1 (1) over bar 0 1\} planes of GaN serve as a template
   for the growth of semi-polar blue and green LED structures with
   InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells (MQW). A complete fabrication chain
   encompassing substrate etching, metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy
   (MOVPE), characterization, LED processing and device manufacture has
   been developed.
   The semi-polar LED stacks are of high crystalline quality, which is
   manifested by homogeneous InGaN layers in the \{1 (1) over bar 0 1\} MQW
   structure and smooth \{1 (1) over bar 0 1\} LED surface planes. Although
   threading dislocations intersect with the semi-polar \{1 (1) over bar 0
   1\} MQW, V-shaped defects typically observed in polar c-plane MQW
   structures are not detected.
   The blue and green semi-polar LED show only a weak polarization-related
   wavelength shift at large current densities consistent with the lower
   built-in electric fields in the semipolar MQW. At low current densities,
   the green LED exhibit a strong wavelength shift due to In clustering
   effects. The blue LED reveal a stable emission color, which indicates a
   homogeneous In distribution in the wells.}},

   networks}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Most real networks are characterized by connectivity patterns that
   evolve in time following complex, non-Markovian, dynamics. Here we
   investigate the impact of this ubiquitous feature by studying the
   Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) and
   Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic models on activity
   driven networks with and without memory (i.e., Markovian and
   non-Markovian). We find that memory inhibits the spreading process in
   SIR models by shifting the epidemic threshold to larger values and
   reducing the final fraction of recovered nodes. On the contrary, in SIS
   processes memory reduces the epidemic threshold and, for a wide range of
   disease parameters, increases the fraction of nodes affected by the
   disease in the endemic state. The heterogeneity in tie strengths, and
   the frequent repetition of strong ties it entails, allows in fact less
   virulent SIS-like diseases to survive in tightly connected local
   clusters that serve as reservoir for the virus. We validate this picture
   by studying both processes on two real temporal networks.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, olive fruits from six cultivars grown under
   similar agronomical and environmental conditions were collected at four
   different times during fruit ripening. Some agronomical traits were

   fruits was also identified and quantified during the same period using
   high-performance liquid chromatography diode array detection
   time-of-ffight-mass spectrometry. Thus, a total of 57 phenolic compounds
   were determined, and qualitative and quantitative differences among
   cultivars and also among sampling times were observed. In contrast to
   the agronomical traits, a general decrease of total phenolic compounds
   was observed, characterized by a domination of secoiridoids at the
   beginning of ripening and by a domination of simple phenols and
   flavonoids in the end. This is the first time that four of the six
   cultivars have been studied regarding phenolic compounds evolution

Title = {{Vascular assessment techniques of podiatrists in Australia and New
   Zealand: a web-based survey}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FOOT AND ANKLE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Podiatrists play a central role in conducting non-invasive
   vascular assessment in the lower extremity. This involves screening for
   signs and symptoms of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and ongoing
   monitoring of the condition. Podiatric vascular assessment practices in
   Australia and New Zealand are currently unclear. Determining the
   clinical habits of Podiatrists is essential in identifying if there is a
   need for further education or support in performing accurate vascular
   assessments.
   Methods: A web-based, secure, anonymous questionnaire was conducted of
   registered Podiatrists in Australia and New Zealand between 1 April and
   31 July 2013. The questions examined clinician's regular practices in
   vascular assessment, clinical indicators to perform and barriers in
   completing vascular assessment. Nominal logistic regression was
   performed to further examine years of experience and practice setting on
   clinical indicators to perform vascular assessment and types of
   assessment performed.
   Results: Four hundred forty-seven podiatrists participated in the
   survey. Clinical indicators for vascular assessment, along with barriers
   and available equipment were examined and the results varied depending
   on the podiatrists' geographical location, practice setting, and
   experience. Palpation of pedal pulses was the most frequently reported
   assessment (97 \%) along with Doppler assessment (74 \%). Pressure
   measurement was the least frequently reported vascular assessment
   method, with only 34 \% undertaking ankle-brachial indices and 19 \%
   completing toe-brachial indices. Public podiatrists reported more varied
   and complete vascular assessment compared to those in private practice.
   Lack of time was identified as the most frequently reported barrier (66
   \%) in performing vascular assessment, followed by lack of equipment (28
   \%). In New Zealand podiatrists, lack of equipment was much more of an
   issue than in Australian podiatrists.
   Conclusion: Large variations exist in vascular assessment methods
   amongst Australian and New Zealand podiatrists. Some assessments being
   undertaken are potentially inadequate for accurate screening for PAD.
   There is a need for continuing education in vascular assessment to
   address the deficiencies in technique reported by some Podiatrists. A
   podiatry-relevant summary of broad international guidelines for PAD
   screening may be of use to improve utilisation and accuracy of screening
   methods to improve patient management.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Molecular signaling of angiogenesis begins within hours
   after initiation of a stroke and the following regulation of endothelial
   integrity mediated by growth factor receptors and vascular growth
   factors. Recent studies further provided insights into the coordinated
   patterns of post-stroke gene expressions and the relationships between
   neurodegenerative diseases and neural function recovery processes after
   a stroke.
   Results: Differential protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) were
   constructed at 3 post-stroke time points, and proteins with a
   significant stroke relevance value (SRV) were discovered. Genes,
   including UBC, CUL3, APP, NEDD8, JUP, and SIRT7, showed high
   associations with time after a stroke, and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
   results showed that these post-stroke time series-associated genes were
   related to molecular and cellular functions of cell death, cell
   survival, the cell cycle, cellular development, cellular movement, and
   cell-to-cell signaling and interactions. These biomarkers may be helpful
   for the early detection, diagnosis, and prognosis of ischemic stroke.
   Conclusions: This is our first attempt to use our theory of a systems
   biology framework on strokes. We focused on 3 key post-stroke time
   points. We identified the network and corresponding network biomarkers
   for the 3 time points, further studies are needed to experimentally
   confirm the findings and compare them with the causes of ischemic
   stroke. Our findings showed that stroke-associated biomarker genes at
   different time points were significantly involved in cell cycle
   processing, including G(2)-M, G(1)-S and meiosis, which contributes to
   the current understanding of the etiology of stroke. We hope this work
   helps scientists reveal more hidden cellular mechanisms of stroke
   etiology and repair processes.}},

Abstract = {{Stream segregation enables a listener to disentangle multiple competing
   sequences of sounds. A recent study from our laboratory demonstrated
   that cortical neurons in anesthetized cats exhibit spatial stream
   segregation (SSS) by synchronizing preferentially to one of two
   sequences of noise bursts that alternate between two source locations.
   Here, we examine the emergence of SSS along the ascending auditory
   pathway. Extracellular recordings were made in anesthetized rats from
   the inferior colliculus (IC), the nucleus of the brachium of the IC
   (BIN), the medial geniculate body (MGB), and the primary auditory cortex
   (A1). Stimuli consisted of interleaved sequences of broadband noise
   bursts that alternated between two source locations. At stimulus
   presentation rates of 5 and 10 bursts per second, at which human
   listeners report robust SSS, neural SSS is weak in the central nucleus
   of the IC (ICC), it appears in the nucleus of the brachium of the IC
   (BIN) and in approximately two-thirds of neurons in the ventral MGB
   (MGBv), and is prominent throughout A1. The enhancement of SSS at the
   cortical level reflects both increased spatial sensitivity and increased
   forward suppression. We demonstrate that forward suppression in A1 does
   not result from synaptic inhibition at the cortical level. Instead,
   forward suppression might reflect synaptic depression in the
   thalamocortical projection. Together, our findings indicate that
   auditory streams are increasingly segregated along the ascending
   auditory pathway as distinct mutually synchronized neural populations.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To describe the spectrum of cardiac disorders, timing in
   relation to interventional procedures, and outcome in children with
   cardiac disease and arterial ischemic stroke (AIS).
   Methods: Children younger than 18 years with cardiac disease and
   radiologically confirmed AIS admitted to the Royal Children's Hospital
   Melbourne between 1993 and 2010 were retrospectively identified using
   ICD-9 and ICD-10 searches.
   Results: Seventy-six children with cardiac disease and radiologically
   confirmed AIS were identified with the median age at diagnosis of 5
   months (interquartile range 0-58). Cardiac lesions included cyanotic
   congenital heart disease (CHD) in 42 (55\%), acyanotic heart disease in
   24 (29\%), cardiomyopathies/myocarditis in 6 (8\%), infective
   endocarditis in 3 (4\%), and primary arrhythmias in 3 (4\%). Stroke
   occurred following cardiac procedures in 52 patients (68\%): 41 post
   cardiac surgery (4.6 strokes per 1,000 surgical procedures) and 11 post
   cardiac catheterization (1.7 strokes per 1,000 catheterizations). The
   median time from procedure to diagnosis of stroke was 3 days
   (interquartile range 2-7), with 68\% (95\% confidence interval
   58\%-79\%) of strokes estimated to occur within the periprocedural
   period. Prevalence of periprocedural stroke varied by diagnostic
   category, but was most common in patients with cyanotic CHD undergoing
   palliative surgery (22/2,256, 1\%) (p < 0.005). There were 3 AIS-related
   deaths, and 54 survivors (84\%) had persisting neurologic deficits.
   Conclusions: Infants with cyanotic CHD were most frequently affected by
   AIS during the periprocedural period. Prospective cohort studies are
   required to determine effective primary and secondary prevention
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate the diversity of tyramine

   phosphate/citrate buffers with different pH, NaCl concentration and
   incubation temperature. At intervals, cell viability and tyramine
   production were assessed by plate counting and HPLC analysis,
   respectively. The activity of a purified tyrosine decarboxylase (TDC)
   was determined under the same conditions, as a reference. Reduced loss
   in cell viability was observed in all the tested conditions, except for
   pH 4 after 24 h. The TDC activity was greatly heterogeneous within the
   enterococci: EF37 and FC12 produced the higher tyramine concentrations,
   ATCC 29212 showed a reduced decarboxylase activity, while EF643 did not
   accumulate detectable amounts of tyramine in all the conditions assayed.
   Among the considerate variables, temperature was the most influencing
   factor on tyramine accumulation for enterococcal cells. To further
   correlate the phenotypic and genetic characteristics of the enterococci,
   the TDC operon region carrying the genes tyrosine decarboxylase (tyrDC),
   tyrosine/tyramine permease (tyrP), and Na+/H+ antiporter (nhaC-2) was
   amplified and sequenced. The genetic organization and nucleotide
   sequence of this operon region were highly conserved in the enterococcal
   strains of the same species. The heterogeneity in tyramine production
   found between the two E. faecalis strains could be ascribed to different
   regulation mechanisms not yet elucidated. On the contrary, a codon stop
   was identified in the translated tyrDC sequence of E. faecium FC643,
   supporting its inability to accumulate tyramine in the tested
   conditions. In addition, the presence of an additional putative tyrosine
   decarboxylase with different substrate specificity and genetic
   organization was noticed for the first time. Concluding, the high TDC
   activity heterogeneity within enterococci determined different
   accumulation of tyramine, depending on different genetic determinants,
   regulation mechanisms, and environmental factors. The present research
   contributes to elucidate the genetic characteristics of enterococcal
   strains and correlate specific mutations to their different strain
   dependent tyraminogenic activity.}},

Abstract = {{The behaviour of energetic aggregates was investigated for quasi-static
   compression and high strain rate thermomechanical compression behaviour
   that is coupled to laser irradiation. A dislocation-density- based
   crystal plasticity formulation was used to represent energetic
   crystalline behaviour, a finite viscoelastic formulation was used for
   the polymer binder and a coupled electromagnetic (EM)-thermomechanical
   computational scheme was used to predict aggregate response. Aggregates
   with different crystal sizes were considered to account for physically
   representative energetic microstructures and to understand the effects
   of crystal-crystal and crystal-binder interactions. The presence of
   smaller embedded crystals in the binder ligaments inhibited viscous
   sliding, and resulted in global hardening of the aggregate, which led to
   large stress gradients, localized plasticity and dislocation-density
   accumulation. The embedded crystals also increased scattering of the EM
   wave within the binder ligaments and increased the localization of EM
   energy and laser heat generation. Geometrically, necessary dislocation
   densities and stress gradients were calculated to characterize how
   hardening at the binder interfaces can lead to strengthening or defect
   nucleation.}},

Abstract = {{Pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a potential source of
   transplantable cells for treating patients with diabetes. To investigate
   the impact of the host recipient on hESC-derived pancreatic progenitor
   cell maturation, cells were transplanted into immunodeficient SCID-beige
   mice or nude rats. Following the transplant, basal human C-peptide
   levels were consistently higher in mice compared with rats, but only
   rats showed robust meal- and glucose-responsive human C-peptide
   secretion by 19-21 weeks. Grafts from rats contained a higher proportion
   of insulin:glucagon immunoreactivity, fewer exocrine cells, and improved
   expression of mature f3 cell markers compared with mice. Moreover,
   ECM-related genes were enriched, the collagen network was denser, and
   blood vessels were more intricately integrated into the engrafted
   endocrine tissue in rats relative to mice. Overall, hESC-derived
   pancreatic progenitor cells matured faster in nude rats compared with
   SCID-beige mice, indicating that the host recipient can greatly
   influence the fate of immature pancreatic progenitor cells
   post-transplantation.}},

Abstract = {{The metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) has been
   implicated in the pathophysiology of mood and anxiety disorders and is a
   potential treatment target in major depressive disorder (MDD). This
   study compared brain mGluR5 binding in elderly patients suffering from
   MDD with that in elderly healthy volunteers using positron emission
   tomography (PET) and {[}C-11] ABP688. Twenty elderly (mean age: 63.0 +/-
   6.3) subjects with MDD and twenty-two healthy volunteers in the same age
   range (mean age: 66.4 +/- 7.3) were examined with PET after a single
   bolus injection of {[}C-11]ABP688, with many receiving arterial
   sampling. PET images were analyzed on a region of interest and a voxel
   level to compare mGluR5 binding in the brain between the two groups.
   Differences in {[}C-11]ABP688 binding between patients with early-and
   late-onset depression were also assessed. In contrast to a previously
   published report in a younger cohort, no significant difference in
   {[}C-11]ABP688 binding was observed between elderly subjects with MDD
   and healthy volunteers. {[}C-11]ABP688 binding was also similar between
   subgroups with early-or late-onset depression. We believe this is the
   first study to examine mGluR5 expression in depression in the elderly.
   Although future work is required, results suggest potential differences
   in the pathophysiology of elderly depression versus depression earlier
   in life.}},

Abstract = {{Protein protein interactions are recognized as a fundamental phenomenon
   that is intimately associated with biological functions and thus are
   ideal targets for developing modulators for regulating biological
   functions. A challenge is to identify a site that is situated away from
   but functionally connected to the protein protein interface. We employed
   bone motphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and their receptors as a model system
   to develop a strategy for identifying such a network of communication.
   Accordingly, using computational analyses with the COREX/BEST algorithm,
   we uncovered an overall pattern connecting various regions of BMPR-1B
   ectodomain, including the four conserved residues in the protein protein
   interface. In preparation for testing the long-range effects of
   mutations of distal residues for future studies, we examined the extent
   of measurable perturbation of the four conserved residues by
   determination of the conformation and relative affinities of these
   BMPR-1B mutants for ligands BMP-2, -6, and -7 and GDF-5. Results suggest
   no significant structural changes in the receptor but do suggest that
   the four residues play different roles in defining ligand affinity and
   both intra- and intermolecular interactions play a role in defining
   ligand affinity. Thus, these results established two primary but
   necessary goals: (1) the baseline knowledge of perturbation of conserved
   interfacial residues for future reference and (2) the ability of the
   computational approach to identify the distal residues connecting to the
   interfacial residues. The data presented here provide the foundation for
   future experiments to identify the effects of distal residues that
   affect the specificity and affinity of BMP recognition. Protein protein
   interactions are integral reactions in essentially all biological
   activities such as gene regulation and age-related development. Often,
   diseases are consequences of the alteration of these intermacromolecular
   interactions, which are thus recognized as a legitimate target for
   developing modulators for regulating biological functions. One approach
   is to design ligands that bind to the protein protein interface. Another
   is to identify an allosteric site, an advantage of which is bypassing
   the potential challenge in competing for high-affinity interfacial
   interactions or a specific interface in a superassembly of multiple
   macromolecules. However, a challenge of this approach is identifying a
   site that is situated away from but functionally connected to the
   protein protein interface.}},

Abstract = {{The core of the Alpine orogen in the Eastern Alps (Tauern Window)
   experienced a change from orogen-normal shortening and post-nappe doming
   to predominantly orogen-parallel extension and tectonic unroofing during
   late Oligocene to Miocene northward indentation of the Adriatic
   Microplate. A new Sm-147/Nd-144 isochron age of 25.7 +/- 0.9 Ma on a
   garnet-bearing assemblage from the lowest nappe complex forming a dome
   in the eastern part of the Tauern Window indicates that high
   temperatures related to post-nappe Barrovian-type metamorphism
   overlapped in time with the onset of doming. New Rb-87/Sr-87 biotite
   ages from this same complex combined with previously published
   Rb-87/Sr-87 white mica ages suggest that doming and exhumation began no
   later than 28 Ma immediately in front of indenting Austroalpine crustal
   blocks, then migrated laterally to the ESE during rapid exhumation and
   orogen-parallel stretching beginning at about 23 Ma. Rapid cooling ended
   at approximately 17 Ma in the footwall of the Katschberg Normal Fault,
   which delimits the eastern margin of the Tauern Window. A similar
   pattern of migrating doming, orogen-parallel extension and cooling is
   recognized in the western part of the Tauern Window, where rapid
   exhumation began at about 20 Ma, some 2-3 Ma later than in the eastern
   part. This difference in the onset of rapid exhumation as well as the
   overall migration of doming from the center to the ends of the Tauem
   Window are attributed to fragmentation of the aforementioned
   Austroalpine blocks along the leading edge of the main Adriatic indenter
   (Southern Alps) as this indenter advanced to the north. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The ternary copper chalcogenide semiconductor nanoparticles have gained
   much attention as their optical properties make them ideal candidates
   for many applications ranging from photovoltaics to bioimaging. While
   their synthesis is well documented, there have been few reports on the
   synthesis of ternary copper chalcogenide metal hybrid nanoparticles,
   which can further expand the list of potential applications through
   synergistic properties. To this end, Pt-CuInS2 hybrids have been
   synthesized by a two-step approach in high boiling organic solvents. The
   hybrid nanostructures were characterized employing transmission electron
   microscopy, X-ray diffraction, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and
   energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping. We find that during hybrid
   nanoparticle synthesis under conditions modified from typical Pt
   nanopartide reaction schemes, a near-complete shell of Pt forms on the
   semiconductor nanoparticles. Careful control of the reactivity of the Pt
   precursor, through choice of organic reducing agent and Pt coordinating
   ligands, was successfully used to obtain controlled and isolated domains
   on the semiconductor nanoparticles. This strategy was further extended
   for the synthesis of Pd-CuInS2 hybrids.}},

Title = {{Vitamin C intake and risk of renal cell carcinoma: a meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{Studies have showed that vitamin C intake is linked to renal cell
   carcinoma risk, however, the results were inconsistent. Hence, the
   present meta-analysis was to examine the association between vitamin C
   intake and RCC risk. We searched the published studies that reported the
   relationship between vitamin C intake and RCC risk using PubMed and
   Embase up to January 2015. Based on a fixed effects model, RR and the
   corresponding 95\% CI were used to assess the pooled risk. 3 prospective
   cohort studies and 7 case-control studies were included. The overall RR
   (95\% CI) of RCC for the highest vs. the lowest levels of vitamin C
   intake was 0.78(0.69,0.87). Little evidence of heterogeneity was found.
   In the subgroup analyses, we found an inverse association between
   vitamin C intake and RCC risk in the case-control studies but not in the
   prospective cohort studies. Additionally, this association between
   vitamin C intake and RCC risk was not differed by population
   distribution. Our study provides evidence that vitamin C intake is
   associated with a reduced RCC risk. However, our conclusion was just
   based on ten including studies, so more high-quality of case-control
   studies or cohort studies which report this topic are needed.}},

Abstract = {{HRAS is a frequently mutated oncogene in cancer. However, mutant HRAS as
   drug target has not been investigated so far. Here, we show that mutant
   HRAS hyperactivates the RAS and the mTOR pathway in various cancer cell
   lines including lung, bladder and esophageal cancer. HRAS mutation
   sensitized toward growth inhibition by the MEK inhibitors AZD6244,
   MEK162 and PD0325901. Further, we found that MEK inhibitors induce
   apoptosis in mutant HRAS cell lines but not in cell lines lacking RAS
   mutations. In addition, knockdown of HRAS by siRNA blocked cell growth
   in mutant HRAS cell lines. Inhibition of the PI3K pathway alone or in
   combination with MEK inhibitors did not alter signaling nor had an
   impact on viability. However, inhibition of mTOR or combined inhibition
   of MEK and mTOR reduced cell growth in a synergistic manner. Finally,
   Ba/F3 cells transformed with mutant HRAS isoforms Q61L, Q61R and G12V
   demonstrated equal sensitivity towards MEK and mTOR inhibition. Our
   results show that HRAS mutations in cancer activate the RAS and mTOR
   pathways which might serve as a therapeutic option for patients with
   HRAS mutant tumors.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{471}},
Number = {{2184}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, there has been great interest in using control theory
   to alter the stability regimes of fluid systems. A flow property is
   measured at a point and relayed back to a control that alters a
   condition that opposes the instability, thereby postponing its onset.
   Here, we discuss an alternative to postponing and even eliminating
   instabilities without the need for measuring properties or designing
   control strategies: a shear flow imposed upon a system produces an
   interfacial viscous-capillary wave which, in the nonlinear regime, is
   capable of postponing or even eliminating the incipient instability. The
   literature shows several examples, whereby Rayleigh break-up of
   capillary jets is eliminated, van der Waals dry-out of a film is removed
   and thermocapillary instability is avoided by the application of a
   suitable surface shear or an imposed fluid flow. The stabilization
   mechanism is closely linked to the behaviour of the lower-order terms
   governing the evolution of the liquid-gas interface profile, providing
   an estimate for the time scales and shear strength involved. Our
   intention here is to develop a unified theoretical framework for the
   study of a large number of thin liquid-film configurations and related
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Archaeological accounts of cultural change reveal a fundamental
   conflict: Some suggest that change is gradual, accelerating over time,
   whereas others indicate that it is punctuated, with long periods of
   stasis interspersed by sudden gains or losses of multiple traits.
   Existing models of cultural evolution, inspired by models of genetic
   evolution, lend support to the former and do not generate trajectories
   that include large-scale punctuated change. We propose a simple model
   that can give rise to both exponential and punctuated patterns of gain
   and loss of cultural traits. In it, cultural innovation comprises
   several realistic interdependent processes that occur at different
   rates. The model also takes into account two properties intrinsic to
   cultural evolution: the differential distribution of traits among social
   groups and the impact of environmental change. In our model, a
   population may be subdivided into groups with different cultural
   repertoires leading to increased susceptibility to cultural loss,
   whereas environmental change may lead to rapid loss of traits that are
   not useful in a new environment. Taken together, our results suggest the
   usefulness of a concept of an effective cultural population size.}},

   in relation with the antiferrodistortive structural phase transition in
   SrTiO3 from cubic to tetragonal symmetry, which makes it a direct
   bandgap semiconductor. The photoluminescence spectra are also tuned by
   an electrostatic gate field in a field-effect transistor geometry. At 20

Abstract = {{Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activation is commonly observed
   in studies of pain, executive control, conflict monitoring, and salience
   processing, making it difficult to interpret the dACC's specific
   psychological function. Using Neurosynth, an automated brainmapping
   database {[}of over 10,000 functional MRI (fMRI) studies], we performed
   quantitative reverse inference analyses to explore the best general
   psychological account of the dACC function P(psi process vertical bar
   dACC activity). Results clearly indicated that the best psychological
   description of dACC function was related to pain processing-not
   executive, conflict, or salience processing. We conclude by considering
   that physical pain may be an instance of a broader class of
   survival-relevant goals monitored by the dACC, in contrast to more
   arbitrary temporary goals, which may be monitored by the supplementary
   motor area.}},

Abstract = {{We report on a novel type of triblock copolymer polymersomes with
   temperature-controlled permeability within the physiologically relevant
   temperature range of 37-42 degrees C for sustained delivery of
   anticancer drugs. These polymersomes combine characteristics of
   liposomes, such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, monodispersity,
   and stability at room temperature, with tunable size and thermal
   responsiveness provided by amphiphilic triblock copolymers. The
   temperature-sensitive
   poly(N-vinylcaprolactam)(n)-poly(dimethylsiloxane)(65)-poly(N-vinylcapro
   lactam)(n) (PVCLn-PDMS65-PVCLn) copolymers with n = 10, 15, 19, 29, and
   50 and polydispersity indexes less than 1.17 are synthesized by
   controlled RAFT polymerization. The copolymers are assembled into stable
   vesicles at room temperature when the ratio of PVCL to the total polymer
   mass is 0.36 <f < 0.52 with the polymersome diameter decreasing from 530
   to 40 nm as the length of PVCL is increased from 10 to 19 monomer units.
   Importantly, the permeability of polymersomes loaded with the anticancer
   drug doxorubicin can be precisely controlled by PVCL length in the
   temperature range of 37-42 degrees C. Increasing the temperature above
   the lower critical solution temperature of PVCL results in either
   gradual vesicle shrinkage (n = 10 and n = 15) or reversible formation of
   beadlike aggregates with no size change (n = 19), both leading to
   sustained drug release. All temperature-triggered morphological changes
   are reversible and do not compromise the structural stability of the
   vesicles. Finally, concentration- and time-dependent cytotoxicity of
   drug-loaded polymersomes to human alveolar adenocarcinoma cells is
   demonstrated. Considering the high loading capacity (similar to 40\%)
   and temperature responsiveness in the physiological range, these polymer
   vesicles have considerable potential as novel types of
   stimuli-responsive drug nanocarriers.}},

Title = {{Bridging the gap among actor-sensor-actor communication through load
   balancing multi-path routing}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{Wireless sensor actor networks (WSANs) consist of a large amount of
   sensor nodes with low cost and little actor nodes with better processing
   capabilities. The actor nodes tend to get partitioned due to low actor
   density in case of economic considerations. So, the communication among
   actors requires sensor nodes to relay his data to the destination actor
   which lead to the bottleneck in communication. A high-throughput
   disjoint multi-path (HTDM) routing scheme is proposed in this paper
   which allows actor simultaneously forwards data through multiple
   disjoint paths to achieve high throughput. HTDM routing scheme can
   quickly establish multiple disjoint routing paths, which can increase
   the throughput among actors a lot, and the routing path can be adjusted
   dynamically according to the energy status of their nodes, which can
   achieve load balancing. Simulation results show that, compared with
   related routing schemes, HTDM routing scheme can achieve higher
   throughput performance and distribute transmission loads more evenly to
   most of the nodes in the network.}},

Title = {{Adrenal Function Testing Following Hormone Therapy for Infantile Spasms:
   Case Series and Review of Literature}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{Prednisolone and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) are ``hormone{''}
   therapies for infantile spasms. There is limited data on the occurrence
   of decreased adrenal reserve or signs of clinical adrenal insufficiency
   after hormone therapy. This is a retrospective medical record review of
   patients referred to our Infantile Spasms Program. Our standardized
   infantile spasms management guideline began in September 2012 and
   initially included a post-hormone laboratory assessment of adrenal
   function. Medical records were assessed for hormone treatments, adrenal
   function testing, and signs of adrenal insufficiency. Forty-two patients
   who received one or both hormone therapies met inclusion criteria. A
   post-hormone laboratory assessment of adrenal function was done in 14
   patients. Of these 14 patients, 2 had an abnormal laboratory assessment
   of adrenal function, both by adrenal stimulation testing-one after ACTH
   and one after prednisolone. One patient received hydrocortisone
   replacement and the other received stress dose hydrocortisone as needed;
   neither patient developed signs of adrenal insufficiency. Another
   patient treated with both types of hormone therapy in tandem, who did
   not have a post-hormone laboratory assessment, developed signs of mild
   adrenal insufficiency and required replacement hydrocortisone. Our study
   suggests that adrenal suppression can occur after modern hormone therapy
   regimens. We found two patients with abnormal adrenal function testing
   after hormone therapy and another patient with signs adrenal
   insufficiency. Given the seriousness of adrenal crisis, caregiver
   education on the signs of adrenal insufficiency is critical. Greater
   vigilance may be indicated in patients receiving both types of hormone
   therapy in tandem. Although a routine post-hormone laboratory assessment
   of adrenal function may not be feasible in all patients, replacement or
   stress dose hydrocortisone is necessary for all patients with suspected
   adrenal insufficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of transnationalism typically frame it in opposition to the
   entrapping effects of borders. Yet, for many people, transnationalism is
   negotiated in contexts marked by forced separation and differential
   mobility. Drawing on long-term fieldwork among West Bank and Israeli
   Palestinians, this article explores transnational ties and orientations
   in relation, not in opposition, to the entrapping effects of borders.
   Specifically, I examine the two-way traffic in emotions and perceptions
   that marks family, social and symbolic relationships between West Bank
   and Israeli Palestinians. I show how entrapping and transnational
   processes combine to generate a tense interplay between closeness and
   distance, solidarity and estrangement. The paper calls attention to
   complex transnational formations among people prone to entrapment such
   as detained and deported migrants, refugees and minorities divided by
   rigid borders, and it suggests that a focus on emotions and perceptions
   is critical if we are to understand such formations.}},

Abstract = {{The electron emission from the uracil molecule induced by fast proton
   impact has been investigated using the classical-trajectory Monte Carlo
   (CTMC) method. Applying the independent-particle model, the full

   continuum-distorted-wave-eikonal-initial-state (CDW-EIS) approach, as
   well as the combined classical-trajectory Monte Carlo-classical
   over-the-barrier (CTMC-COB) model. The effect of the molecular treatment
   of the ionization by the multicenter potential is analyzed by simplified

Abstract = {{Interfacial polymerization of uniform template-free nanostructures is
   very challenging since many factors play determinant roles in the final
   structure of the resulting nanoassemblies. Here, we present a single
   oxidative coupling method for the synthesis of different nanoshapes by
   addition or substitution of a methyl group on aniline monomers to freely
   alter the mechanism of monomer-to-polymer conversion. Well-defined
   nanotubes, nanohollows, and solid nanospheres are obtained from aniline,
   N-methylaniline, and 2-methylaniline polymerizations, respectively. We
   found that the extent of hydrophobicity and protonation under mild
   acidic conditions determines the monomers' arrangement in micelle or
   droplet form, reactivity, and nucleation mechanism. These can
   subsequently affect the final morphology through a fusion process to
   form tubular structures, external flux of monomers to form nanohollows,
   and intradroplet oxidation to form solid nanospheres. Altered biological
   responses, such as cytocompatibility, redox response, hemocompatibility,
   and cell proliferation, are also found to be dependent on the position
   of the methyl group in the nanostructures.}},

Title = {{Lithosphere model of the Pannonian-Adriatic overthrusting}},
Journal = {{TECTONOPHYSICS}},

Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{A gravity model has been established at the contact of the southern part
   of the Pannonian basin and central Dinarides. Two-dimensional gravity
   modelling was carried out by means of the calibrated density set,
   defined at the Alp07 profile (Sumanovac, 2010), which significantly
   improved the resolution of the method. Gravity attraction caused by the
   structure in the upper mantle was analyzed in detail, which enabled
   construction of complete lithosphere model at the contact of the
   Dinarides, as a part of the Adriatic microplate, and the Pannonian basin
   as a segment of the Eurasian plate.
   Geophysical models demonstrate that overthrusting structures need to be
   considered in the present geological model; notably, the thrusting of
   the Adriatic microplate under the European plate. However, overthrusting
   processes cannot provide a complete explanation of the processes in the
   Pannonian basin. Considering that the Pannonian basin area is in fact a
   large geothermal anomaly, it is necessary to introduce the asthenosphere
   upwelling into the model. The presence of this structure is confirmed by
   a change in densities and seismic velocities in the uppermost mantle.
   This process has led to a significant thinning of the crust in the Tisia
   block and to the homogenization of properties as a result of the rising
   of the asthenosphere, and the crust can therefore be considered as a
   single layer. The combined effect of the push exerted by the African
   plate, and the rising of the asthenosphere and the thinning of the crust
   in the Pannonian basin caused the underthrusting of the Adriatic
   microplate below the Pannonian segment, thickening of the crust and
   steeply sinking of the Adriatic upper mantle below the Dinarides.
   Seismicity of the area and earthquake hypocenters enable the
   construction of active faults, which correlate well with the main faults
   at the surface and boundaries of density blocks in the crust. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{We investigate compact objects formed by dark matter admixed with
   ordinary matter made of neutron-star matter and white-dwarf material. We
   consider non-self annihilating dark matter with an equation of state
   given by an interacting Fermi gas. We find new stable solutions, dark
   compact planets, with Earth-like masses and radii from a few Km to few
   hundred Km for weakly interacting dark matter which are stabilized by
   the mutual presence of dark matter and compact star matter. For the
   strongly interacting dark matter case, we obtain dark compact planets
   with Jupiter-like masses and radii of few hundred Km. These objects
   could be detected by observing exoplanets with unusually small radii.
   Moreover, we find that the recently observed 2 M-circle dot pulsars set
   limits on the amount of dark matter inside neutron stars which is, at
   most, 10(-6) M-circle dot.}},

Abstract = {{Metal chalcogenide complexes (MCCs) have attracted considerable
   attention recently due to their high solubility in polar solvents,
   low-temperature decomposition to metal chalcogenide films, and service
   as ligands for colloidal nanocrystals (NCs). However, most of the MCCs
   were typically synthesized in the highly toxic and explosive hydrazine
   (denoted as hydrazine-MCCs), severely restricting the wide applications
   of MCCs. Here we present a versatile and environmentally benign
   water-based solution method for the preparation of various MCCs (denoted
   as water-MCCs) through directly dissolving a series of bulk V2VI3
   chalcogenides (V = Sb, As and VI = S, Se, Te) in water with the presence
   of (NH4)(2)S at room temperature and ambient atmosphere. We further show
   that such water-MCCs can be readily processed into corresponding
   semiconducting thin films upon mild thermal treatment and then be
   extended to fabricate compositionally controlled semiconductor alloys
   with tunable band gaps (i.e., Sb-2(SI1-x,Se-x)(3), 0 <= x <= 1) through
   simple control of substrate temperature. Furthermore, we present that
   our water-MCCs, especially for Sb4S72-, can be utilized to serve as
   ligands for in-situ-synthesized water-based PbS quantum dots (QDs),
   achieving a homogeneous and stable aqueous QDs solution without needing
   further conventional secondary ligand exchange. Our study provides a
   general strategy for the synthesis of various MCCs using water as safer
   and more environmentally friendly solvent alternative to hydrazine, thus
   greatly enhancing the wide applications of MCCs in solution-processed
   inorganic semiconductors.}},

Title = {{Acoustic properties of pistonphones at low frequencies in the presence
   of pressure leakage and heat conduction}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{358}},
Pages = {{324-333}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{The wide concern on absolute pressure calibration of acoustic
   transducers at low frequencies prompts the development of the
   pistonphone method. At low frequencies, the acoustic properties of
   pistonphones are governed by the pressure leakage and the heat
   conduction effects. However, the traditional theory for these two
   effects applies a linear superposition of two independent correction
   models, which differs somewhat from their coupled effect at low
   frequencies. In this paper, acoustic properties of pistonphones at low
   frequencies in full consideration of the pressure leakage and heat
   conduction effects have been quantitatively studied, and the explicit
   expression for the generated sound pressure has been derived. With more
   practical significance, a coupled correction expression for these two
   effects of pistonphones has been derived. in allusion to two typical
   piston phones, the NPL pistonphone and our developed infrasonic
   pistonphone, comparisons were done for the coupled correction expression
   and the traditional one, whose results reveal that the traditional one
   produces maximum insufficient errors of about 0.1 dB above the lower
   limiting frequencies of two pistonphones, while at lower frequencies,
   excessive correction errors with an explicit limit of about 3 dB are
   produced by the traditional expression. The coupled correction
   expression should be adopted in the absolute pressure calibration of
   acoustic transducers at low frequencies. Furthermore, it is found that
   the heat conduction effect takes a limiting deviation of about 3 dB for
   the pressure amplitude and a small phase difference as frequency
   decreases, while the pressure leakage effect remarkably drives the
   pressure amplitude to attenuate and the phase difference tends to be 90
   degrees as the frequency decreases. The pressure leakage effect plays a
   more important role On the low frequency property of pistonphones. (C)

Abstract = {{We study historical dynamics of joint equilibrium distribution of stock
   returns in the U.S. stock market using the Boltzmann distribution model
   being parametrized by external fields and pairwise couplings. Within
   Boltzmann learning framework for statistical inference, we analyze
   historical behavior of the parameters inferred using exact and
   approximate learning algorithms. Since the model and inference methods
   require use of binary variables, effect of this mapping of continuous
   returns to the discrete domain is studied. The presented results show
   that binarization preserves the correlation structure of the market.
   Properties of distributions of external fields and couplings as well as
   the market interaction network and industry sector clustering structure
   are studied for different historical dates and moving window sizes. We
   demonstrate that the observed positive heavy tail in distribution of
   couplings is related to the sparse clustering structure of the market.
   We also show that discrepancies between the model's parameters might be
   used as a precursor of financial instabilities.}},

Abstract = {{Animals that communicate using conspicuous body patterns face a

   15]. However, even these patterns are vulnerable to eavesdroppers, as
   sensitivity to the linearly polarized component of light is widespread
   among invertebrates due to their intrinsically polarization sensitive
   photoreceptors{[}14, 16]. Stomatopod crustaceans appear to have gone one
   step further in this arms race and have evolved a sensitivity to the
   circular polarization of light, along with body patterns producing
   it{[}17]. However, to date we have no direct evidence that any of these
   marine crustaceans use this modality to communicate with conspecifics.
   We therefore investigated circular polarization vision of the mantis
   shrimp Gonodactylaceus falcatus{[}18] and demonstrate that (1) the
   species produces strongly circularly polarized body patterns, (2) they
   discriminate the circular polarization of light, and (3) that they use
   circular polarization information to avoid occupied burrows when seeking
   a refuge.}},

Title = {{Homocysteine Level Is Associated with White Matter Hyperintensity
   Locations in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{Background and Purpose
   The relationship between plasma level of total homocysteine (tHcy) and
   white matter hyper-intensities (WMHs), especially in patients with acute
   ischemic stroke (AIS), is controversial. The present study investigated
   the association between these two as well as WMH locations in a large
   cohort of patients with AIS.
   Methods
   Consecutive patients were reviewed from a prospective ischemic stroke
   database. Clinical data, including tHcy level and WMHs, were assessed.
   WMHs were assessed using the Fazekas scale and Age-Related White Matter
   Changes (ARWMC) visual grading scale. The association between tHcy and
   WMH locations was investigated by using multivariate logistic regression
   analyses.
   Results
   A total of 923 out of 1,205 patients were examined. The average age was
   58.9 +/- 11.9 years; 31.6\% were female. Elevated tHcy level was
   significantly associated with WMHs. For the highest tHcy quartile, the
   odds ratio (OR) (95\% confidence interval; CI) was 1.891 (1.257; 2.843)
   according to the Fazekas scale and 1.781 (1.185; 2.767) according to the
   ARWMC scale when compared to the lowest quartile. However, in a subgroup
   analysis, only WMHs in the periventricular area and left or right
   frontal areas were found to be independently associated with tHcy level.
   For the highest tHcy quartile, the OR (95\% CI) was 1.761 (1.172; 2.648)
   for the periventricular WMHs, 1.768 (1.134; 2.756) for the left frontal
   WMHs, and 1.890 (1.206; 2.960) for the right frontal WMHs.
   Conclusions
   In patients with AIS, plasma tHcy level is related to WMHs, especially
   WMHs distributed within the periventricular and frontal areas.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{143}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{A self-propelled artificial microswimmer is often modeled as a ballistic
   Brownian particle moving with constant speed aligned along one of its
   axis, but changing direction due to random collisions with the
   environment. Similarly to thermal noise, its angular randomization is
   described as a memoryless stochastic process. Here, we speculate that
   finite-time correlations in the orientational dynamics can affect the
   swimmer's diffusivity. To this purpose, we propose and solve two
   alternative models. In the first one, we simply assume that the
   environmental fluctuations governing the swimmer's propulsion are
   exponentially correlated in time, whereas in the second one, we account
   for possible damped fluctuations of the propulsion velocity around the
   swimmer's axis. The corresponding swimmer's diffusion constants are
   predicted to get, respectively, enhanced or suppressed upon increasing
   the model memory time. Possible consequences of this effect on the
   interpretation of the experimental data are discussed. (C) 2015 AIP

   copolymer solutions: The effect of chain architecture}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{143}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{Using the self-consistent field lattice technique, the effects of
   concentration and hydrophobic middle block length (where the chain
   length remains constant) on aggregation behavior are studied in
   amphiphilic symmetric triblock copolymer solutions. The heat capacity
   peak for the unimer-micelle transition and the distribution peaks for
   the different degrees of aggregation for micelles and small aggregates
   (submicelles) are calculated. Analysis of the conducted computer
   simulations shows that the transition broadness dependence on
   concentration is determined by the hydrophobic middle block length, and
   this dependence is distinctly different when the length of the
   hydrophobic middle block changes. Different size for small aggregates
   simultaneously appear in the transition region. As temperature
   decreases, the number of different size small aggregates for the large
   hydrophobic middle block length first ascends and then descends in
   aggregation degree order. These results indicate that any transition
   broadness change with concentration is related to the mechanism of
   fragmentation and fusion. These results are helpful for interpreting the
   aggregation process of amphiphilic copolymers at equilibrium. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The mechanism of Stille reactions (cross-coupling of ArX with Ar'SnnBu3)
   performed in the presence of fluoride ions is established. A triple role
   for fluoride ions is identified from kinetic data on the rate of the
   reactions of trans{[}ArPdBr(PPh3)(2)] (Ar=Ph, p-(CN)C6H4) with Ar'SnBu3
   (Ar'=2thiophenyl) in the presence of fluoride ions. Fluoride ions
   promote the rate-determining transmetallation by formation of
   trans-{[}ArPdF(PPh3)(2)], which reacts with Ar'SnBu, (Ar' = Ph,
   2-thiophenyl) at room temperature, in contrast to trans-
   {[}ArPdBr(PPh3)(2)], which is unreactive. However, the concentration
   ratio {[}F-]/{[}Ar'SnBu3] must not be too high, because of the formation
   of unreactive anionic stannate {[}Ar'Sn(F)Bu-3](-). This rationalises
   the two kinetically antagonistic roles exerted by the fluoride ions that
   are observed experimentally, and is found to be in agreement with the
   kinetic law. In addition, fluoride ions promote reductive elimination

Abstract = {{AIM: To elucidate the clinicopathological characteristics of clinically
   early gastric cancer in the upper-third stomach and to clarify treatment
   precautions.
   METHODS: A total of 683 patients with clinical early gastric cancer were
   enrolled in this retrospective study, 128 of whom had gastric cancer in
   the upper-third stomach (U group). All patients underwent a double
   contrast barium examination, endoscopy, and computed tomography (CT),
   and were diagnosed preoperatively based on the findings obtained. The
   clinicopathological features of these patients were compared with those
   of patients with gastric cancer in the middle-and lower-third stomach
   (ML group). We also compared clinicopathological factors between
   accurate-diagnosis and under-diagnosis groups in order to identify
   factors affecting the accuracy of a preoperative diagnosis of tumor
   depth.
   RESULTS: Patients in the U group were older (P = 0.029), had a higher
   ratio of males to females (P = 0.015), and had more histologically
   differentiated tumors (P = 0.007) than patients in the ML group. A
   clinical under-diagnosis occurred in 57 out of 683 patients (8.3\%), and
   was more frequent in the U group than in the ML group (16.4\% vs 6.3\%,
   P < 0.0001). Therefore, the rates of lymph node metastasis and lymphatic
   invasion were slightly higher in the U group than in the ML group (P =
   0.071 and 0.082, respectively). An under-diagnosis was more frequent in
   histologically undifferentiated tumors (P = 0.094) and in those larger
   than 4 cm (P = 0.024). The median follow-up period after surgery was 56
   mo (range, 1-186 mo). Overall, survival and disease-specific survival
   rates were significantly lower in the U group than in the ML group (P =
   0.016 and 0.020, respectively). However, limited operation-related
   cancer recurrence was not detected in the U group in the present study.
   CONCLUSION: Clinical early gastric cancer in the upper-third stomach has
   distinguishable characteristics that increase the risk of a clinical
   under-diagnosis, especially in patients with larger or undifferentiated
   tumors.}},

Title = {{mRNA Levels of Imprinted Genes in Bovine In Vivo Oocytes, Embryos and

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{Twenty-six imprinted genes were quantified in bovine in vivo produced
   oocytes and embryos using RNA-seq. Eighteen were detectable and their
   transcriptional patterns were: largely decreased (MEST and PLAGL1);
   first decreased and then increased (CDKN1C and IGF2R); peaked at a
   specific stage (PHLDA2, SGCE, PEG10, PEG3, GNAS, MEG3, DGAT1, ASCL2,
   NNAT, and NAP1L5); or constantly low (DIRAS3, IGF2, H19 and RTL1). These
   patterns reflect mRNAs that are primarily degraded, important at a
   specific stage, or only required at low quantities. The mRNAs for
   several genes were surprisingly abundant. For instance, transcripts for
   the maternally imprinted MEST and PLAGL1, were high in oocytes and could
   only be expressed from the maternal allele suggesting that their genomic
   imprints were not yet established/recognized. Although the mRNAs
   detected here were likely biallelically transcribed before the
   establishment of imprinted expression, the levels of mRNA during these
   critical stages of development have important functional consequences.
   Lastly, we compared these genes to their counterparts in mice, humans
   and pigs. Apart from previously known differences in the imprinting
   status, the mRNA levels were different among these four species. The
   data presented here provide a solid reference for expression profiles of
   imprinted genes in embryos produced using assisted reproductive
   biotechnologies.}},

Abstract = {{Existing diagnostic guidelines for heart failure with preserved ejection

   Furthermore, the capabilities of novel imaging techniques to assess
   existing parameters (e.g. left ventricular ejection fraction, systolic

Journal = {{BMC ORAL HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Orofacial clefts are a group of frequently observed
   congenital malformations often requiring multiple hospital admissions
   over the lifespan of affected individuals. The aim of this study was to
   describe the total-population hospital admissions with principal
   diagnosis of cleft lip and/or palate in Australia over a 10 year period.
   Methods: Data for admissions to hospitals were obtained from the
   Australian Institute of Health and Welfare National Hospital Morbidity
   Database (July 2000 to June 2010). The outcome variable was a hospital
   separation with the principal diagnosis of cleft palate, cleft lip or
   cleft lip and palate (ICD-10-AM diagnosis codes Q35-Q37 respectively).
   Trends in rates of admission and length of stay by age, gender and cleft
   type were investigated.
   Results: A total of 11, 618 admissions were identified; cleft palate (
   4,454; 0.22 per 10,000 people per year), cleft lip (2,251; 0.11) and
   cleft lip and palate (4,913; 0.25). Admission age ranged from birth to
   79 years with males more frequently admitted. Most admissions occurred
   prior to adolescence in cleft palate and cleft lip and through to late
   teens in cleft lip and palate, declining for all groups after 25 years.
   Conclusions: This study identified population level trends in hospital
   separations for orofacial cleft diagnosis in Australia.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Accidental industrial hand injury very often requires early
   intervention. Assuming as full stomach condition, regional anaesthesia
   is preferred to avoid the risk of aspiration in general anaesthesia.
   Different additives have been used to prolong the duration of brachial
   plexus block. We evaluated the effect of adding dexmedetomidine to
   ropivacaine for supraclavicular brachial plexus blockade. The primary
   endpoints were the onset and duration of sensory and motor block and
   duration of analgesia.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS
   Seventy six patients aged 20-50 years with ASA grade I, II who were
   presented with industrial hand injury and required emergency operative
   interventions were randomly allocated into two groups. Group-RD (n=38)
   received ropivacaine (30ml 0.5\%) with dexmedetomidine 1ml (100 mu g)
   and patients in group-RP (n=38) received ropivacaine (30ml 0.5\%) with
   0.9\% normal saline 1ml solution as placebo. Sensory and motor block
   onset times and durations, time to first analgesic use, total analgesic
   need, postoperative VAS, hemodynamics and side effects were recorded for
   each patient.
   RESULTS
   Though having comparable demographic profile, the onset of motor and
   sensory block was significantly fastened by dexmedetomidine (p<0.05).
   Sensory and motor block duration and time to first analgesic use were
   significantly prolonged and the total need for rescue analgesics was
   lower in group RD (P<0.05) than group RD. Postoperative VAS value at 12
   hours were significantly lower in group RD (P<0.05). Side effects and
   hemodynamics were quite comparable among two groups.
   CONCLUSION
   It can be concluded that adding dexmedetomidine to brachial plexus block
   increases the sensory and motor block duration and time to first
   analgesic use and decreases block onset time and total analgesic use
   with no side effects.}},

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{282}},
Number = {{1820}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{Using a system of interspecies hybrids, trihybrids, and recombinants
   with varying proportions of genomes from three distinct Xenopus species,
   we provide evidence for de novo epigenetic silencing of paternal 45S
   ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) genes and their species-dependent
   expression dominance that escapes transcriptional inactivation after
   homologous recombination. The same pattern of imprinting is maintained
   in the offspring from mothers being genetic males (ZZ) sex-reversed to
   females, indicating that maternal control of ribosomal deoxyribonucleic
   acid (rDNA) expression is not sex-chromosome linked. Nucleolar dominance
   (nucleolus underdevelopment) in Xenopus hybrids appears to be associated
   with a major non-Mendelian reduction in the number of 45S rDNA gene
   copies rather than a specific pattern of their expression. The loss of
   rRNA gene copies in F1 hybrids was non-random with respect to the
   parental species, with the transcriptionally dominant variant
   preferentially removed from hybrid zygotes. This dramatic disruption in

Abstract = {{The microbial communities that reside in the human gut (microbiota) and
   their impact on human health and disease are nowadays one of the most
   exciting new areas of research. A well-balanced microbial intestinal
   colonization in early postnatal life is necessary for the development of
   appropriate innate and adaptive immune responses and to establish immune
   homeostasis later in life. Although the composition and functional
   characteristics of a `healthy' gut microbiota remain to be elucidated,
   perturbations in the microbial colonization of an infant's
   gastrointestinal tract have been associated with an increased risk of
   short- and long-term immunologically mediated diseases. Emerging
   evidence suggests that gut microbiota biomodulators, such as probiotics,
   prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics may support disease prevention
   in infants who tend to have a delayed and/or aberrant initial
   colonization with reduced microbiota diversity (delivery by caesarean
   section, premature delivery, and excessive use of perinatal
   antibiotics). Under these dysbiosis conditions probiotics could act as
   `surrogate' colonizers to prevent immune-mediated diseases. This review
   focuses on the influence of delivery mode on the colonization of the
   infant gastro-intestinal tract. In particular, it examines the
   manipulation of the gut microbiota composition through the use of gut
   microbiota biomodulators, in the management of aberrant initial gut
   colonization and subsequent consequences for the health of the
   offspring. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen-release by photoexcitation, excited-state-hydrogen- transfer
   (ESHT), is one of the important photochemical processes that occur in
   aromatic acids and is responsible for photoprotection of biomolecules.
   The mechanism is described by conversion of the initial state to a
   charge-separated state along the O(N)-H bond elongation, leading to
   dissociation. Thus ESHT is not a simple H-atom transfer in which a
   proton and a 1s electron move together. Here we show that the
   electron-transfer and the proton-motion are decoupled in gas-phase ESHT.
   We monitor electron and proton transfer independently by picosecond
   time-resolved near-infrared and infrared spectroscopy for isolated
   phenol-(ammonia) 5, a benchmark molecular cluster. Electron transfer
   from phenol to ammonia occurred in less than 3 picoseconds, while the
   overall H-atom transfer took 15 picoseconds. The observed
   electron-proton decoupling will allow for a deeper understanding and
   control of of photochemistry in biomolecules.}},

   Study about the Introduction of Tablet Devices in Secondary Education}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates teachers' and students' perceptions concerning
   the impact of using tablet devices for teaching and learning purposes.
   An explorative focus group study was conducted with teachers (n = 18)
   and students (n = 39) in a secondary school that has implemented tablet
   devices since 2012. The general finding of this study shows that the use
   of tablet devices in the classroom setting has an impact on both
   teaching and learning practices. The results suggest that teachers can
   be divided into two categories: the innovative teachers and the
   instrumental teachers. Innovative teachers attempt to shift from a
   teacher-centered to a learning-centered approach. They have changed
   their teaching style by transforming lessons in accordance with the
   advantages tablet computers can offer. Instrumental teachers seem to use
   the device as a `book behind glass'. The distinction between the two
   groups has consequences for both the way courses are given and how
   students experience them. In general, the introduction of tablet devices
   entails a shift in the way students learn, as the devices provide
   interactive, media-rich, and exciting new environments. The results of
   this study indicate that policy makers should consider introducing
   technical and pedagogical support in order to facilitate both teachers'
   and students' understanding of the full potential of this kind of
   technology in education.}},

Title = {{Effect of alpha-Amylase Degradation on Physicochemical Properties of
   Pre-High Hydrostatic Pressure-Treated Potato Starch}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{The effect of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) on the susceptibility of
   potato starch (25\%, w/v) suspended in water to degradation by exposure
   to bacterial alpha-amylase (0.02\%, 0.04\% and 0.06\%, w/v) for 40 min
   at 25 degrees C was investigated. Significant differences (p < 0.05) in
   the structure, morphology and physicochemical properties were observed.
   HHP-treated potato starch (PS) exposed to alpha-amylase (0.06\%, w/v)
   showed a significantly greater degree of hydrolysis and amount of
   reducing sugar released compared to alpha-amylase at a concentration of
   0.04\% (w/v) or 0.02\% (w/v). Native PS (NPS) granules have a spherical
   and elliptical form with a smooth surface, whereas the hydrolyzed NPS
   (hNPS) and hydrolyzed HHP-treated PS granules showed irregular and
   ruptured forms with several cracks and holes on the surface. Hydrolysis
   of HHP-treated PS by alpha-amylase could decrease the average granule
   size significantly (p < 0.05) from 29.43 to 20.03 mu m. Swelling power
   decreased and solubility increased with increasing enzyme concentration
   and increasing pressure from 200-600 MPa, with the exception of the
   solubility of HHP-treated PS at 600 MPa (HHP600 PS). Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) showed extensive degradation of the starch
   in both the ordered and the amorphous structure, especially in
   hydrolyzed HHP600 PS. The B-type of hydrolyzed HHP600 PS with
   alpha-amylase at a concentration 0.06\% (w/v) changed to a B+V type with
   an additional peak at 2 theta = 19.36 degrees. The HHP600 starch with
   0.06\% (w/v) alpha-amylase displayed the lowest value of To (onset
   temperature), T-c (conclusion temperature) and Delta H-gel (enthalpies
   of gelatinization). These results indicate the pre-HHP treatment of NPS
   leads to increased susceptibility of the granules to enzymatic
   degradation and eventually changes of both the amorphous and the
   crystalline structures.}},

Abstract = {{Neonatal sepsis still remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality
   in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Recently, soluble CD14 subtype
   (sDC14-ST) also named presepsin, was proposed as an effective biomarker
   for diagnosing, monitoring, and assessing the risk of neonatal sepsis
   and septic shock. The aim of this study was to investigate the
   diagnostic accuracy of sCD14-ST presepsin in diagnosing neonatal
   bacterial sepsis and in discriminating non-bacterial systemic
   inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) from bacterial sepsis. This study
   involved 65 critically ill full-term and preterm newborns admitted to
   the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), divided into three groups: 25
   newborns with bacterial neonatal sepsis (group A); 15 newborns with a
   diagnosis of non-bacterial SIRS and with no localizing source of
   bacterial infection (group B); and 25 babies with no clinical or
   bacteriological signs of systemic or local infection receiving routine
   NICU care, most of them treated with phototherapy for neonatal jaundice
   (group C). A total of 102 whole blood samples were collected, 40 in
   group A, 30 in group B and 32 in group C. In 10 babies included in group
   A, sCD14-ST presepsin was also measured in an additional second blood
   sample collected 3 days after the start of antibiotic treatment.
   sCD14-ST presepsin was measured by a commercially available
   chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) optimized on an automated
   immunoassay analyzer. Statistical analysis was performed by means of
   MedCal (R) statistical package; receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
   analysis was computed, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used
   to evaluate the ability of sCD14-ST to discriminate neonatal bacterial
   sepsis from non-bacterial SIRS. Blood sCD14-ST presepsin levels were
   found significantly higher in bacterial sepsis when compared with
   controls (p < 0.0001); similarly, they were higher in non-bacterial SIRS
   when compared with controls (p < 0.0001). However, no statistically
   significant difference was found between bacterial sepsis and
   non-bacterial SIRS (p = 0.730). In our population, CRP and sCD14-ST did
   not correlate with each other. ROC analysis revealed that sCD14-ST
   presepsin has an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.995 (95\% C.I.:
   0.941-1.00) greater than that of CRP (0.827; 95\% C.I.: 0.72-0.906).
   Similarly, in the group of babies with non-infectious SIRS, sCD14-ST AUC
   was greater than CRP AUC (0.979; 95\% C.I.: 0.906-0.999 versus 0.771;
   95\% C.I.: 0.647-0.868). In controls, preliminary reference intervals
   for sCD14-ST ranged 223.4-599.7 ng/L, being significantly different from
   those previously published elsewhere. In conclusion, sCD14-ST presepsin
   could be introduced in clinical practice as a diagnostic tool for
   improving the management of neonatal sepsis and non-bacterial SIRS. (C)

   description of general plasmon-molecule interactions. Mutual
   polarization effects are easily incorporated within a standard
   ground-state Hartree-Fock computation, and time-dependent simulations
   carry the same formal computational scaling as real-time time-dependent
   Hartree-Fock theory. As a proof of principle, we apply this generalized
   method to the emergence of a Fano-like resonance in coupled
   molecule-plasmon systems; this feature is quite sensitive to the
   nanoparticle-molecule separation and the orientation of the molecule

Title = {{Ab initio downfolding for electron-phonon-coupled systems: Constrained
   density-functional perturbation theory}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{We formulate an ab initio downfolding scheme for electron-phonon-coupled
   systems. In this scheme, we calculate partially renormalized phonon
   frequencies and electron-phonon coupling, which include the screening
   effects of high-energy electrons, to construct a realistic Hamiltonian
   consisting of low-energy electron and phonon degrees of freedom. We show
   that our scheme can be implemented by slightly modifying the density
   functional-perturbation theory (DFPT), which is one of the standard
   methods for calculating phonon properties from first principles. Our
   scheme, which we call the constrained DFPT, can be applied to various
   phonon-related problems, such as superconductivity, electron and thermal
   transport, thermoelectricity, piezoelectricity, dielectricity, and
   multiferroicity. We believe that the constrained DFPT provides a firm
   basis for the understanding of the role of phonons in strongly
   correlated materials. Here, we apply the scheme to fullerene
   superconductors and discuss how the realistic low-energy Hamiltonian is
   constructed.}},

Title = {{Elevational Ranges of Montane Birds and Deforestation in the Western
   Andes of Colombia}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{Deforestation causes habitat loss, fragmentation, degradation, and can
   ultimately cause extinction of the remnant species. Tropical montane
   birds face these threats with the added natural vulnerability of
   narrower elevational ranges and higher specialization than lowland
   species. Recent studies assess the impact of present and future global
   climate change on species' ranges, but only a few of these evaluate the
   potentially confounding effect of lowland deforestation on species
   elevational distributions. In the Western Andes of Colombia, an
   important biodiversity hotspot, we evaluated the effects of
   deforestation on the elevational ranges of montane birds along
   altitudinal transects. Using point counts and mist-nets, we surveyed six
   altitudinal transects spanning 2200 to 2800m. Three transects were
   forested from 2200 to 2800m, and three were partially deforested with
   forest cover only above 2400m. We compared abundance-weighted mean
   elevation, minimum elevation, and elevational range width. In addition
   to analysing the effect of deforestation on 134 species, we tested its
   impact within trophic guilds and habitat preference groups.
   Abundance-weighted mean and minimum elevations were not significantly
   different between forested and partially deforested transects. Range
   width was marginally different: as expected, ranges were larger in
   forested transects. Species in different trophic guilds and habitat
   preference categories showed different trends. These results suggest
   that deforestation may affect species' elevational ranges, even within
   the forest that remains. Climate change will likely exacerbate harmful
   impacts of deforestation on species' elevational distributions. Future
   conservation strategies need to account for this by protecting connected
   forest tracts across a wide range of elevations.}},

Abstract = {{A facile transition metals (TM = Mn, Co, Cu) doping has been employed as
   an effective approach to alter the electrical and optical properties of
   LaFeO3 with substantially improved photoelectrochemical (PEC) water
   oxidation performance under visible light. It is found that the highest
   photocurrent density is obtained with 10\% doping concentration, and the
   promoted photoconversion efficiency follows the order of LaFe0.9Cu0.1O3
   > LaFe0.9Co0.2O3 > LaFe0.9Mn0.1O3 > LaFeO3. The 10\% Cu dopant yields
   the highest photocurrent density of 0.99 mA/cm(2) at 1 V vs. Ag/AgCl,
   which is three times higher than that of pure LaFeO3 under visible light
   illumination (>420 nm). The Fe3+ discharge is observed in the doped
   samples by cyclic voltammetry study, wherein the discharge capacity
   exhibits the same trend with the PEC enhancement. The electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy shows the enhanced charge transfer on the surface
   of the TM doped LaFeO3, which is responsible for the improved PEC
   performance. Furthermore, the increased carrier densities upon TM doping
   revealed by Mott-Schottky plots also contribute to the PEC enhancement.
   Our results demonstrate that TM doping is a viable way to promote the
   photoconversion efficiency of LaFeO3-based PEC cells under visible
   light. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{282}},
Number = {{1820}},

Abstract = {{Evolution of body size is likely to involve trade-offs between body
   size, growth rate and longevity. Within species, larger body size is
   associated with faster growth and ageing, and reduced longevity, but the
   cellular processes driving these relationships are poorly understood.
   One mechanism that might play a key role in determining optimal body
   size is the relationship between body size and telomere dynamics.
   However, we know little about how telomere length is affected when
   selection for larger size is imposed in natural populations. We report
   here on the relationship between structural body size and telomere
   length in wild house sparrows at the beginning and end of a selection
   regime for larger parent size that was imposed for 4 years in an
   isolated population of house sparrows. A negative relationship between
   fledgling size and telomere length was present at the start of the
   selection; this was extended when fledgling size increased under the
   selection regime, demonstrating a persistent covariance between
   structural size and telomere length. Changes in telomere dynamics,
   either as a correlated trait or a consequence of larger size, could
   reduce potential longevity and the consequent trade-offs could thereby
   play an important role in the evolution of optimal body size.}},

Journal = {{DEVELOPMENTAL CELL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{Drosophila Orb, the homolog of vertebrate CPEB, is a key translational
   regulator involved in oocyte polarity and maturation through poly(A)
   tail elongation of specific mRNAs. orb also has an essential function
   during early oogenesis that has not been addressed at the molecular
   level. Here, we show that orb prevents cell death during early
   oogenesis, thus allowing oogenesis to progress. It does so through the
   repression of autophagy by directly repressing, together with the CCR4
   deadenylase, the translation of Autophagy-specific gene 12 (Atg12) mRNA.
   Autophagy and cell death observed in orb mutant ovaries are reduced by
   decreasing Atg12 or other Atg mRNA levels. These results reveal a role
   of Orb in translational repression and identify autophagy as an
   essential pathway regulated by Orb during early oogenesis. Importantly,
   they also establish translational regulation as a major mode of control
   of autophagy, a key process in cell homeostasis in response to
   environmental cues.}},

   (4 355 418 person quarters); 71 895 (15.4\%) patients also filled a
   prescription for warfarin (416 479 person quarters with warfarin use).
   The main outcome measure was emergency department visit or hospital
   admission with a primary diagnosis of hypoglycemia in person quarters
   with concurrent fills of warfarin and glipizide/glimepiride compared
   with the rates in quarters with glipizide/glimepiride fills only,
   Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for individual
   characteristics. Secondary outcomes included fall related fracture and
   altered consciousness/mental status.
   SUMMARY ANSWER AND LIMITATIONS
   In quarters with glipizide/glimepiride use, hospital admissions or
   emergency department visits for hypoglycemia were more common in person
   quarters with concurrent warfarin use compared with quarters without
   warfarin use (294/416 479 v 1903/3 938 939; adjusted odds ratio 1.22,
   95\% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.42). The risk of hypoglycemia
   associated with concurrent use was higher among people using warfarin
   for the first time, as well as in those aged 65-74 years. Concurrent use
   of warfarin and glipizide/glimepiride was also associated with hospital
   admission or emergency department visit for fall related fractures
   (3919/416 479 v 20 759/3 938 939; adjusted odds ratio 1.47, 1.41 to
   1.54) and altered consciousness/mental status (2490/416 479 v 14 414/3
   938 939; adjusted odds ratio 1.22, 1.16 to 1.29). Unmeasured factors
   could be correlated with both warfarin use and serious hypoglycemic
   events, leading to confounding. The findings may not generalize beyond
   the elderly Medicare population.
   WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
   A substantial positive association was seen between use of warfarin with
   glipizide/glimepiride and hospital admission/emergency department visits
   for hypoglycemia and related diagnoses, particularly in patients
   starting warfarin. The findings suggest the possibility of a significant
   drug interaction between these medications.}},

Abstract = {{The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) ensures the accurate segregation
   of sister chromatids during mitosis. Activation of the SAC occurs
   through a series of ordered molecular events that result in recruitment
   of Mad1:Mad2 complexes to improperly attached kinetochores. The current
   model involves sequential phospho-dependent recruitment of Bub3:Bub1 to
   KNL1 followed by binding of Mad1:Mad2 to Bub1. Here, we show in
   non-transformed diploid human cells that the KNL1-Bub3-Bub1 (KBB)
   pathway is required during normal mitotic progression when kinetochores
   are misaligned but is nonessential for SAC activation and Mad2 loading
   when kinetochores are unattached from microtubules. We provide evidence
   that the Rod-ZW10-Zwilch (RZZ) complex is necessary to recruit Mad1:Mad2
   to, and delay anaphase onset in response to, unattached kinetochores
   independently of the KBB pathway. These data suggest that the KBB and
   RZZ complexes provide two distinct kinetochore receptors for Mad1: Mad2
   and reveal mechanistic differences between SAC activation by unattached
   and improperly attached kinetochores.}},

Abstract = {{Each adult mammalian skeletal muscle has a unique complement of fast and
   slow myofibers, reflecting patterns established during development and
   reinforced via their innervation by fast and slow motor neurons.
   Existing data support a model of postnatal ``matching{''} whereby
   predetermined myofiber type identity promotes pruning of inappropriate
   motor axons, but no molecular mechanism has yet been identified. We
   present evidence that fiber type-specific repulsive interactions inhibit
   innervation of slow myofibers by fast motor axons during both postnatal
   maturation of the neuromuscular junction and myofiber reinnervation
   after injury. The repulsive guidance ligand ephrin-A3 is expressed only
   on slow myofibers, whereas its candidate receptor, EphA8, localizes
   exclusively to fast motor end-plates. Adult mice lacking ephrin-A3 have
   dramatically fewer slow myofibers in fast and mixed muscles, and
   misexpression of ephrin-A3 on fast myofibers followed by
   denervation/reinnervation promotes their respecification to a slow
   phenotype. We therefore conclude that Eph/ephrin interactions guide the
   fiber type specificity of neuromuscular interactions during development
   and adult life.}},

Abstract = {{The power of rhodium-carbene methodology in chemistry is demonstrated by

   Plantazolicin A, a novel soilbacterium metabolite, comprises a linear
   array of 10 five-membered rings in two pentacyclic regions that derive
   from ribosomal peptide synthesis followed by extensive posttranslational
   modification. The compound possesses potent antimicrobial activity, and
   is selectively active against the anthraxcausing organism. A
   conceptually different synthesis of plantazolicin A is reported in which
   the key steps are the use of rhodium(II)-catalyzed reactions of
   diazocarbonyl compounds to generate up to six of the seven oxazole rings
   of the antibiotic. NMR spectroscopic studies and molecular modeling
   reveal a likely dynamic hairpin conformation with a hinge region around
   the two isoleucine residues. The compound has modest activity against
   methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).}},

Abstract = {{Fusion tag is one of the best available tools to date for enhancement of
   the solubility or improvement of the expression level of recombinant
   proteins in Escherichia coli. Typically, two consecutive affinity
   purification steps are often necessitated for the purification of
   passenger proteins. As a fusion tag, acyl carrier protein (ACP) could
   greatly increase the soluble expression level of Glucokinase (GlcK),
   alpha-Amylase (Amy) and GFP. When fusion protein ACP-G2-GlcK-Histag and
   ACP-G2-Amy-Histag, in which a protease TEV recognition site was inserted
   between the fusion tag and passenger protein, were coexpressed with
   protease TEV respectively in E. coli, the efficient intracellular
   processing of fusion proteins was achieved. The resulting passenger
   protein GlcK-Histag and Amy-Histag accumulated predominantly in a
   soluble form, and could be conveniently purified by one-step Nichelating
   chromatography. However, the fusion protein ACP-GFP-Histag was processed
   incompletely by the protease TEV coexpressed in vivo, and a large
   portion of the resulting target protein GFP-Histag aggregated in
   insoluble form, indicating that the intracellular processing may affect
   the solubility of cleaved passenger protein. In this context, the
   soluble fusion protein ACP-GFP-Histag, contained in the supernatant of
   E. coli cell lysate, was directly subjected to cleavage in vitro by
   mixing it with the clarified cell lysate of E. coli over-expressing
   protease TEV. Consequently, the resulting target protein GFP-Histag
   could accumulate predominantly in a soluble form, and be purified
   conveniently by one-step Ni-chelating chromatography. The approaches
   presented here greatly simplify the purification process of passenger
   proteins, and eliminate the use of large amounts of pure site-specific
   proteases.}},

   pump beam sizes is employed to determine simultaneously the electronic
   transport parameters (the carrier lifetime, the carrier diffusion
   coefficient, and the front surface recombination velocity) of silicon
   wafers. By employing the multiple pump beam sizes, the influence of
   instrumental frequency response on the multi-parameter estimation is
   totally eliminated. A nonlinear PCR model is developed to interpret the
   PCR signal. Theoretical simulations are performed to investigate the
   uncertainties of the estimated parameter values by investigating the
   dependence of a mean square variance on the corresponding transport
   parameters and compared to that obtained by the conventional
   frequency-scan method, in which only the frequency dependences of the
   PCR amplitude and phase are recorded at single pump beam size.
   Simulation results show that the proposed multiple-pump-beam-size method
   can improve significantly the accuracy of the determination of the
   electronic transport parameters. Comparative experiments with a p-type
   silicon wafer with resistivity 0.1-0.2 Omega.cm are performed, and the
   electronic transport properties are determined simultaneously. The
   estimated uncertainties of the carrier lifetime, diffusion coefficient,
   and front surface recombination velocity are approximately +/- 10.7\%,
   +/- 8.6\%, and +/- 35.4\% by the proposed multiple-pump-beam-size
   method, which is much improved than +/- 15.9\%, +/- 29.1\%, and >+/-
   50\% by the conventional frequency-scan method. The transport parameters
   determined by the proposed multiple-pump-beam-size PCR method are in
   good agreement with that obtained by a steady-state PCR imaging
   technique. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Pressure- and temperature-induced changes in the Ce valence and c- f
   hybridization of the Ce115 superconductors have been studied
   systematically. Resonant x-ray-emission spectroscopy indicated that the
   increase of the Ce valence with pressure was significant for CeCoIn5,
   and moderate for CeIr(In0.925Cd0.075)(5). We found no abrupt change of
   the Ce valence in the Kondo regime for CeIr(In0.925Cd0.075)(5), which
   suggests that valence fluctuations are unlikely to mediate the
   superconductivity in this material. X-ray-diffraction results were
   consistent with the pressure-induced change in the Ce valence.
   High-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy revealed a
   temperature-dependent reduction of the spectral intensity at the Fermi

Abstract = {{The commercialization of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technologies
   requires the development of cathode materials not only with high
   electrochemical activity and stability but also with excellent tolerance
   and resistance towards contaminants such as chromium. Here, a new
   electrode, Sm0.5(1-x)Sr0.5(1-x)BaxCo1-0.3xFe0.2xNb0.1xO3-delta (SSBCFN
   with x = 0.4, 0.5, 0.6) is developed based on the combined composition
   of Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta (SSC) and Ba(Co0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1)O3-delta (BCFN).
   SSBCFN with x = 0.5 (SSBCFN5) shows a high electronic conductivity of
   128-221 S cm(-1) in the temperature range of 500-900 degrees C, an
   essential requirement of SOFCs electrode materials and low electrode
   polarization resistance of 0.53 Omega cm(2) at 600 degrees C,
   significantly lower than 1.79 Omega cm(2) for the reaction on SSC and
   0.64 Omega cm(2) on BCFN. SSBCFN5 shows cubic perovsldte structure with
   a high oxygen non-stoichiometry, delta = 0.514 +/- 0.027, based on
   chemical titration method. Compared to SSC and BCFN electrodes, SSBCFN5
   shows better electrochemical activity for the oxygen reduction reaction
   and most importantly, it exhibits excellent stability and resistance
   toward chromium deposition and poisoning under SOFC operation conditions
   from 700 to 900 degrees C. The results indicate that SSBCFN5 is a
   promising potential cathode of SOFCs with high activity, stability and

Abstract = {{Tribenuron-methyl (TM) is a powerful sulfonylurea herbicide that
   inhibits branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) biosynthesis by targeting the
   catalytic subunit (CSR1) of acetolactate synthase (ALS). Selective
   induction of male sterility by foliar spraying of TM at low doses has
   been widely used for hybrid seed production in rapeseed (Brassica
   napus); however, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we
   report greater TM accumulation and subsequent stronger ALS inhibition
   and BCAA starvation in anthers than in leaves and stems after TM
   application. Constitutive or anther-specific expression of csr1-1D (a
   CSR1 mutant) eliminated anther-selective ALS inhibition and reversed the
   TM-induced male sterile phenotype in both rapeseed and Arabidopsis. The
   results of TM daub-stem experiments, combined with the observations of
   little TM accumulation in anthers and reversion of TM-induced male
   sterility by targeted expression of the TM metabolism gene Bel in either
   the mesophyll or phloem, suggested that foliar-sprayed TM was
   polar-transported to anthers mainly through the mesophyll and phloem.
   Microscopy and immunoblotting revealed that autophagy, a bulk
   degradation process induced during cell death, was elevated in
   TM-induced male sterile anthers and by anther-specific knockdown of ALS.
   Moreover, TM-induced pollen abortion was significantly inhibited by the
   autophagy inhibitor 3-MA. These data suggested that TM was
   polar-transported to anthers, resulting in BCAA starvation via
   anther-specific ALS inhibition and, ultimately, autophagic cell death in
   anthers.}},

Abstract = {{Past water circulations can significantly reduce the porosity and
   permeability of marine limestones. This is particularly the case in the
   Middle (Bathonian/Bajocian) to Upper (Oxfordian) Jurassic limestones
   from the eastern border of the Paris Basin. The knowledge of the timing,
   the temperature and composition of paleowaters is essential to model the
   hydrological evolution in this are a where the Callovian-Oxfordian
   claystones are studied for the storage of nuclear wastes. In this way,
   fluid inclusions hosted in low-temperature (<60 degrees C) authigenic
   calcite, quartz and celestite crystals were analyzed by Raman
   spectroscopy and mass spectrometry to determine the chlorinity and D/H
   ratios. Chlorinity measurements (mmol Cl per liter of water) in fluid
   inclusions trapped in authigenic crystals during the late Jurassic/early
   Cretaceous period revealed unexpected high values, up to 3800 mmol
   l(-1), indicating that brines were involved in some of the diagenetic
   crystallization processes. By contrast, fluid inclusions in calcite
   cements of Cenozoic age within the Oxfordian limestones have low Cl
   concentration (less than 150 mmol l(-1)), thus showing that a dilution
   event caused by water infiltrations during the Cretaceous uplift of this
   part of the basin has flushed out the original saline porewater. By
   coupling delta D of fluid inclusion with delta O-18 of calcite crystals,
   we estimate that calcite precipitation occurred at temperatures between
   25 and 53 degrees C. The hydrogen isotope composition of calcite-forming
   water is different between the Middle Jurassic (delta D ranging from -20
   to -35.8 parts per thousand(V-SMOW)) and the overlying Oxfordian
   limestone (delta D from -59.5 to -44.8 parts per thousand(V-SMOW)).
   Present-day groundwaters are also of distinct composition on both sides
   of the Oxfordian claystones, indicating that limestone aquifers
   underwent independent hydrologic evolutions since the early diagenetic
   Jurassic cementation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Standard evolutionary dynamics is limited by the constraints of the
   genetic system. A central message of evolutionary neurodynamics is that
   evolutionary dynamics in the brain can happen in a neuronal niche in
   real time, despite the fact that neurons do not reproduce. We show that
   Hebbian learning and structural synaptic plasticity broaden the capacity
   for informational replication and guided variability provided a
   neuronally plausible mechanism of replication is in place. The synergy
   between learning and selection is more efficient than the equivalent
   search by mutation selection. We also consider asymmetric landscapes and
   show that the learning weights become correlated with the fitness
   gradient. That is, the neuronal complexes learn the local properties of
   the fitness landscape, resulting in the generation of variability
   directed towards the direction of fitness increase, as if mutations in a
   genetic pool were drawn such that they would increase reproductive
   success. Evolution might thus be more efficient within evolved brains
   than among organisms out in the wild.}},

Abstract = {{We re-evaluated the effects of temperature and NaCl concentration on
   quantitative Raman spectroscopic measurements of dissolved CH4 in NaCl
   aqueous solutions with the newly developed Unsaturated Homogenized
   Solution Method (UHSM). The Raman peak area ratios (PARs) of the
   symmetric stretching vibrational mode of methane (at similar to 2917
   cm(-1)) to the OH stretching band of water in homogeneous CH4-containing
   aqueous solutions were obtained at temperatures from 273.15 to 603.15 K,
   pressures from 10 to 120 MPa, and NaCl concentrations from 0 to 5 mol/kg
   H2O. The pressure and concentration of CH4 (mCH(4)) have little effect
   on the Quantitative Factor (QF = PAR/mCH(4)). However, the QF shows both
   temperature and NaCl concentration dependencies; QF increases linearly
   with temperature from 273 to 603 K at constant NaCl concentration, and
   the rate of increase of QF to temperature decreases with NaCl
   concentration. After normalization to QF at 298.15 K, the QF at elevated
   temperature (T, in K) and NaCl concentration (mNaCl, in mol/kg H2O) can
   be represented as a function of temperature and mNaCl:
   QF{[}T, mNaCl] / QF{[}298.15 K, mNaCl] = f(n) (T, mNaCl) = a(n)T + b(n)
   where a(n) = -4.898E - 04 x mNaCl(1/2) + 2.011E - 03 and b(n) =
   1.377E-01 x mNaCl(1/2) + 4.042E-01. This function has been applied
   successfully to determine the methane concentration in natural fluid
   inclusions in quartz, and it can be used in other laboratories for
   CH4-NaCl-H2O ternary systems, where QF at 298.15 K is the only parameter
   that needs to be obtained for the quantitative analyses of dissolved CH4
   in NaCl aqueous solutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The paper explores the notion of the subject' in the context of
   education as an alternative to more limited concepts such as the student
   or learner. Drawing on the thought of Cornelius Castoriadis, the subject
   under consideration is a conscious, self-reflective subject that
   organizes and modifies itself in relation to a world of significations.
   Through the capacity for conscious self-modification, the subject
   becomes a self-reflective agent in a socially instituted world of
   significations. For Castoriadis, this kind of subjectivity is not
   readily available in every kind of social organization; rather, it is a
   possible product of a society that has instituted itself explicitly or
   autonomously. This socially instituted reflexivity is for Castoriadis
   historically associated with democracy, politics and philosophy. In the
   second part, the discussion is extended to the non-human realm and the
   world of the living being. Here, too, meaningor proto-meaning in the
   case of the living beingis a constituent in the formation of a world. In
   this discussion, where Francisco Varela is an important source, concepts
   such as meaning, signification, normativity and purpose are introduced
   in the natural sciences, or rather, the sciences of human and non-human
   nature. The aim of the paper is twofold: on the one hand, to introduce
   pedagogical reflections into discussions about human on non-human
   nature; and, on the other, to develop a richer conceptual repertoire for
   exploring educational phenomena than what is immediately available. An
   important background, in both cases, is the possibility of ecological
   crisis, which poses new problems for educators.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical simulation was performed to investigate the effect of the
   nanoparticles, vortex generator and combination of them on heat transfer
   and fluid flow characteristics in a rectangular channel using Commercial
   Computational Fluid Dynamics Code FLUENT. Euler-Lagrangian approach was
   utilized in the numerical modeling of the nanofluids. The fluid was
   considered as a continuous phase and the heat and flow fields were
   analyzed by solving Navier-Stokes and energy equations and the
   nanoparticles were simulated as a discrete phase in a Lagrangian frame.
   The thermal and hydraulic performances of the channel were investigated
   at different nanoparticle concentration, shape and angle of attack of
   the vortex generator. According to the results, the Nusselt number
   increases by raising the nanoparticles concentration and adding
   nanoparticles is more effective than placing VG from thermal point of
   view in the range of study. Using a combination of these heat transfer
   enhancers maximizes the thermal performance of the channel as well as
   the flow resistance. So, in order to achieve the best thermal-hydraulic
   performance, combination of the computational fluid dynamics analyses,
   artificial neural networks and multi-objective genetic algorithm was
   used to determine the optimal values of these parameters. Finally, a set
   of optimal solutions as well as the best shape, angle of attack of the
   VG and nanoparticles volume fraction was obtained. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized solvothermally in various diols
   (ethylene glycol, di(ethylene glycol), tetra(ethylene glycol),
   1,2-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol), using basic zinc carbonate
   (2ZnCO(3)center dot 3Zn(OH)(2)) as a precursor for the first time. Since
   ZnCO3 was sparingly soluble in diols the transformation reaction
   proceeded at a low reaction rate. Ethylene glycol was found as the most
   suitable medium among five diols studied yielding the smallest ZnO
   particles (similar to 55 nm) and short reaction time, t(r) (2 h). Diols
   with shorter chain length produced smaller ZnO particles. p-Toluene
   sulfonic acid (p-TSA) acted as a catalyst and reduced t(r) from 8 h to 2
   h in concentration of 0.02 M. Optimum reaction conditions for the
   synthesis in ethylene glycol were 185 degrees C and 2 h. At higher p-TSA
   concentrations (0.04-0.08 M) the size of ZnO particles was reduced from
   500-800 nm to 50-100 nm and crystallite size to 25-30 nm. Benzene
   sulfonic acid (BSA) and inorganic bases (LiOH, NaOH, and KOH) also
   showed catalytic activities. Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopies
   revealed high concentration of defects on ZnO surface causing the
   emission of visible light and giving this type of ZnO higher potential
   in various (opto)-electronic application in comparison to Zn(II) acetate
   based ZnO. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this investigation, the microstructure and hardness of a
   high-strength high-carbon steel containing 0.80 wt.\% silicon and 0.84
   wt.\% aluminum have been evaluated under different austempering
   conditions. Austempering was performed at temperatures of 300, 330 and,
   360 degrees C for different times from 1 to 8 h. Observations carried
   out by light optical microscopy (LOM) and scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM) revealed that the austempered samples have a microstructure
   consisting mostly of bainitic ferrite and retained austenite, and this
   was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and microhardness
   measurements. This simply indicates that it is possible to partially
   substitute aluminum for silicon and still retard the formation of
   carbides. There were no significant changes in ferrite plate thickness
   with increasing transformation temperature. The fraction of retained
   austenite, however, increased with temperature. A yield strength of 1170
   MPa, an ultimate tensile strength of 1370 MPa, and a total elongation of
   9.1\% were obtained after isothermal transformation at 360 degrees C for
   4 h. Depending on the transformation conditions, hardness values of
   about 500-660 HV30 were obtained. The hardness increased as the
   transformation temperature decreased. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Given two polynomials P,q we consider the following question: ``how
   large can the index of the first non-zero moment (m) over tildek=
   integral(b)(a) P(k)q be, assuming the sequence is not identically

   index, and we provide the first general upper bound: K <= 2 + deg q+
   3(deg P - 1)(2). The proof is based on qualitative analysis of linear
   ODEs, applied to Cauchy-type integrals of certain algebraic functions.
   The moment Bautin index plays an important role in the study of
   bifurcations of periodic solution in the polynomial Abel equation y' =
   py (2) + epsilon qy(3) for p,q polynomials and epsilon << 1. In
   particular, our result implies that for p satisfying a well-known
   generic condition, the number of periodic solutions near the zero
   solution does not exceed 5 + deg q + 3 deg2 p. This is the first such
   bound depending solely on the degrees of the Abel equation. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Anticancer activity of a novel curcumin analog
   (E)-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylidene)-5-((E)-3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphen
   yl)acryloyl)cyclopentanone (CUR3d) was studied using a human
   hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2). The results showed that
   CUR3d completely inhibits the tumor cell proliferation in a dose- and
   time-dependent manner. CUR3d at 100 mu mol/L activated the pro-apoptotic
   caspase-3 along with downregulation of anti-apoptotic BIRC5 and Bcl2.
   CUR3d treatment controlled the cancer cell growth by downregulating the
   expression of PI3K/Akt (Akt1, Akt2) pathway along with NF-kappa B. CUR3d
   down-regulated the members of epidermal growth receptor family (EGFR,
   ERBB3, ERBB2) and insulin like growth receptors (IGF1, IGF-1R, IGF2).
   This correlated with the downregulation of G-protein (RHOA, RHOB) and
   RAS (ATF2, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS) pathway signaling. CUR3d also arrested cell
   cycle via inhibition of CDK2, CDK4, CDK5, CDK9, MDM2, MDM4 and TERT
   genes. Cell cycle essential aurora kinases (AURK alpha, AURK beta) and
   polo-like kinases (PLK1, PLK2, PLK3) were also modulated by CUR3d.
   Topoisomerases (TOP2 alpha, TOP2 beta), important factors in cancer cell
   immortality, as well as HIF-1 alpha were downregulated following CUR3d
   treatment. The expression of protein kinase-C family (PRKC-A, PRKC-D,
   PRKC-E) was also attenuated by CUR3d. The downregulation of histone
   deacetylases (Class I, II, IV) and PARP I further strengthened the
   anticancer efficacy of CUR3d. Downregulation of carcinogenic cathepsins
   (CTSB, CTSD) and heat shock proteins exhibited CUR3d's potency as a
   potential immunological adjuvant. Finally, the non-toxic manifestation
   of CUR3d in healthy liver and lung cells along with downregulation of
   drug resistant gene ABCC1 further warrant need for advance
   investigations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Depression of the Thoracolumbar Posterior Vertebral Body on the
   Estimation of Cement Leakage in Vertebroplasty and Kyphoplasty
   Operations}},
Journal = {{CHINESE MEDICAL JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{128}},

Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: The cross-section of thoracolumbar vertebral body is
   kidney-shaped with depressed posterior boundary. The anterior wall of
   the vertebral canal is separated from the posterior wall of the
   vertebral body on the lateral X-ray image. This study was designed to
   determine the sagittal distance between the anterior border of the
   vertebral canal and the posterior border of the vertebral body (DBCV)
   and to analyze the potential role of DBCV in the estimation of cement
   leakage during percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) or percutaneous
   kyphoplasty (PKP).
   Methods: We retrospectively recruited 233 patients who had osteoporotic
   vertebral compression fractures and were treated with PVP or PKP.
   Computed tomography images of T11-L2 normal vertebrae were measured to
   obtain DBCV. The distance from cement to the posterior wall of the
   vertebral body (DCPW) of thoracolumbar vertebrae was measured from C-arm
   images. The selected vertebrae were divided into two groups according to
   DCPW, with the fracture levels, fracture grades and leakage rates of the
   two groups compared. A relative operating characteristic (ROC) curve was
   applied to determine whether the DCPW difference can be used to estimate
   the degree of cement leakage. The data were processed by statistical
   software SPSS version 21.0 using independent sample t-test and
   Chi-square tests.
   Results: The maximum DBCV was 6.40 mm and the average DBCV was 3.74 +/-
   0.95 mm. DBCV appeared to be longer in males than in females, but the
   difference was not statistically significant. The average DCPW of type-B
   leakage vertebrae (2.59 +/- 1.20 mm) was shorter than that of other
   vertebrae (7.83 +/- 2.38 mm, P < 0.001). The leakage rate of group DCPW
   <6.40 mm was lower than that of group DCPW >6.40 mm for type-C and
   type-S, but much higher for type-B. ROC curve revealed that DCPW only
   has a predictive value for type-B leakage (area under the curve: 0.98,
   95\% confidence interval: 0.95-0.99, P < 0.001), and when the cut-off
   value was 4.05 mm, the diagnostic sensitivity and the specificity were
   94.87\% and 93.02\%, respectively.
   Conclusions: Depression of the thoracolumbar posterior vertebral body
   may be informative for the estimation of cement location on C-arm
   images. To reduce type-B leakage, DCPW should be made longer than DBCV
   on C-arm images for safety during PVP or PKP.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the effects and underlying mechanisms of NCX 4040, a
   nitric oxide (NO)-donating aspirin derivative, on the production of
   proinflammatory mediators were examined using murine macrophages exposed
   to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Prevotella intermedia, a pathogen
   implicated in the etiology of periodontal disease. NCX 4040
   significantly reduced P. intermedia LPS-induced production of inducible
   NO synthase (iNOS)-derived NO, IL-1 beta and IL-6 as well as their mRNA
   expression in RAW264.7 cells. Notably, NCX 4040 was much more effective
   than the parental compound aspirin in reducing LPS-induced production of
   inflammatory mediators. NCX 4040 induced the expression of heme
   oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in cells treated with P. intermedia LPS, and the
   suppressive effect of NCX 4040 on LPS-induced NO production was
   significantly reversed by SnPP, a competitive HO-1 inhibitor. NCX 4040
   did not influence LPS-induced phosphorylation of JNK and p38. I kappa
   B-alpha degradation as well as nuclear translocation and DNA-binding
   activities of NF-kappa B p65 and p50 subunits induced by P. intermedia
   LPS were significantly reduced by NCX 4040. Besides, LPS-induced
   phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 was significantly down-regulated by
   NCX 4040. Further, NCX 4040 elevated the SOCS1 mRNA in cells stimulated
   with LPS. This study indicates that NCX 4040 inhibits P. intermedia
   LPS-induced production of NO, IL-1 beta and IL-6 in murine macrophages
   through anti-inflammatory HO-1 induction and suppression of NF-kappa B,
   STAT1 and STAT3 activation, which is associated with the activation of
   SOCS1 signaling. NCX 4040 could potentially be a promising tool in the
   treatment of periodontal disease, although further studies are required
   to verify this. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Condensing heat exchangers constantly work in extremely corrosive
   environments because of the strong acids formed from the condensing flue
   gases. Cost effective metallic materials, e.g. carbon steel, aluminum,
   copper, stainless steel, etc., cannot survive in such environments. In
   this research, a fluoropolymer based coating material with improved
   thermal conductivity was developed by post-blending graphite particles
   into perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) powder. The composite was coated onto
   metallic substrates commonly used for heat exchanger manufacturing (e.g.
   stainless steel, aluminum, etc.), and the coating shows excellent
   surface smoothness (without pinholes) and corrosion resistance, very low
   friction coefficient and good adhesion to the substrate. The surface
   mechanical and tribological properties of the coating were characterized
   by nano-indentation, scratch and wear tests. The thermal diffusivity,
   specific heat and thermal conductivity of the composite material were
   measured using laser flash and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
   techniques, and significant improvement of thermal conductivity was
   observed in the graphite-filled PFA. The overall heat transfer behavior
   of coated tubes was evaluated using a thermal contact resistance model,
   and substantial increase of heat transfer rate was anticipated by
   improving the thermal conductivity of the composite coating, reducing
   the coating thickness, and increasing the real contact area at the
   polymer/tube interface. The composite coating provides an alternative
   material solution for condensing heat exchangers used in low-grade waste
   heat recovery. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Effective cooling is very important issue in a light emitting diode

   significantly as the junction temperature increases. This study proposes
   a cooling method that improves upon the poor ventilation and heat

   natural convection. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to
   optimize the geometry of the horizontal fin heat sink with the modified
   openings, and the cooling performance of the proposed model was compared
   against those of conventional fin heat sinks. The total thermal
   resistance of the proposed model is decreased by 30.5\% relative to that
   of the conventional no-opening model at an orientation of 1800 and a
   heat input of 10 W. In addition, the luminous efficacy of the proposed
   model is increased by 23.7\% relative to that of the conventional
   no-opening model at an orientation of 1800 and a heat input of 25 W. (C)

Title = {{Development of a cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL)-based polymer for
   antibacterial activity}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{132}},
Number = {{45}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{A biobased polymer derived from cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) as a
   renewable resource was investigated for use as an antibacterial
   material. CNSL is a mixture of aromatics containing cardanol as the main
   component and cardol and 2-methylcardol as minor components. CNSL
   composition analyses showed that the minor components (i.e., cardol and
   2-methylcardol) in CNSL had higher contents of unsaturated structures
   than cardanol. These higher unsaturated contents promoted the thermal
   polymerization in the preparation of an epoxy CNSL prepolymer (ECNP).
   The biobased polymer film was fabricated by the reaction of amine
   compounds and ECNP without any organic solvent. The ECNP film took less
   than 2.0 h to reach a hardened dry condition at room temperature because
   of the crosslinking reaction between epoxy and amine groups. The
   antibacterial activities of the biobased polymer against Escherichia
   coli and Staphylococcus aureus were evaluated. CNSL showed antibacterial
   activity against S. aureus, whereas epoxy CNSL and ECNP alone showed no
   significant antibacterial activity against E. coli or S. aureus. This
   indicated that the antibacterial activity was based on the phenolic and
   catechol hydroxyl groups of CNSL. In addition, a biobased polymer film
   derived from CNSL and diamine showed antibacterial activity against both
   E. coli and S. aureus, even with alcohol conditioning. This suggested
   that the antibacterial activity was certainly fixed in the structure of
   the ECNP-based polymers after the standard antisepsis treatment in
   medical facilities. Therefore, this biobased polymer could be useful in
   antibacterial materials as a coating and resin for health care
   applications. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci.

Abstract = {{In this work, a self-rectifying property of silicon nitride

   The RRAM devices, switching layers consisted of Si3N4/SiO2/Si, are
   fabricated by a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition and dry
   oxidation, and revealed intrinsic diode property, so as to remove
   unwanted sneak path currents from an RRAM cross-bar array without extra
   switching devices. In addition, compared to Pt/Si3N4/Ti RRAM cells,
   whole operating current levels in proposed cells have been lowered about
   similar to 10(3) since introduced Si bottom electrode and SiO2 tunnel
   barrier efficiently suppress the current in both low and high resistive
   states. Consequently, these results show that the Si3N4-based one diode

   the Ce(III) ion with the N3O2 donor set and the Ce(III) ion sits within
   the cavity of acyclic ligand. The Ce(III) ion is 11-coordinated by three
   nitrogen atoms from the ligand and eight O atoms, six of which come from
   three nitrate ions, two from the ligand. In the structure of the
   complex, water molecules link molecules together to form a 3D hydrogen
   bond network. Thermal behavior of the Schiff base ligands and their
   Ce(III) complexes metal complexes were studied under nitrogen atmosphere
   in the temperature range of 20-800 degrees C. Thermal stability of the
   ligands increased upon complexation with Ce(III) ion. In the UV-Vis
   spectra of Ce(III) complexes, new absorption bands appeared at 340-450
   nm and these new bands were attributed to metal-ligand (M-L) charge
   transitions. Photoluminescence properties of the ligands and their
   Ce(III) complexes were examined. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In view of the requirement of large cold rolling deformation and bonding
   pressure in the conventional superplastic diffusion bonding of 2205
   duplex stainless steel, a novel method of introducing thermal cycling

   stainless steel was improved, activity of atoms and grain boundaries
   were improved, and the recrystallized grains were refined. The shear
   bond strength of joint prepared in the mode of thermal cycling using
   specimens with the cold roll reduction of 60\% was 15 MPa higher than
   that of conventional bonding using specimens with the cold roll
   reduction of 85\%. Compared to the shear bond strength of 430 MPa under
   the specific pressure of 10 MPa after conventional bonding, shear bond
   strength of 623 MPa was obtained under the condition of T-max = 1000

Abstract = {{A multiple fans with piezoelectric actuator system (MFPA) that combines
   piezoelectric effect, magnetic effect and resonance effect to drive
   passive fans vibrating simultaneously offers better thermal performance
   than a single piezoelectric fan as proposed in previous studies. In this
   study, a modular MFPA with a housing designed to concentrate airflow was
   developed and its thermal performance was investigated. Dimensionless
   heat convection number (M-MFPA) was defined to compare the thermal
   performance of the ar MFPA with natural convection. The results
   indicated that the geometry of the housing can significantly influence
   the thermal performance of the modular MFPA. The airflow generated from
   the MFPA was concentrated when Z{*} decreased from 2.5 to 1.25 at Y{*} =
   0.917 and theta = 0 degrees; the results showed T{*}(t) decreased from
   0.76 to 0.67. Moreover, under the case of Z{*} = 1.25 and theta = 0
   degrees, no further decreased from 0.67 to 0.60 when Y{*} decreased from
   0.917 to 0.417. To optimize the thermal performance of the modular MFPA,
   a nozzle was applied for concentrating airflow. The results showed an
   optimal value of M-MFPA of 2.57 when the nozzle angle (theta) was 63.43
   degrees under the case of Z{*} = 1.25, Y{*} = 0.417. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The non-sugar solids (NSS) content is one of the most important
   nutrition indicators of Chinese rice wine. This study proposed a rapid
   method for the measurement of NSS content in Chinese rice wine using
   near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. We also systemically studied the
   efficient spectral variables selection algorithms that have to go
   through modeling. A new algorithm of synergy interval partial least
   square with competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (Si-CARS-PLS) was
   proposed for modeling. The performance of the final model was
   back-evaluated using root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC) and
   correlation coefficient (R-c) in calibration set and similarly tested by
   mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and correlation coefficient
   (R-p) in prediction set. The optimum model by Si-CARS-PLS algorithm was
   achieved when 7 PLS factors and 18 variables were included, and the
   results were as follows: R-c = 0.95 and RMSEC = 1.12 in the calibration
   set, R-p = 0.95 and RMSEP = 1.22 in the prediction set. In addition,
   Si-CARS-PLS algorithm showed its superiority when compared with the
   commonly used algorithms in multivariate calibration. This work
   demonstrated that NIR spectroscopy technique combined with a suitable
   multivariate calibration algorithm has a high potential in rapid
   measurement of NSS content in Chinese rice wine. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Hot salt stress corrosion cracking (HSSCC) behaviour of alloy IMI 834
   was studied to examine the effect of long-term exposure and the role of
   hydrogen. Studies were conducted by exposing the salt-coated specimens
   at 300, 350 and 400 degrees C, at different stress levels for 1000 h,
   and in the unstressed condition; and the role of hydrogen in HSSCC was
   studied by using X-ray diffraction. Although the specimens passed 1000 h
   of hot salt exposure test at stress levels higher than their yield
   strength, at these temperatures, the post-exposure tensile tests showed

Abstract = {{The recent development of scaffolds with controlled topography has
   garnered a good deal of interest from researchers in various fields. In
   this paper, the authors focused on thermal deformation during reactive
   ion etching (RIE) of monolayers of two-dimensional polystyrene colloidal
   crystals as a simple method for the fabrication of such scaffolds.
   Various interesting structures, such as micro-polygons and micro-size
   honeycombs, were prepared in a one-step etching process. These
   interesting structures were fabricated on 3-mu m-diameter particles but
   not on 1-mu m-diameter particles because thermal deformation requires
   collective motion of bulk polymer. The balance of physical etching,
   chemical etching, and thermal deformation seems to have an important
   role in the fabrication of these micro structures. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   number (6000, 8000, 10,000 and 12,000) and pitch ratio (1.83, 2.92 and

   friction factor and thermal performance are presented as functions of
   Reynolds number, pitch ratio and open area ratio. Sensitivity analysis
   is used to find the effect of each active parameter. Results indicated
   that using PCRs leads to obtain lower heat transfer enhancement than the
   CRs. Thermal performance increases with increase of open area ratio but
   it reduces with rise of pitch ratio and Reynolds number. The most
   effective parameter for thermal performance is open area ratio. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Background: Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a major health problem in
   adult women that involves many factors. No proteomic analysis has been
   conducted exclusively in POP patients. This study aimed to identify the
   differential expression of proteins that may be involved in POP by
   proteomic analysis.
   Methods: Samples of the uterosacral ligament (USL) were collected from
   five POP patients and five non-POP patients matched according to age,
   parity, and menopausal status and analyzed using two-dimensional
   electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
   time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Quantitative real-time
   polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to verify the mRNA
   expression of proteins that showed differential expression in the
   proteomic analyses.
   Results: Proteins differentially expressed between POP and non-POP
   patients were detected. Eight proteins that were down-regulated in the
   POP group were identified by MALDI-TOF-MS. These proteins included
   electron transfer flavoprotein, apolipoprotein A-I, actin, transgelin,
   cofilin-1, cyclophilin A, myosin, and galectin-1, and their expression
   was verified by qRT-PCR.
   Conclusion: Using comparative proteomics, we identified eight
   differentially expressed proteins (including four cytoskeleton proteins
   and three proteins related to apoptosis) in the USL that may be involved
   in apoptosis associated with the tissue effects in POP pathophysiology.}},

Abstract = {{Laser-assisted machining (LAM) is an effective and economic technique
   for enhancing the machinability of materials which are difficult-to-cut,
   such as nickel alloys, titanium alloys and various ceramics. Recently,
   many researchers have studied the effectiveness of laser-assisted
   turning (LAT) by measuring its cutting force, tool wear, specific
   cutting energy and surface roughness. However, research on
   laser-assisted milling (LAMill) is still in progress because it is
   difficult to control the laser heating source and tool path to machine
   the varying shape of the workpiece using this method. Moreover, there
   have been no researches of workpieces with three-dimensional shapes.
   During the LAMill process, the material is softened and the mechanical
   strength of the material is reduced when a laser is used to irradiate
   the surface of the workpiece. As a result, the cutting force is reduced
   and the surface roughness is improved with LAMill. The purpose of this
   study was to develop three-dimensional LAMill and to verify the
   effectiveness of this approach by comparing it to the conventional
   machining (CM) method. A thermal analysis was also conducted in order to
   determine the effective depth of cut (DOC). Also, the cutting force and
   surface roughness of AISI 1045 steel and Inconel 718 with cylindrical
   shapes were measured. Measured results of machining characteristics were
   also analyzed according to the cutting method, i.e., up cut milling,
   down cut milling and milling style. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study describes the proposal, fabrication, testing, and

   panel (HSP) for micro/nano-satellites. The HSP consisted of a phase
   change material (PCM) and a thin panel-shaped container made of a
   high-thermal-conductivity pitch-based carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer
   (CFRP). The internal PCM was used to increase the apparent heat capacity
   with a small mass gain, whereas the high-thermal-conductivity CFRP was
   used to enhance heat dissipation. The HSP was examined using thermal
   vacuum tests and thermal analysis. The HSP's continuous phase change
   reduced the temperature fluctuation in the space chamber. Furthermore,
   the HSP was loaded and examined on a Japanese micro-satellite called
   Hodoyoshi-4. In this on-orbit test, the HSP functioned as designed, and
   the temperature profile obtained on orbit agreed well with the thermal
   analysis. These results show the HSP's high potential for the thermal

Abstract = {{Compressed air energy storage (CAES) is recognized as one of the most
   promising grid-scale energy storage technology due to the increasing
   share of intermittent renewable power sources. To utilize both the
   compression heat during charging and the waste heat in exhaust from
   turbines during discharging of CAES system, a hybrid energy system based
   on CAES system and CO2 transcritical power cycle (OTC) with liquid
   natural gas (LNG) cold energy utilization is proposed. The LNG is used
   to chill the inlet air temperature of compressors during the charge
   process thereby reducing the power consumption, and thus making a
   shorter time to fill up the air storage cavern. On the other hand, the
   CTPC with LNG as its heat sink is employed to recover the waste heat in
   exhausted flue gas from expansion train to produce more electricity,
   which can increase the net energy output, resulting in a raised energy
   generated per unit volume of storage (EVR). Moreover, the parametric
   analysis shows that the air storage cavern temperature and turbine inlet
   temperature have positive effect on the system second law efficiency,
   whereas the inlet temperature of compressors has negative effect. (C)

Abstract = {{AIMS: Late-life suicide is a growing public health concern in New
   Zealand. Given that suicide attempt is one of the strongest predictors
   of future suicide, the aim of this study was to examine the
   characteristics of older people (aged >= 65) who presented to the
   Waikato Hospital Emergency Department following an episode of self-harm
   between 1 July, 2010, and 30 June, 2013.
   METHODS: Existing hospital databases and clinical recording systems for
   medical and psychiatric records were used to identify the sample. Data
   was collected retrospectively.
   RESULTS: Of the 52 cases of elderly self-harm, 63.5\% were classified as
   suicide attempt; 19.2\% were self-injurious behaviour with no suicide
   intent; and 17.3\% were self-injurious behaviour where the suicide
   intent was unknown. Overdose was the most common method (65.4\%). 61.5\%
   of the cases reported perceived physical illness as a stressor; while
   50\% were diagnosed with depression. 13.7\% had repeated self-harm in
   the following 12 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study has highlighted the role of physical illness and
   depression in older people presenting with self-harm. Routine screening
   of depression in older people with chronic medical conditions and
   assertive treatment of depression in primary care should be considered
   as strategies to reduce self-harm and suicide in older people.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism by which carbon condenses to form PAHs or fullerenes is a
   problem that has garnered considerable theoretical and experimental
   attention. The ring-coalescence and annealing model for the formation of
   C-60 involves a {[}2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of a cydopolyyne to
   form a tetraalkynyl cydobuta-1,3-diene intermediate, followed by a
   Bergman cydoaromatization reaction of the enediyne moiety.
   Intra-molecular trapping of the incipient p-benzyne diradical across a
   diyne moiety of the macrocyclic ring affords an aromatic ring that must
   undergo further intramolecular reactions via polyradical intermediates
   to produce a condensed graphitic structure or fullerene. Computational
   studies of a model system for the intriguing
   tetraalkynylcyclobuta-1,3-diene intermediate, however, reveal that the
   corresponding p-benzyne diradical lies in a shallow minimum with a very
   low barrier to ring opening to cydooctadienediyne. This pathway has not
   been previously considered in the mechanism for carbon condensation.}},

Abstract = {{Rare earth elements (REE) are widely used in variety of commercial
   applications, which results in public exposure to them, and it is a
   matter of concern. Recent studies have demonstrated that the toxicity of
   (REE) as a group is similar to the toxicity of heavy metals. Many
   methods were used to remove lanthanides from wastewaters generated from
   their commercial use. Samarium, a REE, which may be removed from the
   aqueous solution by polyelectrolyte-enhanced ultrafiltration process,
   was investigated using poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) with average molecular
   weight 100,000Da. The ultrafiltration studies were carried out using a
   tangential cell system. Polyethersulfone membrane with molecular weight
   cutoff of 5,000Da and an effective filtration area of 50cm(2) were used
   (PES-5). Several parameters, such as transmembrane pressure, PAA
   concentrations, and pH, have been optimized to improve the retention of
   the Sm(III) ions. Results shows that the permeate flux increases
   linearly with increasing transmembrane pressure. It can be seen that
   with the increase in the concentration of PAA, the Sm(III) ions
   retention also increases until reaching 80\%. A better retention was
   observed at 2x10(-4)molL(-1) PAA concentration and 3bar transmembrane
   pressure. The pH effect study on samarium ions revealed a maximum
   retention around 70\% for pH 5.}},

Abstract = {{A defective mitochondrial respiratory chain complex (DMRC) causes
   various metabolic disorders in humans. However, the pathophysiology of
   DMRC in the liver remains unclear. To understand DMRC pathophysiology in
   vitro, DMRC-induced pluripotent stem cells were generated from dermal
   fibroblasts of a DMRC patient who had a homoplasmic mutation (m.3398T ->
   C) in the mitochondrion-encoded NADH dehydrogenase 1 (MTND1) gene and
   that differentiated into hepatocytes (DMRC hepatocytes) in vitro. DMRC
   hepatocytes showed abnormalities in mitochondrial characteristics, the
   NAD(+)/NADH ratio, the glycogen storage level, the lactate turnover
   rate, and AMPK activity. Intriguingly, low glycogen storage and
   transcription of lactate turnover-related genes in DMRC hepatocytes were
   recovered by inhibition of AMPK activity. Thus, AMPK activation led to
   metabolic changes in terms of glycogen storage and lactate turnover in
   DMRC hepatocytes. These data demonstrate for the first time that energy
   depletion may lead to lactic acidosis in the DMRC patient by reduction
   of lactate uptake via AMPK in liver.}},

Abstract = {{Carbene, cyclobutyl, and potential diradical mechanisms were studied
   computationally for Stone-Wales rearrangements in several derivatives of
   as-indacene and pyracyclene, including cyclopent{[}hi]
   acephenanthrylene, dicydop enta {[}cd,fg] pyrene, corannulene, diindeno
   {[}1,2,3,4-defg;1',2',3',4'-mnop]chrysene, and semibuckminsterfullerene.
   At the UM06-2X/cc-pVDZ and BD (T)/cc-pVDZ//UM06-2X/cc-pVDZ levels of
   theory, free energies of reaction reveal that transformations involving
   an increase in curvature are thermodynamically unfavorable. In addition,
   the carbene transition states or intermediates (corrected to 1000
   degrees C) are generally around 100-120 kcal/mol higher than starting
   substrates, except for as-indacene (80 kcal/mol), which is the only
   process considered here that is predicted to have a barrier accessible
   under typical flash vacuum pyrolysis conditions. For pyracydene
   derivatives, the relative free energy of cydobutyl intermediates rises
   steadily with increasing curvature of the substrate and increasing
   annelation. Singlet acetylenic diradicals related to pyracydene,
   diindenochrysene, and semibuckminsterfullerene are predicted to be
   second- or higher-order saddle points that lie more than 40 kcal/mol
   higher than the corresponding carbenes and cydobutyl intermediates.}},

Title = {{An ethnobotanical survey of traditionally used plants on Suva planina
   mountain (south-eastern Serbia)}},

Abstract = {{Ethnopharmacological relevance: This study documents the ethnobotanical
   and ethnomedicinal importance of plants in the Suva planina mountain
   region (south-eastern Serbia). It is reflected in their high diversity
   and their wide range of uses in the treatment of the local population.
   The aim of this study was a comparative analysis of data collected in
   the Suva planina region with relevant data from the Western Balkans,
   which included identifying the `most popular' plants, as well as those
   species which are used specifically for treatment solely in the research
   area.
   Materials and methods: Ethnobotanical research was carried out between
   2012 and 2014 and data was collected through both open and
   semi-structured interviews with locals. A total of 66 people were
   interviewed (37 women and 29 men), aged between 49 and 90 (with a mean
   age of 71).
   Results: This study identified 128 plants and 2 fungi which are used in
   ethnomedicine, 5 plant species used in ethnoveterinary medicine, and 16
   plants used for `other' purposes. Lamiaceae (20), Asteraceae (17),
   Rosaceae (16), Brassicaceae (5), Alliaceae (4) and Apiaceae (4) have the
   greatest diversity of species. Results showed that Achillea mellefolium,
   Allium cepa, Allium sativum, Arctostaphyllos uva-ursi, Gentiana lutea,
   Hypericum perforatum, Juglans regia, Matricaria chamomilla, Mentha
   piperita, Plantago lanceolata, Plantago major, Salvia officinalis,
   Sempervivum tectorum, Tilia cordata and Thymus sepyllum are the `most
   popular' medicinal plants (UV=1). Those plants with the most
   phytotherapeutic uses are Gentiana cruciata (14), H. perforatum (11) and
   A. sadvum (10), while the most common conditions treated with medicinal
   plants are respiratory (79), urogenital (53), gastrointestinal (51),
   skin (43) and those relating to the circulatory system (35). A
   comparative analysis of the data collected in the research area and that
   from other parts of the Western Balkans showed that there are great
   similarities within Serbia between Suva planina and the Zlatibor region
   (37.2\%) and Kopaonik Mt. (32.3\%), while further afield it is most
   similar to Bosnia and Herzegovina (40.9\%) and Bulgaria (40.6\%).
   Moreover, it was established that 14 plant species and 2 fungi are used
   only in the Suva planina region, which points to the specificity of the
   diversity and the sound knowledge of medicinal plants in this region.
   Conclusions: Our results confirm that medicinal plants are an invaluable
   resource of the research area and need to be protected as they
   contribute to an improvement in living standards and the survival of
   people threatened by unfavourable demographic trends. However, due to
   over-exploitation, some plants have become exceptionally rare and are
   under threat, leading to the need for their rational use and protection
   so as to ensure they are still around for future generations. (C) 2015

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Bacterial infections are common in patients suffering viral hepatitis
   and critical for prognosis. However, any correlation between HBV and
   concomitant bacterial infections is not well characterized. A
   retrospective study was conducted from Jan 2012 to Jan 2014 on 1333
   hospitalized patients infected with bacteria. Among them, 491
   HBV-infected patients were co-infected with E. coli (268), S. aureus
   (61), P. aeruginosa (64) or K. pneumoniae (98). A group of 300
   complication-free chronically HBV-infected patients were controls. We
   found that HBV DNA levels were elevated in patients with each of the
   bacterial infections (all P < 0.05). ALT and HBeAg were strong
   determinants of high HBV DNA concentration. Patterns of determinants
   varied in infections by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
   Patients with HBV DNA >= 2000 IU/mL had higher rates of all four
   concomitant bacterial infections (all P < 0.001). All types of strains
   isolated from HBV-positive patients showed less resistance to tested
   antimicrobials. The HBV DNA serum concentrations were inversely
   correlated to the number of ineffective antimicrobials in E. coli, P.
   aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae infections (P = 0.022, 0.017 and 0.016,
   respectively), but not S. aureus (P = 0.194). In conclusion, bacterial
   infections are associated with a high level of HBV replication, which,
   in turn, has a significant positive impact on bacterial resistance to
   antimicrobials. These correlations vary between Gram-negative and
   Gram-positive bacteria.}},

Pages = {{66-72}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone (NVP) and tri(ethylene glycol) divinyl ether (TDE)
   are utilized as reactive diluents to replace carcinogenic styrene (St)
   during the formulation of unsaturated polyester (UPE) resins. The
   processability and thermomechanical properties of the UPE
   resin-containing hemp fibre composites are evaluated. Both NVP-UPE and
   TDE-UPE resins exhibit better miscibility than the St-UPE resin.
   Rheological and curing measurements reveal that the St-free resins have
   much lower viscosity and curing temperatures than the St-UPE resin,
   indicating their superior processability. Furthermore, hemp fibre
   composites with NVP-UPE resin show comparable mechanical properties to
   the St-UPE composites. Composites of TDE-UPE have comparable tensile and
   impact strengths to the St-UPE composites. However, the flexural
   strength and modulus, storage modulus, and glass transition temperature
   of TDE-UPE composites are all lower than those of the St-UPE composites.

Abstract = {{Low body mass index (BMI) has been associated with risk of head-neck
   cancer (HNC), but prospective data are scarce. We investigated the
   association between BMI, BMI at age 20 years and change in BMI during
   adulthood with risk of HNC and HNC subtypes. 120,852 participants
   completed a questionnaire on diet and other cancer risk factors,
   including anthropometric measurements, at baseline in 1986. After 20.3
   years of follow-up, 411 HNC (127 oral cavity cancer (OCC), 84
   oro-/hypopharyngeal cancer (OHPC), and 197 laryngeal cancer (LC)) cases
   and 3,980 subcohort members were available for case-cohort analysis
   using Cox proportional hazards models. BMI at baseline was inversely
   associated with risk of HNC overall, with a multivariate rate ratio of
   3.31 (95\% CI 1.40-7.82) for subjects with a BMI < 18.5 kg/m(2),
   compared to participants with a BMI of 18.5 to 25 kg/m(2). Among HNC
   subtypes, this association was strongest for OCC and OHPC. The
   association between BMI at age 20 and HNC risk appeared to be positive.
   In this large prospective cohort study, we found an inverse association
   between BMI at baseline and HNC risk. For BMI at age 20, however, a
   positive rather than inverse association was found.}},

Abstract = {{The exact quantum entropy of BPS black holes can be evaluated using
   localization in supergravity. An important ingredient in this program,
   that has been lacking so far, is the one-loop effect arising from the
   quadratic fluctuations of the exact deformation (the QV operator). We
   compute the fluctuation determinant for vector multiplets and hyper
   multiplets around Q-invariant off-shell configurations in
   four-dimensional N = 2 supergravity with AdS(2) x S-2 boundary
   conditions, using the Atiyah-Bott fixed-point index theorem and a
   subsequent zeta function regularization. Our results extend the
   large-charge on-shell entropy computations in the literature to a regime
   of finite charges. Based on our results, we present an exact formula for
   the quantum entropy of BPS black holes in N = 2 supergravity. We explain
   cancellations concerning 1/8-BPS black holes in N = 8 supergravity that
   were observed in arXiv : 1111. 1161. We also make comments about the
   interpretation of a logarithmic term in the topological string partition
   function in the low energy supergravity theory.}},

Abstract = {{Education is an effective way to improve girls' self-worth, health, and
   productivity; however there remains a gender gap between girls' and
   boys' completion of school. The literature around factors influencing
   girls' decision to stay in school is limited. Seven focus group
   discussions took place among 79 girls in forms 2 to 4 at secondary
   schools in rural western Kenya, to examine their views on why girls
   absent themselves or dropout from school. Data were analysed
   thematically. Lack of resources, sexual relationships with boyfriends,
   and menstrual care problems were reported to lead directly to dropout or
   school absence. These were tied to girls increased vulnerability to
   pregnancy, poor performance in school, and punishments, which further
   increase school absence and risk of dropout. Poverty, unmet essential
   needs, coercive sexual relationships, and an inequitable school
   environment collude to counter girls' resolve to complete their
   schooling. Lack of resources drive girls to have sex with boyfriends or
   men who provide them with essentials their family cannot afford, such as
   sanitary pads and transport to school. While these improve quality of
   their school life, this dynamic increases their exposure to sexual risk,
   pregnancy, punishment, and dropout. Evaluation of interventions to
   ameliorate these challenges is warranted, including provision of pocket
   money to address their needs.}},

Title = {{CB1 cannabinoid receptor enrichment in the ependymal region of the adult
   human spinal cord}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Cannabinoids are involved in the regulation of neural stem cell biology
   and their receptors are expressed in the neurogenic niches of adult
   rodents. In the spinal cord of rats and mice, neural stem cells can be
   found in the ependymal region, surrounding the central canal, but there
   is evidence that this region is largely different in adult humans: lacks
   a patent canal and presents perivascular pseudorosettes, typically found
   in low grade ependymomas. Using Laser Capture Microdissection, Taqman
   gene expression assays and immunohistochemistry, we have studied the
   expression of endocannabinoid system components (receptors and enzymes)
   at the human spinal cord ependymal region. We observe that ependymal
   region is enriched in CB1 cannabinoid receptor, due to high CB1
   expression in GFAP+ astrocytic domains. However, in human spinal cord
   levels that retain central canal patency we found ependymal cells with
   high CB1 expression, equivalent to the CB1HIGH cell subpopulation
   described in rodents. Our results support the existence of ependymal
   CB1HIGH cells across species, and may encourage further studies on this
   subpopulation, although only in cases when central canal is patent. In
   the adult human ependyma, which usually shows central canal absence, CB1
   may play a different role by modulating astrocyte functions.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},

Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{A reconstruction methodology based on different-phase-neighbor (DPN)
   pixel swapping and multigrid hierarchical annealing is presented. The
   method performs reconstructions by starting at a coarse image and
   successively refining it. TheDPNinformation is used at each refinement
   stage to freeze interior pixels of preformed structures. This preserves
   the large-scale structures in refined images and also reduces the number
   of pixels to be swapped, thereby resulting in a decrease in the
   necessary computational time to reach a solution. Compared to
   conventional single-grid simulated annealing, this method was found to
   reduce the required computation time to achieve a reconstruction by
   around a factor of 70-90, with the potential of even higher speedups for
   larger reconstructions. The method is able to perform medium sized (up
   to 300(3) voxels) three-dimensional reconstructions with multiple
   correlation functions in 36-47 h.}},

Abstract = {{The chromatographic behaviour of eleven synthetic cathinones and four
   phenylethylamines under supercritical/subcritical fluid conditions was
   investigated. Four stationary phases with sub-2 mu m particles (Waters
   Acquity UPC2 BEH silica, BEH 2-ethylpyridine, CSH Fluoro-Phenyl, and HSS
   C18SB) were evaluated in terms of isomer resolution, chromatographic
   peak shape, and analysis time. Methanol, water, formic acid, ammonium
   hydroxide, ammonium acetate, and ammonium formate were mixed with carbon
   dioxide to test their influence on analyte retention and peak shapes.
   Methanol and ammonium cations were essential for successful separations.
   Efficient separations of four isomeric pairs (R > 1), and most of the
   remaining analytes, were achieved in less than 3.3 min on BEH and
   Fluoro-Phenyl columns with gradient of methanolic ammonium hydroxide in
   CO2. Drugs were detected by positive electrospray ionization triple
   quadrupole mass spectrometry in selected reaction monitoring mode. Added
   detection specificity and faster separation of isomers on the BEH column
   using a steep gradient and high flow rate reduced analysis time of the
   mixture of 15 drugs to 1.6 min. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Anti-inflammatory effect of Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi
   hydroalcoholic extract on neutrophil migration in zymosan-induced

Abstract = {{Ethnopharmacological relevance: Schinus terebinthifolius is a species of
   plant from the Anacardiaceae family, which can be found in different
   regions of Brazil. Schinus is popularly known as aroeirinha,
   aroeira-vermelha, or Brazilian pepper. In folk medicine, S.
   terebinthifolius is used for several disorders, including inflammatory
   conditions, skin wounds, mucosal membrane ulcers, respiratory problems,
   gout, tumors, diarrhea and arthritis. According to chemical analyses,
   gallic acid, methyl gallate and pentagalloylglucose are the main
   components of hydroalcoholic extracts from S. terebinthifolius leaves.
   In the present study, we demonstrated the ability of a hydroalcoholic
   extract to inhibit cell migration in arthritis and investigated the
   mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.
   Materials and methods: The anti-inflammatory effect of S.
   terebinthifolius hydroalcoholic leaf extract (ST-70) was investigated in
   a zymosan-induced experimental model of inflammation. Male Swiss and
   C57B1/6 mice received zymosan (100 mu g/cavity) via intra-thoracic
   (i.t.) or intra-articular (i.a.) injection after oral pre-treatment with
   ST-70. The direct action of ST-70 on neutrophils was evaluated via
   chemotaxis.
   Results: ST-70 exhibited a dose-dependent effect in the pleurisy model.
   The median effective dose (ED50) was 100 mg/kg, which inhibited 70\% of
   neutrophil accumulation when compared with the control group. ST-70
   reduced joint diameter and neutrophil influx for synovial tissues at 6 h
   and 24 h in zymosan-induced arthritis. Additionally, ST-70 inhibited
   synovial interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 beta, keratinocyte-derived chemokine
   (CXCL1/KC) and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-alpha production at 6 h and
   CXCL1/KC and IL-1 beta production at 24 h. The direct activity of ST-70
   on neutrophils was observed via the impairment of CXCL1/KC-induced
   chemotaxis in neutrophils. Oral administration of ST-70 did not induce
   gastric damage. Daily administration for twenty days did not kill any
   animals. In contrast, similar administrations of diclofenac induced
   gastric damage and killed all animals by the fifth day.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory
   effects of ST-70, suggesting a putative use of this herb for the
   development of phytomedicines to treat inflammatory diseases, such as
   joint inflammation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The past few decades have witnessed a proliferation of photographic
   images (often in photobooks or online) focusing on the aged and the
   terminally ill. These works cut across different photographic practices,
   bringing together the documentary, the vernacular and the art
   photograph. Rather than individual decisive moment' shots, such works
   almost always occur in sequences or series, tracking a process whose
   telos is inevitably death. Following Roland Barthes (2000{[}1980]), I
   examine works from this growing photographic genre in light of the ways
   that loss and imminent death are ensnared in the theorisation of
   photography itself. Such memento mori might appear to be linked to the
   indexical nature of photography, in its most literal sense a
   photochemical process capturing the trace of something inevitably past,
   and therefore ineluctably lost. However, I argue that even with
   technological changes in the modes of production and systems of
   dissemination of images, where the digital paradigm no longer
   presupposes a necessary link between the photographic and the real,
   artists working in this genre have adhered to the notion of
   photography's truth effect, its affinity with the role of witness. After
   a brief glance at three texts linking photography and death, I probe
   numerous bodies of work from this genre, sounding their need to rehearse
   loss of life and its symbolic retrieval, and the complex ways in which
   memory and oblivion continue to be written into diverse photographic
   practices.}},

Title = {{Assessment of the safety of antimalarial drug use during early pregnancy
   (ASAP): protocol for a multicenter prospective cohort study in Burkina

Abstract = {{Background: A major unresolved safety concern for malaria case
   management is the use of artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) in the
   first trimester of pregnancy. There is a need for human data to inform
   policy makers and treatment guidelines on the safety of artemisinin
   combination therapies (ACT) when used during early pregnancy.
   Methods: The overall goal of this paper is to describe the methods and
   implementation of a study aimed at developing surveillance systems for
   identifying exposures to antimalarials during early pregnancy and for
   monitoring pregnancy outcomes using health and demographic surveillance
   platforms. This was a multi-center prospective observational cohort
   study involving women at health and demographic surveillance sites in
   three countries in Africa: Burkina Faso, Kenya and Mozambique
   {[}(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01232530)]. The study was designed
   to identify pregnant women with artemisinin exposure in the first
   trimester and compare them to: 1) pregnant women without malaria, 2)
   pregnant women treated for malaria, but exposed to other antimalarials,
   and 3) pregnant women with malaria and treated with artemisinins in the
   2nd or 3rd trimesters from the same settings. Pregnant women were
   recruited through community-based surveys and attendance at health
   facilities, including antenatal care clinics and followed until
   delivery. Data from the three sites will be pooled for analysis at the
   end of the study. Results are forthcoming.
   Discussion: Despite few limitations, the methods described here are
   relevant to the development of sustainable pharmacovigilance systems for
   drugs used by pregnant women in the tropics using health and demographic
   surveillance sites to prospectively ascertain drug safety in early
   pregnancy.}},

Abstract = {{Ethnopharmacological relevance: Artocarpus altilis (Moreceae) has been
   widely used as a traditional folk medicine in Southeast Asia for the
   treatment of many diseases, including skin disorders, such as ulcers and
   dermatitis. Aim of the study: The present study aimed to investigate the
   ability of an artocarpin-enriched extract to prevent ultraviolet
   radiation B-induced photodamage.
   Materials and methods: The content of artocarpin in the extract was
   determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A DPPH
   assay was used to evaluate the free radical scavenging activity of the
   extract, which was compared with those of I.-ascorbic acid and
   a-tocopherol. Cytotoxicity and proliferation of cells treated with the
   extract were determined using XTF and BrdU assays, respectively. Human
   skin fibroblasts and keratinocytes were pretreated with the extract for
   24 h and later irradiated with ultraviolet radiation B at 128 J/cm(2).
   The levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 released from ultraviolet radiation
   B-irradiated keratinocytes and, MMP-1 and type-I procollagen produced by
   ultraviolet radiation B-irradiated fibroblasts were measured by ELISA
   and/or western blotting. The hairless skin of male mice (outbred ICR)
   was treated with the extract or L-ascorbic acid solution prior to
   exposure to ultraviolet radiation B irradiation. The dose of ultraviolet
   B irradiation was consecutively increased to 18, 36, 54, and 72 J/cm(2)
   at weeks 1-4, 4-7, 7-10, and 10-12, respectively. The epidermal
   thickness and collagen content in the skin of ultraviolet radiation
   B-irradiated mice were evaluated.
   Results: The extract concentration of 50 mu g/mL was not toxic and did
   not inhibit the proliferation of fibroblasts. The pretreatment of
   fibroblasts with 50 mu g/mL extract prior to ultraviolet radiation B
   irradiation attenuated MMP-1 production but did not affect type-I
   procollagen production. The extract also decreased the ultraviolet
   radiation B-induced production of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in keratinocytes.
   Moreover, the topical administration of the extract suppressed epidermal
   thickening and collagen loss in chronically ultraviolet radiation
   B-exposed skin in mice.
   Conclusions: The experimental study revealed that A. altilis extract
   suppresses structural alterations in skin damaged by ultraviolet
   radiation B irradiation. This suppression was, at least partially,
   mediated by decrease in MMP-1 production in fibroblasts and TNF-alpha
   and IL-6 productions in keratinocytes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Abstract = {{Ion-exchange membranes (IEMs) are ionic conducting materials. They have
   various applications such as: fuel cell (PEMFC), electrochemical
   synthesis (Cl-2/NaOH), desalination, purification, separation, and
   environment. Despite these applications, several aspects are still
   unknown, such as: the membrane structure, the conduction mechanisms, and
   concentration polarization. The main obstacle in electro-membrane
   processes such as electrodialysis is the concentration polarization
   phenomenon, which remains one of the incomprehensible phenomena in IEM
   transport. This phenomenon is common to all systems operating a
   selective ionic transfer through an interface; it arises from the
   difference in ions mobility in the solution and in the membrane. A
   better understanding of concentration polarization can help to improve
   the membrane performance, the process efficiency, and in the reduction
   the process operation cost. In this research, we studied the effect of
   the ammonia buffer (NH3/NH4+) on the counter-ion transfer through the
   anion- and the cation-exchange membranes AMX and CMX, respectively. The
   results show that the ammonia addition facilitates the counter-ion
   transfer in both cases and gives a total elimination of the system
   polarization, but with different behaviors of CMX and AMX membranes. The
   classical concentration polarization theory remains insufficient to
   explain the obtained results.}},

Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Using light microscope (LM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM), the
   megaspores and microspores of 77 samples representing ca. 70 species of
   Selaginella from China are observed. Combing previous studies, the spore
   morphology of nearly all documented Selaginella species from China were
   reviewed. Based on the morphological characteristics in megaspores
   and/or microspores, we divided the spores of Chinese species into 15
   types and three types are further divided into various subtypes. Each
   type and subtype are described in detail and a key to the types and
   subtypes of spores is given. For the first time, the systematic
   significance of microspores of Selaginella are discussed, and the
   results indicate that microspores of Selaginella are significant in the
   systematics of Selaginella. Some important morphological characteristics
   in spores (e.g., color, micro-sculpture, size, etc.), often been
   neglected in previous studies, are introduced. Some spore-morphological
   synapomorphies of the clades and subclades, identified by recent
   molecular work (Zhou et al. 2015a), are well established. Using the
   spore morphology, the delimitation of some taxonomically difficult
   species in Selaginella is assessed.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Improving the unsaturated fatty acid content of ruminant
   meat is essential due to the generally saturated nature of fatty acids
   in ruminant meat and the negative effects this can have on human health.
   Nonetheless, enhancing the unsaturated fatty acid content of ruminant
   meat can have adverse effects on the shelf life and quality attributes
   of the meat. This study assessed the effects of dietary 80 \% canola oil
   and 20 \% palm oil blend (CPOB) on fatty acid composition, antioxidants,
   oxidative spoilage, cholesterol and physicochemical properties of
   semimembranosus (SM) muscle from goats. Twenty four Boer bucks were
   randomly assigned to diets containing on dry matter basis 0, 4 and 8 \%
   CPOB, fed for 100 d and slaughtered. The carcasses were subjected to a 7
   d postmortem refrigerated storage. All analyses were conducted on the SM
   muscle.
   Results: Diet had no effect (P > 0.05) on the concentration of free
   thiol and carbonyl and the band intensity of myosin heavy chain, actin
   and troponin T. The muscle glycogen, pH, water holding capacity,
   tenderness, glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity, total carotenoid,
   d-tocopherol, cholesterol and proximate composition did not differ (P >
   0.05) between diets. The SMmuscle from goats fed 4 and 8 \% CPOB had
   lower (P < 0.05) concentration of C14:0 and C16:0 and higher (P < 0.05)
   concentration of C18:1 trans-11, C18:1 omega-9, C18: 3 omega-3, C20:5
   omega-3 and C22:5 omega-3 than the SM muscle from the control goats.
   Dietary CPOB increased (P < 0.05) the concentration of alpha and gamma
   tocopherol and meat redness (a{*}) on d 1 and 4 postmortem. Regardless
   of diet, antioxidant vitamins, and shear force decreased (P < 0.05)
   while drip loss, lipid and protein oxidation increased (P < 0.05) as
   postmortem storage progressed.
   Conclusion: Results evince that dietary CPOB can be used as a management
   tool to enhance the beneficial fatty acids and antioxidant contents of
   chevon without deleterious effects on its physicochemical properties and
   shelf life.}},

Abstract = {{A combination of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra and
   density functional theory (DFT) calculations is used to characterize the
   paramagnetic species in rutile N-doped SnO2 samples synthesized by wet
   chemistry methods. In particular, the nature of paramagnetic N species,
   substitutional or interstitial, and their effect on the electronic
   structure are discussed. Complex EPR spectra generated by the
   interaction of the unpaired electron with N and Sn nudei have been
   accurately simulated to obtain the EPR properties (g and A tensors). The
   results suggest that the N dopants form a rather symmetric structure
   with three magnetically equivalent or nearly equivalent Sn atoms
   surrounding the N impurity. After a careful assessment of an
   all-electron basis set for Sn atoms, realistic models of substitutional
   and interstitial N-doped SnO2 structures have been designed, and the
   corresponding hyperfine coupling constants (hpcc) were computed. The
   comparison between computed and measured hpcc values leads to assignment
   of the paramagnetic centers in N-doped SnO2 to substitutional N dopants
   that take the position of the O atoms in the lattice. The DFT
   calculations finally suggest the N impurities induce the formation of
   localized empty states (electron holes) in the intra band gap region.

Title = {{HYPOXIC PRECONDITIONING AND CELL DEATH FROM OXYGEN/GLUCOSE DEPRIVATION
   CO-OPT A SUBSET OF THE UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE IN HIPPOCAMPAL NEURONS}},
Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{310}},

Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{The state of protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), via the
   unfolded protein response (UPR), regulates a pro-or anti-apoptotic cell
   fate. Hypoxic preconditioning (HPC) is a potent anti-apoptotic stimulus,
   wherein ischemic neural injury is averted by a non-damaging exposure to
   hypoxia. We tested if UPR modulation contributes to the
   pro-survival/anti-apoptotic phenotype in neurons preconditioned with
   hypoxia, using organotypic cultures of rat hippocampus as a model
   system. Pharmacologic induction of the UPR with tunicamycin increased
   mRNA of 79 of 84 UPR genes and replicated the pro-survival phenotype of
   HPC, whereas only small numbers of the same mRNAs were upregulated at 0,
   6 and 24 h after HPC. During the first 24 h after HPC, protein signals
   in all 3 UPR pathways increased at various times: increased ATF4,
   phosphorylation of eif2 alpha and IRE1, cleavage of xbb1 mRNA and
   cleavage of ATF6. Pharmacologic inhibition of ATF6 and IRE1 blocked HPC.
   Ischemia-like conditions (oxygen/glucose deprivation, OGD) caused
   extensive neuron cell damage and involved some of the same UPR protein
   signals as HPC. In distinction to HPC and tunicamycin, OGD caused
   widespread suppression of UPR genes: 55 of 84 UPR gene mRNAs were
   numerically downregulated. We conclude that although HPC and ischemic
   cell death in hippocampal neurons involve protein-based signaling in all
   3 UPR pathways, these processes co-opt only a subset of the genomic
   response elicited by agents known to cause protein misfolding, possibly
   because of persistent transcription/translation arrest induced by
   hypoxia and especially OGD. (C) 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We equip three-dimensional spin-3 gravity in the principal embedding

   topologically massive gravity with strict null warped AdS boundary
   conditions. We prove the invertibility of the map between zuvielbein and
   metric variables and construct a global gauge transformation to half of
   AdS spin-3 gravity in the diagonal embedding. This explains why the
   theory is chiral and why the Polyakov-Bershadsky algebra arises. We then
   introduce chemical potentials, derive the entropy, free energy, and the
   holographic response functions, and conclude with a discussion.}},

Abstract = {{Due to their high energy density and reduced cost, lithium sulfur
   batteries are promising alternatives for applications such as electrical
   vehicles. However, a number of technical challenges need to be overcome
   in order to make them feasible for commercial uses. These challenges
   arise from the battery highly interconnected chemistry, which besides
   the electrochemical reactions includes side reactions at both electrodes
   and migration of soluble polysulfide (PS) species produced at the
   cathode to the anode side. The presence of such PS species alters the
   already complex reactivity of the Li anode. In this work, interfacial
   reactions occurring at the surface of Li metal anodes due to
   electrochemical instability of the electrolyte components and PS species
   are investigated with density functional theory and ab initio molecular
   dynamics methods. It is found that the bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide
   lithium salt reacts very fast when in contact with the Li surface, and
   anion decomposition precedes salt dissociation. The anion decomposition
   mechanisms are fully elucidated. Two of the typical solvents used in
   Li-S technology, 1,3-dioxolane and 1,2-dimethoxyethane, are found stable
   during the entire simulation length, in contrast with the case of
   ethylene carbonate that is rapidly decomposed by sequential 2- or
   4-electron mechanisms. On the other hand, the fast reactivity of the
   soluble PS species alters the side reactions because the PS totally
   decomposes before any of the electrolyte components forming Li2S on the
   anode surface.}},

Title = {{No Evidence for Enrichment in Schizophrenia for Common Allelic
   Associations at Imprinted Loci}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{Most genetic studies assume that the function of a genetic variant is
   independent of the parent from which it is inherited, but this is not
   always true. The best known example of parent-of-origin effects arises
   with respect to alleles at imprinted loci. In classical imprinting,
   characteristically, either the maternal or paternal copy is expressed,
   but not both. Only alleles present in one of the parental copies of the
   gene, the expressed copy, is likely to contribute to disease. It has
   been postulated that imprinting is important in central nervous system
   development, and that consequently, imprinted loci may be involved in
   schizophrenia. If this is true, allowing for parent-of-origin effects
   might be important in genetic studies of schizophrenia. Here, we use
   genome-wide association data from one of the world's largest samples (N
   = 695) of parent schizophrenia-offspring trios to test for
   parent-of-origin effects. To maximise power, we restricted our analyses
   to test two main hypotheses. If imprinting plays a disproportionate role
   in schizophrenia susceptibility, we postulated a) that alleles showing
   robust evidence for association to schizophrenia from previous
   genome-wide association studies should be enriched for parent-of-origin
   effects and b) that genes at loci imprinted in humans or mice should be
   enriched both for genome-wide significant associations, and in our
   sample, for parent-of-origin effects. Neither prediction was supported
   in the present study. We have shown, that it is unlikely that
   parent-of-origin effects or imprinting play particularly important roles
   in schizophrenia, although our findings do not exclude such effects at
   specific loci nor do they exclude such effects among rare alleles.}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental goal of genomics is to identify the complete set of
   expressed proteins. Automated annotation strategies rely on assumptions
   about protein-coding sequences (CDSs), e.g., they are conserved, do not
   overlap, and exceed a minimum length. However, an increasing number of
   newly discovered proteins violate these rules. Here we present an
   experimental and analytical framework, based on ribosome profiling and
   linear regression, for systematic identification and quantification of
   translation. Application of this approach to lipopolysaccharide-
   stimulated mouse dendritic cells and HCMV-infected human fibroblasts
   identifies thousands of novel CDSs, including micropeptides and variants
   of known proteins, that bear the hallmarks of canonical translation and
   exhibit translation levels and dynamics comparable to that of annotated
   CDSs. Remarkably, many translation events are identified in both mouse
   and human cells even when the peptide sequence is not conserved. Our
   work thus reveals an unexpected complexity to mammalian translation
   suited to provide both conserved regulatory or protein-based functions.}},

Title = {{Phylogeographic Structure of the White-Footed Mouse and the Deer Mouse,
   Two Lyme Disease Reservoir Hosts in Quebec}},

Abstract = {{Modification of a species range is one of many consequences of climate
   change and is driving the emergence of Lyme disease in eastern Canada.
   The primary reservoir host of the bacteria responsible for Lyme disease,
   Borrelia burgdorferi, is the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus),
   whose range is rapidly shifting north into southern Quebec. The deer
   mouse, P. maniculatus, is occurring over most Quebec province and is a
   less competent host for B. burgdorferi. Here, we compared the
   phylogeographic structure of both Peromyscus species in Quebec. Using a
   combination of multiple mitochondrial DNA markers and phylogeographic
   methods, we detected an ongoing and rapid expansion of P. leucopus,
   while P. maniculatus appears more stable. Haplotype and populations
   networks indicated that populations of P. maniculatus exhibit more
   genetic structure than P. leucopus across the study area. Furthermore,
   significant and consistent genetic divergences between populations of
   the two species on both sides of the St. Lawrence River suggest that
   distinct lineages of P. leucopus and P. maniculatus with different
   ancestral origins colonized Southern Quebec following the Last Glacial
   Maximum. The phylogeographic structure of pathogens is expected to
   mirror the structure observed in their reservoir hosts. As different
   strains of Borrelia burgdorferi may be associated with different levels
   of pathogenicity and immune responses of their hosts, our results are
   helpful at better understanding the pattern of spread of Lyme disease in
   a zone of emergence, and associated risk for human populations.}},

Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of global regulatory networks has been exploited to rewire the
   gene control programmes of the model bacterium Salmonella enterica
   serovar Typhimurium. The product is an organism with competitive fitness
   that is superior to that of the wild type but tuneable under specific
   growth conditions. The paralogous hns and stpA global regulatory genes
   are located in distinct regions of the chromosome and control hundreds
   of target genes, many of which contribute to stress resistance. The
   locations of the hns and stpA open reading frames were exchanged
   reciprocally, each acquiring the transcription control signals of the
   other. The new strain had none of the compensatory mutations normally
   associated with alterations to hns expression in Salmonella; instead it
   displayed rescheduled expression of the stress and stationary phase
   sigma factor RpoS and its regulon. Thus the expression patterns of
   global regulators can be adjusted artificially to manipulate microbial
   physiology, creating a new and resilient organism.}},

   the charge transport mechanism of

   features of its light absorption and emission in monomeric and dimeric
   forms. Energy profiles corresponding to electron and hole hopping in
   Bebq2 monomer and in three close-packed dimers that can occur in the
   solid phase are calculated. Our calculation revealed that charges and
   excitons could be either localized on individual ligands or delocalized
   over a pair of stacking ligands in dimers. Delocalized hole states serve
   as deep charge traps hindering hole transport. On the other hand, the
   electron states are localized, and hopping electron transport can take
   place with low barriers. The excited states of dimers exhibit exciton
   splitting. In some dimers, the transition dipole moment arrangement is
   unfavorable for luminescence. Therefore, our calculations explain why
   Bebq2 is an electron transporter (hole blocker) and why regular packing
   with ligand stacking in Bebq2 layers favors electron transport along the
   stacks but decreases luminescence.}},

Title = {{Frailty still matters to health and survival in centenarians: the case
   of China}},
Journal = {{BMC GERIATRICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Frailty indicates accumulated vulnerability of adverse
   health outcomes in later life. Its robustness in predicting dependent
   living, falls, comorbidity, disability, health change, mortality, and
   health care utilization at older ages is well-documented. However,
   almost no studies have ever attempted to examine its robustness in
   centenarians, mainly due to data unavailability. This study examines
   prevalence of frailty in centenarians and its predictive powers on
   subsequent mortality and health conditions.
   Methods: We use a sample of 4434 centenarians from the 2002, 2005, 2008,
   and 2011 waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey
   (CLHLS), with elders in three younger age groups 65-79, 80-89, and 90-99
   as comparisons. Frailty is measured by a cumulative deficit index (DI)
   that is constructed from 39 variables covering physical and cognitive
   function, disease conditions, psychological well-being, and other health
   dimensions. Survival analysis is conducted to examine how frailty is
   associated with subsequent mortality at an average follow-up length of
   3.7 years (2.6 years for deceased persons died in 2002-2011 and 7.6
   years for survived persons at the 2011 wave). Logistic regressions are
   applied to examine how frailty is associated with subsequent physical
   and cognitive functions, disease conditions, and self-rated health with
   an average follow-up length of 3.0 years.
   Results: The study reveals that centenarians are frailer than younger
   elders. The DI scores increase from less than 0.1 at ages 65-79 to over
   0.30 in centenarians. Women are frailer than men at all ages. However,
   there is a great variation in frailty among all age groups. We also find
   that each additional increase of 0.01 score of the DI is associated with
   1.6 \% higher mortality risk (95 \% CI: 1.014-1.018) in female
   centenarians and 1.4 \% higher mortality risk (95 \% CI: 1.010-1.018) in
   male centenarians, although these associations are weaker than those in
   other three younger age groups.
   Conclusions: Frailty still plays an important role in determining
   subsequent health outcomes and mortality in centenarians.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW C}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{Four quantities deducible from nuclear structure experiments have been
   claimed to correlate with the slope parameter L of the symmetry energy:
   neutron skin thickness, cross section of low-energy dipole (LED) mode,
   dipole polarizability alpha(D), and alpha S-D(0) (i. e., product of
   alpha(D) and symmetry energy S-0). By means of calculations in the
   Hartree-Fock plus random-phase approximation with various effective
   interactions, we compare the correlations between L and these four
   quantities. The correlation derived from different interactions and the
   correlation from a class of interactions that are identical in symmetric
   matter as well as in S-0 are simultaneously examined. These two types of
   correlation may behave differently, as exemplified in the correlation of
   aD to L. It is found that the neutron skin thickness and alpha S-D(0)
   correlate well to L, and therefore are suitable for narrowing down the
   value of L via experiments. The LED emergence and upgrowth makes the
   alpha S-D(0)-L correlation strong, although these correlations are
   disarranged when a neutron halo appears in the ground state.}},

   treatment to stage II-III non-small cell lung cancer: retrospective
   analysis}},
Journal = {{RADIATION ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Elderly patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are
   frequently treated with radiation therapy (RT) alone, due to poor
   performance status or underlying disease. We investigated the
   effectiveness of RT over 60 Gy administered alone to NSCLC patients who
   were unfit or rejecting for combination treatment.
   Methods and materials: From April 2002 to July 2010, 83 patients with
   stage II-III NSCLC, aged over 60 years, treated by RT alone with a
   curative aim were analyzed. Radiation was targeted to the primary tumor
   and clinically involved lymph nodes. A total dose of 66 Gy in 30
   fractions (2.2 Gy/fraction) was delivered once daily (5 fractions
   weekly). One month after completing RT, initial tumor responses were
   evaluated.
   Results: Median age of patients was 73 years (range, 60 - 82 years). The
   median survival time was 18.6 months (range, 2-135). The actuarial
   overall survival rates at 2 and 3 years were 39 \% and 23 \%, and
   cause-specific survival rate at 2 and 3 years were 57 \% and 47 \%,
   respectively. When primary tumor was controlled, the 2- and 3-year CSS
   were 56 \% and 45 \%, but 32 \% and 23 \% in those patients with local
   failure, respectively (P = 0.017). Additionally, the local control rate
   was associated with the initial tumor response (P = 0.01). No patient
   experienced grade 4+ toxicity.
   Conclusions: For stage II-III NSCLC patients aged over 60 years and
   unfit or rejecting for combination treatment, RT alone showed promising
   result. Long-term disease control can be expected if an early tumor
   response to radiation is achieved, which could result in improved
   overall survival rates.}},

Abstract = {{The gene encoding the neural cell adhesion molecule Cntn5 (a.k.a. NB-2)
   has been put forward as a candidate in neurodevelopmental disorders,
   like autism spectrum disorder (ASD), by recent genetic findings. Little
   is known about the expression pattern and function of the gene, and its
   functional involvement in brain development has remained elusive. So
   far, most research has focused on its early postnatal expression in the
   auditory system, where the absence of Cntn5 causes abnormal responses to
   acoustic stimuli and a decrease in fiber density. The current study
   shows that the Cntn5 gene is expressed in forebrain structures during
   embryonic development, starting at E15.5, and that it continues to be
   expressed into adulthood. Sites of strong expression included the
   thalamus, the caudate putamen (CPu) and to a lesser extent layer Va of
   the cerebral cortex. Cntn5-positive thalamic nuclei include the
   laterodorsal (LD), ventrolateral (VL) and posterior group (Po), which
   contain glutamatergic neurons. Visualization of the expression pattern
   through the Tau-LacZ fusion protein coded by an insert in the Cntn5
   gene, demonstrated that Cntn5-positive nuclei of the thalamus project to
   the cortex, based on co-localization with thalamocortical markers L1 and
   Calretinin. These results indicate that the cell adhesion functions of
   Cntn5 are exploited for circuit formation and connectivity in early
   development and for synaptic maintenance during adulthood. Subtle
   alterations in the formation of the thalamocortical circuit may
   contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as ASD. (C) 2015 IBRO.

   batteries}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{To explore anode materials with large capacities and high rate
   performances for the lithium-ion batteries of electric vehicles,
   defective Ti2Nb10O27.1 has been prepared through a facile solid-state
   reaction in argon. X-ray diffractions combined with Rietveld refinements
   indicate that Ti2Nb10O27.1 has the same crystal structure with
   stoichiometric Ti2Nb10O29 (Wadsley-Roth shear structure with A2/m space
   group) but larger lattice parameters and 6.6\% O2- vacancies (vs. all
   O2- ions). The electronic conductivity and Li+ ion diffusion coefficient
   of Ti2Nb10O27.1 are at least six orders of magnitude and similar to 2.5
   times larger than those of Ti2Nb10O29, respectively. First-principles
   calculations reveal that the significantly enhanced electronic
   conductivity is attributed to the formation of impurity bands in
   Ti2Nb10O29-x and its conductor characteristic. As a result of the
   improvements in the electronic and ionic conductivities, Ti2Nb10O27.1
   exhibits not only a large initial discharge capacity of 329 mAh g(-1)
   and charge capacity of 286 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C but also an outstanding
   rate performance and cyclability. At 5C, its charge capacity remains 180
   mAh g(-1) with large capacity retention of 91.0\% after 100 cycles,
   whereas those of Ti2Nb10O29 are only 90 mAh g(-1) and 74.7\%.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is heterogeneous and multifactorial
   neurological disorder; and the risk factors of AD still remain elusive.
   Recent studies have highlighted the role of vascular factors in
   promoting the progression of AD and have suggested that ischemic events
   increase the incidence of AD. However, the detailed mechanisms linking
   ischemic insult to the progression of AD is still largely undetermined.
   In this study, we have established a transient cerebral ischemia model
   on young 5xFAD mice and their non-transgenic (nonTg) littermates by the
   transient occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries. We have found
   that transient cerebral ischemia significantly exacerbates brain
   mitochondrial dysfunction including mitochondrial respiration deficits,
   oxidative stress as well as suppressed levels of mitochondrial fusion
   proteins including optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) and mitofusin 2 (MFN2) in
   young 5xFAD mice resulting in aggravated spatial learning and memory.
   Intriguingly, transient cerebral ischemia did not induce elevation in
   the levels of cortical or mitochondrial Amyloid beta (A beta) 1-40 or
   1-42 levels in 5xFAD mice. In addition, the glucose-and
   oxygen-deprivation- induced apoptotic neuronal death in A-treated
   neurons was significantly mitigated by mitochondria-targeted antioxidant
   mitotempo which suppresses mitochondrial superoxide levels. Therefore,
   the simplest interpretation of our results is that young 5xFAD mice with
   pre-existing AD-like mitochondrial dysfunction are more susceptible to
   the effects of transient cerebral ischemia; and ischemic events may
   exacerbate dementia and worsen the outcome of AD patients by
   exacerbating mitochondrial dysfunction.}},

   EXPRESSION OF ESTROGEN RECEPTOR ALPHA IN THE MEDIAL PREOPTIC NUCLEUS OF
   FEMALE RATS}},
Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{310}},

Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{The medial preoptic nucleus (MPN) is a sexually dimorphic cell group of
   the medial preoptic area that plays a central role in the integration of
   olfactory and hormonal stimuli that modulate sexually differentiated
   behaviors. The influence of sex steroids in these behaviors is mediated
   through activation of estrogen receptors (ERs), which are highly
   expressed in this nucleus. Little is known about the effects of
   progesterone (P) or the selective activation of each ER subtype on the
   expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) in the MPN of female
   rats. We have addressed this subject in the current investigation by
   estimating, using stereological tools, the total number of MPN neurons
   that express ERa in rats at each phase of the estrous cycle and in
   ovariectomized rats treated with estradiol benzoate (EB), P or the ER
   alpha- and estrogen receptor beta (ER beta)-specific agonists. Results
   show that the total number of ER alpha-immunoreactive neurons does not
   change over the estrous cycle, except at proestrus when the number is
   reduced. A similar effect was observed after the administration of EB,
   but not of P. Results also show that the estradiol-induced
   down-regulation of the ERa is mediated by activation of both ER
   subtypes, and that ERb activation leads to a reduction in the total
   number of ERa-immunoreactive neurons that is twice that resulting from
   ERa activation. Present data suggest that ERa activation triggers a sort
   of negative feedback mechanism in MPN neurons that reduces its own
   expression, which might be of importance for the regulation of
   estradiol-dependent physiological and behavioral responses. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Background: Cardio-embolic etiology is the most frequently predicted
   cause of cryptogenic stroke/TIA. Detection of occult paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation is crucial for selection of appropriate medication.
   Methods: Enrolment of eligible cryptogenic stroke and TIA patients began
   in 2014 and will continue until 2018. The patients undergo long-term (12
   months) ECG monitoring (implantable loop recorder) and testing for PITX2
   (chromosome 4q25) and ZFHX3 (chromosome 16q22) gene mutations. There
   will be an appropriate control group of age-and sex-matched healthy
   volunteers. To analyse the results descriptive statistics, statistical
   tests for group differences, and correlation analyses will be used.
   Discussion: In our study we are focusing on a possible correlation
   between detection of atrial fibrillation by an implantable ECG recorder,
   and PITX2 and/or ZFHX3 gene mutations in cryptogenic stroke/TIA
   patients. A correlation could lead to implementation of this genomic
   approach to cryptogenic stroke/TIA diagnostics and management. The
   results will be published in 2018.}},

Abstract = {{Polymorphic J-aggregates of monomethine cyanine dye
   3,3'-di(gamma-sulfopropyl)-5,5'-dichlorotiarnonomethinecyanine (TC) have
   been studied by fluorescence optical microscopy (FOM) and by atomic
   force microscopy (AFM). The in situ FOM observations in a solution drop
   distinguish two J-aggregate morphology classes: flexible strips and
   rigid rods. The AFM imaging of dried samples reveals a strong
   J-aggregate structural rearrangement under adsorption on a mica surface
   with the strips self-folding and the rods squashing into rectangular
   bilayers and much deeper destruction. In the present work, the following
   structural conclusions have been drawn on the basis of careful
   consideration of strip crystal habits and various structural features of
   squashed/destructed rods: (1) the tubular morphology of TC rods is
   directly proved by FOM measurements in the solution bulk; (2) the
   staircase model of molecular arrangement in strips is proposed
   explaining the characteristic similar to 44 degrees skew angle in strip
   vertices; (3) a model of tube formation by a close-packed helical
   winding of flexible monolayer strips is proposed and justified which
   explains the observed J-aggregate polymorphism and strip-to-rod
   polymorphic transformations in a wide spatiotemporal scale; (4) at a
   nanoscale, an unexpectedly complex quasi-one-dimensional organization in
   J-aggregate two-dimensional monolayers is observed by high-resolution
   AFM imaging of constituent nanostrips separated by a characteristic
   distance in the range of 6-10 nm. The obtained results indicate that the
   underlying monolayer structure is the same for all J-aggregate
   polymorphs.}},

Abstract = {{Adult stem cells may acquire mutations that modify cellular behavior,
   leading to functional declines in homeostasis or providing a competitive
   advantage resulting in premalignancy. However, the frequency, phenotypic
   impact, and mechanisms underlying spontaneous mutagenesis during aging
   are unclear. Here, we report two mechanisms of genome instability in
   adult Drosophila intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that cause phenotypic
   alterations in the aging intestine. First, we found frequent loss of
   heterozygosity arising from mitotic homologous recombination in ISCs
   that results in genetic mosaicism. Second, somatic deletion of DNA
   sequences and large structural rearrangements, resembling those
   described in cancers and congenital diseases, frequently result in gene
   inactivation. Such modifications induced somatic inactivation of the
   X-linked tumor suppressor Notch in ISCs, leading to spontaneous
   neoplasias in wild-type males. Together, our findings reveal frequent
   genomic modification in adult stem cells and show that somatic genetic
   mosaicism has important functional consequences on aging tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Density functional theory is used to study structural energetics of Pb
   vacancy cluster formation on C-60/Pb/Si(111) to explain the unusually
   fast and error-free transformations between the ``Devil's Staircase{''}
   (DS) phases on the Pb/Si(111) wetting layer at low temperature (similar
   to 110 K). The formation energies of vacancy clusters are calculated in
   C-60/Pb/Si(111) as Pb atoms are progressively ejected from the initial
   dense Pb wetting layer. Vacancy clusters larger than five Pb atoms are
   found to be stable with seven being the most stable, while vacancy
   clusters smaller than five are highly unstable, which agrees well with
   the observed ejection rate of similar to 5 Pb atoms per C-60. The high
   energy cost (similar to 0.8 eV) for the small vacancy clusters to form
   indicates convincingly that the unusually fast transformation observed
   experimentally between the DS phases, upon C-60 adsorption at low
   temperature, cannot be the result of single-atom random walk diffusion
   but of correlated multi-atom processes.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a scheme for quantum estimation by means of parametric

   parameters which maximize the quantum Fisher information (QFI). To
   achieve a large number of independent measurements we propose using an

Abstract = {{Recent sequencing of the Oriental pear (P. bretschneideri Rehd.) genome
   and the availability of the draft genome sequence of Occidental pear (P.
   communis L.), has provided a good opportunity to characterize the
   abundance, distribution, timing, and evolution of long terminal repeat
   retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) in these two important fruit plants. Here, a
   total of 7247 LTR-RTs, which can be classified into 148 families, have
   been identified in the assembled Oriental pear genome. Unlike in other
   plant genomes, approximately 90\% of these elements were found to be
   randomly distributed along the pear chromosomes. Further analysis
   revealed that the amplification timeframe of elements varies
   dramatically in different families, super-families and lineages, and the
   Copia-like elements have highest activity in the recent 0.5 million
   years (Mys). The data also showed that two genomes evolved with similar
   evolutionary rates after their split from the common ancestor similar to
   0.77-1.66 million years ago (Mya). Overall, the data provided here will
   be a valuable resource for further investigating the impact of
   transposable elements on gene structure, expression, and epigenetic

   analyse the multi-carrier energy systems under five zones of uncertainty
   in order to achieve the maximum electricity profits. For example, it is
   shown that the profit of the system is <8.5\% despite the 50\% of
   uncertainty in the state without combined heat and power (CHP) while
   system earns a profit of at least 12.8 in the state with CHP. The Monte
   Carlo simulation method has used to generate different scenarios. The
   proposed design methodology decides on which model is suitable for hub.
   It includes detailed models for transducer performance and hub using the
   mean and variance of profits and assess of their impact individually.
   The model also considers information on energy products used as per-unit
   form. Price and electricity markets have intended as in the day-ahead
   and real-time pricing with three types of tariffs during the day.}},

Abstract = {{Sediments of the Plio-Pleistocene Guadix - Baza basin have provided a
   wealth of information on the first hominin populations in Western
   Europe. To better constrain the age of the Fuente Nueva-3 archaeological
   site within the basin, and to complement previous magnetostratigraphic
   studies, two vertical boreholes were taken that provide a continuous
   record of the lower part of the sequence. Results indicate that the
   sequence is dominated by negative inclinations, but some additional
   intervals with positive inclination are also identified in the lower
   part of the sequence. A new cosmogenic nuclide burial age of 1.50 +/-
   0.31 Ma helps constrain the magnetostratigraphic record. The abundance
   of normal polarity directions at the bottom of a borehole may indicate
   proximity to the Olduvai Subchron; however, further analyses are
   required to confirm this hypothesis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Abstract = {{We used time-lapsed scanning tunneling microscopy between 43 and 50 K
   and density functional theory (DFT) to explore the basic surface
   diffusion steps of cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) molecules on the Ag(100)
   surface. We show that the CoPc molecules translate and rotate on the
   surface in the same temperature range. Both processes are associated
   with similar activation energies; however, the translation is more
   frequently observed. Our DFT calculations provide the activation
   energies for the translation of the CoPc molecule between the nearest
   hollow sites and the rotation at both the hollow and the bridge sites.
   The activation energies are only consistent with the experimental
   findings, if the surface diffusion mechanism involves a combined
   translational and rotational molecular motion. Additionally, two
   channels of motion are identified: the first provides only a channel for
   translation, while the second provides a channel for both the
   translation and the rotation. The existence of the two channels explains
   a higher rate for the translation determined in experiment.}},

Abstract = {{DNA damage is a natural hazard of life. The most common DNA lesions are
   base, sugar, and single-strand break damage resulting from oxidation,
   alkylation, deamination, and spontaneous hydrolysis. If left unrepaired,
   such lesions can become fixed in the genome as permanent mutations.
   Thus, evolution has led to the creation of several highly conserved,
   partially redundant pathways to repair or mitigate the effects of DNA
   base damage. The biochemical mechanisms of these pathways have been well
   characterized and the impact of this work was recently highlighted by
   the selection of Tomas Lindahl, Aziz Sancar and Paul Modrich as the
   recipients of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their seminal work
   in defining DNA repair pathways. However, how these repair pathways are
   regulated and interconnected is still being elucidated. This review
   focuses on the classical base excision repair and strand incision
   pathways in eukaryotes, considering both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and
   humans, and extends to some important questions and challenges facing
   the field of DNA base damage repair.}},

Abstract = {{An LC-MS/MS method is proposed for the analysis of sterigmatocystin in
   cereals and feed. The method is based on a solid-liquid extraction and a
   dilute-and-shoot approach. Accuracy and precision were established at
   the LOQ (1gkg(-1)); the mean overall recovery (n=6) was 98\%, with a
   confidence interval of 3.8\% and a CV\% of 3.7\%. Accuracy and precision
   were also assessed at three other concentration levels (2.03, 5.07 and
   10.14gkg(-1); six replicates per level). The mean overall recovery
   (n=24, LOQ included) was 99\% with a confidence interval of 0.8\% and a
   CV\% of 1.9\%. The method was then applied to 14 naturally incurred feed
   samples. Aflatoxin B-1 was present in the range 28.7-240.1 mu gkg(-1),
   while lower concentrations of sterigmatocystin were found (0.7-2.2 mu
   gkg(-1)). This method may represent a valuable choice, ensuring a high
   level of accuracy and precision, as well as high-throughput performance.
   Therefore, it meets the recent EFSA opinion recommendation in terms of
   availability of fast and sensitive methods (recommended LOQ =
   1.5gkg(-1)) in order to increase data collection to allow for the
   assessment of dietary exposure.}},

Abstract = {{The continuous flow synthesis of a range of organic solutions of
   N,N-dialkyl-N-chloramines is described using either a bespoke meso-scale
   tubular reactor with static mixers or a continuous stirred tank reactor.
   Both reactors promote the efficient mixing of a biphasic solution of
   N,N-dialkylamine in organic solvent, and aqueous sodium hypochlorite to
   achieve near quantitative conversions, in 72-100\% in situ yields, and
   useful productivities of around 0.05 mol/h with residence times from 3
   to 20 minutes. Initial calorimetric studies have been carried out to
   inform on reaction exotherms, rates and safe operation. Amines which
   partition mainly in the organic phase require longer reaction times,
   provided by the CSTR, to compensate for low mass transfer rates in the
   biphasic system. The green metrics of the reaction have been assessed
   and compared to existing procedures and have shown the continuous
   process is improved over previous procedures. The organic solutions of
   N,N-dialkyl-N-chloramines produced continuously will enable their use in
   tandem flow reactions with a range of nucleophilic substrates.}},

Abstract = {{We predict that the maximal, steady-state ion capacity N-s(lambda) of
   radio-frequency (rf) traps, loaded at a rate of lambda particles per rf
   cycle, shows universal, nonlinear, nonmonotonic behavior as a function
   of loading rate lambda. The shape of N-s(lambda), characterized by four
   dynamical regimes, is universal; i.e., it is predicted to manifest
   itself in all types of rf traps independent of the details of their
   construction and independent of particle species loaded. For lambda << 1
   (region I), as expected, N-s(lambda) increases monotonically with
   lambda. However, contrary to intuition, at intermediate lambda similar
   to 1 (region II), N-s(lambda) reaches a maximum, followed by a local
   minimum of N-s(lambda) (region III). For lambda >> 1 (region IV),
   N-s(lambda) again rises monotonically. In region IV, numerical
   simulations, analytical calculations, and experiments show N-s(lambda)
   similar to lambda(2/3). We confirm our predictions both experimentally
   with magneto-optical-trap-loaded Na+ ions stored in a hybrid ion-neutral
   trap and numerically with the help of detailed ab initio
   molecular-dynamics simulations.}},

Abstract = {{International focus on reducing onward HIV transmission emphasizes the
   need for routine HIV testing and early uptake of antiretroviral
   treatment (ART). Strategic targets have been set for 2020 to achieve the
   goal of 90\% of people infected with HIV diagnosed, 90\% of identified
   cases on treatment, and 90\% of persons on treatment virally suppressed
   (90-90-90). It is vital to understand the complexity of factors
   influencing a person's treatment decisions over time and the context
   which may enable better adherence. In this paper we present findings
   from the review of published and gray literature (2003-2013) on the
   documented factors associated with treatment initiation and adherence in
   the general adult population of Australia, Canada, and the UK. A
   framework developed by Begley, McLaws, Ross, and Gold {[}2008. Cognitive
   and behavioural correlates of non-adherence to HIV anti-retroviral
   therapy: Theoretical and practical insight for clinical psychology and
   health psychology. Clinical Psychologist, 12(1), 9-17] in Australia was
   adapted to summarize the findings. A systematic database search using
   keywords and a set of inclusion criteria yielded 17 studies
   (Australia=6; Canada=8; UK=3). In addition 11 reports were included in
   the review. We found that a person's abilities and motivations
   (intrapersonal factors, reported in 7 studies) to start and continue ART
   are influenced by a host of interconnected factors spanning relationship
   (interpersonal, 3 studies) and broader structural (extrapersonal, 15
   studies) factors that are situated within social determinants of health.
   People therefore evaluate various costs and benefits of starting and
   staying on treatment, in which biomedical concerns play an important yet
   often subsidiary role. In this review the economic barriers to care were
   found to be significant and under-reported, highlighting the persistent
   health inequities in terms of access to services. Our understanding of
   the context around people's use of ART remains poor. Qualitative social
   research within HIV-positive communities is urgently needed to capture
   people's lived experiences and may address some of this deficit in
   understanding.}},

Title = {{Tumor-selective peptide-carrier delivery of Paclitaxel increases in vivo
   activity of the drug}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Taxanes are highly effective chemotherapeutic drugs against
   proliferating cancer and an established option in the standard treatment
   of ovarian and breast cancer. However, treatment with paclitaxel is
   associated with severe side effects, including sensory axonal
   neuropathy, and its poor solubility in water complicates its
   formulation. In this paper we report the in vitro and in vivo activity
   of a new form of paclitaxel, modified for conjugation with a
   tumor-selective tetrabranched peptide carrier (NT4). NT4 selectively
   targets tumor cells by binding to membrane sulfated glycosaminoglycans
   (GAG) and to endocytic receptors, like LRP1 and LRP6, which are
   established tumor markers. Biological activity of NT4-paclitaxel was
   tested in vitro on MDA-MB 231 and SKOV-3 cell lines, representing breast
   and ovarian cancer, respectively, and in vivo in an orthotopic mouse
   model of human breast cancer. Using in vivo bioluminescence imaging, we
   found that conjugation of paclitaxel with the NT4 peptide led to
   increased therapeutic activity of the drug in vivo. NT4-paclitaxel
   induced tumor regression, whereas treatment with unconjugated paclitaxel
   only produced a reduction in tumor growth. Moreover, unlike paclitaxel,
   NT4-paclitaxel is very hydrophilic, which may improve its
   pharmacokinetic profile and allow the use of less toxic dilution
   buffers, further decreasing its general chemotherapic toxicity.}},

Abstract = {{We study the dynamical depinning following a sudden turn off of an
   optical lattice for a gas of impenetrable bosons in a tight atomic
   waveguide. We use a Bose-Fermi mapping to infer the exact quantum
   dynamical evolution. At long times, in the thermodynamic limit, we
   observe the approach to a nonequilibrium steady state, characterized by
   the absence of quasi-long-range order and a reduced visibility in the
   momentum distribution. Similar features are found in a finite-size
   system at times corresponding to half the revival time, where we find
   that the system approaches a quasisteady state with a power-law
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Expression of the neuronal K/Cl transporter KCC2 is tightly regulated
   throughout development and by both normal and pathological neuronal
   activity. Changes in KCC2 expression have often been associated with
   altered chloride homeostasis and GABA signaling. However, recent
   evidence supports a role of KCC2 in the development and function of
   glutamatergic synapses through mechanisms that remain poorly understood.
   Here we show that suppressing KCC2 expression in rat hippocampal neurons
   precludes long-term potentiation of glutamatergic synapses specifically
   by preventing activity-driven membrane delivery of AMPA receptors. This
   effect is independent of KCC2 transporter function and can be accounted
   for by increased Rac1/PAK- and LIMK-dependent cofilin phosphorylation
   and actin polymerization in dendritic spines. Our results demonstrate
   that KCC2 plays a critical role in the regulation of spine actin
   cytoskeleton and gates long-term plasticity at excitatory synapses in
   cortical neurons.}},

Abstract = {{This analysis examined the relationships between HIV-related stigma,
   depression, and anxiety in rural and urban sites. Participants were
   HIV-positive urban (n=100) and rural (n=100) adult residents of a US
   southern state, drawn from a sample for a larger international study of
   self-esteem and self-compassion. Measures included demographic and
   health information, the HIV Stigma Scale, the Center for Epidemiology
   Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and the Symptom Checklist 90 Revised
   (SCL-R-90) anxiety scale. Independent sample t-tests showed no
   significant differences between urban/rural groups on measures of
   HIV-related stigma, anxiety, or depression, except that rural
   participants reported greater disclosure concerns (t=2.11, df=196,
   p=.036). Both groups indicated high levels of depression and anxiety
   relative to published norms and clinically relevant cut-off scores.
   Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted for the HIV Stigma Scale
   including its four subscales and total stigma scores. Block 1 (control)
   contained health and demographic variables known to predict HIV-related
   stigma. Block 2 included the CES-D and the SCL-R-90, and Block 3 was
   urban/rural location. Mental health symptom scores contributed a
   significant amount to explained variance in total stigma scores (5.5\%,
   F=6.020, p<.01), personalized stigma (4.8\%, F=5.035, p<.01), negative
   self-image (9.7\%, F=12.289, p<.001), and concern with public attitudes
   (4.9\%, F=5.228, p<.01), but not disclosure concerns. Urban/rural
   location made significant additional contributions to the variance for
   total stigma (1.7\%, F=3.899, p<.05), disclosure concerns (2.6\%,
   F=5.446, p<.05), and concern with public attitudes (1.9\%, F=4.169,
   p<.05) but not personalized stigma or negative self-image. Depression
   scores consistently and significantly predicted perceived stigma total
   and subscale scores. Findings suggest that mental health symptoms and
   urban/rural location play important roles in perceived stigma, and
   treatment implications are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Rabies is an incurable neglected zoonosis with worldwide
   distribution characterized as a lethal progressive acute encephalitis
   caused by a lyssavirus. Animal venoms and secretions have long been
   studied as new bioactive molecular sources, presenting a wide spectrum
   of biological effects, including new antiviral agents. Bufotenine, for
   instance, is an alkaloid isolated from the skin secretion of the anuran
   Rhinella jimi that inhibits cellular penetration by the rabies virus.
   Antimicrobial peptides, such as ocellatin-P1 and ocellatin-F1, are
   present in the skin secretion of anurans from the genus Leptodactylus
   and provide chemical defense against predators and microorganisms.
   Methods: Skin secretion from captive Leptodactylus labyrinthicus was
   collected by mechanical stimulation, analyzed by liquid chromatography
   and mass spectrometry, and assayed for antiviral and cytotoxic
   activities. Synthetic peptides were obtained using solid phase peptide
   synthesis, purified by liquid chromatography and structurally
   characterized by mass spectrometry, and assayed in the same models.
   Cytotoxicity assays based on changes in cellular morphology were
   performed using baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells. Fixed Rabies virus
   (Pasteur Virus - PV) strain was used for virological assays based on
   rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test.
   Results: Herein, we describe a synergic effect between ocellatin-F1 and
   bufotenine. This synergism was observed when screening the L.
   labyrinthicus skin secretion for antiviral activities. The active
   fraction major component was the antimicrobial peptide ocellatin-F1.
   Nevertheless, when the pure synthetic peptide was assayed, little
   antiviral activity was detectable. In-depth analyses of the active
   fraction revealed the presence of residual alkaloids together with
   ocellatin-F1. By adding sub-effective doses (e.g. < IC50) of pure
   bufotenine to synthetic ocellatin-F1, the antiviral effect was regained.
   Moreover, a tetrapetide derived from ocellatin-F1, based on alignment
   with the virus's glycoprotein region inferred as a possible cell ligand,
   was able to maintain the synergic antiviral activity displayed by the
   full peptide.
   Conclusions: This novel antiviral synergic effect between a peptide and
   an alkaloid may present an innovative lead for the study of new
   antiviral drugs.}},

Title = {{Test of the gravitational redshift with stable clocks in eccentric

Abstract = {{The Einstein Equivalence Principle (EEP) is one of the foundations of
   the theory of General Relativity and several alternative theories of
   gravitation predict violations of the EEP. Experimental constraints on
   this fundamental principle of nature are therefore of paramount
   importance. The EEP can be split into three sub-principles: the
   universality of free fall (UFF), the local Lorentz invariance (LLI) and
   the local position invariance (LPI). In this paper we propose to use
   stable clocks in eccentric orbits to perform a test of the gravitational
   redshift, a consequence of the LPI. The best test to date was performed
   with the Gravity Probe A (GP-A) experiment in 1976 with an uncertainty
   of 1.4 x 10(-4). Our proposal considers the opportunity of using Galileo
   satellites 5 and 6 to improve on the GP-A test uncertainty. We show that
   considering realistic noise and systematic effects, and thanks to a
   highly eccentric orbit, it is possible to improve on the GP-A limit to
   an uncertainty around (3-4) x 10(-5) after one year of integration of
   Galileo 5 and 6 data.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the plastic shear response during static friction of an
   asperity protruding from a large FCC single crystal. The asperity is in
   perfectly adhesive contact with a rigid platen and is sheared by
   tangentially moving the platen. Using discrete dislocation plasticity
   simulations, we elucidate the plastic shear behaviour of single
   asperities of various size and shape, in search for the length scale
   that controls the plastic behaviour. Since plasticity can occur also in
   the crystal, identification of the length scale that controls a possible
   size-dependent plastic behaviour is far from being trivial. It is found
   that scaling down the dimensions of an asperity results in a higher
   contact shear strength. The contact area is dominant in controlling the
   plastic shear response, because it determines the size of the zone, in
   and below the asperity, where dislocation nucleation can occur. For a
   specific contact area, there is still a dependence on asperity volume
   and shape, but this is weaker than the dependence on contact area alone.}},

Abstract = {{CRISPR-Cas systems silence plasmids and viruses in prokaryotes.
   CRISPR-Cas effector complexes contain CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that include
   sequences captured from invaders and direct CRISPR-associated (Cas)
   proteins to destroy corresponding invader nucleic acids. Pyrococcus
   furiosus (Pfu) harbors three CRISPR-Cas immune systems: a Cst (Type I-G)
   system with an associated Cmr (Type III-B) module at one locus, and a
   partial Csa (Type I-A) module (lacking known invader sequence
   acquisition and crRNA processing genes) at another locus. The Pfu Cmr
   complex cleaves complementary target RNAs, and Csa systems have been
   shown to target DNA, while the mechanism by which Cst complexes silence
   invaders is unknown. In this study, we investigated the function of the
   Cst as well as Csa system in Pfu strains harboring a single CRISPR-Cas
   system. Plasmid transformation assays revealed that the Cst and Csa
   systems both function by DNA silencing and utilize similar flanking
   sequence information (PAMs) to identify invader DNA. Silencing by each
   system specifically requires its associated Cas3 nuclease. crRNAs from
   the 7 shared CRISPR loci in Pfu are processed for use by all 3 effector
   complexes, and Northern analysis revealed that individual effector
   complexes dictate the profile of mature crRNA species that is generated.}},

Pages = {{1039-1043}},

Abstract = {{Tight junctions (TJs) are the most important structure of the
   blood-brain barrier (BBB). Studies have shown that triggering of white
   matter lesions (WMLs) may be related to a BBB dysfunction, but rarely
   have studies observed the progressive changes in TJs longitudinally. In
   our present study, the ultrastructure of TJs was observed using a
   transmission electron microscope in Stroke-prone Renalvascular
   Hypertensive Rats. Western blotting was used to detect TJ-related
   proteins zonula occludens-1 and occludin. The results showed that in
   Stroke-prone Renalvascular Hypertensive Rats, the severity of WMLs
   increased gradually. TJs was destroyed gradually 8 weeks after
   hypertension. The levels of zonula occludens-1 and occludin also
   decreased gradually. These data suggested that long-term hypertension
   may contribute toward the gradual disruption of TJs of BBB and induce
   WMLs in chronic hypertensive rats. Copyright (C) 2015 Wolters Kluwer

Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2694-2714}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{As is the case of many studies, the data collected are limited and an
   exact value is recorded only if it falls within an interval range.
   Hence, the responses can be either left, interval or right censored.
   Linear (and nonlinear) regression models are routinely used to analyze
   these types of data and are based on normality assumptions for the
   errors terms. However, those analyzes might not provide robust inference
   when the normality assumptions are questionable. In this article, we
   develop a Bayesian framework for censored linear regression models by
   replacing the Gaussian assumptions for the random errors with scale
   mixtures of normal (SMN) distributions. The SMN is an attractive class
   of symmetric heavy-tailed densities that includes the normal, Student-t,
   Pearson type VII, slash and the contaminated normal distributions, as
   special cases. Using a Bayesian paradigm, an efficient Markov chain
   Monte Carlo algorithm is introduced to carry out posterior inference. A
   new hierarchical prior distribution is suggested for the degrees of
   freedom parameter in the Student-t distribution. The likelihood function
   is utilized to compute not only some Bayesian model selection measures
   but also to develop Bayesian case-deletion influence diagnostics based
   on the q-divergence measure. The proposed Bayesian methods are
   implemented in the R package BayesCR. The newly developed procedures are
   illustrated with applications using real and simulated data.}},

Title = {{Detection of different South American hantaviruses}},
Journal = {{VIRUS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{210}},
Pages = {{106-113}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Hantaviruses are the etiologic agents of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal
   Syndrome (HFRS) in Old World, and Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome
   (HPS)/Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS), in the New World.
   Serological methods are the most common approach used for laboratory
   diagnosis of HCPS, however theses methods do not allow the
   characterization of viral genotypes. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
   has been extensively used for diagnosis of viral infections, including
   those caused by hantaviruses, enabling detection of few target sequence
   copies in the sample. However, most studies proposed methods of PCR with
   species-specific primers. This study developed a simple and reliable
   diagnostic system by RT-PCR for different hantavirus detection. Using
   new primers set, we evaluated human and rodent hantavirus positive
   samples of various regions from Brazil. Besides, we performed
   computational analyzes to evaluate the detection of other South American
   hantaviruses. The diagnostic system by PCR proved to be a sensible and
   simple assay, allowing amplification of Juquitiba virus, Araraquara
   virus, Laguna Negra virus, Rio Mamore virus and Jabora virus, beyond of
   the possibility of the detecting Andes, Anajatuba, Bermejo, Choclo, Cano
   Delgadito, Lechiguanas, Maciel, Oran, Pergamino and Rio Mearim viruses.
   The primers sets designed in this study can detect hantaviruses from
   almost all known genetics lineages in Brazil and from others South
   America countries and also increases the possibility to detect new
   hantaviruses. These primers could easily be used both in diagnosis of
   suspected hantavirus infections in humans and also in studies with
   animals reservoirs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   separated according to their size by a separation technique consisted of
   an iron obstacle column and CoFe2O4 magnetic nanofluid, which produced
   magnetophoretic forces. The biomolecules could be separated from their
   mixture on the basis of magnetophoretic forces. The larger particles
   attract more force and are captured by the column while smaller ones

Abstract = {{Many lactic acid bacteria synthesize extracellular polysaccharides
   (exopolysaccharides, EPSs) with a large variation in structure and
   potential functional properties. Although EPS production can produce
   detrimental effects in alcoholic beverages, these polymers play an
   important role in the rheological behavior and texture of fermented
   products. In this work, EPS production by two Lactobacillus suebicus
   strains, which were isolated from ropy ciders, was examined in a
   semidefined medium. The existence of priming glycosyltransferase
   encoding genes was detected by PCR. In addition, the preliminary
   characterization of the polymers was undertaken. Molecular masses were
   determined by size exclusion chromatography revealing the presence of
   two peaks, corresponding to polymers of high- and low-molecular-weight
   in all fractions. The composition of the EPS fractions was analyzed by
   gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after acid hydrolysis, revealing
   that they contained glucose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine and
   phosphate, although in different ratios, suggesting that a mixture of
   polysaccharides is being synthesized. We also examined the influence of
   the sugar source (glucose, ribose, xylose, or arabinose) and pH
   conditions on growth and EPS production. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Influence of Habitat and Intrinsic Characteristics on Survival of
   Neonatal Pronghorn}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Increased understanding of the influence of habitat (e.g., composition,
   patch size) and intrinsic (e.g., age, birth mass) factors on survival of
   neonatal pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) is a prerequisite to
   successful management programs, particularly as they relate to
   population dynamics and the role of population models in adaptive
   species management. Nevertheless, few studies have presented empirical
   data quantifying the influence of habitat variables on survival of
   neonatal pronghorn. During 2002-2005, we captured and radiocollared 116
   neonates across two sites in western South Dakota. We documented 31
   deaths during our study, of which coyote (Canis latrans) predation (n =
   15) was the leading cause of mortality. We used known fate analysis in
   Program MARK to investigate the influence of intrinsic and habitat
   variables on neonatal survival. We generated a priori models that we
   grouped into habitat and intrinsic effects. The highest-ranking model
   indicated that neonate mortality was best explained by site, percent
   grassland, and open water habitat; 90-day survival (0.80; 90\% CI =
   0.71-0.88) declined 23\% when grassland and water increased from 80.1 to
   92.3\% and 0.36 to 0.40\%, respectively, across 50\% natal home ranges.
   Further, our results indicated that grassland patch size and shrub
   density were important predictors of neonate survival; neonate survival
   declined 17\% when shrub density declined from 5.0 to 2.5 patches per
   100 ha. Excluding the site covariates, intrinsic factors (i. e., sex,
   age, birth mass, year, parturition date) were not important predictors
   of survival of neonatal pronghorns. Further, neonatal survival may
   depend on available land cover and interspersion of habitats. We have
   demonstrated that maintaining minimum and maximum thresholds for habitat
   factors (e. g., percentages of grassland and open water patches, density
   of shrub patches) throughout natal home ranges will in turn, ensure
   relatively high (> 0.50) neonatal survival rates, especially as they
   relate to coyote predation. Thus, landscape level variables
   (particularly percentages of open water, grassland habitats, and shrub
   density) should be incorporated into the development or implementation
   of pronghorn management plans across sagebrush steppe communities of the
   western Dakotas, and potentially elsewhere within the geographic range
   of pronghorn.}},

Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{The current study tested competing predictions regarding the effect of
   mortality salience on delay discounting. One prediction, based on
   evolutionary considerations, was that reminders of death increase the
   value of the present. Another prediction, based in part on construal
   level theory, was that reminders of death increase the value of the
   future. One-hundred eighteen participants thought about personal
   mortality or a control topic and then completed an inter-temporal choice
   task pitting the chance to gain \$50 now against increasingly attractive
   rewards three months later. Consistent with the hypothesis inspired by
   construal theory, participants in the mortality salience condition
   traded \$50 now for \$66.67 in three months, whereas participants in the
   dental pain salience condition required \$72.84 in three months in lieu
   of \$50 now. Thus, participants in the mortality salience condition
   discounted future monetary gains less than other participants,
   suggesting that thoughts of death may increase the subjective value of
   the future.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1465-1470}},

Abstract = {{Modern foundries increasingly use chemically bonded no-bake sand cores
   and molds because they provide ease of molding, good surface finish, and
   collapsibility. One of the most popular binder systems is alkyd oil
   urethane no-bake system comprising three parts: alkyd resin, catalyst,
   and crosslinking agent. Their amounts and ratios can influence mold
   shrinkage, and thereby dimensional quality of the resulting casting.
   With rising emphasis on net-shape casting, there is a need to optimize
   the binder composition to minimize dimensional errors, while achieving
   the desired bench life, stripping time and hardness. This work
   investigates the effect of binder composition on the dimensions of
   chemically bonded sand cores with respect to time. The maximum shrinkage
   of 0.15\% over length was observed when resin content was 2.4\% by
   weight of sand. The rate of shrinkage increased with the amount of
   catalyst. Measurement of core hardness and reduction in weight, followed
   by SEM studies, provided a better understanding of the underlying
   phenomena, especially formation of resin bridges between compacted sand
   particles and evaporation of solvent. This work is expected to aid in
   selection of the most appropriate binder composition for a given set of
   molding process constraints and cast product requirements.}},

Title = {{Frailty predicts short-term incidence of future falls among British
   community-dwelling older people: a prospective cohort study nested
   within a randomised controlled trial}},
Journal = {{BMC GERIATRICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although population-based studies have shown frailty
   predicted future falls, their follow-up periods were one year or longer
   and short-term fall risks associated with frailty are unknown.
   Methods: A prospective cohort study nested within a randomised
   controlled trial was conducted to examine associations between frailty
   and short term incident future falls among community dwelling older
   people. Two hundred forty eight community-dwelling people > =65 years
   without history of > =three falls and allocated to a usual care arm of
   exercise intervention trial were prospectively monitored for falls over
   24 weeks. Frailty index (FI) was constructed from 40 deficits at
   baseline. The future fall risks according to frailty status was examined
   using logistic regression models.
   Results: Of 248 participants, 46 were classified as frail and 57 had one
   or more falls during follow-up. Both each 0.01 increase in FI and
   frailty defined as FI > =0.25 were significantly associated with higher
   risks of future falls in multivariate logistic regression models
   adjusted for age, gender and history of two falls in the previous year
   (odds ratio (OR) = 1.05, 95 \% confidence interval (95 \% CI) =
   1.02-1.07, p < 0.001; OR = 3.04, 95 \% CI = 1.53-6.02, p = 0.001,
   respectively). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis
   showed FI predicted future falls with fair accuracy with area under ROC
   curve of 0.62 (95 \% CI = 0.53-0.71, p < 0.01).
   Conclusions: Frailty was a significant and independent predictor of
   short-term future falls among community-dwelling older people who had
   volunteered for a physical activity study. It is important for
   healthcare practitioners to recognise frailty as a risk factor of

Abstract = {{Based on the idea that time-effect deformation can be regarded as a
   state vector indicating the characteristics of concrete dams, a
   hydrostatic seasonal state (HSS) model is proposed for improving the
   accuracy of the data analysis of concrete dams. According to the theory
   of non-stationary time series, the state equation of the HSS model is
   represented for objectively extracting the time-effect deformation from
   monitoring data of total deformation and to interpret its evolution
   accurately. In this study, the HSS model is applied to an arch dam case,
   and it is estimated by using the expectation-maximisation algorithm. The
   results illustrate that the HSS model can efficiently estimate the
   time-effect deformation from monitoring data of total deformation.
   Compared with the hydrostatic seasonal time model, the proposed HSS
   model shows an improvement in fitting precision and prediction ability.}},

Abstract = {{Revenue management (RM), a common practice for the hotel industry, has
   been found to be very effective in generating extra revenue. However,
   prior studies have shown that the implementation of RM may potentially
   be in conflict with customer loyalty, the basis for long-term
   profitability. With a view to alleviating the impact of RM on customer
   loyalty, this study investigates the relationship between customer
   loyalty and RM knowledge level, and examines the moderating effect of
   the fairness perception for pricing based on a survey and the related
   statistical analyses. The findings suggest that hotel operators should
   facilitate the RM knowledge and the fairness perception of their
   customers so as to result in a potential win-win situation, in which
   profit-seeking hotels increase their revenue through better resource
   utilization, and heterogeneous customers benefit from more diversified
   services.}},

Abstract = {{Aiming to unveil the key structures and processing parameters of
   precursor film for the micropore formation, the structure and mechanical
   behavior of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) casting films prepared at
   different processing conditions are systematically studied with small
   and wide angle X-ray scattering measurements as well as tensile
   analysis. Draw ratio and cast roll temperature are found to be the key
   processing parameters, which determine orientation of lamellar stack and
   thickness of lamellar as well as amorphous layers, respectively.
   Furthermore, these two important structural parameters, the orientation
   of lamellar stack and the thickness of amorphous layer, show positive
   correlations with the formation of micropores. Considering coupling
   effects of tight folds and lamellar-fibrillar or lamellar-amorphous
   transformation, a semi-quantitative deformation model for the micropore
   formation is proposed to correlate surface porosity and elastic recovery
   rate with structural parameters of precursor film. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is a prominent framework that
   addresses the challenge of organisations to understand and promote the
   factors that lead to acceptance of new technologies. Nevertheless, our
   understanding of one of the model's key variables - social influence -
   remains limited. Drawing upon earlier studies that address the role of
   referent individuals to technology acceptance, this paper introduces the
   notion of coalition' as a social group that can affect the opinion of
   other members within an organisation. Our empirical study centres on an
   organisation that has recently decided to introduce Big Data into its
   formal operations. Through a unique empirical approach that analyses
   sentiments expressed by individuals about this technology on the
   organisation's online forum, we demonstrate the emergence of a central
   referent, and in turn the dynamics of a coalition that builds around
   this referent as the attitudes of individuals converge upon the Big Data
   issue. Our paper contributes to existing TAM frameworks by elaborating
   the social influence variable and providing a dynamic lens to the
   technology acceptance process. We concurrently offer a methodological
   tool for organisations to understand social dynamics that form about a
   newly introduced technology and accelerate its acceptance by employees.}},

Abstract = {{Bioelectronics, which can provide electrical impulses to precisely
   modulate the body's neural circuits, spark great interests of industry
   and academia. Yet the technologies to power and manipulate these
   devices, such as wireless powering and remote manipulation, remain
   challenging. Here, by investigating the pyroelectric performances of
   poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) and its remote-manipulation ability
   under near-infrared-ray (nIR) irradiation, a flexible battery-less
   implantable device is proposed, constructed by laminated
   graphene-PVDF-graphene sandwiches, which can be wirelessly powered and
   supply regulatable electrical pulses for nerve stimulation by nIR
   irradiation. The flexible and compact device (20 mm x 20 mm in area, 0.2
   mm in thickness) can generate electrical pulses with controllable
   amplitude and width, and shows an excellent ability to stimulate nerves,
   i.e., sciatic nerve of a frog and a rat heart, by remote control. The
   flexible and remote-manipulative battery-less device should find uses in
   the design and fabrication of bioelectronics-related applications.}},

Abstract = {{The surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is widely used as a
   detergent for both domestic and industrial applications. It forms a
   self-assembled monolayer on the surface of water. We report a
   microscopic model for the interaction between the surfactant and water
   and between water molecules at the interface, revealed using static and
   time-resolved two-dimensional sum frequency generation spectroscopy. Two
   distinct subensembles of water in the presence of this negatively
   charged SDS surfactant have been identified: those close to the SDS
   headgroup having fairly isolated O-H groups, i.e., localized O-H stretch
   vibrations, and those whose O-H stretch vibrations are delocalized,
   i.e., shared between multiple O-H bonds. The two subensembles are
   coupled, with subpicosecond energy transfer occurring between them. This
   is markedly different from O-H bonds at the air water interface, which
   are less heterogeneous, and indicates that the water molecules that
   interact with the surfactant headgroups have hydrogen-bonding properties
   different from those of water molecules interacting with the other water
   molecules.}},

Abstract = {{The fast-paced, iterative, vehicle design environment demands efficiency
   when simulating suspension loads. Towards that end, a computationally
   efficient, linear, planar, quasi-static tyre model is developed in this
   work that accurately predicts a tyre's lower frequency, reasonably large
   amplitude, nonlinear stiffness relationship. The axisymmetric,
   circumferentially isotropic, stiffness equation is discretised into
   segments, then parameterised by a single stiffness parameter and two
   shape parameters. The tyre's deformed shape is independent of the
   overall tyre stiffness and the forces acting on the tyre. Constraint
   modes capture enveloping and bridging properties and a recursive method
   yields the set of active constraints at the tyre-road interface. The
   nonlinear stiffness of a tyre is captured by enforcing unidirectional
   geometric boundary conditions. The model parameters are identified
   semi-empirically; simulated cleat test loads match experiments within
   7\% including nonlinear stiffness when simulating a flat plate test and
   a discontinuous stiffness when simulating a cleat test.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{934-945}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Double-strand breaks (DSB) repair and apoptosis are assumed to
   be key factors in the determination of individual variability in
   response to radiation treatment. In this study we investigated tumor
   protein p53 (TP53) binding protein 1 (53BP1) and phosphorylated histone
   2A family member X (H2AX) foci, H2AX pan-staining and late
   apoptosis/necrosis (LAN) in lymphocytes from breast cancer (BC) patients
   undergoing radiotherapy.Materials and methods: BC patients were
   subjected to local radiotherapy with fractionated doses using linear
   accelerator. Adverse reactions of patients were classified according to
   the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)/European Organization for
   Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) criteria. Blood samples were
   collected before treatment, at various time-points during and after
   radiotherapy. Residual 53BP1 and H2AX foci, H2AX pan-staining were
   analyzed in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) using the Metafer system
   and confocal laser scanning microscopy. LAN cells were counted by the
   trypan blue (TB) exclusion assay. Statistical analysis was performed
   using Mann-Whitney test, Spearman rank correlation test and analysis of
   covariance (ANCOVA).Results: No statistically significant changes were
   observed in the levels of H2AX foci during radiotherapy. In contrast,
   radiation-induced residual 53BP1 were detected already after the first
   fraction. Increased individual variability in the 53BP1 focus formation
   was observed during treatment. The background level of DNA repair foci
   and its individual variability in response to radiotherapy decreased
   after the end of radiotherapy indicating successful removal of
   DNA-damaging effects. A correlation between stage of cancer and 53BP1
   focus formation was established which suggests the prognostic value of
   this test. We show that the fraction of LAN cells negatively correlates
   with the level of 53BP1 and positively correlates with individual
   radiosensitivity. Only weak correlation was observed between H2AX
   pan-staining and LAN cells. Due to large interindividual variability,
   both in vivo assays, LAN and focus formation, have shown relatively low
   predictive power at the individual level.Conclusions: It is likely that
   radiosensitive patients have less efficient mechanisms of elimination of
   apoptotic cells with DNA damage resulting in accumulation of LAN cells
   and facilitating adverse reactions. Our data suggested that the grade of
   adverse reaction may positively correlate with LAN cells in PBL before
   and during radiotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{An ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
   (UHPLC-MS/MS) multi-mycotoxin analytical method was developed to
   simultaneously identify and quantify 20 mycotoxins in grass silages,
   inclusive of mycotoxins that are currently regulated in European Union
   feeds. Extraction of mycotoxins from dried grass silages was performed
   using of a modified QuEChERS extraction employing an acidified aqueous
   extraction (0.1N HCl) with no further clean-up. Following
   chromatographic separation, analytes were detected using a fast
   polarity-switching MS/MS method that allowed both positive and negative
   ions to be analysed from a single injection, thus the reducing time and
   cost of analysis. The limits of detection and quantification ranged
   between 3 mu gkg(-1) DM (aflatoxin B-1, beauvericin and enniatin A and
   A(1)) and 200 mu gkg(-1) DM (deoxynivalenol), and between 10 mu gkg(-1)
   DM (aflatoxin B-1, beauvericin and enniatin A(1)) and 500 mu gkg(-1) DM
   (deoxynivalenol), respectively. Inter-assay accuracy and precision
   ranged between 90\% and 107\% and between 3.9\% and 15.0\% CV,

   application to a range of incurred samples in an inter-laboratory study.}},

Abstract = {{Metric learning constitutes a well-investigated field for vectorial data
   with successful applications, e.g. in computer vision, information
   retrieval, or bioinformatics. One particularly promising approach is
   offered by low-rank metric adaptation integrated into modern variants of
   learning vector quantization (LVQ). This technique is scalable with
   respect to both data dimensionality and the number of data points, and
   it can be accompanied by strong guarantees of learning theory. Recent
   extensions of LVQ to general (dis-) similarity data have paved the way
   towards LVQ classifiers for non-vectorial, possibly discrete, structured
   objects such as sequences, which are addressed by classical alignment in
   bioinformatics applications. In this context, the choice of metric
   parameters plays a crucial role for the result, just as it does in the
   vectorial setting. In this contribution, we propose a metric learning
   scheme which allows for an autonomous learning of parameters (such as
   the underlying scoring matrix in sequence alignments) according to a
   given discriminative task in relational LVQ. Besides facilitating the
   often crucial and problematic choice of the scoring parameters in
   applications, this extension offers an increased interpretability of the
   results by pointing out structural invariances for the given task. (C)

Abstract = {{Traditional scheduling methods can only arrange the operations on
   corresponding machines with appropriate sequences under pre-defined
   environments. This means that traditional scheduling methods require
   that all parameters to be determined before scheduling. However, real
   manufacturing systems often encounter many uncertain events. These will
   change the status of manufacturing systems. These may cause the original
   schedule to no longer be optimal or even to be infeasible. Traditional
   scheduling methods, however, cannot cope with these cases. New
   scheduling methods are needed. Among these new methods, one method
   reverse scheduling' has attracted more and more attentions. This paper
   focuses on the single-machine reverse scheduling problem and designs a
   modified genetic algorithm with a local search (MLGA) to solve it. To
   improve the performance of MLGA, efficient encoding, offspring update
   mechanism and a local search have been employed and developed. To verify
   the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed MLGA, 27 instances
   have been conducted and results have been compared with existing
   methods. The results show that the MLGA has achieved satisfactory
   improvement. This approach also has been applied to solve a real-world
   scheduling problem from one shipbuilding industry. The results show that
   the MLGA can bring some benefits.}},

Title = {{Evaluating the economic implications of non-adherence and

   once-daily tacrolimus in the UK}},

Abstract = {{Background and aims:While short-term kidney graft survival has gradually
   improved over time, improvements in long-term graft survival have been
   more modest. One key clinical factor limiting improved longer-term
   outcomes is antibody-mediated rejection (AbMR), the incidence of which
   appears to be higher in patients who are non-adherent to
   immunosuppressants. Recent data show that adherence can be improved by
   reducing pill burden. The aim of the present study was to model the
   incidence and economic consequences of graft loss and AbMR in patients
   taking once- vs twice-daily tacrolimus in the UK.Methods:A combined
   decision tree and Markov model was developed to estimate the incidence
   of graft failure, AbMR and mortality in renal transplant recipients
   taking once- vs twice-daily tacrolimus. Underlying rates of graft
   failure and mortality were derived from UK-specific sources. Proportions
   of patients adherent to once- vs twice-daily tacrolimus were taken from
   a recent randomized clinical trial and relative risks of graft failure
   and AbMR were taken from a prospective, multi-center analysis of 315
   patients. Cost data were taken from the British National Formulary and
   National Health Service reference costs and reported in 2014 pounds
   sterling.Results:Modeling results showed that improved adherence would
   be associated with reduced incidence of AbMR and graft failure in renal
   transplant recipients. Based on improvements in adherence resulting from
   switching from twice-daily to once-daily tacrolimus, the modeling
   analysis projected cost savings of GBP 4862 per patient over 5 years
   with Advagraf relative to Prograf, on absolute costs of GBP 40,974 and
   GBP 45,836, respectively.Conclusions:Using Advagraf in place of Prograf
   in renal transplant recipients was predicted to be associated with lower
   pharmacy, dialysis and AbMR treatment costs, with the reduction in AbMR
   and dialysis costs being driven by improved adherence to the Advagraf
   regimen and consequent reductions in graft failure and onset of AbMR.}},

   outbreaks between 2013 and 2014}},
Journal = {{SPRINGERPLUS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Since late 2013, outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV)
   have reemerged in Japan. In the present study, we observed a high
   detection rate of PEDV, with 72.5 \% (148/204) of diarrhea samples
   (suckling, weaned, and sows) and 88.5 \% (77/87) of farms experiencing
   acute diarrhea found to be positive for PEDV by reverse transcription
   PCR. Sequencing and phylogenic analyses of the partial spike gene and
   ORF3 of PEDV demonstrated that all prevailing Japanese PEDV isolates
   belonged to novel genotypes that differed from previously reported
   strains and the two PEDV vaccine strains currently being used in Japan.
   Sequence and phylogenetic analysis revealed prevailing PEDV isolates in
   Japan had the greatest genetic similarity to US isolates and were not
   vaccine-related. Unlike vaccine strains, all prevailing field PEDV
   isolates in Japan were found to have a number of amino acid differences
   in the neutralizing epitope domain, COE, which may affect antigenicity
   and vaccine efficacy. The present study indicates recent PEDV isolates
   may have been introduced into Japan from overseas and highlights the
   urgent requirement of novel vaccines for controlling PEDV outbreaks in
   Japan.}},

   created for this study (rescaled brightness temperature, Plastic Surface
   Index and Normalized Difference Sandy Index). The sampling time related
   to the preliminary collection of spectral information on plastic
   surfaces was reduced using information gathered through the Quality
   Assessment and Cloud Quality bands. The overall accuracies observed were
   on average higher than 80\%,and the low cost of the open data set used,
   lacking ancillary data, demonstrated the reliability of the proposed
   method, proving its suitability for environmental and agricultural
   monitoring over large areas.}},

Abstract = {{Euglena gracilis has the ability to accumulate a storage polysaccharide,
   a -1,3-glucan known as paramylon, under aerobic conditions. Under
   anaerobic conditions, E. gracilis cells degrade paramylon and synthesize
   wax esters. Cytosolic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) appears to be
   a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis and position branch point of carbon
   partitioning between paramylon and wax ester biosynthesis. We herein
   identified and characterized cytosolic FBPase from E. gracilis. The K-m
   and V-max values of EgFBPaseIII were 16.5 +/- 1.6M and 30.4 +/-
   7.2molmin(-1)mgprotein(-1), respectively. The activity of EgFBPaseIII
   was not regulated by AMP or reversible redox modulation. No significant
   differences were observed in the production of paramylon in transiently
   suppressed EgFBPaseIII gene expression cells by RNAi (KD-EgFBPaseIII);
   nevertheless, FBPase activity was markedly decreased in KD-EgFBPaseIII
   cells. On the other hand, the growth of KD-EgFBPaseIII cells was
   slightly higher than that of control cells.}},

Abstract = {{We herein report on the formation of BeD2 nanocrystalline domes on the
   surface of a beryllium sample exposed to energetic deuterium ions. A
   polycrystalline beryllium sample was exposed to D ions at 2 keV/atom
   leading to laterally averaged deuterium areal densities up to 3.5 10(17)
   D cm(-2), and studied using nuclear reaction analysis, Raman microscopy,
   atomic force microscopy, optical microscopy and quantum calculations.
   Incorporating D in beryllium generates a tensile stress that reaches a
   plateau at approximate to 1.5 10(17) D cm(-2). For values higher than
   2.0 10(17) cm(-2), we observed the growth of approximate to 90 nm high
   dendrites, covering up to 10\% of the surface in some zones of the
   sample when the deuterium concentration was 3 x 10(17) D cm(-2). These
   dendrites are composed of crystalline BeD2, as evidenced by Raman
   microscopy and quantum calculations. They are candidates to explain low
   temperature thermal desorption spectroscopy peaks observed when
   bombarding Be samples with D ions with fluencies higher than 1.2 10(17)

   This approach combines the selection of a phage library displaying

   With this strategy, we not only confirmed known RNA-binding proteins

Abstract = {{The rapidly evolving science of epigenetics is transforming our
   understanding of the nervous system in health and disease and holds
   great promise for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic
   approaches targeting neurological diseases. Increasing evidence suggests
   that epigenetic factors and mechanisms serve as important mediators of
   the pathogenic processes that lead to irrevocable neural injury and of
   countervailing homeostatic and regenerative responses. Epigenetics is,
   therefore, of considerable translational significance to the field of
   neuroprotection. In this brief review, we provide an overview of
   epigenetic mechanisms and highlight the emerging roles played by
   epigenetic processes in neural cell dysfunction and death and in
   resultant neuroprotective responses. This article is part of a Special

   Phylogenetic and Trait Diversity}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{The `edge of existence' (EDGE) prioritisation scheme is a new approach
   to rank species for conservation attention that aims to identify species
   that are both isolated on the tree of life and at imminent risk of
   extinction as defined by the World Conservation Union (IUCN). The
   self-stated benefit of the EDGE system is that it effectively captures
   unusual `unique' species, and doing so will preserve the total
   evolutionary history of a group into the future. Given the EDGE metric
   was not designed to capture total evolutionary history, we tested this
   claim. Our analyses show that the total evolutionary history of mammals
   preserved is indeed much higher if EDGE species are protected than if
   at-risk species are chosen randomly. More of the total tree is also
   protected by EDGE species than if solely threat status or solely
   evolutionary distinctiveness were used for prioritisation. When
   considering how much trait diversity is captured by IUCN and EDGE
   prioritisation rankings, interestingly, preserving the highest-ranked
   EDGE species, or indeed just the most threatened species, captures more
   total trait diversity compared to sets of randomly-selected at-risk
   species. These results suggest that, as advertised, EDGE mammal species
   contribute evolutionary history to the evolutionary tree of mammals
   non-randomly, and EDGE-style rankings among endangered species can also
   capture important trait diversity. If this pattern holds for other
   groups, the EDGE prioritisation scheme has greater potential to be an
   efficient method to allocate scarce conservation effort.}},

Abstract = {{Adsorption of anthracene on silver is investigated based on the density
   functional theory and the surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).
   Variations in bond and dihedral angles of the optimised geometry of
   anthracene indicate distortions in the hexagonal structure of the ring
   nearer to the silver cluster and deviations in the co-planarity of
   carbon atoms. Natural bond orbital analysis confirms intramolecular
   charge transfers from (C-C) to {*}(C-C) and (C-C) to sigma{*}(Ag-Ag)
   orbitals. Higher polarisation resulting from charge transfers on
   adsorption accounts for Raman enhancements of selective vibrational
   modes and band shifts. Surface plasmon resonance peak of silver
   nanoparticles after the adsorption of anthracene observed around 399 nm
   compares well with the theoretically simulated UV-vis spectrum derived
   using the time-dependent density functional theory. Theoretical and
   experimental SERS correlate well, confirming the process of adsorption,
   the tilted orientation of anthracene on the silver surface and the
   adsorption mechanism reported. Localisation of the electron density
   together with a reduced band gap after the adsorption on silver suggests
   its utility in the design of electro-active organic molecular devices.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate effects of food processing on PBDE
   levels, in particular influence of heat treatment on degradation of
   PBDEs, including possible formation of chlorinated diphenyl ethers or
   brominated dioxins/furans as degradation products. It was shown that
   PBDEs heated in the presence of chlorine (from either organic or
   inorganic sources) formed mixed chlorinated/brominated diphenyl ethers.
   However, no PCDEs were formed in the presence of lipids. Lipid medium
   increased stability of PBDEs exposed to UV irradiation. Profile of
   congeners formed in result of the debromination reaction was
   significantly different than profiles observed by some other authors in
   aliphatic organic solvents. Grilling processes increased concentrations
   (calculated on the fresh product basis) of the studied compounds by
   4-8/22-34\% for electric/coal grill, respectively. Depending on the
   congener and on the applied heat treatment, PBDE mass in pork meat after
   grilling dropped by 26-53\%. No detectable quantities of either
   brominated dioxins or furans were formed during thermal processing of
   food containing typical levels of PBDEs.}},

   modifies the landscape of the host cell nucleus}},
Journal = {{VIRUS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{210}},
Pages = {{1-7}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Although African swine fever virus (ASFV) replicates in viral
   cytoplasmic factories, the presence of viral DNA within the host cell
   nucleus has been previously reported to be essential for productive
   infection. Herein, we described, for the first time, the intranuclear
   distribution patterns of viral DNA replication events, preceding those
   that occur in the cytoplasmic compartment. Using BrdU pulse-labelling
   experiments, newly synthesized ASFV genomes were exclusively detected
   inside the host cell nucleus at the early phase of infection, both in
   swine monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and Vero cells. From 8 hpi
   onwards, BrdU labelling was only observed in ASFV cytoplasmic factories.
   Our results also show that ASFV specifically activates the Ataxia
   Telangiectasia Mutated Rad-3 related (ATR) pathway in ASFV-infected
   swine MDMs from the early phase of infection, most probably because ASFV
   genome is recognized as foreign DNA. Morphological changes of
   promyelocytic leukaemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), nuclear speckles and
   Cajal bodies were also found in ASFV-infected swine MDMs, strongly
   suggesting the viral modulation of cellular antiviral responses and
   cellular transcription, respectively. As described for other viral
   infections, the nuclear reorganization that takes place during ASFV
   infection may also provide an environment that favours its intranuclear
   replication events.
   Altogether, our results contribute for a better understanding of ASFV
   replication strategies, starting with an essential intranuclear DNA
   replication phase which induces host nucleus changes towards a
   successful viral infection. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   fistula (Golden shower) have been reported for applications in
   environmental pollution control using natural, renewable biomass as
   precursor. The potential of different forms of the derived adsorbents
   produced by thermal and chemical activation was examined for two
   representative cases, desulfurization of transportation fuels and
   wastewater treatment. The adsorbents were characterized by FTIR, XRD,
   XPS, and SEM techniques that indicate specific characteristics useful as
   an adsorbent. A successful application in the real industrial wastewater
   treatment and comparison with well recognized commercial adsorbents
   clearly highlights the utility of the developed newer adsorbents in

   potential, streaming potential pH titration, DLS, AFM, in-situ AFM, TEM
   and cryo-TEM). Especially, the sugar-decorated coreeshell architectures
   mainly provide isolated macromolecules over a broad pH range.
   Furthermore, the anionic coreeshell architectures are suited to interact
   with cationic molecules. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In China, municipal solid waste (MSW) is primarily treated by
   landfilling. Landfill gas (LFG) collection effectively reduces methane
   emission from MSW landfills. An accurate system of LFG collection is
   important in landfill planning, design, and operation. However, China
   has not developed such systems. In this study, the efficiency of methane
   collection is calculated in three Chinese landfills with different
   collection systems (A: vertical wells for MSW before 2010; combined
   horizontal trenches and under-membrane pipes for MSW from 2011 onwards;
   B: combined horizontal trenches and vertical wells; C: vertical wells
   only). This efficiency was computed by dividing the quantity of methane
   obtained from landfill operation records by the quantity estimated based
   on the LandGEM model. Results show that the collection efficiencies of
   landfills with vertical wells and/or horizontal pipes ranged from 8.3\%
   to 27.9\%, whereas those of a system equipped with geomembrane reached
   65.3\%. The poor performance of the landfills was attributed to the open
   burning of early-stage LFG, LFG release from cracks in high-density
   polyethylene covers, and high levels of leachate within a landfill site.
   Therefore, this study proposes an integrated LFG collection system that
   can remove leachate and collect gas from landfills that accept waste
   with high moisture content.}},

Abstract = {{Mumps viruses show diverse cytopathic effects (CPEs) of infected cells
   and viral plaque formation (no CPE or no plaque formation in some cases)
   depending on the viral strain, highlighting the difficulty in mumps
   laboratory studies. In our previous study, a new sialidase substrate,
   2-(benzothiazol-2-yl)-4-bromophenyl
   5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-alpha-D-glycero-D-galacto- 2-nonulopyranosidonic
   acid (BTP3-Neu5Ac), was developed for visualization of sialidase
   activity. BTP3-Neu5Ac can easily and rapidly perform histochemical
   fluorescent visualization of influenza viruses and virus-infected cells
   without an antiviral antibody and cell fixation. In the present study,
   the potential utility of BTP3-Neu5Ac for rapid detection of mumps virus
   was demonstrated. BTP3-Neu5Ac could visualize dot-blotted mumps virus,
   virus-infected cells, and plaques (plaques should be called focuses due
   to staining of infected cells in this study), even if a CPE was not
   observed. Furthermore, virus cultivation was possible by direct pick-up
   from a fluorescent focus. In conventional methods, visible appearance of
   the CPE and focuses often requires more than 6 days after infection, but
   the new method with BTP3-Neu5Ac clearly visualized infected cells after
   2 days and focuses after 4 days. The BTP3-Neu5Ac assay is a precise,
   easy, and rapid assay for confirmation and titration of mumps virus.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we wish to investigate certain observable effects in the
   recently obtained wormhole solution of the Eddington-inspired
   Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory, which generalizes the zero-mass
   Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole of general relativity. The solutions of EiBI
   theory contain an extra parameter. having the inverse dimension of the
   cosmological constant., and which is expected to modify various general
   relativistic observables such as the masses of wormhole mouths, tidal
   forces and light deflection. A remarkable result is that a non-zero.
   could prevent the tidal forces in the geodesic orthonormal frame from
   becoming arbitrarily large near a small throat radius (r(0) similar to
   0) contrary to what happens near a small Schwarzschild horizon radius (M
   similar to 0). The role of kappa in the flare-out and energy conditions
   is also analyzed, which reveals that the energy conditions are violated.
   We show that the exotic matter in the EiBI wormhole cannot be
   interpreted as a phantom (omega = p(r)/p < -1) or ghost field phi of
   general relativity due to the fact that both rho and p(r) are negative
   for all kappa.}},

Abstract = {{Delivering vaccine antigens to mucosal surfaces is potentially very
   attractive, especially as protection from mucosal infections may be
   mediated by local immune responses. However, to date mucosal
   immunization has had limited successes, with issues of both safety and
   poor immunogenicity. One approach to improve immunogenicity is to
   develop adjuvants that are effective and safe at mucosal surfaces.
   Differences in immune responses between mice and men have overstated the
   value of some experimental adjuvants which have subsequently performed
   poorly in the clinic. Due to their closer similarity, non-human primates
   can provide a more accurate picture of adjuvant performance. In this
   study we immunised rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) using a unique
   matrix experimental design that maximised the number of adjuvants
   screened while reducing the animal usage. Macaques were immunised by the
   intranasal, sublingual and intrarectal routes with the model protein
   antigens keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH), -galactosidase (-Gal) and
   ovalbumin (OVA) in combination with the experimental adjuvants
   Poly(I:C), Pam3CSK4, chitosan, Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin (TSLP), MPLA
   and R848 (Resiquimod). Of the routes used, only intranasal immunization
   with KLH and R848 induced a detectable antibody response. When compared
   to intramuscular immunization, intranasal administration gave slightly
   lower levels of antigen specific antibody in the plasma, but enhanced
   local responses. Following intranasal delivery of R848, we observed a
   mildly inflammatory response, but no difference to the control. From
   this we conclude that R848 is able to boost antibody responses to
   mucosally delivered antigen, without causing excess local inflammation.}},
