Abstract = {{The sural/radial nerve amplitude ratio (SRAR) has been proposed as a
   sensitive indicator of early-stage axonal polyneuropathy. However,
   previous studies did not take into account the effect of sex differences
   or different calculating methods. To obtain reference values and
   information on the variability of the SRAR in daily practice, we
   measured amplitudes of sural and superficial radial sensory nerve action
   potentials in 106 healthy adults, correlated them with epidemiological
   variables, and calculated the SRAR in several ways. Our results show
   that the SRAR is a robust measure, independent of age, weight, sex, or
   method of calculation. The use of bilateral measurements is recommended.
   The cut-off value (5th percentile) of 0.2 in these healthy subjects is
   much lower than found previously, especially compared to defining
   cut-off values by comparing patients with matched controls. Further
   study is needed to establish the clinical value of this SRAR in the
   early detection of axonal polyneuropathies.}},

Abstract = {{The inhibition of the two transmembrane, tumor-associated isozymes of
   carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) of human origin, hCA IX and XII,
   with a library of aromatic and heteroaromatic sulfonamides has been
   investigated. Most of them were sulfanilamide, homosulfanilamide, and
   4-aminoethyl-benzenesulfonamide derivatives, to which tails that should
   induce diverse physico-chemical properties have been attached at the
   amino moiety, whereas several of these compounds were derived from
   metanilamide, benzene-1,3-disulfonamide or the
   1,3,4-thiadiazole/thiadiazoline-2-sulfonamides. The tails were of the
   alkyl/aryl-carbox-amido/sulfonamido-, ureido or thioureido type. Against
   hCA IX the investigated compounds showed inhibition constants in the
   range of 3-294 nM, whereas against hCA XII in the range of 1.9-348 nM,
   respectively. The best hCA IX inhibitors were ureas/thioureas
   incorporating 4-aminoethyl-benzenesulfonamide and metanilamide moieties.
   The best hCA XII inhibitors were
   1,3,4-thiadiazole/thiadiazoline-2-sulfonamides incorporating 5-acylamido
   or 5-arylsulfonylamido moieties. These compounds also inhibited
   appreciably the cytosolic isozymes; hCA I and II, but some selectivity
   for the transmembrane, tumor-associated isozymes was observed for some
   of them, which is an encouraging result for the design of novel
   therapies targeting hypoxic tumors, in which these carbonic anhydrases
   are highly overexpressed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background Although attitudes towards psychiatric illness influence its
   presentation, detection, recognition, treatment adherence and
   rehabilitation, the lay public's opinions and beliefs about the
   treatment of depression have not been investigated sufficiently.
   Objective The aim of this study was to determine public opinions and
   beliefs about the treatment of depression and the influence of
   perception and causal attributions on attitudes towards treatment of
   depression in urban areas. Methods This study was carried out with a
   representative sample in Istanbul, which is the biggest metropolis in
   Turkey. Seven hundred and seven subjects completed the public survey
   form which consisted of 32 items rating attitudes towards depression.
   Results The public believes that psychological and social interventions
   are more effective than pharmacotherapy, and that the medicines used in
   treatment of depression are harmful and addictive. There was a general
   reluctance to consult a physician for depression, and psychiatrists were
   felt to be more helpful than general practitioners. The public viewed
   depression as treatable. A high educational level and perceiving
   depression as a disease is associated with positive beliefs and opinions
   about the treatment of depression; but the perception of depressive
   patients as aggressive is associated with negative beliefs and opinions
   about the treatment of depression. Conclusion The beliefs that ``
   psychological and social interventions are more effective than
   pharmacotherapy{''} and `` antidepressants are harmful and addictive{''}
   must specifically be taken into account in clinical practice and in
   anti-stigma campaigns. Additional studies are needed to understand the
   public's tendency to conceptualise depression as a psychosocial problem.
   In clinical practice, depression should be in troduced as a
   bio-psychosocial disease whatever its cause: biological, psychological
   or social. In addition, the differences between extreme worry and
   disease, and the lack of aggressiveness of depressive patients, must be
   emphasised.}},

Abstract = {{Using particle-in-cell simulations, we study the evolution of a strongly
   magnetized plasma slab propagating into a finite density ambient medium.
   Like in the previous work, we find that the slab breaks into discrete
   magnetic pulses. The subsequent evolution is consistent with diamagnetic
   relativistic pulse acceleration of (Liang E et at 2003 Phys. Rev. Lett.
   90 085001). Unlike in the previous work, we use the actual electron to
   proton mass ratio and focus on understanding trapping versus
   transmission of the ambient plasma by the pulses and on the particle
   acceleration spectra. We find that the accelerated electron distribution
   internal to the slab develops a double-power law. We predict that
   emission from reflected/trapped external electrons will peak after that
   of the internal electrons. We also find that the thin discrete pulses
   trap ambient electrons but allow protons to pass through, resulting in
   less drag on the pulse than in the case of trapping of both species.
   Poynting flux dominated scenarios have been proposed as the driver of
   relativistic outflows and particle acceleration in the most powerful
   astrophysical jets.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{342-345}},

Abstract = {{Objective: A randomized study was performed to compare the efficacy,
   safety and acceptability of a new model of an intracervical/intrauterine
   contraceptive device (ICD) releasing 20 mu g of levonorgestrel (LNG) per
   day.
   Methods: The LNG-ICD was inserted in Group I into the cervical canal and
   in Group II into the uterine cavity. Group I included 151 women (age,
   18-43 years) whereas Group II included 147 (age, 19-43 years). The
   number of nulliparous women was 145.
   Results: The 5-year results are presented here. The results showed a
   total continuation rate of 50\%; the continuation rate in the cervical
   group and that in the uterine group were 53.6\% and 46.3\%, respectively
   - the difference being statistically insignificant (P = .3593). The main
   reason for termination was a wish for pregnancy, which is explained by
   the relatively young age and degree of milliparity of the study
   population. During the first year, two pregnancies occurred in both
   groups. Two of these were ectopic, one in each group. The other two
   occurred after unnoticed expulsions. Thereafter, no pregnancies
   occurred. The cumulative gross rate for pregnancy was 1.3 and the Pearl
   index at 5 years was 0.425. The total expulsion rate was relatively high
   (11.1\%). Expulsions occurring during the first few months of the first
   year were related to insertion. Removals because of bleeding and because
   of amenorrhea were low, the combined gross rate being 5.7 and the Pearl
   rate 1.8 at 5 years. Also, the gross rate of infection was low (0.7).
   The continuation was high in spite of a high rate of removals for
   planning pregnancy (15.4).
   Conclusions: The method is safe and effective. There were only minor
   differences between the groups. There were no perforations and the
   incidence of infection was low. The device can also be used by young
   nulliparous women. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Replication initiator proteins in bacteria not only allow DNA
   replication but also often regulate the rate of replication initiation
   as well. The regulation is mediated by limiting the synthesis or
   availability of initiator proteins. The applicability of this principle
   is demonstrated here for RctB, the replication initiator for the smaller
   of the two chromosomes of Vibrio cholerae. A strong promoter for the
   rctB gene named rctBp was identified and found to be autoregulated in
   Escherichia coli. Promoter activity was lower in V. cholerae than in E.
   coli, and a part of this reduction is likely to be due to
   autorepression. Sequences upstream of rctBp, implicated earlier in
   replication control, enhanced the repression. The action of the upstream
   sequences required that they be present in cis, implying long-range
   interactions in the control of the promoter activity. A second gene
   specific for chromosome II replication, rctA, reduced rctB translation,
   most likely by antisense RNA control. Finally, optimal rctBp activity
   was found to be dependent on Dam. Increasing RctB in trans increased the
   copy number of a miniplasmid carrying oriCII(VC) implying that RctB can
   be rate limiting for chromosome II replication. The multiple modes of
   control on RctB are expected to reduce fluctuations in the initiator
   concentration and thereby help maintain chromosome copy number
   homeostasis.}},

Abstract = {{Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is a potent inducer of
   oligodendrocyte development and myelination. Although IGF-I
   intracellular signaling has been well described in several cell types,
   intracellular mechanisms for IGF-I-induced oligodendrocyte development
   have not been defined. By using specific inhibitors of intracellular
   signaling pathways, we report here that the MAPK and
   phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathways are required for the
   full effect of IGF-I on oligodendrocyte development in primary mixed rat
   cerebrocortical cell cultures. The MAPK activation, but not the
   phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation, leads to phosphorylation of
   the cAMP response element-binding protein, which is necessary for IGF-I
   to induce oligodendrocyte development. cAMP, although it does not show
   any effect on oligodendrocyte development, has an inhibitory effect on
   IGF-I-induced oligodendrocyte development that is mediated by the
   cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Furthermore, cAMP also has an inhibitory
   effect on IGF-I-dependent MAPK activation. This is a cAMP-dependent
   protein kinase-independent effect and probably contributes to the cAMP
   action on IGF-I-induced oligodendrocyte development.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},

Volume = {{72}},

Abstract = {{High-temperature magnetization and neutron diffraction measurements on
   metastable FexCu100-x solid solutions have recently shown to imply that
   gamma-Fe precipitates present ferromagnetic anti-Invar behavior. For
   this reason, we have studied the ferromagnetic phases of gamma-Fe in
   moment-volume parameter space, using the general potential
   linearized-augmented plane-wave method and the fixed spin moment
   procedure in order to calculate the corresponding total energy. We find
   that only two ferromagnetic phases (one related to a low-spin state and
   the other to a high-spin state) can exist and even coexist in limited
   volume ranges (3.55-3.59 angstrom). Hence, our results provide a
   ``revisited{''} version of the local spin density calculations used in
   the early article by Moruzzi {[}Phys. Rev. B 34, 1784 (1986)]. In
   addition, the fixed spin moment method-using an energy-moment-volume
   space representation-allows us to conclude that the high-spin state is
   the ground state of the gamma-Fe precipitates, as the anti-Invar
   behavior is an intrinsic property of these states. This simple scenario
   seems to adequately describe the perplexing phenomenology recently
   observed on FexCu100-x solid solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Binding of fluorescein-labeled coagulation factors IXa, VIII, X and
   allophycocyanin-labeled annexin V to thrombin-activated platelets was
   studied using flow cytometry. Upon activation, two platelet
   subpopulation; were detected, which differed by 1-2 orders Of magnitude
   in the binding of the coagulation factors and by 2-3 orders of magnitude
   in the binding of annexin V. The percentage of the high-binding
   platelets increased dose dependently or thrombin concentration. At 100
   nM of thrombin, platelets with elevated binding capability Constituted
   similar to 4\% of total platelets and were responsible for the binding
   of similar to 50\% of the total bound factor. Binding of factors to the
   high-binding subpopulation was calcium-dependent and specific as
   evidenced by experiments in the presence of excess unlabeled factor. The
   percentage of the high-binding platelets was not affected by echistatin,
   a potent aggregation inhibitor, confirming that the high-binding
   platelets were not platelet aggregates. Despite the difference in the
   coagulation factors binding, the subpopulations were indistinguishable
   by the expression of general platelet marker CD42b and activation
   markers PAC1 (an epitope of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa) and CD62P
   (P-selectin). Dual-labeling, binding studies involving Coagulation
   factors (IXa, VIII, Or X) and annexin V demonstrated that the
   high-binding platelet subpopulation Was identical for all Coagulation
   factors and for annexin v. The high-binding subpopulation had lower
   rilean forward and side scatters compared with the low-binding
   subpopulation (-80\% and -60\%, respectively). In its turn, the
   high-binding subpopulation was not homogeneous and included two
   subpopulation with different scatter values. We Conclude that activation
   by thrombin induces the formation of two distinct subpopulations of
   platelets different in their binding of the components of the intrinsic
   fX-activating complex, which may have certain physiological or
   pathological significance.}},

Abstract = {{Functional dyspepsia is still a puzzling medical problem. The causes are
   unknown, the pathogenetic mechanisms are uncertain, the management is
   controversial and medications are many times insufficient. The research
   so far has given conflicting results at all levels of investigation.
   This study represents an effort to collect all available data concerning
   the most disputed issues of functional dyspepsia. Topics regarding
   Helicobacter pylori eradication, pathophysiology, endoscopic and
   histologic correlations with symptomatology, the placebo effect and
   management options are presented following an evidence-based approach.
   Many articles, published in recent years, are discussed in order to
   obtain an overall insight of this peculiar symptom complex, named
   functional dyspepsia.}},

Abstract = {{Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase is an important mammalian target that
   catalyses the oxidative cleavage Of L-tryptophan to N-formylkynurenine.
   In this work, the redox properties of recombinant human indoleamine
   2,3-dioxygenase (rhIDO) and its H303A variant have been examined for the
   first time and the spectroscopic and substrate-binding properties of
   rhIDO and H303A in the presence and absence of substrate are reported.
   The Fe3+/Fe2+ reduction potential of H303A was found to be -304 mV; in
   the presence Of L-Trp, this value increases to +16 +/- 3 mV. A variety
   of spectroscopies indicate that ferric rhIDO at pH 6.6 exists as a
   mixture of six-coordinate, high-spin, water-bound heme and a low-spin
   species that contains a second nitrogenous ligand; parallel experiments
   on H303A are consistent either with His303 as the sixth ligand or with
   His303 linked to a conformational change that affects this transition.
   There is an increase in the low-spin component at alkaline pH for rhIDO,
   but this is not due to hydroxide-bound heme. Substrate binding induces a
   conformational rearrangement and formation of low-spin, hydroxide-bound
   heme; analysis of the H303A variant indicates that His303 is not
   required for this conversion and is not essential for substrate binding.
   The Fe3+/Fe2+ reduction potential of H303A variant is approximate to 70
   mV lower than that of rhIDO, leading to a destabilization of the
   ferrous-oxy complex, which is an obligate intermediate in the catalytic
   process. In comparison with the properties of other heme enzymes, the
   data can be used to build a more detailed picture of substrate binding
   and catalysis in indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. The wider implications of
   these results are discussed in the context of our current understanding
   of the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme.}},

Abstract = {{Stoichiometric modeling of the early stages of the citric acid
   fermentation process by Aspergillus niger revealed that ammonium ions
   combine with a carbon-containing metabolite inside the cell, in a ratio
   1:1, to form a nitrogen compound which is then excreted by the mycelium.
   High-performance liquid chromatography analysis identified glucosamine
   as the product of the relationship between glucose and ammonium during
   the early stages of the citric acid fermentation process. Slightly
   acidic internal pHs, extremely low ammonium ion concentrations inside
   the cell, and glucosamine synthesis come into direct contradiction with
   the earlier theory of the ammonium pool inside the cell, regarded as
   responsible for inhibition of the enzyme phosphofructokinase. At later
   fermentation stages, when the mycelium is involved in a process of
   fragmentation and regrowth, the addition of ammonium sulfate leads to a
   series of events: the formation and secretion of glucosamine in elevated
   amounts, the short inhibition of citrate synthesis, growth enhancement,
   the utilization of glucosamine, and finally, the enhancement of citric
   acid production rates. Obviously, the enzymatic processes underlining
   the phenomena need to be reexamined. As a by-product of the citric acid
   fermentation, glucosamine is reported for the first time here. Suitable
   process manipulations of the system described in this work could lead to
   successful glucosamine recovery at the point of its highest yield before
   degradation by the fungus occurs.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To obtain data on correlates of climacteric symptoms in women
   around menopause attending menopause clinics in Italy.
   Methods: Since 1997 a large cross sectional study has been conducted on
   the characteristics of women around menopause attending a network of
   first level menopause outpatient's clinics in Italy. A total of 66,501
   (mean age 54.4 years) women are considered in the present paper.
   Results: The odds ratios of moderate and severe hot flashes/night sweats
   were lower in more educated women and (for severe symptoms only) in
   women reporting regular physical activity. Depression, difficulty to
   sleep, forgetfulness and irritability tended to be less frequent in more
   educated women and (depression only) in women reporting regular physical
   activity. Parous women reported more frequently these symptoms.
   Conclusions: This large study confirms in Southern European population
   that low education, body mass index and low physical activity are
   associated with climacteric symptoms. Parous women are at greater risk

Abstract = {{Introduction: Although carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has become
   established as the preferred approach to the management of critical
   carotid stenosis, carotid angioplasty with stenting (CAS) has arisen as
   a competitive modality. We report here a non industry-supported
   experience using CAS in a nonselected patient population suffering from
   critical carotid steriosis.
   Methods: All patients suffering from carotid stenosis (> 50\%
   symptomatic or > 80\% asymptomatic) were offered CAS or CEA. The first
   36 patients who underwent attempted CAS over this last year are reported
   here. CAS was performed with the SMART PRECISE (Cordis, Inc, Miami
   Lakes, FL) or ACCULINK (Guidant, Inc, St Paul, MN) stents. All
   procedures were performed with cerebral protection.
   Results: The planned procedure success rate was 97\%, and the major
   adverse event (MAE) rate was 3.0\% in 35 patients who underwent
   successful CAS. This included a minor stroke and a subendocardial
   myocardial infarction in the same individual. Both events were
   attributed to sustained postprocedure hypotension. The most frequent
   intraprocedure complications observed were bradycardia and hypotension.
   Persistent postprocedure hypotension requiring vasopressor support
   complicated 23\% of cases. The average duration of vasopressor support
   in this group was 21 hours.
   Conclusion: CAS can be accomplished with an MAE comparable to CEA and
   will likely become the dominant alternative to CEA for the management of
   carotid stenosis. Management of periprocedural cardiovascular
   instability represents one of the most important elements in the safe
   conduct of CAS. (c) 2005 Excerpta Medica Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   structure considered are the cold dark matter (CDM), biased peaks in the
   initial density field, dark halos, and ``galaxies'' populating the dark
   halos in accordance with a halo occupation distribution ( HOD) model. We
   have found that the effects of biasing, gravitational evolution, and
   initial conditions on topology of large-scale structure are all
   comparable. The redshift space distortion effects are relatively small
   down to about 5 h(-1) Mpc for all tracers except for the high-threshold
   part of the genus curve. The gravitational effects are found to be well
   modeled by analytic perturbation theory when the CDM distribution is
   considered. But the direction of gravitational evolution of topology can
   be even reversed for different tracers. For example, the shift parameter
   of the genus curve evolves in opposite directions for matter and HOD
   galaxies at large scales. At small scales, there are interesting
   deviations of the genus curve of dark halos and galaxies from that of
   matter in our initially Gaussian simulations. The deviations should be
   understood as due to combined effects of gravitational evolution and
   biasing. This fact gives us an important opportunity: topology of
   large-scale structure can be used as a strong constraint on galaxy
   formation mechanisms. At scales larger than 20 h(-1) Mpc all the above
   effects gradually decrease. With good knowledge of the effects of
   nonlinear gravitational evolution and galaxy biasing on topology, one
   can also constrain the Gaussian random phase initial conditions
   hypothesis to high accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{The complex sequence of reactions and resulting material phases that
   Occur during formation of ohmic contacts using a trilayer
   titanium/nickel/titanium structure on n-SiC have been studied. The
   Ti/Ni/Ti contacts on SiC were rectifying in the as-deposited state, but
   became ohmic upon annealing at 1000 degrees C for 2 min in a N-2
   ambient, resulting in a specific contact resistance (p(c)) as low as 1 X
   10(-4) Omega cm(2). X-ray diffraction, Auger electron spectroscopy data
   and transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that Ni2Si, TiC and
   graphitic-bound C formed as a result of the annealing. The top Ti layer
   remained intact as predominantly titanium oxide with minor amounts of
   TiC. The Ni layer was converted to a double Ni2Si layer containing
   graphite C nonuniformly distributed. The bottom Ti layer was converted
   to a TiC layer separating the two Ni2Si layer, and graphitic C was
   concentrated in a discontinuous layer near the Ni2Si/SiC interface. The
   reasons for the formation of this complicated microstructure were
   discussed. (c) 2005 American Vacuum Society.}},

   the measured thickness and the simulated thickness. We can reduce the
   design variables to three, incident angle error, and azimuth angle
   errors of polarizer and analyzer. The optimization results are slightly

Abstract = {{Here we demonstrate that fruit from tomato ( Lycopersicon esculentum)
   plants expressing Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana) H+/cation
   exchangers (CAX) have more calcium (Ca2+) and prolonged shelf life when
   compared to controls. Previously, using the prototypical CAX1, it has
   been demonstrated that, in yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells, CAX
   transporters are activated when the N-terminal autoinhibitory region is
   deleted, to give an N-terminally truncated CAX (sCAX), or altered
   through specific manipulations. To continue to understand the diversity
   of CAX function, we used yeast assays to characterize the putative
   transport properties of CAX4 and N-terminal variants of CAX4. CAX4
   variants can suppress the Ca2+ hypersensitive yeast phenotypes and also
   appear to be more specific Ca2+ transporters than sCAX1. We then
   compared the phenotypes of sCAX1- and CAX4-expressing tomato lines. The
   sCAX1- expressing tomato lines demonstrate increased vacuolar H+/Ca2+
   transport, when measured in root tissue, elevated fruit Ca2+ level, and
   prolonged shelf life but have severe alterations in plant development
   and morphology, including increased incidence of blossom-end rot. The
   CAX4-expressing plants demonstrate more modest increases in Ca2+ levels
   and shelf life but no deleterious effects on plant growth. These
   findings suggest that CAX expression may fortify plants with Ca2+ and
   may serve as an alternative to the application of CaCl2 used to extend
   the shelf life of numerous agriculturally important commodities.
   However, judicious regulation of CAX transport is required to assure
   optimal plant growth.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new run-to-run control scheme to reduce overlay
   misalignment errors in steppers and demonstrates the feasibility of the

   mainly depends on two factors: one is the internal dynamics of photo
   processes and steppers and the other is the process history of lots,
   such as base equipment and reticles. Based on these observations, a new
   control scheme was designed to find the stepper inputs minimizing the
   misalignment errors based on history data analysis and neural network
   models. Moreover, we demonstrated that the proposed control scheme
   reduces the spec-out ratios as well as the number of engagements of the
   send-ahead wafer process, which thereby results in the increase of
   product yield in semiconductor manufacturing.}},

Abstract = {{The unique properties of microcavity plasma devices, and their potential
   to provide the basis for alternative PDP cell structures of improved
   luminosity, are described. Arrays as large as 500 x 500 (250,000)
   inverted pyramid microcavity devices, each with an emitting aperture of
   50 x 50 mu m(2) and designed for AC or bipolar excitation, have been
   fabricated in Si and operated in the rare gases and Ar/N-2 mixtures at
   pressures up to and beyond 1 atm. For a device pitch of 100 mu m, the
   array filling factor is 25\% and the device packing density is 10(4)
   cm(-2). Measurements of the unoptimized radiant output of 500 x 500
   arrays of Si microplasma devices, operating in Ne/(5-50)\% Xe mixtures
   and photoexciting (in transmission mode) a 20-mu m-thick film of green
   phosphor, yield values of the luminous efficacy up to 7.2 +/- 0.6 Im/W
   for a Ne/50\% Xe mixture (total pressure of 800 Torr) excited by a
   20-kHz sinusoidal voltage waveform. Sustaining voltages ranging from
   similar to 250 to 340 V (RMS) yield luminance values up to similar to
   2000 cd/m(2) for Ne/50\% Xe mixtures but the incorporation of field
   emitters or MgO into the microcavity is expected to significantly reduce
   the required operating voltage. Also, the fabrication of microplasma
   devices in ceramic multilayer structures or glass for scaling the
   display area is discussed briefly. Recent laser spectroscopic
   measurements of absorption in the visible and near-infrared suggest
   steps to be taken in PDP cell design, particularly as the Xe content in
   Ne/Xe mixtures is increased.}},

   Furthermore, the whole system simulation is implemented in the frequency

   Medicaid managed care enrollees with diabetes. Using results from a mail
   survey of 2,104 Medicaid managed care enrollees with diabetes,
   multivariate logistic regression models were fit for 3 outcomes:
   dissatisfaction with diabetes information from doctor or nurse,
   dissatisfaction with diabetes care received and dissatisfaction with
   health plan. Across the 3 models, enrollees who reported they were in
   poor health, who failed to engage in self-management activities, who
   reported little or inadequate patient education and/or who had
   difficulty accessing diabetes care were more likely to report
   dissatisfaction. The results of this study will be used to propose
   interventions that Medicaid managed care plans can initiate to improve
   satisfaction of enrollees with diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{Activating mutations of the N- ras gene occur at relatively high
   frequency in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.
   Somewhat paradoxically, ectopic expression of activated N-ras in primary
   hematopoietic cells and myeloid cell lines (in some cases) can lead to
   inhibition of proliferation. Expression of mutant N-ras in murine
   hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells is sufficient to induce myeloid
   malignancies, but these pathologies occur with long latency. This
   suggests that mutations that disable the growth suppressive properties
   of N-ras in hematopoietic cells are required for the development of
   frank malignancy. In the present work, the growth suppression induced by
   a mutant N- ras gene in U937 myeloid cells was used as the basis to
   screen a retroviral cDNA library for genes that prevent mutant
   N-ras-induced growth suppression (i.e., putative cooperating oncogenes).
   This screen identifi. ed the gene for the transcription factor
   interferon regulatory factor-2 ( IRF-2), and as con. firmation of the
   screen, overexpression of this gene in U937 cells was shown to inhibit
   mutant N-ras-induced growth suppression. Also recovered from the screen
   were two truncated clones of an uncharacterized gene ( interim of.
   ficial symbol: PP2135). Overexpression of this truncated PP2135 gene in
   U937 cells did not appear to abrogate mutant N-ras-induced growth
   suppression, but rather appeared to confer an increased sensitivity of
   U937 cells to retroviral infection, accounting for the recovery of this
   gene from the genetic screen.}},

Abstract = {{Following the devastating flood in 1998, the U.S. government proposed a
   Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) to the Bangladesh government.
   Accepting the 1998 SOFA would have allowed entry of U.S. troops in
   Bangladesh without passports or visas and without requiring declaration
   of military hardware. This would have facilitated American forces
   support for relief operations and rehabilitation of disaster victims in
   the shortest possible time. Unfortunately, the Bangladesh government
   rejected the U.S. terms outlined in the 1998 proposal. A sample survey
   was conducted among Bangladeshi Americans to examine their opinions
   regarding the 1998 SOFA. Survey data reveals that slightly over 58
   percent of the respondents supported signing the SOFA. Reasons for their
   support or opposition to the U.S. proposal are also presented.
   Statistical analyses suggest that whether respondents have studied or
   are currently studying in the United States emerged as the most
   significant factor associated with approval or disapproval of the 1998
   SOFA. Implications of the study findings are also discussed.}},

Volume = {{83}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of 2 Ca(2+)
   channel blockers, verapamil and diltiazem, on calcium loading (active
   Ca2+ uptake) and the following Ca(2+) release induced by silver ion
   (Ag(+)) and Ca(2+) from the membrane of heavy sarcoplasmic reticulum
   (SR) of chicken skeletal muscle. A fluorescent probe technique was
   employed to determine the calcium movement through the SR. Pretreatment
   of the medium with diltiazem and verapamil resulted in a significant
   decrease in the active Ca(2+) uptake, with IC(50) of about 290 mu mol/L
   for verapamil and 260 mu mol/L for diltiazem. Inhibition of Ca(2+)
   uptake was not due to the development of a Substantial drug-dependent
   leak of Ca(2+) from the SR. It might, in part, have been mediated by a
   direct inhibitory effect of these drugs on the Ca(2+) ATPase activity of
   the SR Ca(2+) pump. We confirmed that Ca(2+) channel blockers,
   administered after SR Ca(2+) loading and before induction of Ca(2+)
   release, caused a dose-dependent inhibition of both Ca(2+)- and
   Ag(+)-induced Ca(2+) release rate. Moreover, if Ca(2+) channel blockers
   were administered prior to SR Ca(2+) loading, in spite of Ca(2+) uptake
   inhibition the same reduction in Ca(2+)- and Ag+-induced Ca(2+) release
   rate was seen. We showed that the inhibition of Ag+-induced Ca(2+)
   release by L-channel blockers is more sensitive than Ca(2+)- induced
   Ca(2+) release inhibition, so the IC(50) for Ag(+)- and Ca(2+)- induced
   Ca(2+) release was about 100 and 310 mu mol/L for verapamil and 79 and
   330 mu mol/L for diltiazem, respectively. Our results Support the
   evidence that Ca(2+) channel blockers affect muscle microsome of chicken
   skeletal muscle by 2 independent mechanisms: first, reduction of Ca(2+)
   uptake rate and Ca(2+)-ATPase activity inhibition, and second,
   inhibition of both Ag(+)- and Ca (2+)- induced Ca(2+) release by Ca(2+)
   release channels. These findings confirm the direct effect of Ca(2+)
   channel blockers on calcium release channels. Our results suggest that
   even if the SR is incompletely preloaded with Ca(2+) because of
   inhibition of Ca 2+ uptake by verapamil and diltiazem, no impairment in
   Ca(2+) release occurs.}},

Abstract = {{Interfaces between arsenide and phosphide III-V semiconductors have
   shown to be one of the most difficult issues to be understood and
   definitively solved. This problem is particularly relevant with Vapour
   Phase Epitaxy (VPE) and Metallo-Organic Vapour Phase Epitaxy (MOVPE)
   techniques, since an irreproducibility in preparing abrupt interfaces
   between arsenide and phosphide has been evidenced. Several researchers
   have ascribed this problem to the volatility of arsenic and phosphorus
   species and since then for long time different recipes and growth
   procedures have been suggested in order to obtain sharp transition
   between the two different materials. In this work the film/substrate
   interface is modelled using thermodynamical calculations after the
   regular solution model proposed by Jordan and Ilegems: PH3 flows over
   GaAs surface, and as a consequence the substrate is enriched with P,
   with the formation of a thin layer of GaAsP and mixed As-P gaseous
   species. Samples of InGaP on GaAs substrate were grown by MOVPE and
   characterised by Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS) and Transmission
   Electron Microscopy (TEM) in order to support the theoretical findings.

Abstract = {{While cost accounting is a well-developed discipline with a rich
   institutional past, it is criticized for being manipulable. This
   criticism is due, in part, to the existence of multiple, yet equally
   accepted cost allocation procedures or cost estimation techniques.
   Employing a principal-agent model, cost accounting is modeled as a menu
   of alternative methods which, conditional on agent effort, produce
   noisy, unbiased and independently distributed (i.e., equally defensible)
   measures from which a single realization is selected ex post as the
   report used to contract with the agent. Assuming that the report does
   not indicate which method produced it, the report modeled is
   ``tainted{''} in that the lowest (most favorable to the agent) outcome
   is reported, where the ``amount{''} of tainting corresponds to the
   menu's size. The paper identifies bright-line conditions where the
   principal's expected net payoff is independent of the amount of
   tainting, demonstrating that tainting does not necessarily affect the
   report's incentive value. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present study describes the main characteristics of the proteolytic
   activities of the velvetbean caterpillar, Anticarsia gemmatalis Hubner,
   and their sensitivity to proteinase inhibitors and activators. Midguts
   of last instar larvae reared on an artificial diet were homogenized in
   0.15 M NaCl and centrifuged at 14,000 g for 10 min at 4 degrees C and
   the supernatants were used in enzymatic assays at 30 degrees C, pH 10.0.
   Basal total proteolytic activity (azocasein hydrolysis) was 1.14 +/-
   0.15 absorbance variation min(-1) mg protein(-1), at 420 nm; basal
   trypsin-like activity (N-benzoyl-L-arginine-p-nitroanilide, BApNA,
   hydrolysis) was 0.217 +/- 0.02 mmol p-nitroaniline min(-1) mg
   protein(-1). The maximum proteolytic activities were observed at pH 10.5
   using azocasein and at pH 10.0 using BApNA, this pH being identical to
   the midgut pH of 10.0. The maximum trypsin-like activity occurred at 50
   degrees C, a temperature that reduces enzyme stability to 80 and 60\% of
   the original, when pre-incubated for 5 and 30 min, respectively.
   Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride inhibited the proteolytic activities with
   an IC50 ofO.39 mM for azocasein hydrolysis and of 1.35 rnM for BApNA
   hydrolysis. Benzamidine inhibited the hydrolysis with an IC50 of 0.69
   and 0.076 mM for azocasein and BApNA, respectively. The absence of
   cysteine-proteinases is indicated by the fact that 2-mercaptoethariol
   and L-cysteine did not increase the rate of azocasein hydrolysis. These
   results demonstrate the presence of serine-proteinases and the
   predominance of trypsin-like activity in the midgut of Lepidoptera
   insects, now also detected in A. gemmatalis, and suggest this enzyme as
   a major target for pest control based on disruption of protein
   metabolism using proteinase inhibitors.}},

Abstract = {{Tremor of unknown origin is detected in 10-30\% of early-treated and in
   more than 30\% late-treated phenylketonuric patients. With the aim of
   characterizing tremor in phenylketonuria, we carried out a systematic
   study in 54 patients aged 6 to 37 years. Tremor examination was done by
   applying the WHIGET Tremor Rating Scale and by accelerometer recording
   (BYOPAC System MP100WSW). Age at diet onset, IQ test results,
   concomitant plasma phenylalanine levels and index of dietary control
   were also studied. Tremor was not observed at rest in any case, but was
   apparent in 22 patients (40.7\%) when carrying out a kinetic task. In 15
   patients tremor was also evident during maintenance of a postural task
   at a frequency ranging between 7.5 and 12.7 Hz. Frequency of tremor was
   not significantly modified by loading the arms or by increasing muscle
   contraction. Patients with tremor had a later age at onset of
   phenylalanine restricted diet (p < 0.001). Other treatment-related
   variables did not differ between patients with and without tremor. Our
   results of the neurophysiological examination suggest that tremor in
   phenylketonuric patients is dependent on a dysfunction of central
   nervous system networks and may be an index of cerebral damage.}},

Abstract = {{A distributed hydrologic model of an urban watershed in the northeast
   United States was developed and combined with a genetic algorithm to

   4,533 hydrologic response units (HRUs). The infiltration-based BMP was
   conceptualized as an element that alters the infiltration/runoff
   partitioning of the HRUs in which it was applied. The results indicate
   that the optimal location and number of BMPs is a complex function of
   watershed network connectivity, flow travel time, land use, distance to
   channel, and contributing area, requiring an optimization approach of
   the type introduced here. A Pareto frontier describing the trade-off

Abstract = {{The adaptive changes that develop in the pressure-overloaded left
   ventricular (LV) myocardium include cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and
   interstitial fibrosis. Although the former is known to depend to a
   sizeable extent on sympathetic (over)activity, little information exists
   whether the same applies to the latter, ie, whether excess catecholamine
   exposure contributes to the imbalance between collagen deposition by
   fibroblasts and degradation by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs),
   eventually leading to LV collagen accumulation. Sprague-Dawley rats were
   subjected to abdominal aortic banding (B) or sham operation (S) and
   treated with beta-blockade (Bb, oral propranolol, 40 mg/kg per day),
   chemical sympathectomy (Sx, 6-hydroxydopamine, 150 mg/kg intraperitoneal
   twice per week) or vehicle (Vh). Ten weeks later, systolic blood
   pressure, LV weight, collagen abundance (computer-aided histology),
   zymographic matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 activity and its specific
   tissue inhibitor concentration (TIMP-2) were measured. Both
   sympathectomy and beta-blockade failed to attenuate the banding-induced
   blood pressure elevation but significantly attenuated the attendant LV
   hypertrophy. As expected, pressure-overload hypertrophy was associated
   with interstitial fibrosis (collagen: 4.37 +/- 1.23\% BVh versus 1.23
   +/- 0.44\% SVh, P<0.05), which was abolished by sympathectomy (2.55 +/-
   1.31\%, P=not significant versus SSx) but left unchanged by
   beta-blockade (4.11 +/- 1.23\%, P<0.05 versus both SBb and BSx).
   beta-blockade, but not sympathectomy, was also associated with an
   increased TIMP-2/MMP-2 ratio (P<0.05), indicating reduced interstitial
   collagenolytic activity. In separate groups of banded and sham-operated
   rats, treatment with the alpha-receptor blocker doxazosin (10 mg/kg per
   day) displayed similar antifibrotic and biochemical effects as
   sympathectomy. Thus in the course of experimental pressure overload, the
   sympathetic nervous system plays a major pro-fibrotic role, which is
   mediated via alpha-adrenergic but not beta-adrenergic receptors.}},

Abstract = {{Predictive factors for alcoholic relapse after liver transplantation
   (LT) performed for alcoholic liver disease (ALD) have been assessed in
   numerous studies, often with contradictory results. The aim of the study
   was to assess pretransplantation alcohol consumption characteristics on
   alcoholic relapse after LT. Patients transplanted for ALD for at least 6
   months were included. An anonymous questionnaire assessed
   socio-demographic characteristics, medical history, and alcohol
   consumption before and after LT. Relapse was defined as any alcohol use
   after LT. Severe relapse was defined by heavy drinking: more than 21
   units/week for males and 14 units/week for females. A total of 61
   patients were studied. The mean follow up after LT was 49 +/- 34 months.
   Alcoholic relapse occurred in 32 of 61 patients (52\%) and severe
   relapse in eight of 61 patients (13\%). Risk factors for severe relapse
   were: length of abstinence before LT (P = 0.0001), more than one alcohol
   withdrawal before LT (P = 0.001), alcohol dependence (P = 0.05), alcohol
   abuse in first relatives (P = 0.05), and younger age (P = 0.05).
   Information on previous alcohol consumption (dependence, number of
   withdrawals, family history) helps to predict severe relapse after LT in
   patients with ALD, allowing early awareness and specific postoperative
   care.}},

Title = {{Diabetic retinopathy is associated with a switch in splicing from anti-
   to pro-angiogenic isoforms of vascular endothelial growth factor}},
Journal = {{DIABETOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2422-2427}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Aims/hypothesis: Proliferative diabetic retinopathy results from excess
   blood vessel growth into the vitreous fluid of the eye. Retinal
   angiogenesis is regulated by expression of vascular endothelial growth
   factor (VEGF), and many studies have shown that VEGF is critically
   involved in proliferative diabetic retinopathy. VEGF is alternatively
   spliced to form the angiogenic (VEGF(xxx)) and potentially
   anti-angiogenic (VEGF(xxx)b) family of isoforms. The VEGF(xxx)b family
   is found in normal tissues, but down-regulated in renal and prostate
   cancer. Previous studies on endogenous expression of VEGF in the eye
   have not distinguished between the two families of isoforms. Methods: We
   measured VEGF(xxx)b isoform expression in normal human eye tissue (lens,
   sclera, retina and iris) and vitreous fluid using enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay and Western blotting with a VEGF(xxx)b-specific
   antibody. Results: VEGF(xxx)b protein was expressed in lens, sclera,
   retina, iris and vitreous fluid. Multiple isoforms were seen, including
   VEGF(165)b, VEGF(121)b, VEGF(145)b, VEGF(183)b and VEGF(189)b. In
   non-diabetic patients, 64 +/- 7\% of the VEGF in the vitreous was
   VEGF(xxx)b (n=18), whereas in diabetic patients only 12.5 +/- 3.6\% of
   total VEGF was VEGF(xxx)b. Conclusions/interpretation: Since VEGF(xxx)b
   inhibits VEGF(xxx)-induced angiogenesis in a one-to-one stoichiometric
   manner, these results show that in the eye of diabetic patients VEGF
   splicing was switched from an anti-angiogenic to a pro-angiogenic
   environment. This occurred through changes to the ratio of VEGF(xxx) :
   VEGF(xxx)b. Alterations to splicing, and through that to the balance of
   VEGF isoforms, could therefore be a potential therapeutic strategy for
   diabetic retinopathy.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this technical note the ability to estimate surface soil moisture
   (theta) from soil color using image analysis is evaluated. Four natural
   soils and uniform fine sand were used. Calibration soil samples with
   theta varying from 0 to 0.40 m(3) m(-3) in 0.05 m(3) m(-3) increments
   were prepared and photographed. The variations in soil color with theta
   were investigated in both the RGB (red, green, and blue) and HSV (hue,
   saturation, and value) color spaces. Generally, all tested soils became
   when wetted up to a certain limit (around 0.25 m(3) m(-3)). However,
   many soils actually became lighter again at the highest theta levels.
   This was due to that some water was visible on the soil surface causing
   reflections. A simple linear regression model between S and V was
   selected to estimate theta from the soil color. The model performed
   excellent in the fine sand and in two natural soils with a root mean
   square error (RMSE) of 0.011 to 0.017 m(3) m(-3). In the two other soils
   RMSE was about 0.025 m(3) m(-3). An independent validation data was also
   collected for the sand. The calibrated model performed well also in the
   validation data set with a RMSE of 0.015 m(3) m(-3). From the limited
   data presented in this study, it seems that the relationship between
   soil color and theta is stronger in light colored soils with low organic
   matter content. Some examples of practical applications of the method
   are also suggested in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{A rational expectations competitive storage model was applied to the
   U.S. corn market, to assess the aptness of this framework in explaining
   monthly price behavior in an actual commodity market. Relative to
   previous models, extensive realism was added to the model, in terms of
   how production activities and storage costs are specified. By modeling
   convenience yield, ``backwardation{''} in prices between crop years did
   not depend on the unrealistic assumption of zero ending stocks. Our
   model generated cash prices that were distributed with positive skewness
   and kurtosis, and mean and variance that inereased over the storage
   season, comparable to the persistence and the occasional spikes observed
   in commodity prices. Futures prices were generated as conditional
   expectations of cash prices at contract maturity, and the variances of
   futures prices exhibited realistic time-to-maturity and seasonal
   patterns. Model realizations of cash and futures prices over many
   ``years{''} were used to demonstrate the wide variety of price behaviors
   that could be observed in an efficient market with a similar market
   structure, implying that economic and policy implications drawn from
   short, historical samples of prices could be misleading.}},

Title = {{Left ventricular remodeling after primary coronary angioplasty in

Journal = {{AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{150}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background Primary angioplasty is the best treatment of acute myocardial
   infarction but fails to achieve adequate myocardial reperfusion in 25\%
   to 30\% of patients, despite TIMI grade 3 flow. Drug treatment aimed at
   reducing the no-reflow phenomenon may improve myocardial salvage, thus
   preventing left ventricular remodeling. Our aim was to evaluate the
   impact of abciximab and adenosine on immediate angiographic results and
   on 6-month left ventricular remodeling.
   Methods Ninety consecutive patients undergoing primary angioplasty with
   coronary stenting were randomized in a sequential alternating fashion to
   standard abciximab treatment (ABCX) group, intracoronary adenosine
   distal to the occlusion (ADO) group, or neither (CTRL) group. All
   patients underwent a clinical and echocardiographic follow-up at 1 and 6
   months. The primary end point was the prevalence of 6-month left
   ventricular remodeling.
   Results Baseline clinical, echocardiogrophic, and angiographic
   characteristics were similar. Mean final corrected TIMI frame count was
   17 +/- 9, 16 +/- 12, and 23 +/- 11 frames in ABCX, ADO, and CTRL
   patients, respectively (P = .002). Angiographic no-reflow was observed
   in 7\%, 13\%, and 17\% of ABCX, ADO, and CTRL patients, respectively (P
   > .20). At 6 months, left ventricular remodeling occurred in 7\%, 30\%,
   and 30\% of ABCX, ADO, and CTRL patients, respectively (P = .045), with
   a percent increase in end-diastolic volume of 5\% +/- 13\%, 15\% +/-
   15\%, and 12\% +/- 18\% (P = .04).
   Conclusions During primary angioplasty, abciximab enhances myocardial
   reperfusion, translating into a reduced incidence of 6-month left
   ventricular remodeling. In contrast, adenosine administration improves
   angiographic results but does not prevent left ventricular remodeling.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Control of hyperglycemia has been shown to decrease
   mortality in critically ill adults, but the benefits of strict glucose
   control have not been established in children. Since January 2002, our
   pediatric burn center has adopted a policy of `intensive' insulin
   therapy to achieve blood glucose levels 90 to 120 mg/ dL. The purpose of
   this study was to examine the impact of this practice on patient
   outcomes.
   Methods. We reviewed the records of children with >= 30\% total body
   surface area (TBSA) burn injury admitted to our regional pediatric burn
   center from July 1, 2000 to June 31, 2003. Patients were grouped into
   `conventional insulin therapy' for the 2000 to 2001 period (n = 31) and
   into `intensive insulin therapy' for the 2002 to 2003 period (n = 33).
   The efficacy of glucose control, infection rates, and patient survival
   were compared for the two therapies.
   Results. The demographic characteristics and injury severity were
   similar between the conventional and intensive insulin therapy groups.
   Children receiving intensive insulin therapy had glucose levels of 90 to
   120 mg/dL more consistently than those in the conventional insulin
   therapy group. There was a significant decrease in urinary tract
   infections among intensive insulin therapy patients. TBSA burn, percent
   full-thickness burn, and Pediatric Risk of Mortality scores were
   negatively related to survival; intensive insulin therapy was positively
   associated with survival.
   Conclusion. Intensive insulin therapy to maintain normoglycemia in
   severely burned children can be safely and effectively implemented in
   the burn unit. This therapy seems to lower infection rates and improve
   survival. Intensive insulin therapy should be considered for children
   with severe burn injuries.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF CLINICAL BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{Background The outcome of parathyroid surgery is often not clear for at
   least 24 h after the operation. A frozen section does not always
   distinguish between an adenoma and hyperplasia. Minimally invasive
   surgical techniques are being refined, so the need for perioperative
   assurance about the completeness of surgery has increased. The value of
   intraoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) measurements in 26 surgical
   cases undergoing parathyroidectomy has been evaluated.
   Methods Twenty-one patients were diagnosed as having primary
   hyperparathyroidism, including two patients with multiple endocrine
   neoplasia type I (MEN 1). Five patients had tertiary
   hyperparathyroidism, including one patient with X-linked
   hypophosphataemia and four with renal hyperparathyroidism (RHPT). Blood
   samples were taken at the onset of surgery, at the time of tumour
   resection and at 5-min intervals following removal of the tumour. PTH
   was measured using a PTH Turbo assay on the DPC Immulite analyser.
   Results Current practice suggests that the PTH concentration should fall
   to less than 50\% of the pre-incision value or to less than 50\% of the
   level at the time of tumour resection (time equals zero). PTH levels
   were therefore monitored at 5-min intervals following removal of the
   tumour. In most of the case studies PTH followed the suggested pattern,
   but not when further exploration was warranted to determine if another
   adenoma was present, In some cases the PTH levels fell by the
   appropriate margin to deem the procedure a success but at 10 min
   post-gland excision the PTH began to rise again. Further exploration was
   required to confirm the continued source of PTH.
   Conclusion We recommend that intraoperative PTH measurements continue
   until at least 15 min post-gland removal in cases of suspected
   single-gland disease. A decline in PTH concentration to at least 50\% of
   the pre-incision or time of gland resection levels should be observed.

Abstract = {{Objective-To report an unusual 2nd carpal bone (C2) slab fracture and
   its treatment, using an ultrasonographically assisted, minimally
   invasive arthrotomy technique, for fragment removal.
   Study Design-Case report.
   Animals-An 11-year-old crossbred Warmblood gelding.
   Methods-A bone fragment, spanning the height of C2, identified on the
   palmaromedial aspect of C2 was demarcated intraoperatively using
   ultrasonographically guided needles and removed by arthrotomy.
   Results-Fracture fragment removal was achieved using a small,
   ultrasonographically guided arthrotomy. The horse has become sound after
   treatment and returned to the previous level of pleasure riding
   activity.
   Conclusions-Perioperative ultrasonography was used to delineate and
   facilitate removal of an unusual slab fragment of C2, through a
   minimally sized arthrotomy. Despite the presence of pancarpal
   osteoarthritis and partial involvement of the medial collateral
   ligament, the prognosis appeared to be satisfactory for this pleasure
   riding horse.
   Clinical Relevance-Ultrasonographic guidance may be used to optimize the
   approach to C2 articular bony fragments that may not be observed using
   arthroscopy. (c) Copyright 2005 by The American College of Veterinary

Abstract = {{The oxidative absorption of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) into a solution of
   ferric chelate of trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexanetetraacetate (CDTA) was
   studied in a counter-current laboratory column randomly packed with 15
   mm plastic Ralu rings. The present investigation takes concern about the
   Kraft pulping situation where dilute H2S concentrations are omnipresent
   in large-volume gas effluents. A fractional two-level factorial approach
   was instigated to determine the significance of six operating variables,
   namely the solution's alkalinity (pH; 8.5-10.5), the liquid mass flow
   rate (L; 1.73-5.19 kg m(-2) s(-1)), the solution's ionic strength (I-C;
   0.01-0.1 mol dm(-3)), the gas mass flow rate (G; 0.19-0.57 kg m(-2)
   s(-1)), the inlet H2S concentration (C-H2S,C-0; 70-430ppm) and the
   initial ferric CDTA concentration (C-Fe,C-0; 100 -400 mu mol dm(-3)).
   Initially, a Plackett-Burman design matrix of seven duplicated
   experiments revealed that pH is the leading factor controlling the H2S
   conversion rate while the ionic strength and ferric CDTA concentration
   effects remained negligible within the factorial domain. Surface
   response analysis based on 11 duplicated factorial experiments plus 10
   central composite trials revealed that the H2S conversion significantly
   increases with liquid flow rate but decreases with growing H2S load up.
   Further examination about the influence of ferric CDTA on H2S absorption
   rate was set up over a broader concentration range (C-Fe,C-0; 0-2000 mu
   mol dm(-3)) at pH of 9.5 and 10.5. It showed good potential at 2000 mu
   mol dm(-3) as H2S conversion increased by a significant 25\% for both pH
   values in comparison to pure alkaline solutions containing no ferric
   CDTA. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence has been accumulated suggesting that a dysfunction in pain
   inhibitory systems, i.e. in `diffuse noxious inhibitory controls'
   (DNIC)-like mechanisms, might be-amongst other factors-responsible for
   the development of anatomically generalized chronic pain like
   fibromyalgia. The aim of the present study was to look for similar
   impairments in chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) as a regionally
   specific pain syndrome. Twenty-nine CTTH patients and 25 age- and
   sex-matched healthy control subjects participated in the study. After
   baseline assessment of electrical detection and pain thresholds, tonic
   heat stimuli were concurrently applied by a thermode to the thigh to
   induce DNIC-like pain inhibition. Tonic heat stimuli were applied either
   slightly above ('pain' condition) or slightly below ('heat' condition)
   pain threshold. For determination of electrical detection and pain
   thresholds, electrocutaneous stimuli were administered either to the
   forearm (extra-cranial site) or to the temple (cranial site), using a
   multiple staircase procedure. The increase in the electrical detection
   and pain thresholds induced by concurrent tonic heat stimulation was
   significantly smaller in the CTTH patients than in the control subjects.
   This group difference was present during the `pain' as well as the
   `heat' conditiori. Furthermore, the electrical detection and pain
   thresholds were affected in this group-specific manner both at the
   forearm and at the temple. These findings suggest that patients with
   CTTH suffer from deficient DNIC-like pain inhibitory mechanisms in a
   similar manner, as do patients with anatomically generalized chronic
   pain like fibromyalgia. (c) 2005 International Association for the Study

Abstract = {{The kinetics of butane and hexane sorption from vapor phase by porous
   glasses is studied by the pulsed NMR technique. The sorption process is
   revealed to proceed in two stages: monomolecular adsorption and
   capillary condensation. The rate of adsorption is limited by the rate of
   adsorbate transfer to the adsorbent surface, with the latter rate being
   described by the classical diffusion flux. It is shown that
   ultramicropores are filled simultaneously with the formation of a
   monolayer. The relative content of molecules in such pores is estimated.
   At the stage of monomolecular adsorption and at the initial stage of
   capillary condensation, when the adsorption proceeds from the vapor
   phase of butane-hexane or butane-deuterated hexane mixtures, butane
   molecules are predominantly sorbed and followed by their partial
   displacement by hexane molecules. The rate of the capillary condensation
   of butane from the mixture is 15-18-fold lower than that from the vapor
   phase of butane alone which is explained by a decrease in the gradient
   of chemical potential. It is shown that, when adsorption occurs from a
   nonequilibrium butane-hexane mixture, anomalous kinetic curves are
   observed because the driving force of adsorption changes in the course
   of establishing equilibrium in the liquid phase.}},

   quantitative computed tomography (CT) in this population has not been
   studied. This study was designed to evaluate bone measurements in HIV-1
   infected children and adolescents using DXA and CT. Fifty-eight children
   and adolescents (32 females and 26 males with a mean age +/- SD of 12.0
   +/- 3.9 years, age range 5.0-19.4 years) with perinatally acquired HIV-1
   infection underwent simultaneous bone area and density evaluation by DXA
   and CT. Height and weight measurements as well as pubertal assessment
   were performed on the same day. All but four subjects were receiving
   highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Subjects were matched with
   healthy children and adolescents for age, gender, and ethnicity. HIV-1
   infected children were significantly shorter ( P < 0.001), lighter ( P <
   0.005), and had delayed puberty ( P < 0.001) compared to controls. Using
   DXA, HIV-1 infected subjects had significantly less bone area ( P <
   0.001), bone mineral content (BMC) ( P < 0.005), and BMD ( P < 0.05) at
   the vertebral level compared to controls. In addition, bone area ( P <
   0.001), BMC ( P < 0.001), and BMD ( P < 0.005) of the whole body were
   also reduced relative to controls. In contrast, using CT, HIV-1 infected
   subjects had similar vertebral BD compared to controls, but smaller
   vertebral height and cross-sectional area (CSA) ( P =0.01 and P < 0.005,
   respectively). DXA Z-scores provided values significantly lower than CT
   Z-scores in the HIV-1 infected population ( P < 0.01). After accounting
   for weight and vertebral height, stepwise multiple regression
   demonstrated that the prediction of CT BD values of L1 to L3 from DXA
   values of these vertebrae was significantly improved. HIV-1 infected
   children and adolescents have lower vertebral and whole body BMC and BMD
   DXA measures. In contrast, vertebral BD measurements by CT are normal.
   The lower bone measurements were primarily due to the decreased bone and
   body size of the HIV-1 subjects.}},

Abstract = {{Plant stanols and sterols of the 4-desmethyl family (e. g., sitostanol
   and sitosterol) effectively decrease LDL cholesterol concentrations,
   whereas 4,4-dimethylsterols (alpha-amyrin and lupeol) do not. Serum
   carotenoid concentrations, however, are decreased by both plant sterol
   families. The exact mechanisms underlying these effects are not known,
   although effects on micellar composition have been suggested. With a
   liver X receptor (LXR) coactivator peptide recruitment assay, we showed
   that plant sterols and stanols from the 4-desmethylsterol family
   activated both LXR alpha and LXR alpha, whereas 4,4-dimethyl plant
   sterols did not. In fully differentiated Caco-2 cells, the functionality
   of this effect was shown by the increased expression of ABCA1, one of
   the known LXR target genes expressed by Caco-2 cells in measurable
   amounts. The LXR-activating potential of the various plant
   sterols/stanols correlated positively with ABCA1 mRNA expression.
   Reductions in serum hydrocarbon carotenoids could be explained by the
   effects of the 4-desmethyl family and 4,4-dimethylsterols on micellar
   carotenoid incorporation. Our findings indicate that the decreased
   intestinal absorption of cholesterol and carotenoids by plant sterols
   and stanols is caused by two distinct mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{In a sample of 28 subacute anterior circulation ischemic stroke patients
   with severe arm paresis, reduced motor cortex excitability (increased
   motor thresholds, reduced MEP amplitudes, reduced number of active
   points) and a reduced conduction velocity in the corticospinal system
   were found in the affected hemisphere. At the same time motor cortex
   topology for the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) representation was
   comparable for the affected and non-affected hemisphere. Considerable
   arm motor recovery (Fugl-Meyer test) was observed when assessed four
   weeks later after a period of rehabilitation intervention. Motor cortex
   excitability and conduction velocity in the corticospinal system
   improved in the affected hemisphere. In addition, APB representation
   showed a medial shift in patients with such a representation at pre test
   (n = 14). Multiple stepwise regression indicated that of all
   transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) parameters only the medial shift
   of the motor cortex map predicted motor recovery. Assessing the effect
   of training time (non-intensified vs. intensified therapy) and type of
   arm training (Bobath approach vs. Arm BASIS training) with a randomised
   controlled design revealed that the impairment-oriented Arm BASIS
   training improved motor control more than the control conditions. In
   addition, patients of the group receiving the Arm BASIS training with an
   APB representation at pre test showed a medial shift of the motor cortex
   map and improved conduction times. In conclusion, changes in motor
   cortex topology were likely to be relevant for motor recovery and might
   have been induced by the impairment-oriented training.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study evaluated the validity of three single-item,
   patient-rated, interviewer-administered, global assessments of treatment
   benefit, satisfaction with treatment and willingness to continue
   treatment, collectively referred to as the BSW.
   Methods: The BSW, micturition diaries, the Overactive Bladder
   Questionnaire (OAB-q) and the King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) were
   included in part or in total in three OAB clinical trials. Discriminant
   validity for full and dichotomized responses was assessed with ANOVAs
   models and correlations were used to evaluate construct validity.
   Results: The BSW demonstrated significant differences among the majority
   of the response levels on all measures of micturitions in all studies.
   The BSW also demonstrated discriminant validity with the OAB-q and the
   KHQ. BSW measures demonstrated significant differences among the change
   scores for all subscales of the OAB-q and the majority of the KHQ
   domains with both full and dichotomized responses. Patients who were
   dissatisfied with treatment and those unwilling to continue treatment
   also reported significantly worse OAB-q and KHQ scores compared with
   those who were satisfied with treatment or willing to continue
   treatment. BSW measures were moderately correlated with the micturition
   variables, moderate to strongly correlated with the OAB-q and weak to
   moderately with the KHQ, providing support for the construct validity of
   the BSW measures.
   Conclusions: The BSW is a useful tool to capture patients' global
   impressions of three key elements of treatment outcome: a perceived
   benefit, satisfaction with treatment, and the willingness to continue
   treatment, and can facilitate patient-physician communication as well as
   be informative to researchers.}},

Abstract = {{Background Cocaine use is associated with myocardial ischemia and
   infarction, but it is unclear whether this is only because of the acute
   effects of cocaine on heart rate, blood pressure, and vasomotor tone or
   whether accelerated atherosclerosis from long-term exposure to cocaine
   also contributes.
   Methods We sought to measure the association between cocaine exposure
   and coronary calcification, a marker for atherosclerosis, among
   participants in the CARDIA Study who received computed tomography
   scanning and answered questions about illicit drug use at the year 15
   examination in 2000-2001.
   Results Among 3038 CARDIA participants (age 33-45 years, 55\% women and
   45\% black), past cocaine exposure was reported by 35\% and was more
   common among men, smokers, drinkers, and participants with less
   education. Powdered cocaine exposure was more common among whites, crack
   cocaine among blacks. Before adjustment, cocaine exposure was strongly
   associated with coronary calcification. After adjusting for age, sex,
   ethnicity, socioeconomic status, family history, and habits, however,
   these associations disappeared: adjusted odds ratios for coronary
   calcification were 0.9 (95\% CI 0.6-1.3) for 1 to 10, 1.2 (95\% CI
   0.8-1.7) for 11 to 99, and 1.0 (95\% CI 0.6-1.6) for >= 100 lifetime
   episodes of cocaine use, in comparison with none. Sex, tobacco, and
   alcohol use appeared to be primarily responsible for the confounding we
   observed in unadjusted models.
   Conclusion We found no evidence of a causal relationship between
   long-term exposure to cocaine and coronary calcification and conclude
   that acute nonatherogenic mechanisms probably explain most
   cocaine-associated myocardial infarction.}},

Abstract = {{Combining multiple information sources such as subbands, streams (with
   different features) and multimodal data has been shown to be a very
   promising trend, both in experiments and to some extents in real-life
   biometric authentication applications. Despite considerable efforts in
   fusions, there is a lack of understanding on the roles and effects of
   correlation and variance (of both the client and impostor scores of
   base-classifiers/experts). Often, scores are assumed to be independent.
   In this paper, we explicitly consider this factor using a theoretical
   model, called variance reduction-equal error rate (VR-EER) analysis.
   Assuming that client and impostor scores are approximately Gaussian
   distributed, we showed that equal error rate (EER) can be modeled as a
   function of F-ratio, which itself is a function of 1) correlation; 2)
   variance of base-experts; and 3) difference of client and impostor
   means. To achieve lower EER, smaller correlation and average variance of
   base-experts, and larger mean difference are desirable. Furthermore,
   analysing any of these factors independently, e.g. focusing on
   correlation alone, could be miss-leading. Experimental results on the
   BANCA multimodal database confirm our findings using VR-EER analysis. We
   analyzed four commonly encountered scenarios in biometric authentication
   which include fusing correlated/uncorrelated base-experts of
   similar/different performances. The analysis explains and shows that
   fusing systems of different performances is not always beneficial. One
   of the most important findings is that positive correlation ``hurts{''}
   fusion while negative correlation (greater ``diversity,{''} which
   measures the spread of prediction score with respect to the fused
   score), improves fusion. However, by linking the concept of ambiguity
   decomposition to classification problem, it is found that diversity is
   not sufficient to be an evaluation criterion (to compare several fusion
   systems), unless measures are taken to normalize the (class-dependent)
   variance. Moreover, by linking the concept of bias-variance-co-variance
   decomposition to classification using EER, it is found that if the
   inherent mismatch (between training and test sessions) can be learned
   from the data, such mismatch can be incorporated into the fusion system
   as a part of training parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Newborn rats seek and attain contact with their mothers by orienting and
   primitive locomotor behaviors called maternally-directed orienting
   behaviors (MDOBs). By 2 days of age MDOBs are elicited specifically by
   maternal features and are heightened by a period of acute separation
   from the mother This behavioral regulation by the mother's presence
   suggests an early form of filial attachment. To probe for other evidence
   of filial attachment, two aspects of the controls of MDOBs were
   investigated: (1) whether MDOBs are goal-corrected in relation to the
   dam's position and (2) whether the performance of MDOBs can be separated
   from that of suckling. It was found that, during the first 2 days after
   birth, MDOBs maintained the pup's ventrum-to-ventrum contact with the
   dam regardless of her position, suggesting that they are goal-corrected.
   Evidence was not found for independent controls of nipple grasping (NG),
   the behavior that initiates suckling, and MDOBs during the first two

Abstract = {{Objectives. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid in
   preventing bone loss in patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer
   and bone metastases who were receiving androgen deprivation therapy.
   Methods. Patients received zoledronic acid 4 mg as a 15-minute infusion
   every 3 weeks for I year. Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine (L2
   to L4) and total hip was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at
   baseline and 12 months. Biochemical markers of bone turnover
   (N-telopeptide and bone alkaline phosphatase) and serum creatinine
   levels were evaluated at baseline and during the study. Skeletal-related
   events were assessed at each study visit.
   Results. Of the 221 enrolled patients, 202 and 221 patients were
   included in the efficacy and safety analyses, respectively. The mean
   increase in bone mineral density of the lumbar spine and total hip was
   7.7\% (P < 0.001) and 3.6\% (P < 0.001), respectively. Decreases in
   N-telopeptide and bone alkaline phosphatase levels were significant and
   sustained. The median time to the first skeletal-related event was not
   reached; 11.9\% of patients had a skeletal-related event. Arthralgia
   (20.4\%), nausea (14\%), fatigue (14\%), and back pain (12.2\%) were the
   most common adverse events. Adverse events due to renal function
   deterioration were infrequent. The mean maximal change in serum
   creatinine level from baseline was 0.3 mg/dL.
   Conclusions. Zoledronic acid administration for I year to patients with
   hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and bone metastases who were receiving
   androgen deprivation therapy was safe and prevented bone loss, as
   demonstrated by significant increases in bone mineral density and
   sustained suppression of biochemical markers of bone turnover.}},

Abstract = {{Ensheathing olfactory glial cells (OEC) can be considered, with stem
   cells, as the other most important cell type for developing therapeutic
   cellular transplantation strategies following lesion of the central
   nervous system (CNS) and particularly in the case of spinal cord injury.
   OECs are macroglial cells whose precursors are located in the olfactory
   mucosa. OEC ensheath the axons of the sensory, olfactory, neurons, from
   the peripheral mucosa to the central olfactory bulbs. These glial cells
   constitute one of the rare macroglial cells which, after removal in the
   adult mammal, can survive in culture and multiply,. After post-traumatic
   transplantation in the CNS, these cells have induced several instances
   of functional recovery after injury of different neural systems. The
   ``OEC transplantation effect{''} consists in modifying the central
   inhibitory, environment to make it more propitious for axonal regrowth
   and cell survival (reduction of the glial scar; releasing of numerous
   survival and neurotrophic factors, and of surface, extracellular matrix
   and adhesion molecules). In addition to the fact that OEC can ensheath
   and/or myelinate central axons, migrate in the CNS and accompany, the
   growing axons over a relatively long distance, the,) also can be
   obtained from olfactory mucusa. OEC thus constitute a preferential
   candidate for autologous transplantation for the purposes of repair.}},

Abstract = {{Background: This report describes the development and the clinical
   evaluation of a novel confocal endomicroscope for obtaining fluorescence
   images of cellular morphology of the mucosae of the upper- and the
   lower-GI tract in vivo. The work assessed the feasibility of performing
   in vivo microscopy at endoscopic examination and evaluated fluorescence
   imaging protocols.
   Methods: images were collected in real time by using two prototype
   endoscope configurations, featuring slightly different miniaturized
   fiber-optic confocal microscopes, fitted integrally into the tips of
   conventional endoscopes. Confocal scanning was performed at 488 nm
   illumination for excitation of exogenously applied fluorophores (topical
   acriflavine and intravenous fluorescein). The images were compared with
   conventional histology of biopsy specimens and the findings of
   white-light endoscopy.
   Results: Confocal endomicroscopy enabled imaging of cellular and
   subcellular structures (i.e., nuclei) of the GI tract. The crypts of the
   colonic mucosa, the villi of the terminal ileum and duodenum, the
   gastric pits of the stomach and the squamous epithelium of the distal
   esophagus could be clearly visualized. Acriflavine strongly contrasted
   the cell nuclei of the surface epithelium, including the absorptive
   epithelial cells and the mucous secreting goblet cells. Fluorescein
   stained the extracellular matrix of the surface epithelium and also the
   subepithelial layers of the lamina propria. Images at increasing depth
   beneath the epithelium showed the mucosal capillary network. The
   findings correlated with the histology of biopsy specimens.
   Conclusions: The development of a fluorescence confocal endomicroscope
   makes it practical to examine the upper- and the lower-GI mucosa in
   cellular detail during otherwise routine endoscopic examination. The
   results represent a major technical advance in the development of this
   new optical imaging modality for the in vivo examination of GI tissue.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to adapt to environmental changes is based on the impressive
   capacity of the central nervous system for plasticity changes. A better
   understanding of the requirements of neuroplasticity will help to
   apprehend and predict the success of sensory prostheses. To investigate
   neuroplastic changes associated with (1) blindfolding and (2) the use of
   a mobile visual-auditory substitution system, five normally sighted
   adults underwent weekly measurements of neuromagnetic activity using a
   122-channel whole head neuromagnetometer. The substitution device
   converted visual images into sound patterns. During measurements
   subjects listened to ``geometric sounds{''} converted from images of
   geometric shapes, ``natural sounds{''} representing photographs of
   everyday objects, as well as to original ``environmental sounds{''}. To
   assess the role of visual deprivation, three individuals were
   blindfolded throughout a 3-week testing period. To assess the effect of
   extended exposure to ``visual sounds{''}, three subjects-two
   blindfolded, one sighted-had free use of the substitution device.
   Neuromagnetic responses were restricted to the auditory cortex across
   all measurements. Activity at 100 ms after presentation of ``natural
   sounds{''}, but not other auditory stimuli, showed a significant
   enhancement over time only in blindfolded subjects using the
   substitution system, indicating that the combination of visual
   deprivation and practice facilitated intra-modal plasticity. The fact
   that changes occurred only in response to ``natural sounds{''} probably
   reflects the increased behavioural relevance of this category evident
   only for blindfolded subjects using the substitution device.}},

Abstract = {{Peculiar dermatologic manifestations are present in several heritable
   gastrointestinal disorders. Muir-Torre syndrome (MTS) is a
   genodermatosis whose peculiar feature is the presence of sebaceous gland
   tumors associated with visceral malignancies. We describe one patient in
   whom multiple sebaceous gland tumors were associated with early onset
   colon and thyroid cancers and attenuated polyposis coli. Her family
   history was positive for colonic adenomas. She had a daughter presenting
   with yellow papules in the forehead region developed in the late
   infancy. Skin and visceral neoplasms were tested for microsatellite
   instability and immunohistochemical status of mismatch repair (MMR), APC
   and MYH proteins. The proband colon and skin tumors were microsatellite
   stable and showed normal expression of MMR proteins. Cytoplasmic
   expression of MYH protein was revealed in colonic cancer cells. Compound
   heterozygosity due to biallelic mutations in MYH, R168H and 379delC, was
   identified in the proband. The 11-year-old daughter was carrier of the
   monoallelic constitutional mutation 379delC in the MYH gene; in the
   sister, the R168H MYH gene mutation was detected. This report presents
   an interesting case of association between MYH-associated polyposis and
   sebaceous gland tumors. These findings suggest that patients with MTS
   phenotype that include colonic polyposis should be screened for MYH gene
   mutations.}},

   performance is strongly influenced by other components of the culture
   system, such as transitional conditions employed during the retrieval,
   pH, gas phase, and patient-specific characteristics. There is now

Abstract = {{Cognitive functions require the integrated activity of multiple

   Synchronization Likelihood (SL) method was developed as a general method
   to study both linear and nonlinear aspects of coupling. In the present
   study the genetic architecture of the SL in different frequency bands
   was investigated. Using a large genetically informative sample of 569
   subjects from 282 extended twin families we found that the SL is
   moderately to highly heritable (41-67\%) especially in the alpha
   frequency (8-13 Hz) range. This index of functional connectivity of the
   brain has been associated with a number of pathological states of the

Abstract = {{In the present paper we intend to discuss the question of pattern
   formation and complex dynamics developed in some lattice models.
   Dynamical systems are characterized by their coherent and chaotic
   natures. In this paper, we report non-linear lattice models which are
   good candidates to illustrate the fascinating complex dynamics occurring
   in some physical systems. One of the proposed models is devoted to the
   formation of localized structures in a two-dimensional lattice.
   Instability process of localized structures is examined in detail. The
   instability process is mostly related to the phase transformation in
   crystalline solids. On the basis of a two-dimensional lattice model
   involving non-linear and competing interactions the formation and
   dynamics of elastic domains and twin boundaries are investigated. The
   emphasis is placed especially on the instability mechanisms of a strain
   band and modulated strain structure with respect to the transverse
   perturbations then producing localized structures on the lattice. The
   long-time evolution of localized modes is also studied using asymptotic
   perturbative methods and an asymptotic equation is then deduced in the
   framework in the quasicontinuum approximation. Next, we propose a
   non-linear analysis in the vicinity of a critical point of the
   phonon-dispersion branch. From the non-linear analysis, we deduce, in
   the semidiscrete approach by using a multiscale technique, an amplitude
   equation of the Ginzburg-Landau type. The mechanism of self-generated
   non-linear localized modes in the two-dimensional lattice beyond the
   instability process or near the critical region of the phonon dispersion
   is numerically investigated. The numerical simulations exhibit
   non-trivial localized patterns. The second study deals with the soliton
   motion on a damped driven one-dimensional lattice. The lattice model is
   made of a one-dimensional chain equipped with rotatory molecules. The
   problem of soliton dynamics under the influence of discreteness effects,
   damping and time-dependent applied field allows Lis to show a transition
   to chaos of the soliton movement. Numerical simulations performed
   directly on the discrete system show a particularly rich dynamics of the
   lattice model. The last model we want to propose for illustration of the
   dynamics of non-linear systems is a one-dimensional lattice model with
   long-range interactions. In this part of the paper we are interested in
   the non-local description of the discrete system in the framework of the
   quasicontinuum approach. The idea is to consider a one-to-one
   correspondence between functions of discrete arguments and a class of
   analytic functions. The procedure allows Lis to use the same
   representation of the Lagrangian for all cases: discrete and analytic.
   The equation of motion deduced in the quasicontinuum representation is
   similar to that of a non-local model of elasticity including a local
   non-linear term. A perturbative asymptotic multiscale technique leads to
   an asymptotic equation for the long-time evolution of the non-linear
   wave. Numerical simulations are performed oil the discrete system for
   different ranges of non-local action showing the propagation of discrete
   kink in the lattice.}},

Abstract = {{Intraspecific phylogeography has been used widely as a tool to infer
   population history. However, little attention has been paid to Southeast
   Asia despite its importance in terms of biodiversity. Here we used the
   cytochrome oxidase I gene of mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA) for a
   phylogeographic study of 147 individuals of the black fly Simulium tani
   from Thailand. The mtDNA revealed high genetic differentiation between
   the major geographical regions of north, east and central/south
   Thailand. Mismatch distributions indicate population expansions during
   the mid-Pleistocene and the late Pleistocene suggesting that current
   population structure and diversity may be due in part to the species'
   response to Pleistocene climatic fluctuations. The genealogical
   structure of the haplotypes, high northern diversity and
   maximum-likelihood inference of historical migration rates, suggest that
   the eastern and central/southern populations originated from northern
   populations in the mid-Pleistocene. Subsequently, the eastern region had
   had a largely independent history but the central/southern population
   may be largely the result of recent ( c. 100 000 years ago) expansion,
   either from the north again, or from a relictual population in the
   central region. Cytological investigation revealed that populations from
   the south and east have two overlapping fixed chromosomal inversions.
   Since these populations also share ecological characteristics it
   suggests that inversions are involved in ecological adaptation. In
   conclusion both contemporary and historical ecological conditions are
   playing an important role in determining population genetic structure
   and diversity.}},

Abstract = {{This investigation presents the observations made pertaining to the
   lubricated sliding wear response of a zinc-based alloy containing nickel
   over a range of applied pressures and sliding speeds. Properties studied
   were wear rate and frictional heating. The varying wear response of the
   samples under different material and test conditions has been
   substantiated through the features of wear surfaces, subsurface regions,
   and debris. The role of various microconstituents in the material and
   their specific features have been correlated with the observed wear
   behaviour of the alloy in different material and test conditions.
   The wear rate and frictional heating increased with pressure and speed.
   The data plots in general comprised initially low slope followed by a
   higher slope at larger applied pressures. Heat-treated samples performed
   better than the ascast one except at the maximum sliding speed; a
   reverse trend was noted in the latter case.
   The study suggests the benefits of heat treatment in terms of improved
   wear response of the alloy under specific test conditions. Moreover, the
   wear behaviour of the samples for different material and test conditions
   could be explained in terms of the features of their microconstituents
   and the predominance of one set of factors causing improved wear
   behaviour over the other producing a reverse effect.}},

Abstract = {{Titanium silicalite (TS-1) loaded with sulfated zirconia as bifunctional
   oxidative and acidic catalyst has been synthesized at various loadings
   of zirconium (2-20 wt\%). Structure and properties of the samples were
   characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature programmed
   reduction (TPR), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and UV-vis diffuse
   reflectance (UV-vis DR) spectroscopy techniques. The monolayer
   dispersion capacity of zirconium on the TS-1 was found to be 0.65 Zr4+
   nm(-2) TS-1. The UV-vis DR spectroscopy showed that the tetrahedral
   coordination of the titanium was observed in all samples, while
   octahedral zirconium was only observed in the samples containing high
   amount of zirconium loading (10, 15 and 20 wt\%). The TPR profiles
   suggested that the zirconium structure impregnated on the surface of
   TS-1 with high amount of zirconium loading (15 and 20 wt\%) have a
   similar structure to sulfated zirconia calcined at 500 degrees C.
   Adsorption of pyridine onto the samples indicated that Bronsted acid
   sites are only present in samples with high sulfated zirconia loading,
   i.e. 15 and 20 wt\%. As analyzed by XRD, the formation of Bronsted acid
   sites is due to the presence of disulfate species on the surface of
   TS-1. It has been demonstrated that samples with 15 and 20 wt\% loadings
   of sulfated zirconia showed activity towards consecutive transformation
   of 1-octene to 1,2-octanediol through the formation of 1,2-epoxyoctane
   using aqueous hydrogen peroxide. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A population viability analysis is important for the management of
   endangered populations and requires the estimation of survival
   parameters. The long-tailed bat (Chalinolobus tuberculatus) is one of
   only two native terrestrial mammals currently found in New Zealand and
   is classed as vulnerable. Its viability in temperate beech (Nothofagus)
   forest, Eglinton Valley, Fiordland, New Zealand was estimated using
   mark-recapture data collected between 1993 and 2003 using the Program
   MARK. Survival was estimated based on a total of 5286 captures
   representing 1026 individuals. Overall annual survival varied between
   0.34 and 0.83 but varied significantly among three sub-populations and
   with sex and age. Females generally had a higher survival rate compared
   to males; and adults had higher survival relative to juveniles. Survival
   of all bats was lower in years when the number of introduced mammalian
   predators was high and when the winter temperature was warmer than
   average. High numbers of introduced predators occurred during three of
   the 10 years in the study. Climate change may mean that the conditions
   that promote high predator numbers may occur more frequently. A
   preliminary population viability analysis using a projection matrix on
   the overall adult female population showed an average 5\% decline per
   year (lambda = 0.95). Increased predator control targeting a range of
   predators is required in years when their numbers are high in order to
   halt the decline of this population of long-tailed bats. Population
   estimates using minimum number alive estimates supported the population
   estimates derived from Program MARK and a population viability analysis
   using matrices. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Coordinate metrology aims to answer two questions: whether a
   manufactured part meets design tolerance specifications and how well the
   manufactured part meets the specifications. Existing methods for
   analyzing measured coordinate data are not adequate or effective for
   parts of complex tolerance zones.
   This paper presents a new approach to dimensional qualification of
   manufactured parts. In this paper, we view the part qualification
   problem as an issue of finding an admissible point in transformation
   space. Based on the concept of admissible point, we develop theories and
   algorithms for part geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD\&T)
   conformance check. A formulation based on containment fit for tolerance
   check is developed. An admissible transformation volume (ATV) is used to
   quantitatively characterize the quality of manufactured parts with
   respect to design tolerance specifications.
   We examine our approach in three tolerance examples and conclude that
   admissible transformation volume is an effective metric for part
   dimensional quality gauging and it is especially useful for
   multi-tolerance zone check where traditional methods fail to address it
   effectively. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Decomposition losses from leaves of three evergreen chaparral species,
   scrub oak (Quercus dumosa), ceanothus (Ceanothus crassifolius), and
   manzanita (Arctostaphylos glauca), were quantified over a 2-y field
   exposure using litterbags. Changes in ash-free dry mass, C, and N were
   monitored at 2- to 6-month intervals at four replicate sites composed of
   patches of these three chaparral species. Three proximate C fractions
   were extracted from fresh and decomposing litter samples: polar and
   non-polar extractives (EXT), acid-solubles (ACID), and acid-insolubles
   (KLIG). The chemical structure of fresh and decomposed litter was
   additionally characterized using high-resolution solid-state C-13 NMR
   spectroscopy, while morphological properties were examined by scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM). After 2 y, the litters had lost between
   20.7\% +/- 1.2 (Ceanothus) and 35.2\% +/- 6.8 (Quercus) of their
   original ash-free dry mass. The manzanita decomposed at a significantly
   faster rate than the other two litter types during the first few months
   of field exposure. Yet, after 2 y, mass loss was greater for the oak.
   Differences in decomposition rates could not be accounted for based on a
   single litter quality index. Fresh manzanita exhibited a significantly
   higher N content, which could explain its initially faster decay rate.
   Fresh oak litter, on the other hand, had a relatively high ACID and
   O-alkyl C (O-ALK) content, which may have been responsible for its decay
   pattern. Fresh ceanothus contained a relatively low KLIG content, yet it
   decomposed more slowly than the two other species. The solid-state C-13
   NMR spectra of the ceanothus litter had two peaks characteristic of
   proanthocyanidins, which likely contributed to the recalcitrance of this
   litter type. SEM revealed that ceanothus leaf surfaces were left nearly
   unchanged after field exposure. In comparison, the oak and manzanita
   leaf surfaces were pitted and covered by microbial growth to the point
   of being unrecognizable. Taken together, our results indicate that a
   combination of biological, physical and chemical factors need to be
   examined to clarify the different decomposition rates and patterns of
   these three chaparral species. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We performed a preliminary feasibility and safety study using
   intravenous (IV) administration of a platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa
   inhibitor (abciximab) in conjunction with intraarterial (IA)
   administration of a thrombolytic agent (reteplase) in a primate model of
   intracranial thrombosis. We introduced thrombus through superselective
   catheterization of the intracranial segment of the internal carotid
   artery in 16 primates. The animals were randomly assigned to receive IA
   reteplase and IV abciximab ( n =4), IA reteplase and IV placebo ( n =4),
   IA placebo and IV abciximab ( n =4) or IA and IV placebo ( n =4).
   Recanalization was assessed by serial angiography during the 6-h period
   after initiation of treatment. Postmortem magnetic resonance (MR)
   imaging was performed to determine the presence of cerebral infarction
   or intracranial hemorrhage. Partial or complete recanalization at 6 h
   after initiation of treatment (decrease of two or more points in
   pre-treatment angiographic occlusion grade) was observed in two animals
   treated with IA reteplase and IV abciximab, three animals treated with
   IA reteplase alone and one animal treated with IV abciximab alone. No
   improvement in perfusion was observed in animals that received IV and IA
   placebo. Cerebral infarction was demonstrated on postmortem MR imaging
   in three animals that received IA and IV placebo and in one animal each
   from the groups that received IA reteplase and IV abciximab or IV
   abciximab alone. One animal that received IV abciximab alone had a small
   intracerebral hemorrhage on MR imaging. IA reteplase with or without
   abciximab appeared to be the most effective regimen for achieving
   recanalization in our model of intracranial thrombosis. Further studies
   are required in experimental models to determine the optimal dose,
   method of administration and efficacy of these medications in acute
   ischemic stroke.}},

Abstract = {{The mathematical formalism is studied for medium-foreign spherical
   inclusion models (in materials science) and body tissue - spherical
   tumor models (in oncology). It is established that they are similar,

   mathematical descriptions of very different types of processes (for
   example, diffusion and thermal conductivity, electromagnetic
   oscillations and sound, statistical mechanics and population dynamics).
   A typical process occurring with powders in metals technology and nature
   is a complex process including diffusion and chemical reaction. Such a
   process sometimes relates to diffusion in the active medium. Special
   cells in the body (lymphocytes) appear outside tumors, move toward them,
   penetrate into them, and trap tumor cells. It is suggested that the
   lymphocytes can be considered as analogs of diffusing particles (the
   diffusant) while the tumor cells can be considered as analogs of traps
   in the case of diffusion in an active medium. An equation is also
   proposed that describes the behavior of an ensemble of tumor cells under
   the influence of a magnetic field.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Although the rationale for earlier screening of persons with
   a family history of colorectal cancer is plausible, there is no direct
   evidence that earlier assessment is either effective or cost-effective.
   Objective: To estimate the clinical and economic effect of using family
   history assessment to identify persons for colorectal cancer screening
   before age 50.
   Methods: We developed a decision model to compare costs and outcomes for
   two scenarios: (a) standard population screening starting at age 50; (b)
   family history assessment at age 40, followed by screening colonoscopy
   at age 40 for those with a suggestive family history of colorectal
   cancer. The analysis was conducted using the health insurer perspective.
   Results: Using U.S. population estimates, 22 million would be eligible
   for family history assessment, and one million would be eligible for
   early colonoscopy; 2,834 invasive cancers would be detected, and 29,331
   life years would be gained. The initial program cost would be \$900
   million. The discounted cost per life year gained of family history
   assessment versus no assessment equals \$58,228. The results were most
   sensitive to the life expectancy benefit from earlier screening, the
   cost of colonoscopy, and the relative risk of colon cancer in those with
   a family history.
   Conclusions: The cost-effectiveness of family history assessment for
   colorectal cancer approaches that of other widely accepted technologies;
   yet, the results are sensitive to several assumptions where better data
   are needed. Because of the relatively high prevalence of family history
   in the population, careful analysis and empirical data are needed.}},

Abstract = {{The creation and detection of specific angular momentum states in
   Rydberg atoms is a significant advance in quantum-information
   processing. Detection of high angular momentum states in alkali-metal
   atoms is difficult because they are nearly-degenerate in energy. We
   present theoretical results on the detection of such states using
   terahertz-frequency half-cycle pulses (HCPs). Calculations are done for
   n=15,l=0,...,14 states in hydrogen and cesium using a grid-based
   pseudopotential method. Our results indicate that HCP redistribution is
   a reliable method of distinguishing angular momentum Rydberg states.}},

Abstract = {{The unsteady process of upstream head-on quenching of two laminar
   premixed hydrogen-air flames at different equivalence ratios in one
   dimension is investigated numerically in the presence of preferential
   and differential diffusion effects. important chemical and transport
   characteristics of the mutual annihilation process are studied during
   the two primary stages of upstream mutual annihilation, pre-heat layers'
   and reaction layers' interactions. Because of the diffusive mobility of
   the fuel, hydrogen, relative to heat and the oxidizer, preferential and
   differential diffusion effects result in a shift in the equivalence
   ratio in the reaction zone to leaner conditions. This shift, in turn,
   affects the subsequent reaction layers' interactions through qualitative
   and quantitative changes in the rates of reactants' consumption and
   radicals' production. Another consequence of this shift is the presence
   of excess and `unbumt' fuel or oxidizer at the end of the mutual
   annihilation process. The process of mutual annihilation occurs over
   time scales that are significantly shorter than characteristic residence
   times associated with flames.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental and clinical data indicate that tumor progression is

   biological and clinical characteristics with human NHL. In the present
   study, we evaluated this relationship in a series of 43 cases of canine
   NHL. The results demonstrate that both MVD and endothelial area ( EA)
   were significantly higher in high-grade compared to low-grade lymphoma
   and a good statistical correlation was found between MVD and EA. These
   data indicate that increased angiogenesis paralleled with increased
   malignancy grade in canine NHL, which represents an interesting tumor
   model for studying the role of angiogenesis as an interspecies pathway
   of tumoral malignancy and biological aggressiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Let W be a simple finite-dimensional Lie-algebra over the complex

   C{[}t(1)(+/- 1) .....t(n)(+/- 1)] is denoted by tau(0). We add degree
   derivations d(1) ..... d(n) to tau(0) and denote the resulting
   Lie-algebra by tau which we call a toroidal Lie-algebra, for n >= 2 it
   is known that the center of tau(0) is infinite dimensional. This
   intinite center, which is only an abelian ideal in tau, does not act as
   scalars on any irreducible representation of tau. In this paper, we
   prove that the study of irreducible representation of tau with
   finite-dimensional weight spaces is reduced to the study of irreducible
   representation for to tau(0) circle plus Cd-n with finite-dimensional
   weight spaces on which the center acts as scalars.
   In the process we prove an interesting result for n >= 2. Let (tau) over
   bar be the quotient of tau by the non-zero degree central operators.
   Then (tau) over bar does not admit representations with finite
   dimensional weight spaces where the zero degree center acts

Abstract = {{Objective: We sought to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a
   portable indirect flat-panel detector for low-dose imaging as compared
   with an asymmetric film-screen system in a pediatric intensive care
   unit.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 120 neonates underwent chest
   radiographs using a portable flat-panel detector (digital speed 800) and
   an asymmetric film-screen system (400 speed). Four readers evaluated the
   detection of 11 anatomic and 5 pathologic landmarks and 4 support
   devices. Statistical analysis was performed using repeated analysis of
   variance. The level of statistical significance was P = 0.05.
   Results: The detection of 4 anatomic/4 pathologic landmarks and 2
   support devices was significantly better using the flat-panel detector
   as compared with the asymmetric film-screen system (P < 0.05). Another 8
   anatomic and one pathologic landmarks were detected equally well or
   slightly better with the flat-panel detector (P > 0.05).
   Conclusions: The portable flat-panel detector offers the potential of a
   50\% dose reduction with equal or significantly better detection of
   clinically important structures.}},

Abstract = {{The semantic web for Earth and environmental terminology (SWEET) is an
   investigation in improving discovery and use of Earth science data,
   through software understanding of the semantics of web resources.
   Semantic understanding is enabled through the use of ontologics, or
   formal representations of technical concepts and their interrelations in
   a form that supports domain knowledge. The ultimate vision of the
   semantic web consists of web pages with XML namespace tags around terms,
   enabling search tools to ascertain their meanings by following the link
   to the defining ontologies. Such a scenario both reduces the number of
   false hits (where a search returns alternative, unintended meanings of a
   term) and increases the number of successful hits (where searcher and
   information provider have a syntax mismatch of the same concept). For
   SWEET, we developed a collection of ontologies using the web ontology
   language (OWL) that include both orthogonal concepts (space, time, Earth
   realms, physical quantities, etc.) and integrative science knowledge
   concepts (phenomena, events, etc.). This paper describes the development
   of a knowledge space for Earth system science and related concepts (such
   as data properties). Some of the ontology contents are ``virtual{''} by
   means of an OWL wrapper associated with terms in large external
   databases (including gazetteers and Earthquake databases). We developed
   a search tool that finds alternative search terms (based on the
   semantics) and redirects the expanded set of terms to a search engine.

   and characterization of 68 nitrogen-fixing root nodule bacteria
   collected from eight endemic tree species of Dalbergia in Madagascar.
   The isolates were characterized by (i) restriction fragment length
   polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of 16S-IGS rDNA, (ii) 16S rDNA gene
   sequencing and (iii) nodulation tests. Results revealed a wide diversity
   of bacteria present in the nodules of Dalbergia. Among the 68 isolated
   bacteria, 65 belonged to Bradyrhizobium, Mesorhizobium, Rhizobium,
   Azorhizobium and Phyllobacterium from the alpha-class of Proteobacteria,
   and three isolates belonged to Burkholderia and Ralstonia from the

Abstract = {{Current strategies for bone tissue regeneration focus on the development
   of implantable matrices that mimic biological tissues. Inorganic
   composites are of special interest for bone substitute applications. It
   is necessary to create an artificial three-dimensional scaffold-like
   porous material with certain geometrical structure to induce bone
   growth. We report here the growth of calcium phosphate crystals on
   free-standing carboxylic acid functionalized gold nanoparticle
   membranes. The gold nanoparticle membrane is synthesized by the
   spontaneous reduction of aqueous chloroaurate ions by a diamine molecule
   at a liquid-liquid interface. This membrane is robust and malleable, and
   most importantly, the gold nanoparticles in the membrane may be
   functionalized with suitable ligands. In this study, the amino acids
   aspartic acid and cysteine together with an aromatic bifunctional
   molecule, anthranilic acid, were used to modify the surface of the gold
   nanoparticles in the membrane. The free carboxylic acid groups on the
   gold nanoparticles further to functionalization with these molecules
   were then used to bind Ca2+ ions and reacted with phosphate ions to
   yield calcium phosphate. The nature of the nanogold surface modifier
   directed the formation of either crystalline hydroxyapatite or amorphous
   calcium phosphate. The nanogold membrane thus suggests potential
   biomedical application as biocompatible implants and grafts.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Recent prospective studies reported that increased plasma
   homocysteine levels are an independent predictor of osteoporotic
   fracture in elderly persons. These studies, however, did not take into
   account folate and vitamin B12, which are the major nutritional
   determinants of homocysteinemia.
   Methods. Incident osteoporotic fractures were assessed in 702 Italian
   participants aged 65-94 years with a mean follow-up of 4 years
   (1999/2000-2003/2004). A multivariable logistic regression model was
   used to study the relation of baseline plasma homocysteine, serum
   folate, and serum vitamin B12 with risk of fracture.
   Results. After adjustment for sociodemographic and clinical confounders,
   the odds ratio (OR) for each increase of I standard deviation in
   log-transformed plasma homocysteine was 1.39 (95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI], 1.01-1.91), but decreased to 1.22 (95\% CI, 0.85-1.74) after
   further adjustment for serum folate and vitamin B12. The corresponding
   multivariable-adjusted OR for hyperhomocysteinemia (plasma total
   homocysteine {[}tHcy] > 15 mu moL) was 1.58 (95\% CI, 0.71-3.53).
   Participants in the lowest serum folate quartile (>= 9.3 nmoI/L) had an
   increased risk of fracture than did those in higher quartiles
   (multivariable-adjusted OR = 2.06; 95\% CI 1.02-4.18), but no
   dose-related protective effect for increasing serum folate levels was
   found (multivariable-adjusted OR = 0.84 for each increase of I standard
   deviation in log-transformed serum folate, 95\% CI, 0.59-1.19). No
   independent association was found for serum vitamin B12.
   Conclusions. Low serum folate is responsible for the association between
   homocysteine and risk of osteoporotic fracture in elderly persons.}},

Abstract = {{How can we accelerate innovation and ensure effective dissemination of
   knowledge about online learning resources? This paper advocates
   strategies that systematically link online professional development with
   the research, development and diffusion cycle. The systemic approach we
   describe can accelerate knowledge advancement and help manage change by
   improving communication among teachers, trainers, developers and
   researchers. The examples that are provided are set within two funded
   projects in the United States that led to the development of two
   distinct but related strategies-the Online Site Evaluation Form for
   educators (a web-based review form used in workshops) and a six-week
   online course on technology-supported assessments. Both strategies make
   it easier to give feedback to developers and offer incentives to do so
   in ways that help teachers to learn about online resources individually
   and with colleagues. The examples are discussed with analysis of their
   strengths and weaknesses in supporting different modes of interaction.
   We highlight implications for instructional development, professional
   development, research and knowledge management in online communities.}},

Abstract = {{Structural transition can be induced in charged micelles by increasing
   the ionic strength of the medium. We have monitored the organization and
   dynamics of the functionally important tryptophan residues of gramicidin
   in spherical and rod-shaped sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles utilizing a
   combination of wavelength-selective fluorescence and related
   fluorescence approaches. Our results show that tryptophans in
   gramicidin, present in the single-stranded beta(6.3) conformation,
   experience slow solvent relaxation giving rise to red edge excitation
   shift in spherical and rod-shaped micelles. In addition, changes in
   fluorescence polarization with increasing excitation or emission
   wavelength reinforce that the gramicidin tryptophans are localized in
   motionally restricted regions of these micelles. Fluorescence quenching
   experiments using acrylamide as a quencher of tryptophan fluorescence
   show that there is reduced water penetration in rod-shaped micelles.
   Taken together, we show that gramicidin conformation and dynamics is
   sensitive to the salt-induced structural transition in charged micelles.
   In addition, these results demonstrate that deformation of the host
   assembly could modulate protein conformation and dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Positive and negative ion electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass
   spectral study of a new series of hybrid peptides, viz,
   BocN-alpha,beta-peptides and BocN-beta,alpha-peptides, synthesized from
   C-linked carbo-beta(3)-amino acids {[}Caa (S)] and L-Ala has been
   carried out. The alpha,beta-peptides have been differentiated from
   beta,alpha-peptides by the collision-induced dissociation (CID) of {[}M
   + H](+) and {[}M - H](-) ions in positive and negative ion ESI-MS
   respectively. The fragment ion {[}M + H - C(CH3)(3) + H](+) formed from
   {[}M + H](+) ions by the loss of 2-methyl-prop-2-ene in
   alpha,beta-peptides with L-Ala at the N-terminus is insignificant or
   totally absent for beta,alpha-peptides which have the Caa (S) at
   N-terminus. The fragment ion {[}M - H-C(CH3)(3)OH - HNCO](-) formed from
   {[}M - H](-) of beta,alpha-peptide acids is totally absent for
   alpha,beta-peptide acids. This has been attributed to the absence of the
   beta-methylene group in alpha,beta-peptides, and the participation of
   the beta-methylene group in the loss of HNCO in beta,alpha-peptide acids
   is confirmed by the deuteration experiments. The CID of {[}M + H-Boc +
   H](+) ions of these peptides also produce characteristic fragmentation.
   In the CID spectra of alpha,beta-peptides, the b(n)(+) ions and the
   resulting y(n)(+) ions occur at a mass difference of 243 and 71 Da
   corresponding to the successive losses of Caa and L-Ala, whereas a mass
   difference of 71 and 243 Da is observed for beta,alpha-peptides. In
   contrast to the CID of protonated peptides, the CID of {[}M - H](-) ions
   of the alpha,beta- and beta,alpha-peptide acids do not give b(n)(-) ions
   and show abundant z(n)(-) ions. Further, a pair of diastereomeric
   dipeptide esters and acids have been distinguished by the CID of {[}M +
   H](+) ions. The loss of 2-methyl-prop-2-ene is more pronounced for
   Boc-NH-Caa(R)-D-Ala-OCH3 (21) and Boc-NH-Caa(R)-D-AIa-OH (23) with Caa
   (R) at the N-terminus, whereas it is totally absent for Boc-NH-Caa
   (S)-D-Ala-OCH3 (22) and Boc-NH-Caa(S)-D-Ala-OH (24) peptides, which have
   Caa (S) at the N-terminus. Thus, on the basis of our previous and
   present studies, we propose that the CID of {[}M + H](+) ions provides a
   simple and useful method for distinguishing the configuration of Caa (S
   or R) at the N-terminus of BocN-carbo beta,alpha- and
   beta,beta-dipeptides. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction and objectives. To investigate the association between a
   patient's social network and hypertension risk in older adults in Spain
   and to determine whether the nature of the social network is related to
   a patient's awareness of hypertension, to disease treatment and control,
   or to adherence to hypertension drug therapy.
   Patients and method. Cross-sectional study of 3483 subjects
   representative of the non-institutionalized Spanish population aged 60
   years or more. Logistic regression analysis, adjusted for sex, age,
   educational level, lifestyle and frequency of medical consultation, was
   used to derive odds ratios (ORs) for associations between
   characteristics of the social network (e.g., marital status,
   cohabitation status, frequency of contact with family members, and
   frequency of contact with friends and neighbors) and aspects of
   hypertension.
   Results. The hypertension risk in married individuals and those living
   with others was less than in those who were unmarried (OR=0.79; 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI] 0.67-0.94) or who lived alone (OR=0,75; 95\%
   CI, 0.61-0.93). Men who saw their friends frequently were more likely to
   be aware of hypertension (OR=1.57; 95\% CI, 1.19-2.07). Women who saw
   their friends or neighbors frequently were less likely to be aware
   (OR=0.70; 95\% CI, 0.51-0.97). No clear relationship between social
   network characteristics and other hypertension-related variables was
   observed.
   Conclusions. In older adults, hypertension was associated with aspects
   of social integration, such as marital and cohabitation status. Among
   hypertensives, awareness of hypertension was partly related to the
   frequency of contact with family and friends or neighbors.}},

Abstract = {{The primary aim of this investigation was to determine the reliability
   and sensitivity of H-1 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-MRS) as a
   method for quantifying myocardial triglyceride (TG) content in humans
   over time and in response to metabolic perturbations. Three separate
   experiments were designed to quantify myocardial TG content 1) over a
   90-day period, 2) after a high-fat meal, and 3) after a 48-h fast.
   Proton spectra were collected from a 10 x 20 x 30-mm(3) voxel placed
   within the intraventricular septum, with measurements acquired at
   end-systole and end-expiration, using cardiac triggering and respiratory
   gating. Minimal variation was observed between myocardial TG content
   determined 90 days apart ( r = 0.98, CV = 5\%), whereas TG values were
   unaffected by a high-fat meal despite a significant twofold increase ( P
   < 0.05) in serum TG. In contrast, myocardial TG content increased
   threefold ( P < 0.05) after a 48-h fast despite a 25\% reduction in
   serum TG. Body mass index was significantly related to myocardial TG ( r
   = 0.58, P < 0.05) and the change in myocardial TG after a 48-h fast (
   r(2) = 0.60). H-1-MRS is a reliable method for the determination of
   myocardial TG in humans and is relatively unaffected by the consumption
   of one high-fat meal but sensitive to changes following a prolonged
   fast.}},

Abstract = {{The intra-articular migration of a femoral interference screw is a rare
   complication after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in
   the knee. Only a few reports of cases have been published within the
   last few years and different approaches toward this complication have
   been described. We report the case of a 23-year-old female patient who
   was admitted with knee pain after undergoing an ACL reconstruction 4
   years previously. After the clinical examination, a knee radiograph in 2
   planes revealed a dislocated femoral interference screw lying in the
   popliteal fossa. During arthroscopy, the interference screw was
   retrieved through an additional posteromedial portal to avoid an
   arthrotomy. The causes for intra-articular screw migration are multiple
   and most cases were reported in the early postoperative period. The
   arthroscopic removal of a screw is recommended because of the lower
   morbidity.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction A large increase in syphilis prevalence was noted in the
   Czech Republic during the last decade. It was associated with
   prostitution in cities and especially in areas bordering more
   economically developed countries. Foreigners account for more than 50\%
   of this increase. Absence of legislative regulations contributes to this
   situation.
   Objective To demonstrate the necessity of setting sexually transmitted
   disease (STD) fighting priority in the Czech Republic.
   Methods The authors review the development of legislation related to
   STDs in the context of geopolitical changes and the epidemiological
   situation in the Czech Republic by relating epidemiological,
   geopolitical and economic data.
   Results Venereal-diseases-related regulatory codes have existed in the
   Czech Republic for years; however, they became fragmented in several
   regulations and often do not have the status of law. It is a consequence
   of the transformation of the entire state health care delivery system to
   a private system. The treatment of foreigners, refugees and uninsured
   people is a major problem.
   Conclusion It is necessary to focus on special populations, such as
   homeless people, immigrants and prostitutes. It is desirable to
   strengthen international cooperation in combating STD as well as
   prostitution. Relevant legislation should be introduced to correlate the
   existing regulations and bring them up to date.}},

Abstract = {{Background: This prospective, randomized study compared the efficacy of
   the vertical infraclavicular and axillary approaches using a single
   injection blockade of the brachial plexus. The primary endpoint was
   complete blockade in dermatomes C5-Th1, while secondary endpoints
   included onset time, motor block, block performance time, surgical
   success rate, patient satisfaction, and side-effects/complications.
   Methods: Sixty patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical
   status I or II, scheduled for surgery of the forearm or hand received
   either a vertical infraclavicular (n = 30) or an axillary block (n =
   30). A single injection of 0.5 ml/kg ropivacaine 7.5 mg/ml was made
   after electrolocalization of nerve fibres corresponding to the median
   nerve at maximum 0.5 mA (2 Hz, 0.1 ms). Onset and distribution of
   analgesia and motor block were assessed at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 60 min
   after the local anaesthetic injection. A complete block was defined as
   analgesia in all dermatomes (C5-Th1) at 60 min post-injection.
   Results: The vertical infraclavicular approach provided complete
   blockade in 29 patients (97\%) and the axillary approach in 23 patients
   (77\%). Analgesia in C5-C6 dermatomes and corresponding motor block
   occurred significantly more frequently in the vertical infraclavicular
   approach, which also had the shortest onset time. Block procedure was
   quicker in the axillary approach. Side-effects were similar in both
   groups, and there were no permanent sequelae. Patient satisfaction was
   equally high in both groups.
   Conclusions: The vertical infraclavicular approach provides a more
   complete block than the axillary approach when using a single injection
   technique and equal volumes/doses of local anaesthetic.}},

Abstract = {{Dalyat mirabilis Mateu 2002 (Coleoptera: Carabidae) is a cave species
   recently described from SE Spain, which, based on morphological
   analyses, has been related to the Promecognathinae (with one genus in
   western North America and four genera in South Africa). In this paper,
   we investigated the phylogenetic relationships of the main lineages of
   family Carabidae, and the placement of Dalyat among them, with the 18S
   rRNA full sequence and a fragment of wingless with the use of parsimony,
   a fast maximum likelihood algorithm (implemented in the program PHYML),
   and Bayesian posterior probabilities. Although with wingless alone the
   relationships of Dalyat were not robustly supported, both with 18S rRNA
   and in a combined analysis there was a strong support for a sister
   relationship between Promecognathus and Dalyat with the three methods
   used. Using a molecular-clock approach the two lineages were estimated
   to have diverged at a similar (or slightly earlier) age than the origin
   of Harpalinae, known to have radiated in the Cretaceous. This is
   compatible with a vicariant origin of the lineage leading to Dalyat
   because of the isolation of the Iberian plate from Pangea in the late
   Jurassic to early Cretaceous. Other robust relationships within the
   Carabidae are the monophyly of Harpalinae (including Morionini,
   Peleciini and Pseudomorphini), its sister relationship with Brachininae,
   and the inclusion of these two subfamilies together with Scaritini and
   the austral Psydrinae in a strongly supported clade (the `higher'
   Carabidae).}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review The aim of this article is to evaluate food properties
   able to influence specific physiological targets that maybe helpful for
   the prevention and management of overweight and diabetes.
   Recent findings Observational and intervention studies have clearly
   shown that type 2 diabetes can be prevented by lifestyle measures,
   including reduced energy intake to induce a modest but sustained weight
   reduction, together with changes in diet composition.
   Summary Foods can be regarded as functional if proven to affect
   beneficially one or more target functions in the body, beyond adequate
   nutritional effects, in a way relevant to improved state of health and
   well-being, reduction of risk of diseases, or both. Functional foods
   might have a particularly high impact for prevention or treatment of
   overweight and diabetes for which, more than in many other fields, the
   link between nutrition, biological responses and diseases is clearly
   established. Functional foods for obesity should be able to influence
   the energy balance equation regulated by the control of energy intake or
   of energy dissipated as heat (thermogenesis). For prevention of type 2
   diabetes, several unmodified foods with functional properties have
   already been identified (low saturated fat products, vegetables, fruit,
   wholegrain foods, low glycemic index starchy foods). Overall, the
   available evidence on functional foods so far identified in this field
   is incomplete: the major gap is the lack of diet-based intervention
   trials of sufficient duration to be relevant for the natural history of
   diseases like overweight and diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate whether expression of the four members of the
   neurotrophin (NT) family and their four corresponding receptors is
   related to synovial inflammation in patients with spondyloarthritis
   (SpA). Material and
   Methods: Synovial fluid ( SF) and serum NTs and their receptors were
   measured by ELISA. Immunohistochemistry was used for synovial tissue
   biopsy specimens from patients with SpA, rheumatoid arthritis, and
   osteoarthritis (OA). In SpA synovium, immunoreactivity of the receptors
   trkA and NGFRp75 was also assessed before and after 12 weeks of
   treatment with the monoclonal anti-tumour necrosis factor a antibody,
   infliximab.
   Results: mRNA transcripts of all NTs and receptors were expressed in the
   inflamed synovium. At the protein level, brain derived neurotrophic
   factor and NT-3 were significantly higher in the SF of patients with SpA
   than in those with OA. In contrast, ELISA of serum samples showed that
   the highest member in SpA was NT-4. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated
   that the NT receptors trkA and NGFRp75 were highly expressed in the
   inflamed synovium of patients with SpA, correlating with vascularity and
   lymphoid aggregates, respectively. Additionally, immunoreactivity of
   both receptors was significantly decreased after infliximab treatment.
   Conclusions: NTs and their receptors are expressed in inflamed
   peripheral joints of patients with SpA. Their expression is not
   constitutive but related to inflammation and they may be involved in the
   local disease processes.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. The deficit in transplant organs has made it necessary to
   search for alternatives, among them research into xenotransplantation.
   However, the use of animal organs may cause rejection in society and
   among health professionals. The objective was to analyze the acceptance
   of this therapy among Residents, given that they would be the
   professionals most involved in its application if such a therapy proves
   to be useful.
   Materials and methods. A random sample stratified by the services of the
   Residents in a third-level hospital with an organ transplant program and
   accredited for teaching at undergraduate and postgraduate levels (n =
   171). The attitude toward xenotransplantation was evaluated using a
   questionnaire that analyzes different pychosocial variables that 5 may
   influence such attitude.
   Results. The sample consisted of 171 residents (mean age 28 4 years;
   56\% women). Attitudes toward xenotransplantation, whether the results
   were similar to those obtained with human organs, were positive in 81\%
   (n = 138) of cases, with 16\% (n = 27) having doubts and 3\% (n = 6)
   being against. The attitude was more favorable among residents in favor
   of cadaveric donation (83\% vs 57\%; P <.05) and of living donation
   either of the kidney (90\% vs 55\%; P <.001) or of the liver (88\% vs
   56\%; P <.001), and among those who consider that they might need a
   transplant at a given point in the future (88\% vs 73\%; P <.05).
   Conclusion. Residents have a positive attitude toward the application of
   a possible xenotransplantation in safe conditions similar to those that
   currently exist in human organ donation. Such a favorable attitude was
   greatly influenced by a positive attitude toward human organ donation,
   in cadaveric as well as in living donation, and when considering oneself
   to be a possible candidate for a transplant.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This Article examines proportionality as a constitutional limitation on
   the power to punish. In the criminal context, proportionality is often
   mischaracterized as a specifically penological theory-an ideal linked to
   specific accounts of the purpose of punishment. In fact, a
   constitutional proportionality requirement is better understood as an
   external limitation on the state's penal power that is independent of
   the goals of punishment. Proportionality limitations on the penal power
   arise not from the purposes of punishment, but from the fact that
   punishing is not the only purpose that the state must pursue. Other
   considerations, especially the protection of individual interests in
   liberty and equality, restrict the pursuit of penological goals.
   Principles of proportionality put the limits into any theory of limited
   government, and proportionality in the sentencing context is just one
   instance of these limitations on state power. This understanding of
   proportionality gives reason to doubt the assertion that determinations
   of proportionality are necessarily best left to legislatures. In
   doctrinal contexts other than criminal sentencing, proportionality is
   frequently used as a mechanism of judicial review to prevent legislative
   encroachments on individual rights and other exercises of excessive
   power. In the criminal sentencing context, a constitutional
   proportionality requirement should serve as a limit on penal power.}},

Abstract = {{The dachsous (ds), fat (ft), and four-jointed (fj) genes have been
   identified in Drosophila as part of a signaling pathway that regulates

   been identified in vertebrates, but nothing is known thus far about the
   conservation of Ds/Ft/Fj signaling. Here we analyzed and compared for
   the first time the expression patterns of all ds, ft and fj homologs in
   the mouse. During embryogenesis, expression analysis was performed by
   RNA in situ hybridization and in adult organs by real time PCR. As in
   Drosophila, we detected a complementary expression of fjx1 and dchs1 in
   organs like kidney, lung, and intestine. The ubiquitous expression of ft
   in several tissues in Drosophila appears to be split into an epithelial
   expression of fat1/fat3 and a mesenchymal expression of fat-j. These

Abstract = {{Scanning force microscopy has been demonstrated to be an effective
   binding event detection step for immunoassays. In its simplest
   form-analysing small area images-the detection limit of the scanning
   force microscopic immunoassay (SFMIA) has been shown to be comparable to
   existing techniques. In the present work, we have examined how the
   performance of image analysis-based SFMIA can be improved. Firstly, we
   have used a surface analysis parameter that increases linearly with the
   concentration of binding events. This parameter-the surface area
   ratio-is the ratio of the surface area after antigen binding to the
   surface area of the original biospecific surface. With this parameter,
   SFMIA images can be rapidly analysed and converted into assay units.
   Secondly, we have demonstrated that by using silicon wafer supports that
   carry fiducial marks we can relocate to very high accuracy onto the
   biospecific surfaces and identify the changes due to antigen binding. By
   relocating in this manner the signal to noise ratio of the technique is
   enhanced. Thirdly, from simulations we have determined the SFM tip size
   and image area that optimizes the immunoassay sensitivity. (c) 2005

Year = {{2005}},

Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{1341-1354}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Conventional meteoroid theory assumes that the dominant mode of ablation
   (which we will refer to as thermal ablation) is by evaporation following
   intense heating during atmospheric flight. Light production results from
   excitation of ablated meteoroid atoms following collisions with
   atmospheric constituents. In this paper, we consider the question of
   whether sputtering may provide an alternative disintegration process of
   some importance. For meteoroids in the mass range from 10(-3) to 10(-13)
   kg and covering a meteor velocity range from 11 to 71 km/s, we
   numerically modeled both thermal ablation and sputtering ablation during
   atmospheric flight. We considered three meteoroid models believed to be
   representative of asteroidal (3300 kg/m(3) mass density), cometary (1000
   kg/m(3)) and porous cometary (300 kg/m(3)) meteoroid structures.
   Atmospheric profiles which considered the molecular compositions at
   different heights were use in the sputtering calculations. We find that
   while in many cases (particularly at low velocities and for relatively
   large meteoroid masses) sputtering contributes only a small amount of
   mass loss during atmospheric flight, in some cases sputtering is very
   important. For example, a 10(-10) kg porous meteoroid at 40 km/s will
   lose nearly 51\% of its mass by sputtering, while a 10(-13) kg
   asteroidal meteoroid at 60 km/s will lose nearly 83\% of its mass by
   sputtering. We argue that sputtering may explain the light production
   observed at very great heights in some Leonid meteors. We discuss
   methods to observationally test the predictions of these computations. A
   search for early gradual tails on meteor light curves prior to the
   commencement of intense thermal ablation possibly represents the most
   promising approach. The impact of this work will be most dramatic for
   very small meteoroids such as those observed with large aperture radars.
   The heights of ablation and decelerations observed using these systems
   may provide evidence for the importance of sputtering. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Purpose: To examine the expression of HLA-DR, a marker of inflammation,
   in the early stages of dry eye disease and to locate the appearance of
   this marker on specific areas of the bulbar conjunctiva.
   Methods: Dry eye patients were identified and their condition classified
   as mild (n = 16) or moderate (n = 16) based on Schirmer testing, vital
   staining, tear break-up time, and symptom questionnaire scores. Brush
   cytology was used to collect epithelial cells from the nasal, temporal,
   and superior conjunctivae of patients and age-matched controls. HLA-DR
   positive cells were detected by immunohistochemical staining and
   quantified.
   Results: Patients with moderate dry eye had the highest rate of
   conjunctival HLA-DR positive cells, with significantly higher rates than
   controls regardless of which region of the conjunctiva was sampled (P <
   0.01). The mild dry eye group had similar rates of HLA-DR-positive cells
   in the superior conjunctival region compared with controls. However, in
   the nasal and temporal regions, they displayed a significantly higher
   rate of HLA-DR-positive cells than controls (P < 0.01) and the nasal
   region showed a significant difference (P < 0.01) when compared with the
   temporal one. Some of these mild dry eyes had no vital staining.
   Conclusions: The HLA-DR expression pattern in mild and moderate dry eyes

   to elucidate whether the depressive effect of the hormone on abomasal

   influences. In 4 non-fasted rams equipped with bipolar electodes
   implanted onto the abomasal and small-intestinal wall, the myoelectric
   activity was recorded before and after intravenous administration of
   cholecystokinin octapeptide (OP-CCK) at the doses 4.4, 17.5 or 175
   pmol/kg during 30, 60 or 120 s and of cerulein at the doses 1.35, 13.5
   or 135 pmol/kg (pharmacological dose) during the same time periods. It
   was found that the doses considered as physiological ones did not alter
   significantly the slow wave amplitude in abomasum. OP-CCK at the highest
   dose and cerulein at the dose 13.5 pmol/kg increased significantly the
   slow wave frequency. Both highest doses of OP-CCK and all doses of
   cerulein lowered significantly the myoelectric activity index values in

   abomasal myoelectric activity in sheep exhibits the features of

   the desired response signal is not known explicitly. The derivation of
   the QRD-LSL algorithm is based on a significantly reorganized version of
   a QRD-RLS-based unconstrained optimal filtering scheme. Overall an order

Abstract = {{Thyroid cancer incidence rates have increased steadily in the United
   States and elsewhere. Radiation exposure at a young age is a strong risk
   factor, but otherwise the etiology is unclear. To explore etiologic
   clues, we studied the risk of thyroid cancer after an earlier primary
   cancer, as well as the risk of developing multiple primaries after an
   earlier thyroid cancer in the U.S. Surveillance, Epidemiology and
   End-Results (SEER) cancer registries program (1973-2000). In 2,036,597
   patients diagnosed with any invasive cancer who survived for a minimum
   of 2 months, we observed a 42\% increased risk compared to the general
   population for second thyroid cancer based on 1,366 cases (95\%
   confidence interval (CI) = 35-50\%; excess absolute risk (EAR) = 0.38/
   10,000 person-years (PY)). Elevated risks were observed after most
   cancer sites studied. The most pronounced excess (observed/ expected
   (O/E) = 2.86) was seen for second thyroid cancers detected in the year
   after diagnosis of the first cancer. Among 29,456 2-month thyroid cancer
   survivors, 2,214 second cancers occurred (O/E = 1.11, 95\% CI =
   1.06-1.15; EAR = 7.64/10,000 PY). Again, the highest risk was seen in
   the first year (O/E = 1.26). Patients < 40 years of age at diagnosis of
   thyroid cancer had a 39\% increased risk of a second cancer, whereas for
   older patients the risk was elevated 6\%. We observed consistently
   increased risks for cancers of the breast, prostate, and kidney, and a
   likely radiation treatment-related excess of leukemia. Based on small
   numbers of cases, cancers of the salivary glands, trachea, scrotum,
   adrenal glands, and brain and central nervous system (CNS) also occurred
   in excess. A decreased risk was observed for smoking-related
   malignancies. Thyroid cancer is associated with primary cancers of many
   different organs. Although enhanced medical surveillance likely plays a
   role, 2-way, positive associations between thyroid cancer and cancers of
   the breast, prostate, kidney, salivary glands, brain and CNS, scrotum,
   and leukemia suggest etiologic similarities and possible treatment
   effects. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

   and learning on an experimental construction site that are significant
   for the promotion of a safety culture. It seeks to display the methods
   of understanding used by site personnel to constitute the construction
   site as a local work site. In making these explicit, an alternative is
   offered to recent suggestions that critical studies of situated learning
   demand recourse to historical or macro resources. Findings confirm
   insights from previous studies, detailing in addition: the role of trial
   and error; alternative bodies of knowledge underpinning competing
   authority structures; and complex and subtle patterns of the informal
   authority of elite manual workers, its ambiguity and its limitations.
   The experiential knowledge valued by site personnel forms a basis for
   the recognition of authority on site that can conflict with that of
   construction professionals. The conflict between forms of authority and
   knowledge can inhibit the dissemination of good safety practice:
   initiatives will meet significant resistance if they contradict the
   experiential knowledge of site operatives; if they do not make use of
   this experiential knowledge, they may fail to address hazards fully;
   methods of site learning, particularly in the development of innovative
   practice, are inherently hazardous.}},

Abstract = {{Question: Do soil treatments and addition of seed facilitate rapid
   vegetation restoration on forest paths excluded from trampling?
   Location: Six mesophilic mixed deciduous Querco-Fagetea forests in
   Flanders, northern Belgium.
   Methods: Enclosures on paths were excluded from trampling by fencing. In
   a full factorial design, plots were subjected to seeding, soil
   scarification, addition of organic material and inoculum. The following
   two years, seedling establishment and growth were sampled during spring
   and summer. Soil treatments and seeding effect was tested and seedling
   occurrence was analysed in relation to species' origin.
   Results: Spontaneous revegetation was significant in all plots since
   fencing. Throughout the observation period seedling cover and height
   continued to increase. Seeding had an overall effect on seedling
   density, cover and height. Some soil treatment interactions
   significantly enhance revegetation, although each individual soil
   treatment had no significant effect. Regardless of the seeded
   individuals, invading species mostly originated from the surrounding
   area and the seed bank.
   Conclusion: The preliminary results of this experiment imply that
   seeding is the only treatment which has a positive effect on
   revegetation success in all circumstances, provided that the exclusion
   from trampling is effective.}},

Abstract = {{The steady increase in the use of medical implants and the associated
   rise of medical device infections has fuelled the need for the
   production of biomaterials with improved biocompatibility.
   2-(methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (MPC) based coatings have
   been used to improve the biocompatibility of a number of different
   medical devices. Recent studies have investigated the use of a
   phosphorylcholine modified with cationic charge to encourage specific
   bio-interaction. Until now the affect of cationic charge incorporation
   in MPC copolymers on bacterial adhesion has not been investigated. This
   study attempts to address this by investigating the affect of charge on
   four different strains of bacteria commonly associated with medical
   device infections. In addition, the affect of pre-incubating these
   MPC-copolymers in heparin is also evaluated as this has previously been
   shown to improve biocompatibility and reduce bacterial adhesion.
   Bacterial adhesion was assessed by ATP bioluminescence and Scanning
   Electron Microscopy (SEM). Results suggest that bacterial adhesion
   generally increased with increasing cationic charge. When samples were
   however, pre-incubated with heparin a significant reduction in bacterial
   adhesion to the MPC-based, samples was observed. The heparin remained
   bound and effective at reducing bacterial adhesion to the cationic
   MPC-based samples even after three weeks incubation in PBS. To conclude,
   the MPC-based cationic polymer coatings complexed with heparin may
   provide a promising solution to reduce medical device related
   infections. (C) 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{A comparative study on galvannealed (GA) and galvanised plain-skin
   passed (GP-SP) coatings was carried out to evaluate coating
   microstructures, the corrosion resistance and electrochemical behaviour
   in 3.5\% NaCl solution. The corrosion resistance behaviour of GA coating
   was found to be superior compared to GP-SP coating. The Fe-Zn
   intermetallic phases formed in GA coating provided galvanic protection
   i.e., a cell reaction between Fe and Zn within a single phase. This
   gives rise to protective potential plateau and are believed to be
   responsible for the electrochemical polarisation resulting in sluggish
   corrosion reaction kinetics, thereby reducing the corrosion rate
   significantly after prolonged exposure in saline environment. It was
   also observed from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
   study that the coating capacitance (C-c) decreased and polarisation
   resistance (R-p) increased with exposure time indicating a continuous
   charge transfer reaction across the coating and electrolyte interface.
   Although the corrosion potential of both coatings increased towards more
   noble direction with exposure time, it was observed that the potential
   for GA coatings was always nobler than GP-SP coating as E-corr shifted
   towards more positive potential corresponding to a flat potential band
   of -850 +/- 20 mV. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The coexistence of competitive species with a shared predator is well
   established. The effect of `food-value' on predator-prey dynamics has
   also received much attention. However, the Study of a nutrient bound of
   prey, specifically on predator-mediated competitive-coexistence has not
   received much attention. Here we study the effects of the caloric
   content or a nutrient bound of prey on the dynamics of
   competitive-coexistence with the shared predator in a specific model. We
   propose and analyze a mathematical model for exploitative competition of
   two prey species with a shared predator. The change of dynamic stability
   due to the variation of a nutrient bound of each prey on
   predator-mediated dynamics is studied through extensive numerical
   experiments. Our analytical and numerical results demonstrate that
   variation in a nutrient bound promotes the switching of dynamics and may
   be treated as a driving force for the dynamics of
   competitive-coexistence with the shared predator. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Volume = {{6}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The unusual amino acid diaminopimelic acid (DAP) was prepared by cross
   metathesis of appropriately protected vinyl glycine and allyl glycine
   derivatives. Catalytic hydrogenation of the cross-coupling product
   resulted in reduction of the double bond and the removal of protecting
   groups. The resulting compounds were appropriately protected for the
   polymer-supported and solution-phase synthesis of muramyl tripeptides 2
   and 3, which differ in the amidation of the a-carboxylic acids of the
   isoglutamine and DAP moieties. Muramyl dipeptide (1, MDP), the
   DAP-containing muramyl tripeptide 3, and the lysine-containing muramyl
   tripeptides 4 and 5 induced TNF-alpha gene expression without TNF-a
   protein production in a human monocytic cell line. The observed block in
   translation could be removed by co-incubation with LPS, resulting in an
   apparent synergistic effect. Compound 2 did not induce TNF-alpha gene
   expression, neither did it exhibit a synergistic effect with LPS; this
   indicates that amidation of the a-carboxylic acids of the isoglutamine
   and DAP moieties results in a loss of biological activity. It is
   proposed that amidation of a-carboxylic acids is a strategy that may be
   used by pathogens to avoid detection by the innate immune system.
   Furthermore, the pattern recognition receptors Nod1 and Nod2 have been
   implicated in the possible induction of a synergistic effect of
   muropeptides with LPS.}},

Abstract = {{Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerged human
   infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
   coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV is a major
   virion structural protein. It plays an important role in the interaction
   with receptors and neutralizing antibodies. Previously study
   demonstrated that amino acids 318 to 510 is the receptor binding domain
   of SARS-CoV spike protein. The receptor-binding domain of the spike
   protein was expressed by fusion with GST in a pGEX-6p-1 vector. Western
   blot results demonstrated that this fragment could be recognized by SARS
   convalescent sera and spike protein specific monoclonal antibody. To map
   the antigenic epitope of this region, a set of 23 partially overlapping
   fragments spanning the fragment were fused with GST and expressed. Then
   Western blot and ELISA reactivity of these short peptide fused protein
   to immunized sera and monoclonal antibody D3D1 were surveyed. Two linear
   antigenic epitopes SRBD3 (334 similar to 349) and D3D1 (447 similar to
   455) were identified. Identification of antigenic epitopes of the spike
   protein of SARS-CoV may provide the basis for the development of
   immunity-based prophylactic, therapeutic, and diagnostic clinical
   techniques for severe acute respiratory syndrome.}},

Journal = {{ENDOCRINE}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{209-216}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Nitric oxide (NO), a highly reactive free radical, has been identified
   as a neurotransmitter in the central and peripheral nervous system. NO
   synthase (NOS) is the enzyme responsible for NO production from
   L-arginine and plays an important role in regulating the release of
   several hypothalamic peptides. In the pituitary, NO was found to
   increase growth hormone (GH) secretion in several in vitro and in vivo
   models. However, its role in human GH regulation is unknown. The aim of
   this study was to investigate the regulatory effects of NO on human GH
   and prolactin secretion using primary cell cultures of human fetal
   pituitaries and cultured hormone-secreting adenomas. incubation of the
   human fetal pituitaries (21-24 wk gestation) in the presence of sodium
   nitroprusside (SNP; 1 mM), a NO donor, for 4 h resulted in a 50-75\%
   increase in GH secretion, similar to the stimulatory effect evoked by
   growth hormone-releasing hormone (GH RH) (10 nM). However, fetal PRL
   secretion was not affected by SNP. GH release was also stimulated
   (40-70\% increase) by SNIP in 60\% of the cultured GH-secreting adenomas
   studied. SNP-induced GH release was inhibited in both fetal and
   adenomatous cells by PTIO, a NO scavenger. The addition of cGMP (0.1-1
   mM), the second messenger of multiple NO actions, enhanced fetal and
   adenomatous GH secretion by 55-95\%. Neuronal NOS (nNOS) was expressed
   in normal (fetal and adult) human pituitary tissues and in GH-secreting
   adenomas. Examination of its functional expression using L-arginine (1
   mu M) yielded a 35\% increase in GH release from cultured GH-secreting
   adenoma. This response was blocked by a NOS inhibitor with high
   selectivity for the neuronal enzyme and by a guanylyl cyclase inhibitor.
   In conclusion, NO stimulates human GH in cultured fetal pituitaries and
   GH-secreting adenomas. Cyclic GMP is probably involved in this hormonal
   regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To describe the anesthetic management of a patient with
   previous left lower lobe resection who was submitted to a right upper
   lobectomy and review the changes in gas exchange and respiratory
   mechanics which occurred intraoperatively.
   Clinical features: A 69-yr-old male with lung cancer, emphysema and
   obstructive sleep apnea, presented for a right upper lobectomy. His
   history was also positive for a left lower lobectomy six years
   previously. Intraoperative lung isolation was achieved using a 41 F left
   double-lumen tube (DLT). Monitoring the respiratory mechanics allowed
   for continuous adjustment of ventilator settings during the various
   phases of the surgery avoiding the risks of barotrauma and volutrauma.
   Problems with oxygenation occurred during one-lung ventilation.
   Conclusion: This case report shows that a severe level of hypoxemia and
   hypercarbia associated to lung mechanical property changes can be
   observed during the OLV phase. Application of continuous positive airway
   pressure on the non-dependent lung partially corrected blood
   oxygenation. Lobe isolation techniques should be considered as useful
   options for intraoperative airway management for these patients.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Aim: Involvement of oxidative stress and nitric oxide synthase (NOS)
   isoforms in skeletal muscle cellular adaptations to chronic heart
   failure (CHF) is controversial, and possible muscle fibre-type
   heterogeneity in the oxidative stress and NOS responses to CHF have not
   been examined. Consequently, we hypothesized that the changes in
   determinants of elevated oxidative and nitrosylative stress associated
   with CHF would occur in skeletal muscle and would be similar in
   predominantly type I slow twitch muscle (soleus) and type II fast twitch
   muscle (plantaris) of rats.
   Methods: The purpose of this study was to measure NOS isoforms
   (endothelial, inducible and neuronal NOS) and antioxidant enzymes
   (SOD-1, SOD-2, catalase) by protein immunoblot as well as markers of
   oxidative stress by biochemical assays in soleus and plantaris muscle
   sections of the rat hind limb. This was performed for control and
   post-infarction, compensated CHF rats.
   Results: Twelve weeks after coronary artery ligation-induced moderate
   CHF, soleus exhibited decreased SOD-1, SOD-2 and eNOS, but increased
   iNOS and nNOS isoforms assessed by immunoblot. This was associated with
   elevated lipid and DNA oxidative damage assessed by biochemical assays.
   In contrast, plantaris muscle exhibited no changes in antioxidant
   enzymes or NOS isoforms, and had lower lipid and DNA oxidative damage.
   Conclusion: These observations suggest a heretofore unreported muscle
   fibre-type-specific response of oxidative stress and NOS isoforms to CHF
   is of importance in understanding the cellular mechanisms of skeletal
   muscle dysfunction in CHF.}},

   bulk tank milk samples in the Czech Republic during the year 2003 (74
   174; 73 921 and 33 020 records of BTSCC, BTTBC and BTCBC estimations,
   respectively, in milk from 2769 suppliers). Raw data of BTSCC (with
   arithmetic mean 220 000/ml; 95th percentile=502 000/ml; 99th
   percentile=784 000/ml) indicated that the BTSCC limit was exceeded in
   12\% of samples. BTSCC did not sufficiently reflect the hygiene status
   of particular producing herds because correlation coefficients between
   bulk tank milk somatic cell score (BTSCS) and log BTTBC or log BTCBC
   were low. Categorization of herds according to the percentage of records
   exceeding the BTSCC limit gave significantly higher correlation
   coefficients for the association between this characteristic and log
   BTTBC or log BTCBC (r=0(.)84 and r=0(.)68, respectively). The percentage
   of records exceeding the BTSCC limit was a useful tool to highlight
   problem herds kept in inadequate hygienic conditions in primary milk
   production. Likewise, the value of BTSCS>5 seemed to be a useful tool
   for the discrimination of problem herds.}},

Abstract = {{The development of a propeller model that will accurately predict
   airplane engine static and dynamic thrust and torque in a full range of

   propeller characteristics over a wide operating range. Measurements of
   airplane indicated airspeed, flight altitude, torque, propeller speed,

   thrust estimation. A check of the model showed that the predicted and
   measured values of static thrust, torque, and dynamic thrust were within
   less than 2\% over a wide range of advance ratios. With an accurate
   model of in-flight thrust measurement, one could add a new gage on

Abstract = {{Osteointegration of metal implants into aged organisms can be severely
   compromised due to reduced healing capacity of bone, lack of precursor
   cells for new bone formation, or osteoporosis. Here, we report on
   successful implant healing in a novel model of aged sheep in the
   presence of nonglycosylated bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2).
   Ewes of 8 to 12 years with significant radiologic and histologic signs
   of osteoporosis and adipocytic bone marrow received a cylindrical
   hydroxyapatite-titanium implant of 12 x 10 mm. BMP-2 has been produced
   as a bacterial recombinant fusion protein with maltose-binding protein
   and in vitro generation of mature BMP-2 by renaturation and proteolytic
   cleavage.
   A BMP-2 inhibition ELISA was developed to measure the in vitro release
   kinetics of bioactive human BMP-2 from immersed solid implant materials
   by using Escherichia coli expressed and biotinylated recombinant human
   BMP-2 receptor IA extracellular domain (ALK-3 ECD). The implants were
   placed laterally below both tibial plateaus, with the left leg implant
   carrying 380 mu g BMP-2. Both implant types became integrated within the
   following 20 weeks. The control implant only integrated at the cortical
   bone, and little new bone formation was found within the pre-existing
   trabecular bone or the marrow cavity. Marrow fat tissue was partially
   replaced by unspecific connective tissue. In contrast, BMP-2-coated
   implants initiated significant new bone formation, initially in
   trabecular arrangements to be replaced by cortical-like bone after 20
   weeks. The new bone was oriented towards the cylinder. Highly viable
   bone marrow appeared and filled the lacunar Structures of the new bone.
   In mechanical tests, the BMP-2-coated implants displayed in average 50\%
   higher stability. This animal model provided first evidence that
   application of nonglycosylated BMP-2 coated on solid implants may foster
   bone healing and regeneration even in aged-compromised individuals. (c)

   for their inhibitory activity against purified group I and II
   phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) enzymes from snake venom and human
   inflammatory synovial fluid. Irrespective of modification to the
   pharmacophore (isoxazolidine ring), they exhibited greater specificity
   for group II PLA(2) The length of alkyl or aryl group at the 5th
   position, which alters the hydrophobic and aromatic property, was
   responsible for enhancing the inhibition towards PLA(2) enzymes. All of
   the compounds quench the fluorescent property of the purified PLA2
   enzyme, and quenching increases with the increase in length of alkyl or
   aryl group. The inhibitory effect of compounds appeared to be due to the
   direct interaction of compounds with the enzyme. Inhibition is
   substrate-dependent, and the inhibitor likely competes with the
   substrate for the same binding site of the enzyme. The IC50 value for
   the most potent interacting inhibitor 5b(v) was 54.8 mu M. The most
   active interacting compounds 5a(v) and 5b(v) from in vitro inhibition of

Abstract = {{The autoxidation of p-xylene (pX) was carried out with the
   Co(OAc)(2)/Mn(OAc)(2)/Br- catalyst in the presence of a strong acid,
   such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA) and
   p-toluenesulfonic acid. The initial reaction rates, measured by the rate
   of oxygen uptake, and the yields of terephthalic acid were used to
   compare the effectiveness of acid additives. All the acid additives
   improved significantly the effectiveness of the catalyst at their low
   concentrations. The autoxidation reaction increased with the Mn(OAc)(2)
   concentration. The reaction involves the formation of manganese(III)
   salts of strong acids, which are more powerful oxidizing agents than
   manganese(Ill) acetate. Thus, the cycles of free-radical chain reactions
   that involve formation of dibromide radical take place rapidly.
   Dibromide radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the methyl group of
   p-xylene to form ArCH2 center dot, and then the sequence progresses
   through alcohol, aldehyde and carboxylic acid. Manganese(III) salts of
   strong acids also directly react with p-xylene. This was confirmed by
   studying the reaction between Mn(OAc)3 and p-xylene in the presence of
   trifluoroacetic acid. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of anesthetic agents, commonly used in animal models, on
   blood glucose levels in fed and fasted rats were investigated. In fed
   Sprague-Dawley rats, ketamine (100 mg/kg)/ xylazine (10 mg/kg) (KX)
   produced acute hyperglycemia (blood glucose 178.4 +/- 8.0 mg/dI) within
   20 min. The baseline blood glucose levels (104.8 +/- 5.7 mg/dI) reached
   maximum levels (291.7 +/- 23.8 mg/dI) at 120 min. Ketamine alone did not
   elevate glucose levels in fed rats. lsoflurane also produced acute
   hyperglycemia similar to KX Administration of pentobarbital sodium did
   not produce hyperglycemia in fed rats. In contrast, none of these
   anesthetic agents produced hyperglycemia in fasted rats. The acute
   hyperglycemic effect of KX in fed rats was associated with decreased
   plasma levels of insulin, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and
   corticosterone and increased levels of glucagon and growth hormone (GH).
   The acute hyperglycemic response to KX was dose-dependently inhibited by
   the specific 72-adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine (14 mg/kg).
   KX-induced changes of glucoregulatory hormone levels such as insulin,
   GH, ACTH, and corticosterone were significantly altered by yohimbine,
   whereas the glucagon levels remained unaffected. In conclusion, the
   present study indicates that both KX and isoflurane produce acute
   hyperglycemia in fed rats. The effect of KX is mediated by modulation of
   the glucoregulatory hormones through stimulation Of alpha(2)-adrenergic
   receptors. Pentobarbital sodium did not produce hyperglycemia in either
   fed or fasted rats. Based on these findings, it is suggested that
   caution needs to be taken when selecting anesthetic agents, and fed or
   fasted state of animals in studies of diabetic disease or other models
   where glucose and/or glucoregulatory hormone levels may influence
   outcome and thus interpretation. However, fed animals are of value
   exploring the hyperglycemic response to anesthetic agents.}},

Abstract = {{Localized activation of the prodrug ifosfamide in or close to tumors by
   implanting encapsulated ifosfamide-activating cells is an efficacious
   strategy for tumor therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   feasibility of subsieve-size agarose capsules for enclosing the cells in
   this application. Compared with many conventional microcapsules,
   subsieve-size agarose capsules are about one-tenth the size and have
   both higher mechanical stability and allow better molecular
   exchangeability than other systems. Cells that have been genetically
   modified to express cytochrome P450 2B1 enzyme were encapsulated in
   subsieve-size agarose capsules of similar to 90 mu m in diameter and
   implanted into preformed tumors in nude mice. Living cells were detected
   for > 1 month after encapsulation in vitro and showed enzymatic activity
   (i.e., they were able to activate ifosfamide). More significant
   regression of preformed tumors was observed in the recipients implanted
   with cell-enclosing capsules compared with those implanted with empty
   capsules. These results suggest that the strategy of using subsieve-size

Abstract = {{When the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signal is
   appreciably wideband, as in underwater communications, a single
   Doppler-shift parameter is inadequate to model the Doppler effect, and a
   rate parameter is required as well. Such a model also accommodates
   nonsynchronized sampling of the received signal. We establish conditions
   for the identifiability of the Doppler parameters, and show how they
   affect the placement of null subcarriers (NSC). We derive the
   maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator and the corresponding conditional
   Cramer-Rao lower bound. We show that the vector formulation is amenable
   to estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques
   (ESPRIT) analysis, leading to a suboptimal but closed-form estimator. If
   the rate parameter is left uncompensated, we establish that the
   effective SNR is drastically reduced, which further leads to an
   increased bit error rate (BER). The ML estimator is demonstrated by
   numerical simulations that show that the performance of the estimator
   approaches the Cramer-Rao lower bound in the moderate-to-high SNR
   regions.}},

Title = {{Geochronological and stable isotope evidence for widespread orogenic
   gold mineralization from a deep-seated fluid source at ca 2.65 Ga in the
   Laverton gold province, Western Australia}},
Journal = {{ECONOMIC GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Many gold deposits in the Laverton greenstone belt, in the northeast of
   the Eastern Goldfields province of the Yilgarn craton, are located
   adjacent to, or hosted by, granitoids. This has led to controversy over
   whether the granitoids provided the auriferous fluids from which the
   deposits formed or were structural traps controlling the siting of the
   gold deposits. New regional-scale stable isotope data, combined with
   robust geochronology on several deposits, resolves this controversy in
   the Laverton greenstone belt. The median S, C, and 0 isotope
   compositions of ore and gangue minerals from nine different gold
   deposits in the Laverton greenstone belt fall in a very narrow range.
   The only exceptions to this are the more negative delta S-34 values of
   ore sulfides at the Jupiter gold deposit, which were most likely caused
   by preexisting highly oxidized host rocks and the more negative delta
   C-13 values of ore carbonate at deposits with reduced black shale host
   rocks. Redox conditions and mineralization temperatures for all gold
   deposits in the Laverton greenstone belt are broadly similar. Therefore,
   the lack of variation in the isotopic compositions of ore and gangue
   minerals is consistent with their deposition frorn a similar ore fluid.
   There is no convincing evidence to indicate that more than one ore fluid
   was involved in deposition of gold deposits within the Laverton
   greenstone belt, although the data do not uniquely define the source of
   the ore fluid (e.g., whether it was proximal or distal). SHRIMP U-Pb
   dating of gold-related monazite and xenotime provides a temporal
   framework for gold mineralization in the Laverton greenstone belt.
   Synmineralization phosphates have ages of 2650 +/- 7 Ma at Mount
   Morgans, 2649 +/- 11 Ma at Jubilee, 2657 +/- 21 Ma at Jupiter, and
   probably 2653 +/- 6 Ma at Granny Smith. The similarity in age of these
   four deposits, as well as previously published ages for the Wallaby
   (2650 5 Ma) and Sunrise Dam and/or Cleo deposits (2654 +/- 8 Ma), places
   three major constraints on the source of auriferous fluids in the
   Laverton greenstone belt. First, the Wallaby and, most likely, the
   Granny Smith gold deposits are not the same age as adjacent granitoids,
   ruling out the exposed granitic rocks as a proximal magmatic fluid
   source. Second, the broadly synchronous timing of gold mineralization on
   a camp scale provides evidence that the deposits have a similar genesis.
   Third, the range of ages of the gold deposits is not as great as that of
   the granitoids postulated to be their source. Magmatic activity that has
   been invoked as the source of are fluids by various workers is related
   to several geochemically distinctive granitoid suites that are
   diachronous over several tens of millions of Years in the Laverton
   greenstone belt and the wider Eastern Goldfields province. In contrast.
   the consistent age of gold mineralization in the Laverton greenstone
   belt supports a single fluid source, as implied by the isotope
   geochemistry. it is concluded that all studied deposits are orogenic
   gold deposits with a distal and deep source.}},

Abstract = {{Essential oils from 23 species of plants comprising 14 genera and 4
   plant families were obtained by Clevenger-type water distillation. The
   major compounds in these essential oils were identified with GC-MS and
   their insecticidal activity against adult turnip aphids, Lipaphis
   pseudobrassicae (Davis), tested with dosage-mortality bioassays. We
   examined mortality only for viviparous adults because sizeable aphid
   populations on crucifer (Brassicaceae) hosts are largely produced by
   these wingless, parthenogenic females. Twenty-two of the oils were
   directly applied to aphid females in randomized blocks at concentrations
   of 0.0, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg ml(-1). Essential oils mixed with a
   non-toxic emulsifying agent, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), more easily
   penetrated the waxy insect cuticle. Probit analysis and LC50 at three
   different exposures showed aphids were quickly incapacitated and killed
   by aliphatic aldehydes, phenols and monocyclic terpenes contained in
   Bifora and Satureja oils and at applied concentrations as low as 0.3 to
   1.0 mg ml(-1). Only enough Pimpinella isaurica oil and its three
   phenylpropanoid fractions were available for testing at a single
   concentration of 10 mg ml(-1). We could not spare any additional P.
   isaurica oil for testing at other concentrations. Phenylpropanoids
   isolated from P. isaurica oil when recombined or left naturally blended
   in the oil were highly bioactive against L. pseudobrassicae at 10 mg
   ml(-1). (c) 2005 Society of Chemical Industry.}},

Abstract = {{We present a study of the physical properties of TiO2 thin films
   deposited at 200 degrees C on Si by high pressure reactive sputtering, a
   nonconventional deposition method. Just after deposition, the TiO2 films
   were in situ annealed in the deposition chamber at temperatures between
   600 and 900 degrees C in O-2 atmosphere. Morphological, compositional,
   structural and electrical characterization of the samples was performed
   by means of several techniques, including transmission electron
   microscopy, heavy-ion elastic recoil detection analysis, infrared
   spectroscopy, x-ray and electron diffraction and capacitance-voltage
   measurements. Microscopy images show that the TiO2 films are
   polycrystalline, and that a SiO2 film spontaneously grows at the TiO2/Si
   interface. The unannealed TiO2 films are oxygen rich, as shown by
   compositional measurements. By annealing this oxygen excess is released.
   For temperatures above 600 degrees C the TiO2 films are stoichiometric.
   Infrared spectroscopy and diffraction measurements show that
   as-deposited films are a mixture of anatase and rutile grains. During
   annealing there is a phase transformation, and at 900 degrees C the
   anatase phase disappears and only the rutile phase is found. The
   relative dielectric permittivity of the TiO2 film is calculated from
   capacitance-voltage measurements, and very high. values in the 88-102
   range are obtained. (c) 2005 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the effect of no music, classical music or rock music on

   visual and auditory displays of patients' vital signs. In nine
   anaesthesia test scenarios, participants were asked every 50-70 s
   whether one of five vital signs was abnormal and the trend of its
   direction. Abnormality judgements were unaffected by music or musical
   training. Trend judgements were more accurate when music was playing (p
   = 0.0004). Musical participants reported trends more accurately (p =
   0.004), and non-musical participants tended to benefit more from music
   than did the musical participants (p = 0.063). Music may provide a pitch
   and rhythm standard from which participants can judge changes in vital
   signs from auditory displays. Nonetheless, both groups reported that it
   was easier to monitor the patient with no music (p = 0.0001), and easier
   to rely upon the auditory displays with no music (p = 0.014).}},

   Poly(vinyl chloride) polymeric membranes plasticized with o-NPOE

   (sodium tetraphenylborate - NaTPB and potassium
   tetrakis{[}3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]borate-KTFPB) additives, were

Abstract = {{Objective To determine the cardiopulmonary effects of desflurane (DES)
   in horses.
   Animals Six healthy adult horses, three males and three females, aged 9
   +/- 4 (mean +/- SD) years and weighing 370 36 kg.
   Materials and methods Anaesthesia was induced with an O-2 (10 L
   minute(-1)) and DES mixture (vaporizer setting 18\%). After oro-tracheal
   intubation, horses were positioned in right lateral recumbency.
   Anaesthesia was maintained with DES in 02 (20 mL kg(-1) minute(-1))
   delivered through a large animal circle breathing system. The minimum
   alveolar concentration of DES (MAC(DES)) that prevented purposeful
   movement in response to 60 seconds of electrical stimulation of the oral
   mucous membranes was determined for each horse. The delivered
   concentration of DES was then increased to achieve end-tidal
   concentrations corresponding to 1.5 x MAC(DES), 1.75 x MAC(DES). and 2.0
   x MAC(DES). Heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP),
   respiratory rate (f(r)), tidal volume (VT), minute volume (VM) and core
   temperature were determined, and blood samples for arterial blood gas
   analysis taken at each DES concentration. All data were analysed by
   two-way ANOVA for repeated measures and Fisher's test for multiple
   comparisons. A probability level of p < 0.05 was applied.
   Results Desflurane concentrations of 2.0 x MAC(DES) increased HR whereas
   lower concentrations did not. Mean arterial pressure was not affected by
   1.0 x MAC(DES) 1.5 x MAC(DES) or 1.75 x MAC(DES), whereas it decreased
   at 2.0 x MAC(DES). All concentrations of DES examined significantly
   depressed f(r). VT and VM.
   Conclusions and clinical relevance Desflurane concentrations between 1.0
   and 1.75 x MAC(DES) reduces f(r) and VM but does not affect HR or MAP in
   horses.}},

Abstract = {{Computed tomography measurements were made to quantify the relationship
   between the anteversion of the acetabulum and femoral neck in 27 early
   walking age patients (age range; 18-48 months) with developmental
   dysplasia of the hip. The centre-edge angle and acetabular index were
   measured in standard pelvis radiographs, and anteversion of acetabulum
   and femoral neck were measured by use of two-dimensional computed
   tomography in 25 complete dislocated, 19 subluxated and 10 unaffected
   hips (a total of 54 hips). The diagnosis of dysplasia, subluxation and
   complete dislocation of developmental hip dysplasia were determined
   radiographically using Ishida's criteria. There were statistically
   significant differences between the three groups for the centre-edge
   angle, the acetabular index, and acetabulum anteversion. There was no
   statistically significant difference between the three groups for
   femoral neck anteversion. The acetabular anteversion was found to be
   13.4 +/- 2.8 degrees (mean +/- SD) in unaffected hips, 16.7 +/- 1.9
   degrees in subluxated hips and 19.8 +/- 2.5 degrees in complete
   dislocated hips. There was statistically significant difference between
   the three groups, with a wide range of acetabular anteversion values
   noted in all groups (9-26 degrees). The acetabular anteversion was
   increased on the dislocated side in each patient and we found no
   retroverted acetabulum. On the other hand there was no significant
   difference between the groups with regards to femoral neck anteversion.
   We conclude that confirming anteversion of the acetabulum and the
   femoral neck by two-dimensional computed tomography is needed in
   treatment planning of early walking age patients with developmental hip
   dysplasia.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To quantify the number of children who experience gaps in
   insurance coverage and to determine whether vulnerable subgroups of
   children experience noteworthy lapses in insurance coverage.
   Methods. We analyzed nationally representative data from 24 149 children
   sampled in the 1999-2001 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey linked to the
   1997-1999 National Health Interview Survey. Vulnerable subgroups of
   children included children with chronic conditions, those from
   ethnic/racial minorities, and those living in poverty. On the basis of
   cumulative annual monthly insurance coverage status, each child fell
   into 1 of 3 groups: continuous coverage, uninsured, or gaps in coverage.
   Using SAS-callable SUDAAN, we conducted multivariate ordinal logistic
   regression model to quantify the likelihood of having gaps in coverage
   for vulnerable subgroups of children.
   Results. From 1999 to 2001, we found that > 9 million American children
   annually had gaps in coverage and that 5 to 6 million children annually
   were uninsured for the entire year. Sixty percent of children
   experienced gaps of at least 4 months, and > 40\% of all publicly and
   privately insured children had coverage gaps. After accounting for
   relevant covariates, children with chronic conditions were just as
   likely as other children to have gaps in coverage or be uninsured;
   Hispanic children were most likely to have insurance gaps or be
   uninsured; and children from poor and near-poor families were 4 to 5
   times more likely to have lapsed coverage than children from high-income
   families. Poverty and maternal education were the strongest factors
   associated with lapsed coverage.
   Conclusions. Unstable health insurance is an underrecognized problem for
   children, including those with chronic conditions. Because unstable
   insurance coverage can lead to inadequate health care utilization and
   poor child health outcomes, strategies to promote stable insurance
   coverage merit serious consideration.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antibody response to influenza vaccines in
   nursing home residents and healthcare workers (HCWs) and its relation to
   residents' functional and chronic disease status during four successive
   seasons.
   DESIGN: Before-after study.
   SETTING: Nine nursing homes during the 1998-1999 season and two during
   the 1999-2000, 2000-2001, and 2001-2002 seasons.
   PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred fifty-nine residents and 79 HCWs during the
   1998-1999 season; 180 and 71, respectively, during the 1999-2000 season;
   162 and 71, respectively, during the 2000-2001 season; and 153 and 79,
   respectively, during the 2001-2002 season.
   RESULTS: Multivariate analysis indicated that the mean fold increase in
   the geometric mean titers (GMTs) of hemagglutination inhibition (HI)
   antibodies and the response rate (the pro-portion of vaccinees resulting
   in a significant, at least fourfold increase in antibody titer) were
   good and no significant differences occurred for almost all strains in
   both residents and HCWs. The GMTs of HI antibodies and the protection
   rate (the proportion of participants with HI antibody titers >= 40) were
   increased in both residents and HCWs, but were significantly lower for
   almost all strains in residents than in HCWs. Furthermore, multivariate
   analysis indicated that subdivision of residents into three groups by
   level of daily activities and into four groups according to underlying
   diseases revealed only minor differences in immune responses.
   CONCLUSIONS: Antibody responses to the influenza vaccine were lower in
   residents than in HCWs. However, residents showed similar antibody
   responses regardless of their level of daily activity or underlying
   diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. To test the usefulness of diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL)
   for identifying blunt hollow visceral injury with two different sets of
   criteria or a combination of the two.
   Methods. Fifty victims with physical examinations and/ or computed
   tomography findings equivocal for blunt hollow visceral injury underwent
   DPL. Whether or not to perform surgery was determined based on Otomo's
   DPL criteria {[} lavage white blood cell counts (L-WBC) over lavage red
   blood cell counts (L-RBC) divided by 150 (L-WBC >= L-RBC/150) in the
   presence of hemoperitoneum, or L-WBC over 500/mm(3) (L-WBC >= 500) in
   the absence of hemoperitoneum]. The cell count ratio, a comparison of
   L-WBC, L-RBC, peripheral WBC (P-WBC), and peripheral RBC (P-RBC)
   {[}(L-WBC/ L-RBC)/(P-WBC/P-RBC) >= 1] were all calculated
   retrospectively.
   Results. There were one and two false-positive cases based on Otomo's
   criteria and the cell count ratio, respectively, with corresponding
   accuracies of 97.8\% and 95.7\%, respectively. There were no
   false-positive or - negative cases according to the combined use of
   Otomo's criteria and cell count ratio, yielding an accuracy of 100\%.
   Conclusion. Although each criterion alone is very accurate in predicting
   the presence of blunt hollow visceral injury, the combined use of the
   two would further improve the accuracy of the diagnosis and thereby
   reduce the number of unnecessary celiotomies.}},

Abstract = {{Anomalous origin of the right coronary artery (RCA) is a rare condition,

   tomography, which allows three-dimensional visualization of the coronary
   artery with high spatial resolution, may be the most promising imaging
   modality for diagnosing this anomaly. We describe a patient with
   anomalous origin of the RCA arising from the left sinus of Valsalva.
   Volume rendering, and axial and curved multiplanar images showed
   stenosis in the proximal portion of the RCA that coursed between the
   aorta and the pulmonary artery, and an acute angled take-off of the RCA
   from the aorta. Three-dimensional virtual angioscopic images showed a
   hypoplastic RCA orifice and luminal narrowing in the proximal portion of
   the RCA. Multislice computed tomography was thought to be useful for
   detecting anomalous origin of the RCA and for evaluating possible causes

Abstract = {{The resonances in the C-12+C-12 system described previously using a long
   range Morse potential determined from resonance data, are re-examined in
   the light of the recent development of two new methods for the
   identification of resonances in scattering theory, namely the imaginary
   test potential and imaginary phase shift methods. High lying resonances
   are found not to be genuine, as pointed out by Kato and Abe, and as such
   are discarded. This discomfiture is due to (i) the shallow behaviour of
   the Morse potential at the outer edge and (ii) the inappropriate
   insertion of a Coulomb tail as used in that work. These two deficiencies
   are removed in the present study by finding a modified Morse potential
   with a steep rise at the outer edge, and joining smoothly to it a term
   approximating the Coulomb tail. Calculation of the resonances for this
   modified Morse potential, using the above two methods of identification
   of resonances, yields more than 25 states with angular momenta
   0(+)-12(+) in the relevant energy regions. This re-affirms the
   diatomic-like rotational and vibrational picture of the nuclear
   molecular resonances in the C-12+C-12 System proposed previously, and
   shows a close resemblance to the physics of diatomic molecules, a
   phenomenon belonging to an altogether different area. It is revealing
   that the similarity extends right up to the level of potential, which is
   Morse type in both cases. This study also reveals new features of the
   heavy ion potential.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objective: Acute acquired concomitant esotropia is a rare
   form of strabismus that usually presents during infancy or early
   childhood with diplopia and minimal refractive error. The aim of this
   study was to evaluate the response to the prism adaptation test in a
   group of normosensorial patients with acute acquired concomitant
   esotropia and to determine its predictive value for surgical outcome.
   Patients and Methods: Six patients (median age, 11.5 years) with acute
   acquired concomitant esotropia underwent the prism adaptation test by
   applications of Fresnel press-on and prismatic lenses. The sensorial
   condition of each patient had been evaluated with the TNO stereopsis
   test, the Irvine test, Bagolini striated glasses, and the Worth four-dot
   test during the prism adaptation test, when maximum compensation angle
   was achieved, and after surgery. in all patients, surgery was performed
   based on the angle of the squint after the prism adaptation test.
   Patients were observed 1 day, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after
   surgery.
   Results: An increase in the angle of the squint occurred in all patients
   during prism adaptation. The maximum value was obtained in the same
   amount of time whether with prisms of increasing power or by direct
   application of the final value of the prisms. The final prismaiic value
   (target angle) was always the same.
   Conclusions: The accuracy of the patients' selection confirmed the
   existence of highly reproducible compensational movements to the
   prismatic correction in not only patients with anomalous retinal
   correspondence but also normosensorial patients. Prism adaptation test
   results were useful in these patients because of their high predictive
   value for the surgical treatment.}},

   application and, above all, by using cheap methods. In this work the
   possibility to produce secondary materials by blending recycled
   polyethylene (RPE) coming from greenhouses and post-consumer ground tyre
   rubber (GTR) has been studied. In particular, the preparation of these
   blends has been carried out in a common industrial twin screw extruder.
   RPE pellets and GTR powder were fed to the extruder without any other
   additive. Temperature, processing speed, mixing procedure and
   composition were changed in order to study the influence of these
   parameters on the rheological and mechanical properties. The results
   indicate that the blends show fairly good properties provided that a
   relatively low concentration of GTR and proper thermal conditions are
   adopted. A filler-like effect due to the partial carbonization of the
   GTR phase has also been shown especially at the highest processing
   temperature. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The paper examines why peak runway pricing has never been effectively
   implemented. Some of the literature discussing the theory is examined to
   show the basis for the theory and the potential for flaws in practice.
   Three cases where airports attempted to implement peak runway pricing
   are analyzed. The findings indicate that there may be some institutional
   barriers to peak pricing theory that prevent effective implementation.
   Airports and others seeking to reduce congestion might consider focusing
   their efforts on working towards providing alternatives for passengers,
   rather than attempting to use peak pricing as a congestion-reduction
   mechanism in isolation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Seizure susceptibility in intact and ovariectomized female rats treated

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{196}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{73-86}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Despite numerous neuroendocrinological studies of seizures, the
   influence of estrogen and progesterone on seizures and epilepsy remains
   unclear. This may be due to the fact that previous studies have not
   systematically compared distinct endocrine conditions and included all
   relevant controls. The goal of the present study was to conduct such a
   Study using pilocarpine as chemoconvulsant. Thus, age and
   weight-matched, intact or ovariectomized rats were tested to determine
   incidence of status epilepticus and to study events leading to status.
   Intact female rats were sampled at each cycle stage (proestrus, estrus,
   metestrus, or diestrus 2). Convulsant was administered at the same time
   of day, 10:00-10:30 a.m. Statistical analysis showed that there was a
   significantly lower incidence of status on the morning of estrus, but
   differences were attenuated in older animals. Ovariectomized rats were
   distinct in their rapid progression to status. These results show that
   the incidence of status in female rats following pilocarpine injection,
   and the progression to pilocarpine-induced status, are influenced by
   reproductive state as well as age. The hormonal milieu present
   specifically on the morning of estrus appears to decrease susceptibility
   to pilocarpine-induced status, particularly at young ages. In contrast,
   the chronic absence of reproductive steroids that characterizes the
   ovariectomized rat leads to a more rapid progression to status. This
   dissociation between incidence vs. progression provides new insight into
   the influence of estrogen and progesterone on seizures. (c) 2005

   good agreement of the temperature mean values with the thermocouple
   reference has been found for all models over almost the whole pressure
   and temperature range investigated. The standard deviations, which
   increased with temperature, were comparable with or better than the
   results gained for single-shot measurements of pure N-2 or O-2-N-2
   mixtures. Yet for high particle densities close to the critical point of
   CO2 the limitation of the models became obvious, owing to the strongly

Abstract = {{Background: Computer assisted surgery (CAS) permits the visualization of
   hidden bony covered Structures invisible for the human eye with
   radiological 3d data sets. The surgeon might be able to orientate
   anatomically during surgery without having to prepare the according
   landmarks. This would mean less surgical traumatization and a shorter
   and smaller operation corridor. Method: We determined the use of CAS in
   a quality assurance analysis with the subtemporal approach in 8 patients
   with suprameatal tumors type A of the cerebellopontine angle. Various
   navigation systems and methods for referencing for the registration of
   the patients' heads were used. The question was whether it is possible
   intraoperatively without preparation of known anatomical landmarks to
   define the borders of an optimal positioned temporary bone cap and to
   identify the bony covered inner auditory canal and its neuronal
   structures without orienting neurostimulation. Result: It was possible
   with CAS to assess intraoperatively the borders of a temporary bone cap
   above the cranially positioned mastoid cell. However, the objective
   inaccuracy of 2 to 28 mm observed during surgery did not allow a secure
   identification of the inner auditory canal. Conclusions: CAS with the
   subtemporal approach cannot replace the conventional preparation of
   known anatomical landmarks nor neurostimulation to identify neural
   structures, due to the expected high inaccuracy with the non-invasive
   referencing systems that are available today.}},

   profile and for a given set of microscopic parameters including the
   carrier mobilities and thermal velocities, the capture cross sections,

Abstract = {{Background. In response to the growing incidence of back pain,
   increasing emphasis is being placed on individualized preventive
   measures. The purpose of the present study was to investigate
   representative data for back pain, participation rates of back care
   programs, and their correlates in the German general population.
   Methods. The first National Health Survey was carried out in the Federal
   Republic of Germany in the period from October 1997 to March 1999. it
   comprised a representative, cross-sectional study of the population with
   a total sample of 6235 participants between the ages of 18 and 79.
   Results. The 7-day prevalence for back pain in Germany was found to be
   36\%, and 7\% of all Germans had participated in a back care program
   within the past year. The 1-year participation rate was significantly
   lower in persons with higher risk for back pain (men, full-time workers,
   unmarried people, and those with an unhealthy lifestyle).
   Conclusions. The user profile for back care programs indicates that
   genuine needs are not being met and the target group is not being
   reached. A ``preaching to the converted{''} phenomenon is evident, as
   indicated by the fact that the user group is made up of individuals who
   already have a healthy lifestyle and few risks while the population
   group most likely to develop back pain is significantly less likely to
   participate in preventive back care programs.}},

   materials showed antioxidant capacity. In addition, the investigated
   materials were able to reduce the concentration and activity of PMN
   clastase. Beside other aspects Such as biocompatibility,
   biodegradability, fluid absorption and clinical effects (e.g.
   angiogenesis and microcirculation), the understanding of these
   properties may help to support the further refinement of wound dressings
   for improved wound healing. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{ATP released from circulating erythrocytes is a potential signal
   regulating muscle blood flow during exercise (exercise hyperemia), and
   intravascular ATP appears to blunt sympathetic vasoconstriction during
   exercise. Erythrocytes from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) do not
   release ATP. The goal of the present study was to determine whether
   increases in forearm blood flow during exercise are blunted in CF
   patients and whether CF patients exhibit greater vasoconstrictor
   responsiveness during exercise. Nine control subjects and 10 CF patients
   who were free of other disease complications (similar to 96\% O-2
   saturation) performed incremental rhythmic forearm exercise at 5, 10,
   and 15\% of maximum handgrip strength for 21 min (7 min at each
   workload). We used a cold pressor test to evoke sympathetic
   vasoconstriction under resting conditions and at each exercise workload.
   As a control, subjects performed a second exercise bout without the cold
   pressor test. Continuous brachial artery blood velocity was monitored
   beat-to-beat, and vessel diameter was assessed by Doppler ultrasound.
   Artery diameter, as well as blood pressure, heart rate, and O2
   saturation, was measured at steady-state exercise and at 1 min into the
   cold pressor stimulus. Blood pressure and heart rate responses to the
   forearm exercise and each cold pressor test were similar in both groups
   (P > 0.05). Contrary to our hypothesis, forearm blood flow (P = 0.91)
   and forearm vascular conductance (P = 0.82) were similar at rest and at
   each level of exercise between CF patients and controls. Additionally,
   there was no difference in the degree of sympathetic vasoconstriction
   between groups at rest and at each level of exercise (P = 0.22). Our
   results suggest that ATP released from the deformation of erythrocytes
   is not an obligatory signal for exercise hyperemia in human skeletal
   muscle.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose of review The purpose of this review is to summarize the
   pertinent literature published in the past year regarding the regulation
   of gastric exocrine and endocrine secretion.
   Recent findings Gastric acid aids protein digestion; facilitates the
   absorption of iron, calcium, and vitamin 1312; thwarts enteric
   infection; and prevents bacterial overgrowth. When levels of acid and
   proteolytic enzymes overwhelm the mucosal defense mechanisms, ulcers
   occur. To avoid damage under these harsh conditions, gastric acid must
   be finely regulated by overlapping neural (e.g. orexin, pituitary
   adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, nitric oxide, and galanin),
   hormonal (e.g. gastrin, cholecystokinin, and ghrelin), paracrine (e.g.
   histamine and somatostatin), and autocrine (e.g. transforming growth
   factor-alpha) pathways. The precise mechanisms whereby Helicobacter
   pylori induces perturbations in acid secretion are not known, but they
   seem to involve changes in somatostatin and perhaps ghrelin secretion.
   Acid secretion by parietal cells involves intracellular elevation of
   calcium and/or cyclic AMP, followed by a cascade that triggers
   translocation of the proton pump, H+K+-adenosine triphosphatase, from
   cytoplasmic tubulovesicles to the secretory canaliculi.
   Summary An improved understanding of the pathways and mechanisms
   regulating gastric acid secretion may lead to the development of new
   strategies to prevent and treat acid peptic disorders as well as
   circumvent the adverse effects of currently prescribed antisecretory
   medications.}},

Journal = {{MODERN PATHOLOGY}},

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1403-1410}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (ES/PNET) has recently
   been shown to frequently express cytokeratins, suggesting partial
   epithelial differentiation. Older ultrastructural studies have
   documented primitive cell - cell junctions in ES/PNET, reportedly
   resembling poorly formed desmosomes. Recently, paraffin-reactive
   antibodies have become available to proteins found in a variety of
   intercellular junctions indicative of epithelial differentiation,
   including tight junctions, desmosomes and adherens junctions. We
   examined intercellular junction protein expression in a large number of
   genetically confirmed ES/PNET. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
   sections from 23 primary and seven recurrent or metastatic cases of
   genetically confirmed ES/PNET were immunostained for claudin-1 and
   occludin ( tight junction structural proteins), zonula occludens-1
   (ZO-1, tight junction linker protein), desmoglein 1/2 ( desmosomal
   adherens protein), desmoplakin ( desmosomal structural protein) and
   E-cadherin ( epithelial adherens junction protein), using steam
   heat-induced epitope retrieval and the Dako Envision system. Cases with
   >5\% positive cells were scored as `positive'. Normal colonic epithelium
   and skin served as external positive controls. Claudin-1 was expressed
   by 19 of 30 specimens (63\%), ZO-1 was expressed by 15 of 29 specimens
   (51\%), and occludin was expressed by three of 28 specimens (11\%). In
   28 specimens all three tight junction markers were evaluable. In all, 15
   samples (54\%) expressed only one tight junction marker, and 10 samples
   (36\%) expressed two tight junction markers. No case expressed all three
   tight junction markers. Desmoglein was expressed in one of 30 (3\%)
   samples. Desmoplakin was expressed in two of 28 (7\%) samples.
   E-cadherin was negative in all cases. Our data suggest that many of the
   previously described cell - cell junctions in ES/PNET are poorly formed
   tight junctions, given the high frequency of claudin-1 and ZO-1
   expression. This may underestimate the true frequency of tight junction
   protein expression in ES/PNET, as there are at least 20 different
   claudins and other ZO proteins. These tight junctions are almost
   certainly abnormal, given the absence of occludin expression in most
   cases. Desmosomal and adherens junction protein expression was rare to
   absent. Our findings provide additional evidence that ES/PNET frequently
   show partial epithelial differentiation.}},

Volume = {{163}},

Abstract = {{For the first time precarious rocks have been analysed in the epicentral
   area of the AD 1356 Basle earthquake in northern Switzerland. Several
   cliff sites in flat-lying, thickly bedded Upper Jurassic coral
   limestones in the Jura Mountains were investigated. Seven blocks are
   regarded as precarious with respect to earthquake strong ground motions.
   The age of these precarious rocks could not be determined directly as
   for instance by radiometric dating methods; however, based on slope
   degradation processes it can be concluded that the formation of these
   blocks predates the AD 1356 Basle earthquake. The acceleration required
   to topple a precarious rock from its pedestal is estimated using
   geometrical data for individual block sections and earthquake
   strong-motion records from stations on rock sites in the European
   Strong-Motion Database as input data for the computer program ROCKING
   V1.0 from the Seismological Laboratory, University of Nevada, Reno. The
   calculations indicate that toppling of a precarious rock largely depends
   on earthquake strength but also on the frequency spectrum of the signal.
   Although most investigated precarious rocks are surprisingly stable for
   ground motions similar to those expected to have occurred during the AD
   1356 Basle earthquake, at least two blocks are clearly precariously
   balanced, with peak toppling accelerations lower than 0.3 g. Possible
   reasons why these blocks did not topple during the AD 1356 Basle
   earthquake include incomplete separation from their base, sliding of
   precarious rocks, their size, lower than assumed ground accelerations
   and/or duration of shaking.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Computerized heart allograft rejection monitoring (CHARM)
   used for non-invasive rejection monitoring in heart transplant
   recipients is based on the analysis of ventricular evoked response (VER)
   signals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic validity
   of the Tslew(C), a parameter calculated from the VER.
   Methods: During orthotopic heart transplantation, 2 unipolar fractally
   coated screw-in leads were implanted epimyocardially, one to the left
   and one to the right ventricle, and connected to a telemetric pacemaker.
   Recordings of intramyocardial electrograms were performed routinely at
   the hospital. Data processing was done, artifacts were eliminated, and
   trend curves of the patients were displayed. Tslew(C) was calculated
   from the tangent of VER and evaluated from 105 patients. The patients
   were divided into survivor and non-survivor groups. For statistical
   analysis, the 2-tailed t-test was performed.
   Results: Patients in the non-survivors group compared with the control
   group showed a significantly lower Tslew(C) in the final follow-up (p <
   0.001). The differences were even more impressive in patients with
   recorded intramyocardial electrograms 30 days before death or with a
   cardiac reason for death. Tests were performed to find an optimal
   prognostic threshold of the Tslew(C), and the value of 26 mV was finally
   found.
   Conclusion: Tslew(C) can function as prognostic factor after orthotopic
   heart transplantation. Further studies should be initiated to provide
   the prognostic threshold so that patients would not be forced to show up
   routinely every 4 weeks for follow-up visits. Patients would only have
   to be admitted to the hospital if the Tslew(C) were less than this
   prognostic threshold.}},

Abstract = {{In the structural dynamics area, system identification represents one of
   the most critical steps. Therefore, a great research effort has been
   made in the last decades to improve the accuracy and reliability of this
   process. One of the results of this effort is the so-called
   stabilization diagram, a widespread tool, where the system's poles are
   represented for several mod el orders. In real applications, the
   assessment of this diagram is often extremely demanding due to the high
   number of poles amongst which only a few represent the true or physical
   ones.
   Fuzzy clustering was already successfully applied in various fields
   including economics, finance and marketing. In this paper, fuzzy
   clustering is introduced into the structural mechanics field as a tool
   to automatically assess stabilization diagrams. Several advanced
   algorithms are presented, all based on the Fuzzy-C-Means clustering
   technique, including the Gustafson-Kessel and Gath-Geva algorithms. In
   addition, Genetic Algorithms can also be used to cluster a data set as a
   stand-alone technique as well as in a hybrid combination with fuzzy
   clustering algorithms.
   This paper concludes with a comparison of all the mentioned approaches,
   by applying them on true in-flight test data. (C) 2005 Civil-Comp Ltd

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate whether the presence of a positive
   fetal fibronectin (>= 50 ng/mL) in nulliparous women undergoing
   preinduction cervical ripening with the intracervical Foley catheter
   predicted vaginal birth.
   METHODS: This was a prospective blinded observational trial of
   nulliparous women undergoing preinduction cervical ripening. We excluded
   women who had a contraindication to vaginal birth. Cervical and vaginal
   fetal fibronectin specimens were obtained before preinduction cervical
   ripening with an intracervical Foley catheter. The managing obstetrician
   was blinded to these results.
   RESULTS: A total of 241 women met the inclusion criteria, of which
   54.4\% delivered vaginally. There was no difference in the rate of
   vaginal delivery among women with either a positive cervical fetal
   fibronectin (positive fetal fibronectin 55.8\% compared with negative
   fetal fibronectin 53.3\%, P =.70) or positive vaginal fetal fibronectin
   (positive fetal fibronectin 57.6\% compared with negative fetal
   fibronectin 53.3\%, P =.56). Women with a positive cervical fetal
   fibronectin did have a shorter duration of cervical ripening (fetal
   fibronectin-positive 229 220 minutes compared with fetal
   fibronectin-negative 379 193 minutes, P <.05), duration of oxytocin
   (fetal fibronectin-positive 655 555 minutes compared with fetal
   fibronectin-negative 731.5 +/- 342 minutes, P <.025) and required lower
   maximal doses of oxytocin (fetal fibronectin-positive 18.4 mIU/min
   compared with fetal fibronectin-negative 21.8 mIU/min, P =.005). Women
   with a positive vaginal fetal fibronectin demonstrated only a shorter
   duration of cervical ripening compared with their fetal fibronectin
   negative counterparts (fetal fibronectin-positive 300 216 minutes
   compared with fetal fibronectin-negative 345 :+/- 201 minutes, P <.05).
   CONCLUSION: Fetal fibronectin does not predict vaginal delivery in
   nulliparous women requiring preinduction cervical ripening.}},

Abstract = {{A naturally occurring outbreak of subacute fasciolosis in a group of 17
   seven-month-old Soay ram lambs was studied following the sudden death of
   two sheep. In addition to standard biochemical investigations,
   ultrasound examination of the liver and cranial abdominal cavity was
   undertaken. There was a significant positive linear correlation between
   liver weight and ultrasonographic determination of liver size (R = 0.72,
   P < 0.05). Ultrasonographic examination of the liver revealed multiple
   hyperechoic dots in the parenchyma giving a granular appearance to the
   hepatic texture in three sheep corresponding to the most advanced
   histopathological changes as determined by the size of the abscesses and
   their relatively mature fibrous capsules, and areas of hepatic necrosis.
   No distension of the bile duct system was noted nor was the gall bladder
   imaged. While serum concentrations of albumin, globulin and certain
   liver enzymes assisted in the diagnosis of subacute fasciolosis in
   sheep, only glutamate dehydrogenase, and gammaglutamyl transferase
   remained elevated four weeks after triclabendazole treatment. (c) 2004

Abstract = {{Tendon is composed of type I collagen fibers, interspersed with
   proteoglycan matrix and cells. Glycosaminoglycans may play a role in
   maintaining the structural integrity of tendon, preventing excessive
   shearing between collagen components. This study tests the hypothesis
   that tendon extension mechanisms can be altered by modifying the
   composition of noncollagenous matrix. Tendon explants were treated with
   phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or PBS + 0.5 U ml(-1) chondroitinase
   ABC. Structural changes were examined using TEM and biochemical
   analysis, while strain response was examined using confocal microscopy
   and gross mechanical characterization. Chondroitinase ABC removed 90\%
   of glycosaminoglycans from the matrix. Results demonstrated significant
   swelling of fibrils and surrounding matrix when incubated in either
   solution. In response to applied strain, PBS incubated samples
   demonstrated significantly less sliding between adjacent fibers than
   nonincubated, and a 33\% reduction in maximum force. By contrast,
   fascicles incubated in chondroitinase ABC demonstrated a similar strain
   response to nonincubated. Data indicate that collagen-proteoglycan
   binding characteristics can be influenced by incubation and this, in
   turn, can influence the preferred extension mechanisms adopted by
   fascicles. This highlights the importance of maintaining fascicles
   within their natural environment to prevent structural or mechanical
   changes prior to subsequent analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The coalescence in air of two polymeric drops into a single drop (also
   referred to as sintering) was investigated for two thermotropic liquid
   crystalline polymers. Initial coalescence via elastic contact was ruled
   out based on the magnitude of the equilibrium compliance values and the
   process was, therefore, believed to be driven by surface tension and
   resisted by means of viscous)low. Remarkably the viscous coalescence
   model developed for Newtonian fluids (an extension of the Frenkel and
   Eshelby approach) agreed well under some conditions of temperature with
   coalescence data (i.e., observation of neck growth under a microscope).
   On the other hand the extension of the Newtonian model to the
   viscoelastic case by incorporating the upper convected Maxwell model
   (UCM) assuming steady state stresses always underpredicted the rat( of
   coalescence. The viscous neck growth model using the UCM constitutive
   equation was extendcd to the transient stress case in order to
   incorporate the slow growth of viscosity at the startup of flow. The
   unsteady state UCM approach represented a qualitative improvement over
   the Newtonian and steady state UCM formulations because it predicted
   accelerated coalescence, relative to the Newtonian model, by increasing
   the relaxation time. However, the model was unable to quantitatively
   predict the experimental coalescence rates, as it overpredicted the
   acceleration of coalescence. (c) 2005 The Society of Rheology.}},

Abstract = {{The bulk of rural populations in sub-Saharan Africa have no access to
   electricity and are under-served by any other form of modern
   infrastructure. The cost of infrastructure to mainly scattered
   communities has been perennially cited as largely to blame. This is an

   social, economic and political obstacles that play an unquantified and
   frequently unrecognized negative role. At the route of the problem lies
   a subdued role of the would-be recipients who in fact, unlike anybody
   else, are conversant with their problems. Consequently, a number of
   products may come as impositions or misplaced priorities. Consumer
   participation for sustainable development has been articulated at
   international forums and in publications as being advantageous. In
   practice however, the concept appears to be generally shunned and even
   when, occasionally, tried the needs of the consumers are presumed and
   their roles prescribed. This paper discusses a range of social, economic

Abstract = {{Background: The assessment of recidivism in sexual offenders is an
   urgent topic for forensic psychiatry in Germany. The call for useful
   predictive measures is therefore getting louder.
   Aims: The present study analyses which criteria are employed by
   therapists in forensic hospitals to assess the dangerousness of sexual
   offenders. Of particular interest is whether the criteria listed in
   presently known prediction scores as decisive are actually used in
   decision-making in current forensic psychiatric practice.
   Method: Data are collected in a prospective prediction study funded by
   the German Research Association.
   Results: The results reveal that therapists employ mainly clinical and
   less historical criteria, thus indicating substantial differences from
   currently known prediction scores and results of other studies.
   Conclusions: That therapists base their prediction of dangerousness
   primarily on clinical variables reveals a substantial error that has to
   be remedied. Further research on the extent of relevance of clinical
   variables is needed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   analyzed 10 microcapillary cultivated isolates from cutaneous cases and
   5 microcapillary cultivated isolates from visceral cases (totally 15) by
   polymerase chain reaction-RFLP (PCR-RFLP). Of 10 isolates, 3 (30\%) were
   genotyped as Leishmania infantum and 7 (70\%) of 10 isolates were
   genotyped as Leishmania tropica from the microcapillary cultivated
   isolates of cutaneous cases. Oil the other hand, all 5 isolates (100\%)
   were genotyped as L. infantum from microcapillary cultivated visceral
   cases. Our most interesting finding is the presence of 3 L. infantum

   that further investigations must be done about this subject. Oil the
   other hand, we suggest the combination of microcapillary culture method
   and PCR-RFLP of miniexon region of leishmaniae can be used in routine

   catheters}},
Journal = {{CHEST}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{128}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Tracheal suction catheters (TSCs) are used to clear mucus
   from an endotracheal tube (ETT). The clearance rate is critical because
   airway mucus stasis leads to obstruction, but prolonged catheter
   suctioning can lead to hypoxemia. The rate of mucus clearance from an
   ETT is thought to be influenced by the properties of the mucus, the
   pressure used to suction the mucus, and the diameter of the catheter. In
   this study, different adult TSCs were evaluated for their ability to
   suction mucus simulants that had properties similar to airway mucus.
   Methods: Six different 14F TSC designs were evaluated. All catheters had
   the same end hole size, but the two side holes were sized at 3 min, 4
   mm, or 5 mm. A coagulant (Polyox Water Soluble Resin Coagulant NF; Dow
   Chemical Company; Cary, NC) was mixed with water at concentrations of
   0.5\%, 1.5\%, and 3.0\% to simulate mucus or sputum. Suction
   effectiveness was evaluated by the mass percentage of the coagulant
   suctioned over 10 s at 100 min Hg from an 8.0 ETT.
   Measurements and results; The 1.5\% and 3.0\% simulants had properties
   comparable to human air-way mucus and sputum. Suction effectiveness was
   less with the 3.0\% coagulant simulant compared with the 1.5\% and 0.5\%
   simulants. Suction effectiveness was greater (p < 0.01) with TSCs that
   had nonparallel holes and a side hole diameter of 5 mm when tested with
   the 1.5\% and 3.0\% simulants. However, no best catheter could be
   identified among TSCs when tested with the more liquid-like 0.5\%
   simulant.
   Conclusions: Greater TSC side hole diameter and nonparallel positioning
   was important for suctioning mucus simulants that are similar to mucus
   or sputum. The distance between side holes, end hole size, suction
   force, and duration of suctioning were not tested but could also have an
   effect on TSC performance.}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{An in vivo shikimate accumulation assay with excised leaf tissue was
   developed to provide a fast and reliable method for identifying
   glyphosate-resistant plants. The assay is based on glyphosate-induced
   accumulation of shikimate. There was a linear accumulation of shikimate
   in excised leaf discs of soybean and canola treated with 250 mu M
   glyphosate for 48 h. The IC50 for the accumulation of shikimate in
   soybean and corn leaf discs was 34 and 87 mu M, respectively. Leaf discs
   excised from glyphosate-resistant corn or soybean did not accumulate
   shikimate when treated with 500 mu M glyphosate. Leaf discs taken from a
   number of field-grown plants accumulated shikimate in a glyphosate
   dose-dependent manner. The accumulation of shikimate was dependent on
   light and the age of the leaf from which the disc was taken. The assay
   worked either in 96-well microtiter plates or in vials, and it clearly
   differentiated between glyphosate-resistant and -susceptible crops in
   which the resistance is due to an alteration of the target site for
   glyphosate. The assay was simple and robust and has the potential to be
   used as a high throughput assay to detect glyphosate resistance in
   weeds.}},

Title = {{Indinavir impairs endothelial function in healthy HIV-negative men}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{150}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background Potent antiretroviral treatment has drastically reduced
   mortality in HIV-infected patients but may accelerate atherosclerotic
   disease, which could be partially mediated via endothelial dysfunction.
   Methods In 8 HIV-negative healthy males, leg blood flow responses to
   intraartery infusions of methacholine chloride (Mch), sodium
   nitroprusside, and N-G-mono-methyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) were measured
   before and after 4 weeks of daily oral indinavir. In the same subjects,
   we also assessed the effect of indinavir on lipids, insulin sensitivity,
   markers of inflammation, as well as oxidative stress.
   Results After 4 weeks of indinavir, the endothelium-dependent response
   to methacholine chloride was impaired (195\% +/- 38\% vs 83\% +/- 13\%,
   P < .05), the response to N-G-mono-methyl-L-arginine (nitric
   oxide-dependent tone) was nearly abrogated (-30\% +/- 4\% vs -1\% +/-
   11\%, P < .05), whereas the endothelium-independent response to sodium
   nitroprusside remained unchanged. Fasting insulin levels increased from
   5.8 +/- 1.2 to 7.0 +/- 1.4 mu U/mL (P < .05), and HOMA-IR scores
   increased from 1.3 +/- 0.3 to 1.6 +/- 0.3 U (P < .05). There were no
   changes in blood pressure, lipids, markers of inflammation, or oxidative
   stress.
   Conclusions Four weeks of the HIV-1 protease inhibitor indinavir, in the
   absence of HIV-1 infection, causes vascular dysfunction most likely at
   the level of endothelial nitric oxide production. The vascular
   dysfunction may be mediated partially by the concomitant induction of
   insulin resistance but other mechanisms cannot be ruled out.}},

   surface water were also determined. The presence of Vtg in male fish
   plasma as well as that in female can be detected at different sites and
   different seasons. The results indicate that the water in the sampling
   sites was contaminated by some estrogenic compounds. Although BPA, OP

   each is from its sister species and how much nucleotide variation each
   encompasses. Comparisons were based on sequence variation at seven
   nuclear and chloroplast loci. Assignment of collections to morphospecies
   accounted for about 57-75\% of the overall nucleotide variation at the
   seven loci, but morphospecies differed greatly in how much nucleotide
   diversity they encompass. In addition, morphospecies varied widely in
   their genetic distinctiveness, estimated as the length of the stem
   branch from the most recent common ancestor and numbers of
   differentially fixed and shared polymorphic nucleotides among taxa.
   Levels of molecular diversity within morphospecies were not correlated
   with their degree of isolation. Factors that affected the biodiversity

Abstract = {{Reconstructing prairie habitat is one of the most promising techniques
   for conserving the imperiled prairie ecosystem and its associated
   organisms. However, the degree to which reconstructed prairies function
   like remnant prairies has not been fully examined. We evaluated the
   effect of restoration planting prescriptions, as well as vegetative
   quality on butterfly communities inhabiting prairie reconstructions in
   central Iowa, USA. Twelve isolated reconstructed prairies (small,
   surrounded by agriculture), 12 integrated reconstructions (planting
   units in a larger matrix of reconstructed and remnant prairies), and 12
   remnant prairies were surveyed for butterfly and plant diversity,
   abundance and composition. Remnant prairies supported significantly
   higher richness and abundance of habitat-sensitive butterfly species.
   Butterfly richness on integrated reconstructions was intermediately
   positioned between remnant and isolated reconstructions. The best
   vegetative predictors of butterfly richness (R-2 = 0.38) and abundance
   (R-2 =0.13) were the availability of nectar and the percent cover of
   litter (which is related to management issues such as time since
   burning). Most significantly, we found that the response of the
   butterfly community to vegetation in a reconstructed prairie is more
   complex than simply a response to vegetation diversity. Both management
   within the reconstruction and the landscape context around the
   reconstruction affect local patterns of butterflies species distribution
   and abundance. Integrated reconstructions develop richer butterfly
   communities than isolated reconstructions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Context: In addition to heart massage, the primary goal of
   cardiopulmonary resuscitation is efficient oxygenation and ventilation.
   Objective: To compare the ease of learning and handling of standard
   mouth-to-mouth resuscitation with the Combitube (Tyco Healthcare
   Nellcor, Pleasanton, CA) ventilation.
   Methods: After a 30 minute theoretical introduction and demonstration of
   mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and use of the Combitube in mannequins,
   following American Heart Association guidelines, 26 adolescent school
   children (15: 14 years old, 11: 10 years old) undertook two ventilation
   trials, each consisting of five single ventilations, with each
   technique. Only the second trial with each technique was evaluated.
   Qualitative implementation (grades: very good, good, failed) was
   evaluated, several procedure-related time points were recorded, and
   tidal volumes (ml) were measured.
   Results: With mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, the time interval until
   start of first ventilation was 36.5 seconds shorter than with the
   Combitube (P < 0.001). With the Combitube, the time needed for five
   single ventilations was 6.4 seconds less than with mouth-to-mouth
   resuscitation (P < 0.001) and mean tidal volumes were higher
   (mouth-to-mouth resuscitation 450 +/- 384 ml versus Combitube 735 +/-
   358 ml, P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Most of the school children performed both techniques to a
   high qualitative level. The study shows that mouth-to-mouth
   resuscitation and use of the Combitube have equal ease of learning, a
   precondition for proficient retention of skills. Tidal volumes were
   significantly higher with the Combitube and, not surprisingly, the time
   interval until the start of first ventilation was significantly shorter
   with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Regardless of the ventilation
   technique or device, we believe that subsequent retraining of
   ventilation skills is very important.}},

Abstract = {{Object. Various surgical approaches have been proposed for the treatment
   of thoracic outlet syndrome TOS). The authors of this study focused on
   the differences in outcome after supraclavicular neuroplasty of brachial
   plexus (SNBP {[}no rib resection]) and transaxillary first rib resection
   (TFRR) in patients in whom the dominant clinical problem was pain.
   Methods. Fifty-five patients were randomized to Undergo TFRR or SNBP.
   Patients with an anomalous cervical rib, intrinsic weakness, and
   primarily vascular findings were excluded from the study.
   Preoperatively, the following findings were typically observed:
   provocation of symptoms by certain postures (the so-called
   spear-throwing position as well as downward tugging of the shoulder) and
   marked tenderness in the supraclavicular fossa.
   The intergroup severity of the symptoms was comparable. Eight patients
   were lost to follow up. There were 24 TFRRs (in two cases the procedure
   was bilateral) and 25 SNBPs. The mean follow-up interval was 37 months.
   In both groups pain decreased significantly after surgery. By all
   measures the TFRR operation conferred superior results. Patients
   reported significantly less pain (39 +/- 7 compared with 61 +/- 7; score
   range 0-100 on a visual analog scale), greater percentage of pain relief
   (52 +/- 8\% compared with 30 +/- 7\%), and less pain (3.7 +/- 0.4
   compared with 5.1 +/- 0.5) on an affective scale (all p < 0.05) in the
   TFRR and SNBP groups, respectively). In the TFRR group, 75\% of patients
   reported good or excellent outcomes compared with 48\% in the SNBP group
   (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions. Transaxillary first rib resection provided better relief of
   symptoms than SNBP. The major compressive element in patients with
   TOS-associated pain appeared to be the first rib.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The antitumor efficacy of combination therapy of the
   vascular disrupting agent ZD6126 and antiangiogenic agent ZD6474 was
   evaluated in the models of human colorectal (HT29) and ovarian carcinoma
   (OW1). Materials and Methods: HT29 and OW1 xenograft-bearing mice were
   treated with ZD6126 and ZD6474 either alone or in combination. ZD6126
   therapy consisted of three doses of 100 mg/kg administered 1, 3 and 5
   days after the tumor reached the starting size. ZD6474 was administered
   daily at a dose of 25 mg/kg on days 1-5. Results: ZD6126 and ZD6474
   treatment alone only resulted in modest tumor growth delay. However,
   significantly enhanced antitumor effects were observed in the combinaion
   treatment. Conclusion: The combination of the vascular disrupting with
   the antiangiogenic agent led to significant enhancement of antitumor
   efficacy in HT29 and OW1 human tumor models. Such combination therapy
   may have significant therapeutic benefit even in tumors insensitive to
   either treatment alone.}},

Abstract = {{The incommensurate material, T1InS(2), with layer structure was studied
   by light figure spectroscopy techniques in spectral range 400-700 nm in
   temperature interval 80-350 K. Evolution of light figures with
   temperature in phase transition region was reliably established. The
   optic angle of T1InS(2) was found to be sample-dependent with
   essentially two types of critical behavior with temperature; peak-like
   behavior that was ascribed to a pure incommensurate phase and peak-free
   behavior that was attributed to the influence of the domains or defects.
   In latter case the samples showed symmetry forbidden rotation of optic
   plane with temperature. As a whole, the obtained results allow for a
   conclusion that incommensurate spatial modulation with correlation
   length at the nanoscale was contributing to biaxial anisotropy of
   T1InS(2) to a level of 10(-3) versus 10(-4) for basic lattice. (c) 2005

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Subwavelength microwave resonators based on double-ridge waveguides are
   proposed for applications that require strong electromagnetic fields
   under the constraint of limited microwave power. A key advantage of the
   proposed resonator structure is that magnetic couplings to the
   environment can be precisely controlled over a wide range of values with
   minimal impact on the resonance frequencies and quality factors. Another
   advantage is that inductances and capacitances are independent of each
   other, which offers flexibility in resonator design. A theoretical
   analysis for resonant conditions is given, and both numerical
   simulations and experimental measurements confirm that the resonators
   enhance electromagnetic fields by a factor of 40 in the near-field,
   equivalent to an effective electromagnetic energy density increase of
   1600. The resonators are electrically small in size, have a high quality
   factor, and are suitable for the research of microwave frequency quantum
   electrodynamics.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the relation between social problems and

   moderating variables. Two hundred eighty adolescent boys completed
   measures of social problems, cognitive distortions, constructive
   thinking, affiliation with delinquent peers, and multiple aspects of
   substance use. Results revealed that social problems were not directly
   related to most substance use variables. Cognitive distortions moderated
   the relation between social problems and substance use in social
   situations, such that the relation was significant only at high levels
   of cognitive distortions. Constructive thinking and affiliation with
   delinquent peers were both related to substance use, but neither served
   a moderating function. It is concluded that the widely accepted relation
   between social difficulties and adolescent male substance use may be
   better understood in the context of cognitive variables.}},

Abstract = {{Study objective: Low birth weight predicts cardiovascular disease in
   adulthood, and one possible explanation is that children with lower
   birth weight consume more fat than those born heavier. Therefore, the
   objective of this study was to investigate associations between birth
   weight and childhood diet, and in particular, to test the hypothesis
   that birth weight is inversely related to total and saturated fat
   intake.
   Design: Prospective cohort study.
   Setting: South west England.
   Participants: A subgroup of children enrolled in the Avon longitudinal
   study of parents and children, with data on birth weight and also diet
   at ages 8, 18, 43 months, and 7 years ( 1152, 998, 848, and 771 children
   respectively).
   Main results: Associations between birth weight and diet increased in
   strength from age 8 to 43 months, but had diminished by age 7 years.
   Fat, saturated fat, and protein intakes were inversely, and carbohydrate
   intake was positively associated with birth weight at 43 months of age,
   after adjusting for age, sex, and energy intake. After adjustment for
   other confounders, all associations were weakened, although there was
   still a suggestion of a relation with saturated fat ( -0.48 (95\% CI
   -0.97, 0.02) g/day per 500 g increase in birth weight. Similar patterns
   were seen in boys and girls separately, and when the sample was
   restricted to those with complete data at all ages.
   Conclusions: A small inverse association was found between birth weight
   and saturated fat intake in children at 43 months of age but this was
   not present at 7 years of age. This study therefore provides little
   evidence that birth weight modifies subsequent childhood diet.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical method for the determination of ribonucleic acid was
   established by spectrophotometry. At maxium absorption wavelength for
   methyl violet in the B-R buffer solution, and under the best conditions,
   the degree of decrease of the absorbance was linear with the amount of
   ribonucleic Acid. It was a new and preferable approach for the
   determination of ribonucleic Acids. The method with the linearity range
   was 1.0 to 8.0 mu g(.)mL(-1) and the detection limit was 0.52 mu
   g(.)mL(-1), and the correlation coeffient was 0.999 9. This method was
   simple, rapid, and selective. So it was satisfactory to the application
   for the determination of ribonucleic Acid. The reaction mechanism was
   electrostatic interaction to make molecular association of RNA with
   methyl violet, to go on antiion permutation and bonded reaction of
   concert.}},

Abstract = {{In the current classification, squamous vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia
   (VIN) is categorized as VIN 1, 2 and 3 according to the degree of
   abnormality, There is neither evidence that the VIN 1-3 morphologic
   spectrum reflects a biologic continuum nor that VIN 1 is a cancer
   precursor. The VIN 2 and 3 category includes 2 types of lesion, which
   differ in morphology, biology and clinical features. VIN, usual type
   (warty, basaloid and mixed), is HPV related in most cases. Invasive
   squamous carcinomas of warty or basaloid type is associated with VIN,
   usual type. VIN, differentiated type, is seen particularly in older
   women with lichen sclerosus and/or squamous cell hyperplasia in some
   cases. Neither VIN, differentiated type, nor associated keratinizing
   squamous cell carcinoma is HPV related. The term VIN should apply only
   to histologically high grade squamous lesions (former terms, VIN 2 and
   VIN 3 and differentiated VIN 3). The term VIN 1 will no longer be used.
   Two categories should describe squamous VIN: VIN, usual type
   (encompassing former VIN 2 and 3 of warty, basaloid and mixed types) and
   VIN, differentiated type (VIN 3, differentiated type).}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the role of angiogenesis in the clinical
   behavior and pathogenesis of lymphangioma tumors.
   Design: A retrospective study. Median follow-up period was 44.5 months.
   Setting: Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, III
   Patients: Tumor specimens from 12 pediatric patients who underwent
   surgical excision of cervicofacial lymphangioma were examined for
   expression of angiogenic inducer vascular endothelial growth factor
   (VEGF) and angiogenic inhibitor pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF)
   using immunohistochemical analysis. Specimens were divided into
   recurrent and nonrecurrent tumors based on clinical information.
   Main Outcome Measures: Staining patterns of VEGF and PEDF were evaluated
   in lymphangioma specimens. Staining patterns were then compared in both
   recurrent and nonrecurrent groups and graded in a blinded fashion.
   Histological evidence of increased angiogenesis including microvascular
   density, stromal fibrosis, and inflammation were graded in each group
   and correlated with recurrence. Results: Lymphangioma specimens
   demonstrated histological evidence of increased angiogenic activity
   including multiple areas of increased VEGF staining combined with little
   PEDF staining. Sex, age at onset, or tumor location did not correlate
   with recurrence. Furthermore, recurrent specimens had increased
   histological evidence of angiogenesis as well as increased VEGF and
   decreased PEDF activity compared with nonrecurrent lesions.
   Conclusions: Lymphangiomas exhibit tumorlike pathogenesis owing to the
   high expression of angiogenic inducers compared with the low expression
   of inhibitors. Recurrence may be influenced by this imbalance of
   angiogenic mediators. Further research with antiangiogenic therapy using
   agents such as PEDF analogues or anti-VEGF receptor antibodies is
   indicated because they may stabilize or suppress the growth of these
   neoplasms.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the role of the native fox, Pseudalopex culpaeus, as a
   frugivore and seed disperser in a semiarid thornscrub of Chile. We
   quantified the fruit and animal components in its diet versus the
   availability of fruits and small mammals in the field over a 2-year
   period (January 1998 through February 2000). We tested the legitimacy
   and effectiveness of foxes as dispersers by quantifying the percentages
   of seed viability and of germination of seeds that passed through fox
   gut versus those picked from plants. We also studied their efficiency as
   dispersers, monitoring the fate of seeds in faeces placed in the field.
   The highest frequencies of fruit consumption by foxes were observed when
   abundances of small mammal prey were < 6 individuals per hectare,
   regardless of fruit abundance in the field. Thus, foxes consumed fruits
   as a supplementary food resource. Based on 326 faeces, the total number
   of fruits consumed was about 34 000 over the 2-year study period, and
   fruits from the alien shrub Schinus molle represented 98\% of that
   total, with the native Porlieria chilensis a distant second. Germination
   and viability of defecated seeds of P. chilensis were reduced by 66\%
   and 48\%, respectively, in comparison to controls. In contrast,
   germination of seeds of S. molle increased by 50\% and no effect on
   viability was observed. With regard to P. chilensis, foxes were
   legitimate (they defecated viable seeds), but ineffective (seeds in
   faeces had lower germination than those taken directly from parental
   plants and there was no seedling establishment in the field) and
   inefficient dispersers (seeds in faeces were deposited on microhabitats
   hostile to seed germination and seedling establishment). However, with
   regard to S. molle, foxes were legitimate, effective (seeds in faeces
   had higher germination than those taken directly from parental plants;
   there was germination but no establishment in the field), and efficient
   dispersers (over 41\% of seeds were deposited on safe microsites). Thus,
   a native fox may be contributing to the spread of an alien shrub,
   co-opting existing community processes.}},

Abstract = {{The continuing advancement of microsatellites and nanosatellitestor
   space application has identified a need for a simple, low-mass, and low
   packing volume solar array system for these satellites. The result of
   decreasing satellite size, thus surface area, and increasing power
   demand as these satellites become more capable is the inevitable problem
   of power choke on satellite systems with body-mounted solar cells. The
   use of traditional, rigid, solar arrays necessitates larger stowage
   volume and mass, and also requires gimbals for pointing. In previous
   studies, the PowerSphere solar array system has been identified as one
   of the solutions to this power choke problem by lowering mass and
   stowage volume and eliminating pointing mechanisms. Given these
   requirements, ultraviolet cured composite materials have been identified
   as the best candidate for this application. The development of
   Power-Sphere multifunctional ultraviolet-rigidizable (UV-rigidizable)
   inflatable structures is beneficial not only to micro- and
   nanosatellites it also enables the advancement of gossamer-type
   structures. In conjunction with UV-rigidizable material, these
   structures incorporate thin-film flex-circuit to make them
   multifunctional. Two multifunctional structures in the Power-Sphere
   system use the UV-rigidizable material, namely, the inflatable hinge and
   the inflatable isogrid center column.}},

Abstract = {{Elucidating the causes of population divergence, and ultimately
   speciation, is a central objective of evolutionary biology. A number of
   previous studies of Drosophila populations from the Nahal Oren canyon
   (Mt Carmel, Israel) revealed significant interslope differences for a
   complex of fitness and behavioral traits. Peculiarities in courtship
   song patterns and nonrandom mating were observed, despite a small
   interslope distance. Single and multiple mate choice tests with D.
   melanogaster from the opposite slopes displayed highly significant
   assortative mating, with preference for sexual partners from the same
   slope. Here we report the results on mate choice in the sibling species
   D. melanogaster and D. simulans inhabiting Nahal Oren canyon.
   Significant assortative mating was found in both species. Genetic
   heterogeneity in mate choice was found among the isofemale lines of D.
   melanogaster. Samples of isofemale lines established from females
   collected in spring and fall seasons show the same mating patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Starting with a given planar cubic curve {[}x(t), y(t)](T), we construct
   Pythagorean hodograph (PH) space curves of the form {[}x(t), y(t),
   z(t)](T) in Euclidean and in Minkowski space, which interpolate the
   tangent vector at a given point. We prove the existence of these curves
   for any regular planar cubic and we express all solutions explicitly. It
   is shown that the constructed curves provide upper and lower polynomial
   bounds on the parametrical speed and the arc-length function of the
   given cubic. We analyze the approximation order and derive an explicit
   formula for the gap between the bounds. In addition, we discuss the
   approximation of the offset curves. Finally we define an invariant which
   measures the deviation of a given planar cubic from being a PH curve.

Abstract = {{The limited number of publications on repair of the foramen of Morgagni
   hernia concentrates mainly on the laparotomy approach. We present our
   experience with the transthoracic approach. Patients who were diagnosed
   as having a foramen of Morgagni hernia and were operated on via the
   transthoracic approach between December 1991 and June 2004 are reviewed
   retrospectively for their age, sex, presenting symptoms, and diagnostic
   and surgical procedures. Surgical repair was carried out via the
   transthoracic approach in all cases. Of the 24 patients who underwent
   transthoracic diaphragmatic repair of the defect, 16 were women and 8
   were men, with an overall mean age of 55.1 years (range 42-69 years). In
   most cases the defect was on the right side; there was only one case of
   a left-sided defect. The most common presenting symptoms were dyspnea
   and gastrointestinal discomfort; five (20.8\%) patients were
   asymptomatic. In 21 cases (87.5\%) the diagnoses were established
   radiologically. The defect was accessed surgically via a posterolateral
   thoracotomy. No postoperative morbidity or mortality was observed. The
   mean follow-up was 8.3 years (14 months to 14 years), and no recurrence
   was noted. As important as the surgical repair of the foramen of
   Morgagni hernia itself is selection of the surgical approach so
   adhesions of the hernial sac from the surrounding tissues in the
   thoracic cavity are easily released. The transthoracic approach is
   amenable to safe primary repair of the defect and the release of
   adhesions, even in elderly and obese patients, in whom adhesions may be
   excessive.}},

Abstract = {{Durum breeders use a range of techniques in the development of new
   cultivars. An important selection criterion is the rheological
   properties of semolina dough and durum wheat breeders use this criterion
   in the development of new cultivars using a range of techniques. Because
   of the need to process large numbers of genotypes encountered in
   breeding programs, methods that are inexpensive, rapid, require small
   amounts of sample and that correlate with semolina quality are
   desirable. Using breeding material, this study investigated the
   relationship between the glutenin subunit composition and two
   traditional tests of gluten strength, gluten index (GI) and mixograph.
   Two sample sets of durum wheat breeding lines and cultivars, one grown
   in Canada (n = 229) and the other grown in Australia (n = 139) were
   analysed for GI, mixograph and both high molecular weight (HMW) and low
   molecular weight (LMW) glutenin subunits by SDS-PAGE. Nine different HMW
   and 14 different LMW allelic combinations were found. In the Canadian
   set, the most frequent LMW alleles were aaa, bba, caa and cfa while in
   the Australian set, caa was predominant. For the HMW subunits, the most
   common allelic groups were Glu-A1c/Glu-B1d (null, 6 + 8) and
   Glu-A1c/Glu-B1b (null, 7 + 8) with fewer numbers of Glu-A1c/Glu-B1e
   (null, 20) in both sample sets. LMW subunits were more important
   contributors to gluten strength than HMW subunits with the rank for
   higher GI according to the LMW allele (Canadian set) being caa = aaa >
   bba and aaa > cfa while HMW subunits 6 + 8 = 7 + 8 > 20. Similarly,
   using the mixograph, strength ranking for the LMW` alleles was aaa > cfa
   = bba and HMW subunit 20 gave poorer rheological proper-ties. For some
   samples with a good LMW` allelic group a low GI was observed and vice
   versa. Further characterisation of the protein composition in these
   samples showed the GI results could be explained by polymeric/monomeric
   (P/M), glutenin/gliadin (Glu/Gli) and HMW/LMW ratios or the proportion
   of unextractable polymeric protein. (c) Crown in the right of the State

Abstract = {{Objective: We sought to evaluate the incidence and significance of
   recurrent laryngeal nerve and swallowing dysfunction after a Norwood
   procedure compared with that after biventricular aortic arch
   reconstruction.
   Methods: From April 2003 through December 2004, 36 neonates underwent a
   Norwood procedure; 33 of 36 had postoperative fiberoptic laryngoscopy
   and modified barium swallow. Study results were used to guide the
   transition from nasogastric tube to oral feeding and placement of
   gastrostomy tubes. During the same time period, 18 neonates underwent
   aortic arch reconstruction as part of a biventricular repair.
   Results: After a Norwood procedure, laryngoscopy showed left true vocal
   fold (cord) paralysis in 3 (9\%) of 33 patients. The results of a
   modified barium swallow were abnormal in 16 (48\%) of 33 patients, with
   aspiration in 8 (24\%) of 33 patients. Of the 3 patients with vocal fold
   paralysis, 2 had a normal modified barium swallow result, and I had
   aspiration. Gastrostomy tubes were placed in 6 (18\%) of 33 patients,
   all with an abnormal modified barium swallow result. Hospital stay was
   longer in patients with an abnormal modified barium swallow result: 34
   +/- 13 versus 22 +/- 7 days (P <.01). After biventricular repair with
   aortic arch reconstruction, left true vocal fold paralysis occurred in 4
   (25\%) of 16 patients; results of a modified barium swallow were
   abnormal in 10 (59\%) of 17 patients, with aspiration in 6 (35\%) of 17
   patients (all nonsignificant vs patients undergoing the Norwood
   procedure). Follow-up laryngoscopy in 4 patients with vocal fold
   paralysis showed no change in 3 of 4 patients and improvement in I
   patient. Follow-up modified barium swallow showed resolution of
   aspiration in 11 (85\%) of 13 patients. Hospital survival was 32 (89\%)
   of 36 patients for the Norwood procedure and 18 (100\%) of 18 patients
   for biventricular repair. There has been I sudden death before
   second-stage palliation.
   Conclusions: After a Norwood procedure, swallowing dysfunction occurs in
   48\% of patients, with aspiration in 24\%, and results in increased
   length of hospital stay. Left recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, seen in
   9\% of patients, is an uncommon cause of swallowing dysfunction.
   Postoperative aspiration generally resolves over time, whereas vocal
   fold paralysis does not. Systematic evaluation of swallowing function
   allows appropriate tailoring of feeding regimens and might contribute to
   decreased hospital and interstage mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Eastern oysters Crassostreo virginica in Chesapeake Bay, USA, have been
   subjected to intense harvest pressure since about 1850 and to disease
   epizootics since the 1950s. Combined, these processes have degraded the
   once extensive eastern oyster bottom; the remaining oyster shells, which
   are required as Substrate for Successful larval oyster settlement, are
   thus rendered increasingly susceptible to siltation. Between 1999 and
   2001, we used an acoustic seabed classification system and underwater
   videography to assess oyster habitat conditions throughout Maryland's
   portion of Chesapeake Bay relative to eastern oyster recruitment and
   habitat restoration activities. We performed 16 Surveys that covered a
   total of 39 km(2) of bottom that were classified in 1911 as supporting
   productive oyster Populations. Over 90\% of this area has degraded from
   productive oyster bottom to mud, sand, or heavily sedimented oyster
   shell. Seventy percent of the locations we identified as containing
   Unsedimented shell came from within the approximately 90 km(2) of oyster
   bottom that had been Subject to the management activity of spreading
   large volumes of shell at some time between 1960 and 1999. However,
   video observations of 49 of these locations that had been replenished
   with shell at various times indicated that any improvements in oyster
   habitat were short lived, as interstitial spaces in spread shell became
   highly sedimented after an average period of 5.5 years (n = 49; SE =

Abstract = {{News coverage of tobacco issues influences both individual behavior
   change and policy progression. Thus, media advocacy is increasingly
   recognized as important for promoting public health. Letters to the
   editor (LTE) are a basic form of media advocacy, serving to demonstrate
   community sentiment on a given issue. Such letters are yet to receive
   systematic analytic consideration. The authors conducted an ethnographic
   content analysis of LTE on tobacco issues from a sample of 11 Australian
   daily newspapers over a 3-year period (2001 to 2003, N = 361). They
   argue that letters are artifacts of active engagement in a public debate
   and note that various stakeholders adopt similar strategies to pursue
   their objectives. They illustrate how identifying personal and
   collective identities is crucial in the assertion of legitimacy of voice
   in LTEs. Better understanding is needed of both the particular issues
   that spark public engagement, and the salient rhetoric employed by
   advocates of disparate positions.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists decrease bone
   mineral density, a surrogate for fracture risk, in men with prostate
   cancer. We conducted a claims-based cohort study to characterize the
   relationship between GnRH agonists and risk for clinical fractures in
   men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer.
   Patients and Methods Using medical claims data from a 5\% national
   random sample of Medicare beneficiaries, we identified a study group of
   men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer who initiated GnRH agonist
   treatment from 1992 to 1994 (n = 3,887). A comparison group of men with
   nonmetastatic prostate cancer who did not receive GnRH agonist treatment
   during the study period (n = 7,774) was matched for age, race,
   geographic location, and comorbidity. Clinical fractures were identified
   using inpatient, outpatient, and physician claims during 7 years of
   follow-up.
   Results In men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer, GnRH agonists
   significantly increased fracture risk. The rate of any clinical fracture
   was 7.88 per 100 person-years at risk in men receiving a GnRH agonist
   compared with 6.51 per 100 person-years in matched controls (relative
   risk, 1.21; 95\% CI, 1.14 to 1.29; P <.001). Rates of vertebral
   fractures (relative risk, 1.45; 95\% CI, 1.19 to 1.75; P < .001) and
   hip/femur fractures (relative risk, 1.30; 95\% CI, 1.10 to 1.53; P
   =.002) were also significantly higher in men who received a GnRH
   agonist. GnRH agonist treatment independently predicted fracture risk in
   multivariate analyses. Longer duration of treatment conferred greater
   fracture risk.
   Conclusion GnRH agonists significantly increase risk for any clinical
   fracture, hip fractures, and vertebral fractures in men with prostate
   cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Most primary brain cancers are associated with a dismal
   prognosis because of their aggressive behaviour and high mortality.
   Surgical resection with adjuvant radiotherapy is a major treatment for
   these cancers but little has been published about their surgical
   management in Australia. Objective. To determine changes since 1977 in
   demographic characteristics, tumour frequencies, surgical management,
   morbidity and survival for 1,339 patients discharged with astrocytoma
   (A) and oligodendroglioma (0), which comprise the majority of primary
   brain cancers, recorded prospectively in northern Sydney neurosurgery
   databases. Discharges were grouped into eras reflecting changes in
   diagnostic and surgical technology. Results. Between eras 1977-79 and
   1999-2002, mean age increased by 9.5 years, and inpatient stay fell from
   21 to 9 days. The proportion of 0 rose as A fell. Of 144 re-biopsies,
   16\% had less anaplastic pathology, 54\% the same and 30\% more
   anaplastic pathology than the first biopsy. Stereotactically assisted
   surgery increased, with overall rates of burr hole for biopsy decreasing
   and of craniotomy rising. Between 1980-86 and 1999-2002, inpatient
   mortality declined from 7.3 to 2.3\% of discharges, reopening of
   craniotomy and wound complication rates fell, while postoperative
   neurological deficit rose. Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism
   rates for discharges increased significantly. Age and histopathologic
   grade were predictors of survival from 1980. Sex and era of diagnosis
   did not influence survival. After adjustment for age using proportional
   hazards regression, survival improved only for anaplastic A, with a 60\%
   improvement for patients diagnosed in era 3, and a 50\% improvement for
   patients diagnosed in era 4 relative to those in era 1. Conclusions.
   Although markers of inpatient care have improved since the 1980s,
   age-adjusted survival has not increased except for patients with
   anaplastic A. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the present paper we analyze how speakers introduce new characters in
   narratives. We argue that, before what is ordinarily thought of as the
   introductory referring expression, speakers have used a variety of
   strategies to set the stage mentally for the character. We think in
   terms of discourse units, reference episodes, rather than structural
   units for studying reference. We take as our starting point the
   interactive strategies used in dialogues, and we look at monologues in
   terms of how speakers contextualize them {[}cf. Linell, Per, 1998.
   Approaching Dialogue: Talk, Interaction and Contexts in Dialogic
   Perspectives (IMPACT Studies in Language and Society). Benjamins,
   Amsterdam]. We build on work in several areas, especially the analysis
   of information flow {[}Chafe, Wallace, 1994. Discourse, Consciousness
   and Time: The Flow and Displacement of Consciousness Experience in
   Speaking and Writing. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago]. We
   found that speakers often treated referents as given or accessible on
   their first mention. However, speakers had previously used one or more
   pre-introductions either to activate the referent from common ground, to
   create a character placeholder, or to signal that a new character was
   forthcoming. In addition, speakers may provide cues as to whether the
   referent will be difficult to access. Monologue speakers varied in how
   they apparently construed the audience, and their reference strategies
   followed from their construal. We argue that the speaker's ability to
   prepare the audience incrementally is a further example of
   intersubjectivity and an important part of communicative competence. (c)

Abstract = {{Chronic kidney disease affects approximately 19 million adult Americans,
   and its incidence is increasing rapidly. Diabetes and hypertension are
   the underlying causes in most cases of chronic kidney disease. Evidence
   suggests that progression to kidney failure can be delayed or prevented
   by controlling blood sugar levels and blood pressure and by treating
   proteinuria. Unfortunately, chronic kidney disease often is overlooked
   in its earliest, most treatable stages. Guidelines from the National
   Kidney Foundations Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI)
   recommend estimating glomerular filtration rate and screening for
   albuminuria in patients with risk factors for chronic kidney disease,
   including diabetes, hypertension, systemic illnesses, age greater than
   60 years, and family history of chronic kidney disease. The glomerular
   filtration rate, calculated by using a prediction equation, detects
   chronic kidney disease more accurately than does the serum creatinine
   level alone; the glomerular filtration rate also is used for disease
   staging. In most clinical situations, analysis of random urine samples
   to determine the alburnin-creatinine or protein-creatinine ratio has
   replaced analysis of timed urine collections. When chronic kidney
   disease is detected, an attempt should be made to identify and treat the
   specific underlying condition(s). The KDOQI guidelines define major
   treatment goals for all patients with chronic kidney disease. These
   goals include slowing disease progression, detecting and treating
   complications, and managing cardiovascular risk factors. Primary care
   physicians have an important role in detecting chronic kidney disease
   early, in instituting measures to slow disease progression, and in
   providing timely referral to a nephrologist.}},

Abstract = {{Sign languages modulate the production of signs in space and use this
   spatial modulation to refer back to entities-to maintain coreference. We
   ask here whether spatial modulation is so fundamental to language in the
   manual modality that it will be invented by individuals asked to create
   gestures on the spot. English speakers were asked to describe vignettes
   under 2 conditions: using gesture without speech, and using speech with
   spontaneous gestures. When using gesture alone, adults placed gestures
   for particular entities in non-neutral locations and then used those
   locations to refer back to the entities. When using gesture plus speech,
   adults also produced gestures in non-neutral locations but used the
   locations coreferentially far less often. When gesture is forced to take
   on the full burden of communication, it exploits space for coreference.
   Coreference thus appears to be a resilient property of language, likely
   to emerge in communication systems no matter how simple.}},

Abstract = {{Some of the pedologic alterations resulting from traditional soil
   management methods were studied in an area cultivated with citrus
   (Citrus sinensis) in a farm in Bariri County, State of Sao Paulo,
   Brazil. A toposequence was established to evaluate the effect of the
   position in the landscape on changes in soil physical attributes. Field
   and lab data were taken in vertical Profiles of the upper, middle and
   lower slope levels of a Typic Haplorthox and some parameters were
   evaluated statistically through mean comparison tests. Results evidenced
   that the soil bulk density and macroporosity changed along the
   toposequence, especially at the lower levels of the slope. In such
   positions, where the clay level is higher, empty spaces were filled,
   forming blocky structures, which occurred concomitantly with
   micro-aggregate structure. Intensive cultivation caused the greatest
   soil structure alterations, even at the deeper soil layer. The study
   reinforces the importance of detailed morphological observations in
   vertical profiles due to the great variation of pedological attributes
   within a short distance. In a single profile, compact sectors were
   observed side by side with disaggregated pockets. This shows that
   vertical gradients (in each profile) as well as lateral ones (along a
   toposequence) have to be taken into account when studying temporal
   variations of pedological parameters.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated how the physical-chemical characteristics of
   natural amino acids influence the conformational stability of
   reconibinant human growth hormone (rhGH) and hexameric recombinant human
   insulin. A statistical design, with a set of physical-chemical
   descriptors, was used to ensure selection of natural amino acids having
   a wide range of properties. Amino acids were found to affect agitation
   induced aggregation of rhGH, as well as insulin. Of particular interest,
   a substantial stabilization of rhGH occurred in the presence of
   arginine. In contrast, insulin was destabilized in the presence of all
   the amino acids selected. A model correlating amino acid physicochemical
   properties and rhGH agitation-induced aggregation was established.
   However, no such model could be constructed for the insulin stability
   data. Thus, it remains questionable whether a simple set of
   physical-chemical descriptors can sufficiently reflect the general
   impact of amino acids on the delicate balance of forces needed to
   maintain protein physical stability.}},

Abstract = {{Our purpose in this article is to study a unidimensional model of
   spatial electoral competition with four political parties. We assume
   that the voters are distributed along {[}0, 1] in such a way that the
   density delta of this distribution is continuous on {[}0,1] and strictly
   positive on (0,1). The parties engage in a Downsian competition which is
   modeled as a non-cooperative four-person game g(delta) with {[}0, 1] as
   the common strategy set. If xi(i) stands for the ith quartile of the
   above-mentioned distribution, then we prove that 9(delta) has a pure
   Nash equilibrium, if and only if (graphics) delta(x)dx <= 1/4 for every
   t is an element of (xi(1),xi(3)). Moreover, if this condition is
   satisfied, then g(6) has exactly six pure Nash equilibria, which are
   characterized by the fact that two of the parties put forward the policy
   that corresponds to and the other two of them put forward the policy
   that corresponds to xi(3). (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of guanine nucleotides on the intrinsic and extrinsic
   fluorescence properties of dynamin were assessed. The intrinsic Trp
   (tryptophan) fluorescence spectra of purified recombinant dynamin-1 and
   -2 were very similar, with a maximum at 332 nm. Collisional quenching by
   KI was weak (similar to 30\%), suggesting that the majority of Trp
   residues are buried. Binding of guanine nucleotides decreased intrinsic
   fluorescence by 15-20\%. Titration of the effects showed that GTP and
   GDP bound to a single class of noninteracting sites in dynamin tetramers
   with apparent dissociation constants (K-d) values of 5.4 and 7.4 mu M
   (dynamin-1) and 13.2 and 7.1 mu M (dynamin-2) respectively. Similar
   dissociation constant values for both nucleotides were obtained by
   fitrating the quenching of IAEDANS
   {[}N-iodoacetyl-N'-(5-sulpho-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine]-labelled
   dynamin-2. Despite the similar binding affinities, GTP and GDP result in
   different conformations of the protein, as revealed by sensitivity to
   proteinase K fragmentation. Dynamins contain five Trp residues, of which
   four are in the PH domain (pleckstrin homology domain) and one is in the
   C-terminal PRD (proline/arginine-rich domain). Guanine nucleotides
   quenched fluorescence emission from a truncated (Delta PRD) mutant
   dynamin-1 to the same extent as in the full-length protein, suggesting
   confonnational coupling between the G (groove)domain and the PH domain.
   Efficient resonance energy transfer from PH domain Trp residues to bound
   mant-GTP {[}where mant stands for 2'-(3')-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)]
   suggests that the G-domain and PH domain are in close proximity (5-6
   nm). Promotion of dynamin-2 oligomerization, by reduction in ionic
   strength or increasing protein concentration, had little effect on
   intrinsic dynamin fluorescence. However, fluorescence emission from
   IAEDANS center dot dynamin-2 showed a significant spectral shift on
   oligomerization. In addition, energy transfer was observed when
   oligomerization was promoted in mixtures of IAEDANS dynamin-2 and
   4-(4-dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoic acid-coupled dynamin-2, an effect
   that was counteracted by GTP but not GDP.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the operation of an automotive poly-rib
   serpentine belt system. A three-dimensional dynamic finite element
   model, consisting of a driver pulley, a driven pulley, and a complete

   three different elastomeric compounds and a single layer of reinforcing
   cords. Rubber was considered incompressible hyperelastic material, and
   cord was considered linear elastic material. The material model
   accounting for thermal strains and temperature-dependent properties of
   the rubber solids was implemented in ABAQUS/EXPLICIT code for the
   simulation. A tangential shear angle and an axial shear angle were
   defined to quantify shear deformations. The shear angles were found to
   be closely related to velocity variation along contact arc and the
   imbalanced contact stress distribution on different sides of the same
   rib and on different ribs. The temperature effect on shear deformation,
   tension anti velocity variation, and contact stress distribution was
   investigated and shown in comparison to the results for the same system
   operating at room temperature.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the function of dimerization of the TRH receptor, a
   controlled dimerization system was developed. A variant FK506 binding
   protein (FKBP) domain was fused to the receptor C terminus and
   dimerization induced by incubating cells with dimeric FKBP ligand,
   AP20187. The TRH receptor-fusion bound hormone and signaled normally.
   Addition of dimerizer to cells expressing the receptor-FKBP fusion
   dramatically increased the fraction of receptor running as dimer on
   SDS-PAGE. AP20187 caused dimerization in a time-and
   concentration-dependent manner, acting within 1 min. Dimerizer had no
   effect on TRH receptors lacking the FKBP domain, and its effects were
   blocked by excess monomeric FKBP ligand. AP20187-induced dimerization
   did not cause receptor phosphorylation, inositol phosphate production,
   duction or ERK1/2 activation, and dimerizer did not alter signaling by
   TRH. Induced dimerization did, however, alter TRH receptor trafficking.
   TRH promoted greater receptor internalization in cells treated with
   AP20187 but not monomeric ligand, based on loss of surface binding sites
   and immunostaining. Dimerization increased the rate of internalization
   of TRH receptors and decreased the apparent rate of receptor recycling.
   AP20187 enhanced the small amount of TRH-induced receptor
   internalization when the receptor-FKBP fusion protein was expressed in
   cells lacking beta-arrestins. The results show that controlled
   dimerization of the TRH receptor potentiates hormone-induced receptor
   trafficking.}},

Abstract = {{Porphyromonas gingivalis is a periodontopathogen that may play a role in
   cardiovascular diseases. Hemagglutinins may function as adhesins and are
   required for virulence of several bacterial pathogens. The aim of this
   study was to determine the role of hemagglutinin B (HagB) in adherence
   of P. gingivalis to human coronary artery endothelial (HCAE) cells. 1
   gingivalis strain 381, a P. gingivalis 381 HagB mutant, Escherichia coli
   JM109 expressing HagB (E. coli-HagB), and E. coli JM109 containing pUC9
   (E. coli-pUC9) were tested for their ability to attach to HCAE cells.
   Inhibition assays were performed to determine the ability of purified
   recombinant HagB (rHagB) as well as antibodies to HagB, including the
   polyclonal antibody (PAb) A7985 and the monoclonal antibody (MAb)
   HL1858, to inhibit the attachment of P. gingivalis to HCAE cells. As
   expected, when the attachment of P. gingivalis and the HagB mutant were
   compared, no statistical significance was observed between the two
   groups (P = 0.331), likely due to the expression of the hagB homolog
   hagC. However, E. coli-HagB adhered significantly better to HCAE cells
   than did E. coli-pUC9, the control strain. In a competition assay, the
   presence of purified rHagB decreased bacterial adhesion of 1 gingivalis
   or E. coli-HagB to HCAE cells. The presence of PAb A7985 or MAb HL1858
   also significantly decreased attachment of P. gingivalis and E.
   coli-HagB to host cells. These results indicate that HagB is involved in
   the adherence of P. gingivalis to human primary endothelial cells.}},

Abstract = {{A new TiO2-modified film on carbon steel was prepared by electroless
   plating and sol-gel composite process. An artificial neural net was used
   to optimize the preparing condition of the film. The optimized condition

   NiP is 50 min, number of dip coating is 4, heat treatment time is 2 h,
   and the molar ratio of complexing reagent to Ti(OC4H9)(4) is 1.5 : 1.
   Corrosion behavior of carbon steel with coating was investigated by
   polarization resistance measurement, anode polarization, EIS and ESEM
   measurement. XPS was used to characterize the element valence of the
   modified film. Results show that carbon steel with TiO2-modified film
   has good corrosion resistance in 0.5 mol/L of H2SO4 Solution and 0.5
   mol/L of NaCl solution. It is also found that the preparing condition of

Abstract = {{The optimum conditions for synthesizing LiNi1-y Co (y) O-2 (y=0.1, 0.3
   and 0.5) by a simplified combustion method, in which the preheating step
   is omitted, and the electrochemical properties of these materials were
   investigated. The optimum condition for synthesizing LiNi0.9Co0.1O2 by
   the simplified combustion method is calcination at 800 degrees C for 12
   h in air in 3.6 mole ratio of urea to nitrate. The LiNi0.9Co0.1O2
   synthesized under these conditions shows the smallest R-factor\{(I
   (006)+I (102))/I (101)\} and the largest I (003)/I (104), indicating
   better hexagonal ordering and less cation mixing, respectively. The
   LiNi0.7Co0.3O2 synthesized at 800 degrees C for 12 h in air in 3.6 mole
   ratio of urea to nitrate has the largest first discharge capacity 156.2
   mA h g(-1) at 0.5C and shows relatively good cycling performance. This
   sample shows better hexagonal ordering and less cation mixing than the
   other samples. The particle size of the LiNi0.7Co0.3O2 is relatively
   small and its particles are spherical with uniform particle size.}},

Abstract = {{The immune privilege that exists in the eye is maintained by various
   mechanisms. One of the best studied is a form of systemic tolerance
   termed anterior chamber-associated immune deviation (ACAID). We have
   investigated the mechanisms by which ocular inflammation associated with
   the vitreous cavity (VC) is reduced, by injecting either ovalbumin (OVA)
   or allogeneic splenocytes into the VCs of mice, and assessed the effect
   of this on delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses. After antigen
   inoculation into the VC, antigen-specific DTH responses were
   significantly impaired and we named this phenomenon `vitreous
   cavity-associated immune deviation' (VCAID). VCAID could also be induced
   by inoculating antigen-pulsed macrophages into the VC. However, VCAID
   did not develop either in mice with inflamed eyes, whether as a result
   of experimental autoimmune uveitis or coadministration of interleukin
   (IL)-6 in the VC, or in knockout mice deficient for natural killer T
   (NKT) cells. Finally, we found that so-called `hyalocytes' are the only
   cells present in the VCs of normal mice, uniformly distributed on the
   retinal surface. Interestingly, they express F4/80, suggesting that
   hyalocytes are candidate antigen-presenting cells (APCs) responsible for
   mediating VCAID. As for the anterior chamber model, systemic tolerance
   can be induced in the VC in non-inflamed eyes and in the presence of
   invariant NKT cells.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of landscape position on the dynamics of N in the
   soil-plant system has not been adequately studied. Our aim with this
   study on a predominantly Black Chemozem soil was to evaluate the effect
   of slope position (upper vs. lower) and N fertilizer application (none
   vs. 60 kg N ha(-1)) on soil and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) N through
   the growing season. Landscape position had a dominant effect on soil
   NO3- and soluble organic N (SON) concentrations, especially in the
   surface 15 cm. These pools of soil N and net N mineralization were
   greater at the lower than at the upper slope position. The landscape
   effect is attributed to higher organic matter content (as measured by
   organic C) and water availability in lower compared with upper slope
   positions. Nitrogen application had no measurable effect on soil NO3-
   and SON concentrations. Exchangeable and non-exchangeable NH4+ were
   little affected by slope position or N fertilization. Nitrogen
   application increased wheat N uptake; however, its influence was less
   than that of slope position, especially on N accumulation in wheat heads
   during grain-filling. Although N application increased wheat yields,
   landscape position exerted the greater influence: grain yield was less
   on upper than lower slope positions due to earlier onset of crop
   maturity. During grain filling, net N mineralization was suppressed at
   the upper slope position and by N application. The increase in crop
   yield and N uptake due to N application was not significantly different
   between slope positions. This study demonstrated that landscape position
   had a greater influence on N dynamics and availability than the
   application of typical amounts of fertilizer N and that the two effects
   were mostly independent of each other.}},

Abstract = {{The 2000 Hekla eruption took place from February 26 to March 8. Its
   seismic expressions were a swarm of numerous small earthquakes related
   to its onset, and low-frequency volcanic tremor that continued
   throughout the eruption. A swarm of small earthquakes was observed some
   80 min before the onset of the eruption, and the size of the events
   increased with time. Low-frequency volcanic tremor, with a
   characteristic frequency band of 0.5-1.5 Hz and dominant spectral
   peak(s) at 0.7-0.9 Hz, became visible at 18:19 GMT on February 26,
   marking the onset of the eruption. The tremor amplitude rose quickly and
   was very high in the beginning of the eruption. However, it soon began
   to decrease after about an hour. In general, the seismic activity
   related to the 2000 Hekla eruption was very similar to what was observed
   in the previous eruption in 1991. Based on knowledge gained from
   seismicity and strain observations from 1991, this was the first time
   that a Hekla eruption was predicted.}},

Abstract = {{Psychoanalysis must be an idiosyncratic matter. That means that the
   encounter between the patient and the analyst is carried out through the
   personal character of both participants. But there is something more.
   Historical and cultural patterns are also most influential. The present
   and the past social context where the psychoanalytic bipersonal meeting
   occurs is a significant factor in the evanescent constitution and the
   constant movement between the ego of the analyst and the ego of the
   patient. Therefore, in this radical view only Freud would fulfill a
   Freudian encounter. We, as probable post-Freudians, must be permanently
   searching for personal, idiosyncratic ways in the clinical work.
   Brazilian psychoanalysts face the challenge to treat their patients in a
   Brazilian way. To understand Brazilian people and the way psychoanalysis
   may develop in this land, we must know that Brazilians' lived experience
   is frequently blended by irony, paradox, and the fleeting character of
   the human life. Words-a pragmatic perspective of Brazilian words in
   action-are essential for the task. Interrogative psychoanalytic
   dialogues are my main topic of research.}},

   A cavitating jet in air was succesfully generated by injecting a
   high-speed water jet into a low-speed water jet injected into air using
   a concentric nozzle. In order to investigate the various appearances of
   cavitating jets in air, an observation was carried out using high-speed
   photography and high-speed video recording. In this stud periodical
   shading of the cavitation cloud was observed and the frequency of the
   shading was found to be a function of the injection pressure of the
   low-speed waterjet. Unsteadiness of the low-speed waterjet, which is
   related to the periodical shading of the cloud, was also observed.}},

Abstract = {{alpha-Tocopherol is the most important lipophilic antioxidant of the
   chromanol type protecting biomembranes from lipid peroxidation (LPO).
   Therefore, (x-tocopherol and its derivatives are frequently used in the
   therapy or prevention of oxygen radical-derived diseases. In the present
   study, novel chromanol-type antioxidants (twin-chromanol, cis- and
   trans-oxachromanol) as well as the well-known short-chain analogue of
   alpha-tocopherol, pentamethyl-chromanol, were tested for their
   antioxidative potency in rat heart mitochondria (RHM). Our experiments
   revealed that the bioenergetic parameters of mitochondria were not
   deteriorated in the presence of chromanols (up to 50 nmol/mg protein).
   Exposure of RHM to cumene hydroperoxide and Fe2+, (final concentrations
   50 mu M each), inducing LPO, significantly affected their bioenergetic
   parameters which were determined in the presence of glutamate and malate
   (substrates of mitochondrial complex 1). Alterations of the bioenergetic
   parameters were partially prevented in a concentration-dependent manner
   by preincubating RHM with antioxidants before adding the
   radical-generating system. In the lower concentration range,
   twin-chromanol turned out to be more efficient than
   pentamethyl-chromanol, both being far more protective than cis- and
   trans-oxachromanol. Measurement of protein-bound SH groups and
   thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances revealed that this protective
   effect was due to their antioxidative action. Furthermore, HPLC
   measurements of alpha-tocopherol and alpha-tocopheryl quinone in rat
   liver mitochondria demonstrated an alpha-tocopherol-sparing effect of
   twin-chromanol. In conclusion, new chromanol-type antioxidants,
   especially twin-chromanol, were able to improve bioenergetic and
   biochemical parameters of mitochondria exposed to oxidative stress. (c)

Abstract = {{Objective. To investigate the geographical variation in prostate cancer
   incidence in Sweden, in particular the incidences of screening-detected
   tumours and curative treatment of prostate cancer. Material and methods.
   Data were retrieved from the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden
   for all cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in the year 2000-01. There
   were a total of 14 376 cases of prostate cancer and the mean total
   annual age-adjusted incidence was 197/100 000 men. There were 3318 cases
   in tumour category T1c, i.e. non-palpable tumours diagnosed during
   work-up for an elevated serum level of prostate-specific antigen, 1006
   of which (30\%) were asymptomatic and detected at a health checkup.
   Results. The difference between the counties with the lowest and highest
   age-adjusted incidences per 100 000 men of total prostate cancer was
   almost twofold (128 vs 217). The corresponding variation in incidence of
   category T1c tumours was more than fourfold (13 vs 60); the difference
   in incidence of T1c tumours detected in asymptomatic men was up to
   10-fold (2 vs 20); and there was more than a fourfold variation in
   incidence of curative treatment between counties (13 vs 67). Measured
   incidences were mostly highest in urban regions and in counties with
   university hospitals. Conclusion. There are large geographical
   variations in prostate cancer incidence and in the frequency of curative
   treatment for prostate cancer in Sweden and there appear to be large
   geographical variations in the uptake of prostate cancer screening.}},

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION This study examines changes in vascular service provision
   and activity in a single UK health region over 10 years.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS A questionaire on involvement in vascular surgery
   was sent to all general surgeons in the Oxford region in 1992, 1997 and
   2001. Data on involvement in vascular surgery were obtained from rhe
   Department of Health.
   RESULTS Over 10 years the number of general surgeons not performing any
   emergency vascular (arterial) surgery rose from 33\% to 65\% (P=0.002).
   There was also a fall in the number of general surgeons performing only
   emergency vascular surgery (P=0.009). Trends were observed towards more
   vascular emergencies being transferred to another hospital (P=0.068) and
   proportionally fewer general surgeons undertaking recurrent varicose
   vein surgery (P=0.09). The number of vascular reconstructions was 20.8
   per 100,000 in 1997-1998 but falling to 27.2 per 100,000 by 199-2000,
   the greatest increase in activity was seen in the regional centre.
   Endovascular procedures increased from 8.2 per 100,000 in 1990-1991 to
   21.27 in 1995-1996 falling to 17.4 by 1999-2000. Over 10 years, the
   overall major amputation rate remained between 10-12 per 100,000.
   CONCLUSIONS The changes reflect the gradual separation of vascular
   surgery from general surgery occuring nationally. They also suggest a
   more conservative approach in the management of certain vascular
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Microbial leakage and colonization between implants and their
   abutments may cause inflammatory reactions in the peri-implant tissues.
   This study evaluated microbial leakage at the implant-abutment interface
   with a new in vitro model. Materials and Methods: Bacterial leakage was
   tested during dynamic loading in a 2-axis chewing simulator. The authors
   theorized that dynamic loading would decrease the stability of the
   implant-abutment connections and thereby lead to bacterial penetration
   along the gap. Five different implant systems with 8 standard
   implant-abutment combinations for single molar crowns were tested. The
   internal aspects of the implants were inoculated with a bacterial
   suspension and connected to the superstructure with the recommended
   torque. The specimens were immersed in a nutrient solution and loaded
   with 1,200,000 cycles of 120 N in the chewing simulator. Results:
   Statistically significant differences (P <=.05) between implant systems
   with respect to number of chewing cycles until bacterial penetration
   were found. Discussion: The degree of penetration in a specific implant
   system presumably is a multifactorial condition dependent on the
   precision of fit between the implant and the abutment, the degree of
   micromovement between the components, and the torque forces used to
   connect them. Conclusion: It was concluded that the newly developed test
   model is a sensitive tool for the detection of differences between
   current implant systems with respect to their ability to prevent
   bacterial penetration at the implant-abutment interface under dynamic
   loading conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Oxygen consumption and tail beat frequency were measured on saithe
   (Pollachius virens) and whiting (Merlangius merlangus) during steady
   swimming. Oxygen consumption increased exponentially with swimming
   speed, and the relationship was described by a power function. The
   extrapolated standard metabolic rates (SMR) were similar for saithe and
   whiting, whereas the active metabolic rate (AMR) was twice as high for
   saithe. The higher AMR resulted in a higher scope for activity in
   accordance with the higher critical swimming speed (U (crit)) achieved
   by saithe. The optimum swimming speed (U (opt)) was 1.4 BL s(-1) for
   saithe and 1.0 BL s(-) for whiting with a corresponding cost of
   transport (COT) of 0.14 and 0.15 J N-1 m(-1). Tail beat frequency
   correlated strongly with swimming speed as well as with oxygen
   consumption. In contrast to swimming speed and oxygen consumption,
   measurement of tail beat frequency on individual free-ranging fish is
   relatively uncomplicated. Tail beat frequency may therefore serve as a
   predictor of swimming speed and oxygen consumption of saithe and whiting

   inoculated SC into 20 six week-old NOD/SCID mice and 20 six week-old
   CD1-nu mice. Seven weeks later, tumor-bearing mice were divided into
   treatment and control groups. Treatment group was injected with Doxil (6
   mg/kg, IP, as a single injection). Control group was injected with
   buffered saline (0.75cc, IP). Tumor size was determined by caliper
   measurements and tumor response was assessed according to standard
   criteria. In both strains there was a significant decrease in tumor size
   in response to Doxil treatment (P < 0.0001). In CD1-nu eight out of nine
   tumors (88\%) responded to the treatment, and in 2 cases complete
   remission was observed. In NOD/SCID group response to the treatment was
   seen in eight out of ten tumors (80\%) but none regressed fully.
   Response to the treatment was statistically equal in both strains even
   though the apoptotic rate, confirmed by TUNEL staining, was higher in
   NOD/SCID than in CD-1-nu (8.65\% and 0.7\%, respectively) and tumor
   infiltrating cells were different: eosinophils in NOD/SCID and
   CD45R-positive B lymphocytes, and plasma cells in CD-1-nu. In untreated
   CD1-nu mice, tumor progress was slower than in NOD/ SCID. Our results
   indicate that Doxil is effective against CTVT in mouse xenograft models.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Transport of the critically ill patient to or from the
   emergency department (ED) is a frequent occurrence. This study was
   designed to determine whether UK EDs currently have appropriate
   equipment, monitoring, staff training systems, and processes of care for
   transportation of the critically ill patient.
   Methods: A postal questionnaire regarding ED transfer patients was sent
   to 247 UK EDs, followed by repeat mailing and telephone follow up of
   non-responders.
   Results: In total, 139 EDs (56\%) responded. An estimated 20 - 30
   critically ill patients are transferred from and,20 are received by each
   ED annually. Processes of care are poorly developed; only 79 EDs ( 56\%)
   have transfer guidelines available. Audit of transfers is ongoing in 59
   EDs (42\%), and critical incident reporting is ongoing in 122 (88\%).
   There is a lack of immediately available transport equipment; for
   example, 17 EDs (12\%) have no transport ventilator, 9 (6\%) have no
   transport monitor, and 9 ( 6\%) have no syringe pump. Transport
   equipment is invariably not standardised. Anaesthetic staff of
   specialist registrar (74 doctors; 53\%) or senior house officer (36
   doctors; 26\%) grades carry out the majority of ED transfers accompanied
   by a D or E grade nurse. Both invariably have no formal transfer
   training.
   Conclusions: This study highlights inadequacies in provision of
   equipment and monitoring during interhospital transfer from the ED.
   Training and processes of care for transport of the critically ill are
   also suboptimum. Many departments are currently reviewing these
   processes to formalise and improve transfer training procedures and
   protocols.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL WELFARE}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{319-325}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Growing public concern regarding animal welfare and consumer demand for
   humanely produced products have placed pressure on the meat wool and
   dairy industries to improve and confirm the welfare status of their
   animals. This has increased the need for reliable methods of assessing
   animal welfare during commercial farm practices. The measurement of the
   stress caused by commercial farm practices is a major component of
   animal welfare assessment. However, a major issue for animal welfare
   science is that many of the techniques used to measure stress involve
   invasive procedures, such as blood sampling, which may themselves cause
   a stress response and therefore affect the measurement of interest. To
   reduce this problem, a number of non-invasive or minimally invasive
   methods and devices have been developed to measure stress. These include
   the measurement of cortisol concentrations in saliva and faeces, and
   remote devices for recording body temperature, heart rate and the
   collection of blood samples. This review describes the benefits and
   limitations of some of these methods for measuring stress. In
   particular, the review focuses on recent advances and current research
   in the use of infrared thermogrophy (IRT) for measuring stress. Specific
   applications for IRT in the dairy and beef industries are also described
   including an automated, non-invosive system for early diagnosis of
   infection in cattle. It is essential that non-invasive measures of acute
   and chronic stress are developed for reliable assessment of animal
   welfare during standard form management practices and IRT may be a
   useful tool for this purpose. IRT may offer advantages over many other
   non-invasive systems as it appears to be capable of measuring different
   components of the stress axis, including acute sympathetic and
   hypotholamic-pituitary-odrenocorticaI responses.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Age-related decline in taste acuity may be both a cause and
   an effect of depleted zinc and/or increased zinc requirement.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to explore associations between
   zinc status and taste acuity in healthy older European adults aged 55-90
   y.
   Sample: Volunteers were recruited within Italy (n = 108 aged 70-90 y),
   the United Kingdom (UK) (n = 93 aged 55-70) and two regions of France (n
   = 186), Grenoble (aged 70-90 y) and Clermont-Ferrand (aged 55-70 y).
   Methods: A signal detection theory approach was adopted, employing a
   three-alternative, forced-choice procedure. The data were converted to
   R-indices and bivariate correlations were computed to explore
   relationships between serum zinc, erythrocyte zinc and taste acuity.
   ANOVA was undertaken to determine regional differences in zinc status.
   Results: Higher erythrocyte zinc status was associated with better
   acuity for salt (sodium chloride) taste in the sample as a whole (P =
   0.012) (n = 385). Higher serum zinc levels were associated with greater
   sensitivity to sour taste (citric acid) (P = 0.015) only in the older
   groups (aged 70-90 y). There were no apparent associations between serum
   or erythrocyte zinc status and acuity for bitter (quinine) or sweet
   (sucrose) tastes irrespective of age.
   Conclusion: These results agree with those previously suggesting that
   age-related detriment in sensitivity for salt taste may be associated
   with depleted zinc.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of schizophrenic subtypes shows a high range of
   cross-cultural and historical variations. Our study aimed to investigate
   the effect of different diagnostic criteria on the prevalence of

   classified according to Diagnostic (aid Statistical Manual of Mental
   Disorders, Fourth Edition, International Statistical Classification of
   Diseases, 10th Revision, and Bleuler's and Leonhard's criteria.
   Especially, the frequency of catatonic (10\%-22\%) and hebephrenic
   (5\%-20\%) Subtypes of schizophrenia varied within a broad range
   depending on the diagnostic system applied. The comparison of
   International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision and
   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', Fourth Edition
   with ``classical{''} criteria (Bleuler, Leonhard) for the different
   schizophrenic subtypes showed a reduction of typical symptoms and the
   introduction of criteria of prominence during the last century. These

   parkinsonian symptoms developed acutely and progressed to hand tremor,
   sialorrhea, upper body rigidity, masked facies, striatal hand,
   bradykinesia, and a severe, unsteady, shuffling gait. Tremor and
   rigidity were the only parkinsonian symptoms that responded to
   anticholinergic therapy. After converting from a first- to a
   second-generation antipsychotic drug, the patient maintained psychiatric
   stability, with some improvement in motor functioning-most notably
   decreased upper body rigidity. Our findings are consistent with the
   literature on quetiapine therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease in
   terms of adequately controlling psychosis without worsening motor
   symptoms. The difference, however, was that in most cases reported,

Abstract = {{Background: T cells of tumor-bearing mice or cancer patients exhibit an
   immune dysfunction, enabling the tumor to escape immune surveillance.
   Methods: The experiments are based on EL4 thymoma cells that were
   transfected with costimulatory ligands B7-1, B7-2, or both at the same
   time. We used oligonucleotide-based DNA chip microarrays to characterize
   the genomic expression profile of peripheral T cells according to their
   anti-tumor immune response in vivo. These murine T cells were also
   characterized by ELISA, FACS analysis, and co-stimulatory assays.
   Results: Using commonly established methods, such as FACS analysis or
   the analysis of the cytokine profile by ELISA, it was not possible to
   determine functional differences in the in vivo activity of T
   lymphocytes against tumor cells. EL4 tumor cells induced multiple
   anti-tumor immune responses in vivo depending on their B7 expression. We
   successfully used microarray analysis to identify genes that were
   differentially expressed in the dysfunctional T cells, which were unable
   to reject tumors in vivo. Although Th1 and Th2 cytokine expression was
   not affected, we observed differential expression of genes involved in
   the regulation of an innate immune response. Conclusion: Our results
   provide evidence that the anti-tumor response can be identified by the
   ``gene profile{''} of T cells. Genomic scale analysis offers the
   opportunity to identify subtle changes in gene expression in T cells
   reflecting a distinct biological behavior in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To investigate the independent contribution of individual
   socioeconomic markers and state prohibition policy on alcohol
   consumption among men and women in India.
   Methods The study used a multilevel cross-sectional analysis of alcohol
   consumption from the 1998-1999 Indian national family health survey of
   301 984 adult individuals in 92 447 households in 3215 villages in 440
   districts in 26 states, stratified by sex.
   Findings Men with no education were more likely to consume alcohol that
   those with a post graduate education (OR, 2.28; 95\% Cl, 2.08-2.50).
   Unlike men, women showed a U-shaped association between education and
   alcohol consumption. Men and women living in households at the lowest
   standard-of-living quintile were more likely to consume alcohol (OR,
   1.92; 95\% Cl, 1.81-2.03, and OR, 2.72, 95\% Cl, 2.18-3.39),
   respectively, than those classified as living in the top quintile.
   Members of scheduled tribes and castes and other backward classes were
   more likely to consume alcohol than members of other caste groups. There
   was no difference in alcohol consumption between men from states that
   were not under prohibition (OR, 1.36; 95\% Cl 0.69-2.03) and those that
   were. By contrast, states not under prohibition has higher alcohol use
   by women (OR, 3.04, 95\% Cl, 1.59-4.48) than those under partial or
   complete prohibition.
   Conclusions Caste, education and standard of living independently
   influence alcohol use in India. Prohibition policies appear to have
   little effect on alcohol use by men, but may reduce the proportion of
   women who consume alcohol. The socioeconomic patterning of health
   behaviours is likely to feed substantially into inequalities in health
   outcomes. Further investigation is required to understand how social and
   cultural factors in more localized contexts (e.g. districts) influence
   alcohol consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Although it is known that mastoparan, a wasp venom toxin, directly
   activates G(i/o), mastoparan-induced biological responses are not always
   explained by this mechanism. For instance, we have demonstrated
   previously that mastoparan suppressed phosphoinositide hydrolysis
   induced by carbachol in human astrocytoma cells (FEBS Lett 206: 91-94,
   1990). In the present study, we examined whether mastoparan affected
   phosphoinositide hydrolysis by interacting with lipid rafts in PC-12
   cells. Mastoparan inhibited UTP-induced increase in {[}Ca2+](i) and
   phosphoinositide hydrolysis in a concentration-dependent manner.
   UTP-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis occurred in lipid rafts, because
   methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, a disrupting regent of lipid rafts, inhibited
   the hydrolysis. Mastoparan changed the localization of G alpha(q/11) and
   G beta together with cholesterol from lipid rafts to nonraft fractions
   or cytosol. These changes were inhibited by ganglioside mixtures,
   suggesting that mastoparan interacts with gangliosides in lipid rafts.
   In fact, ganglioside mixtures and neuraminidase, but not sialic acid,
   attenuated the inhibitory effect of mastoparan on phosphoinositide
   hydrolysis. Furthermore, fluorescence intensity of tyrosine residue of
   {[}Tyr(3)] mastoparan was potentiated by ganglioside mixtures,
   suggesting the direct binding of mastoparan to gangliosides. Mastoparan
   caused cytotoxicity of PC-12 cells in a concentration-dependent manner,
   determined by LDH release. The mastoparan-induced cytotoxicity was
   significantly inhibited by neuraminidase or gangliosides. The order of
   inhibitory potency of gangliosides was GT1b approximate to GD1b > GD1a >
   GM1 >> GQ1b, but asialo-GM1 and sialic acid were inactive. These results
   suggest that mastoparan initially binds to gangliosides in lipid rafts
   and then it inhibits phosphoinositide hydrolysis by changing the
   localization of G alpha(q/11) and G beta in lipid rafts.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) polymorphism has been
   associated with the development of lung, liver or oesophageal cancer by
   detoxification of carcinogen(s) or activation of procarcinogen(s).
   Aim: To clarify the association between CYP2C19 polymorphisms and
   gastric cancer development in Japanese.
   Methods: We determined CYP2C19 genotypes (CYP2C19{*}1, {*}2 and {*}3) in
   111 Helicobacter pylori-positive patients with gastric cancer and 315 H.
   pylori-positive controls without gastric cancer consisting of patients
   with gastritis only or peptic ulcer. Frequencies of CYP2C19 genotypes
   and serum pepsinogen I and II levels, a biomarker of gastric atrophy, in
   the gastric cancers and controls were compared.
   Results: Frequencies of homozygous extensive metabolizers, heterozygous
   extensive metabolizers and poor metabolizers were 31.5\%, 42.3\% and
   26.2\% in the gastric cancers and 38.1\%, 47.0\% and 14.9\% in the
   controls, respectively (P = 0.046). Poor metabolizers were associated
   with an increased risk for developing gastric cancer with the age- and
   sex-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.975 {[}95\% confidence interval (CI):
   1.068-3.649], especially for diffuse type (OR: 3.385, CI: 1.187-9.648).
   There is no significant association between CYP2C19 genotypes and serum
   pepsinogen I level or pepsinogen I/II ratios, although serum pepsinogen
   I level in gastric cancers were significantly decreased.
   Conclusions: In H. pylori-positive Japanese, poor metabolizers of
   CYP2C19 appear to be at an increased risk for developing gastric cancer,
   especially diffuse type, and may require an intensive follow-up for
   scrutinizing possible gastric cancer development.}},

Abstract = {{Life-long neurogenesis is a characteristic feature of the olfactory
   pathways of a phylogenetically diverse array of animals. In both
   vertebrates and invertebrates, the life-long addition of olfactory
   interneurons in the brain occurs in parallel with the continuous
   proliferation of olfactory receptor neurons in the olfactory organ. It
   has been proposed that these two processes are related functionally,
   with new olfactory interneurons being added to accommodate the new
   olfactory receptor neurons added in the periphery. While this has not
   been tested directly because the two processes are not readily
   separable, this question can be addressed in the olfactory pathway of
   the crab, Libinia emarginata. Unlike most decapod crustaceans, which
   moult and grow throughout life, L. emarginata has a terminal,
   maturational moult after which animals become anecdysic (stop moulting).
   Because the addition of new receptor neurons in crustaceans is
   associated with moulting, a comparison of neurogenesis in immature and
   mature L. emarginata provides an opportunity to examine the
   interdependence of central and peripheral neurogenesis in the olfactory
   pathway. This study demonstrates that the continuous addition of
   olfactory receptor neurons in L. emarginata ceases at the terminal moult
   but that proliferation and differentiation of olfactory interneurons in
   the brain continues in mature animals. Contrary to the general
   assumption, therefore, continuous neurogenesis in the central olfactory
   pathway of this species does not occur as part of a process involving
   the coregulation of central and peripheral neurogenesis. These findings
   suggest that peripheral neurogenesis is not a requirement for continuous
   neurogenesis in the central olfactory pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives The aim was to report an unusual trizygotic pregnancy that
   resulted in live-born twins. The placenta of one twin had placental
   mesenchymal dysplasia (PMD), which resulted from a chimeric fusion of an
   androgenetic zygote and a normal biparental zygote. The literature
   review was summarized.
   Methods The case was first detected by prenatal ultrasound, and was then
   followed by a histologic and detailed genetic investigation. The
   literature on PMD, complete hydatidiform moles (CHMs), and placental
   mosaicism and chimerism was also reviewed.
   Results One placenta of a twin pregnancy was noted to be diffusely
   cystic and enlarged. The macroscopic and microscopic findings were
   consistent with the diagnosis of PMD; however, genetic findings
   confirmed confined placental chimerism involving a normal biparental
   46,XY male conceptus and an androgenetic 46,XX complete hydatidiform

Abstract = {{The eosinophil major basic protein (EMBP), a constituent of the
   eosinophil secondary granule, is implicated in cytotoxicity and
   mediation of allergic disorders such as asthma. It is a member of the
   C-type lectin family, but lacks a Ca2+- and carbohydrate-binding site as
   seen in other members of this family. Here, we report the crystal
   structure of EMBP in complex with a heparin disaccharide and in the
   absence of Ca2+, the first such report of any C-lectin with this sugar.
   We also provide direct evidence of binding of EMBP to heparin and
   heparin disaccharide by surface plasmon resonance. We propose that the
   sugars recognized by EMBP are likely to be proteoglycans such as
   heparin, leading to new interpretations for EMBP function.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Since 2001, the Maine Bureau of Health has offered free
   evidence-based treatment for tobacco dependence, including telephonic
   counseling and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). This study examined
   the utilization of treatment services, evaluated quit outcomes, and
   estimated the population impact of treatment.
   Methods: This is a descriptive study of tobacco users receiving
   treatment services from the Maine Tobacco HelpLine from January 2003 to
   December 2004. Demographics of callers were compared to adult smokers
   statewide, and NRT utilization was examined among callers eligible for
   therapy. Quit outcomes were assessed by telephone interview among a
   sample of callers registered November 15, 2003 to January 31, 2004 (n =
   535), 6 months after assistance. The population impact of treatment was
   estimated by applying intent-to-treat (30-day point prevalence) quit
   rates to services delivered in 2003 and 2004. Analyses were conducted in
   2005.
   Results: A total of 12,479 adult smokers (3\% of smokers annually)
   utilized Maine's tobacco services during 2003 and 2004. Compared to
   smokers statewide, callers were more likely to be aged 45 to 64, female,
   or uninsured. A total of 82.3\% of callers who were eligible for NRT and
   received counseling obtained free NRT. Intent-to-treat quit rates at 6
   months were 12.3\% (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 8.1-17.6) for
   counseling, and 22.5\% (95\% CI = 19.1-26.3) for counseling plus NRT. An
   estimated 1864 smokers calling in 2003-2004 had successfully quit.
   Conclusions: The Maine Tobacco HelpLine and NRT programs have
   demonstrated effectiveness and population outreach, particularly to
   uninsured smokers. This study suggests that for quit lines to maximize
   their impact, tobacco medication access may be important.}},

Abstract = {{We have identified a novel interaction between huntingtin (htt) and
   N-type calcium channels, a channel key in coupling calcium influx with
   synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Htt is a widely expressed 350-kDa cytosolic
   protein bearing an N-terminal polyglutamine tract. Htt is
   proteolytically cleaved by calpains and caspases and the resultant htt
   N-terminal fragments have been proposed to be biologically active;
   however, the cellular function of htt and/or the htt fragments remains
   enigmatic. We show that N-terminal fragments of htt (consisting of
   exon1) and full-length htt associate with the synaptic protein
   interaction (synprint) region of the N-type calcium channel. Given that
   synprint has previously been shown to bind syntaxin 1A and that this
   association elicits inhibition of N-type calcium channels, we tested
   whether htt(exon1) affects the modulation of these channels. Our data
   indicate that htt(exon1) enhances calcium influx by blocking syntaxin I
   A inhibition of N-type calcium channels and attributes a key role for
   htt N-terminal fragments in the fine tuning of neurotransmission. (c)

   series was to evaluate design details of the SIRCA TIRS cover interface

   Four test articles were tested in an arc jet environment with three
   different seal configurations. The test condition was designed to match
   the predicted peak flight heat load at the gap region between the SIRCA
   and the backshell and resulted in an overtest for the apex region of the
   SIRCA TIRS cover. Repeatable thermocouple data were obtained and
   compared with SIRCA thermal response analyses. The one-dimensional
   thermal response prediction compared well with the thermocouple data for
   the location at the backshell interface. For the apex region of the
   SIRCA TIRS cover, a one-dimensional thermal response analysis resulted
   in an overprediction because there were strong multidimensional
   conduction effects due to the TIRS cover geometry. In general, the test
   results provide strong experimental evidence that supports the adequacy

Abstract = {{The studies were conducted on male and female Balb/c mice, weighing 20 g
   (8-10-weeks-of-age). Phosphodiesterase inhibitors were administered
   once: aminophylline at a dose of 20 mg/kg i.m., milrinone - 1 mg/kg,
   i.m., and sildenafil - 1 mg/kg, p.o.
   It has been discovered that aminophylline, milrinone and sildenafil
   increased the percentage of immature CD4(+)CD8(+) thymic cells
   (double-positive thymocytes) with corresponding decreases in the
   percentage of mature CD4(+) and CD8(+) thymocytes, as early as 12 h
   following the exposure to the drugs. The action of milrinone and
   sildenafil on the subsets of thymocyte was maintained for 72 hours. At
   the same time the weight ratio of the lymphatic organs increased. In
   contrast, 72 h after aminophylline injection a decrease in the
   percentage of CD4(+)CD8(+) thymic cells with corresponding increases in
   the percentage of mature CD8(+) thymocytes was observed, but no effect
   on CD4(+) was found. Moreover, aminophylline administration decreased
   the percentage of CD3(+), CD4(+) and CD8(+) splenocytes 72 h after the
   exposure. However, 24 h following the milrinone injection a temporary
   increase in the percentage of CD3(+) and CD8(+) splenocytes was
   observed. It has also been found that a single administration of all
   tested phosphodiesterase inhibitors augmented the percentage of B
   lymphocytes (CD19(+) cells) and decreased T lymphocytes (CD3(+), CD4(+)
   and CD8(+) cells) in mesenteric lymph nodes. The effect on the
   percentage of B and T lymphocytes of mesenteric lymph nodes was
   maintained for 3 days.
   The results of the studies carried out on mice suggest that
   aminophylline (non-selective PDE inhibitor), milrinone (PDE-3 inhibitor)
   and sildenafil (PDE-5 inhibitor) have an immunomodulating effect on the
   T and B lymphocytes of lymphatic organs.}},

Abstract = {{A bioassay arena was developed to test the response of the Japanese
   beetle, Popillia japonica Newman (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), to various
   plant-derived factors that may influence the selection of oviposition
   sites. In choice experiments with natural and artificial plant cues,
   females preferred to lay eggs in ryegrass rather than in artificial
   resources. Artificial grass stems received more eggs on average than
   bare ground, indicating the role of vertical objects on the soil surface
   as oviposition cues. Popillia japonica females were able to discriminate
   between the quality and quantity of the artificial stems, as more eggs
   were laid in soil blocks that had larger diameter stems or a higher
   number of stems per soil block. Beetles were capable of evaluating plant
   characteristics on the soil surface and adjusted their investment
   accordingly; more eggs were laid in resources that were chosen more
   frequently. Observations of females in choice arenas revealed how
   surface cues influence digging behavior and the time spent under the
   soil surface. The number of digging events was not significantly
   different among the three treatments with surface cues (ryegrass, grass
   roots, and artificial grass), but beetles spent significantly more time
   in the soil under ryegrass than any of the other treatments. These
   findings suggest that oviposition by P. japonica is selective and is
   influenced by plant-derived cues evaluated before and after digging into
   the soil.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE - Care for chronic diseases may compete with preventive health
   care. To test this hypothesis, we examined the association between
   diabetes-related processes of care and preventive care in women.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Using data from a prospective cohort study
   of diabetes care in managed care settings, we reviewed the care 540
   diabetic women received from 355 primary care providers within 14
   provider groups from one health plan. Of the 540 women, 278 were
   eligible to receive mammograms and 314 were eligible to receive Pap
   smears. Mammography performance was measured as at least one mammogram
   over a 2-year period and Pap performance was measured as at least one
   Pap smear over a 3-year period. To assess the association between
   diabetes-related processes of care and preventive services, we used
   hierarchical logistic regression models, accounted for clustering within
   provider groups, and adjusted for patient age, race, income and
   education level, diabetes treatment and duration, and health status, as
   well as physician age, sex, years of practice, and specialty.
   Diabetes-related processes of care were defined as dilated retinal
   examinations, urine microalbumin/protein testing, foot examinations,
   lipid and HbA(1c), testing, recommendations to take aspirin, and
   influenza vaccinations received over a 1-year period.
   RESULTS - in this cohort, 73\% of eligible women received mammograms and
   56\% received Pap smears. After adjustment of models, better
   diabetes-related processes of care, better health status, and
   non-Medicaid insurance were associated with mammography performance.
   Better diabetes-related processes of care, younger patient age, and any
   visit to a gynecologist were associated with Pap performance.
   CONCLUSIONS - Better processes of diabetes care were associated with
   better women's preventive health care. Diabetes management did not
   compete with sex-specific screening.}},

   (V-TC) generally decreased with N, although differences observed at N =
   2, 4, and 8 were mostly insignificant. For grain yield, V-TC was
   significantly higher at N = 4 than at N = 2. The V-TC for grain yield at
   N = 4 was slightly higher than the estimate of V-TC in the base
   population, strongly indicating a genetic variance in excess of what is
   predicted by an additive genetic model for a small population.
   Differences in testcross means were likewise inconsistent with an
   additive genetic model. The results imply that nonadditive gene effects
   in elite maize inbreds help maintain genetic variance in small
   populations and that using multiple parents may help sustain genetic
   variability in advanced cycle breeding.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of intracoronary thrombus during percutaneous coronary
   intervention (PCI) is a well-known complication. It has been estimated
   that it complicates approximately 6\% of all coronary procedures.
   Patients at highest risk for this complication include those with acute
   ischemic syndromes or with angiographically apparent thrombus. Since the
   development of PCI, intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) has
   remained the primary antithrombotic therapy for the prevention of
   periprocedural ischemic complications. The availability of a rapid
   ``point of care{''} test for dose individualization (the activated
   clotting time {[}ACT]) has facilitated this process. Other forms of
   antithrombotic therapies such as direct thrombin inhibitors or
   low-molecular-weight heparin have been proposed as more effective
   anticoagulants during PCI. Bivalirudin is a direct thrombin inhibitor
   proven to decrease post-PCI ischemic complication rate compared with UFH
   and have a lower vascular complication rate compared with glycoprotein
   IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists. We herein report a case of acute
   macrothrombus formation during PCI despite adequate ACT achieved with
   bivalirudin.}},

Abstract = {{Boronic acids are a very appealing class of serine proteases inhibitors

   MacroModel/Amber force field, as well as GB/SA solvation parameters, to
   model boronic acids as tetrahedral adducts formed after protease's
   serine O gamma coordination. With the aim to check the implemented force
   field, flexible docking studies were performed on three crystallographic
   complexes of beta-lactamases with boronic acids that output the
   crystallographic conformation of the complexes as the global minimum
   energy structure. Although the used approach was basic, nevertheless the
   resultant force field seems to be efficient and suitable for the
   structure-based design of new boronic inhibitors of beta-lactamases. (c)

Abstract = {{In this paper I mine the rich resources of a large corpus of
   conversational data from young Canadians between 10 and 19 collected in
   2002-2003 by participant observers from the same community. The spoken
   discourse of these speakers is replete with forms such as like, just,
   so, etc. as in I'm just like so happy'. What is the nature of these
   linguistic features? Where did they come from? How are they spreading
   and by whom? This pilot investigation reveals a concentration of these
   forms amongst the 15- to 16-year olds generally, and female speakers in
   particular. This result corroborates many other findings suggesting the
   tremendous influence of the peer group in the middle teenage years, the
   correlation of adolescence with dramatic linguistic differentiation and
   that females lead linguistic change. Further, despite the received
   wisdom, at least in the media, these features are not haphazard, random
   or indiscriminate. Instead, their patterns of use are quite
   circumscribed and linguistically defined. Indeed, their contrasting
   linguistic profiles viewed across different age cohorts (tweens, teens,
   and young adults) suggest that they are undergoing different types of
   change. More generally, the findings highlight the extent of linguistic
   innovation among young people in contemporary urban speech communities.

Abstract = {{Mutations in SMAD tumor suppressor genes are involved in approximately
   140,000 new cancers in the USA each year. At this time, how the absence
   of a functional SMAD protein leads to a tumor is unknown. However,
   clinical and biochemical studies suggest that all SMAD mutations are
   loss-of-function mutations. One prediction of this hypothesis is that
   all SMAD mutations cause tumors via a single mechanism. To test this
   hypothesis, we expressed five tumor-derived alleles of human SMAD genes
   and five mutant alleles of Drosophila SMAD genes in flies. We found that
   all of the DNA-binding domain mutations conferred gain-of-function
   activity, thereby falsifying the hypothesis. Furthermore, two types of
   gain-of-function mutation were identified - dominant negative and
   neomorphic. In numerous assays, the neomorphic allele SMAD4(100T)
   appears to be capable of activating the expression of WG target genes.
   These results imply that SMAD4(100T) may induce tumor formation by a
   fundamentally different mechanism from other SMAD mutations, perhaps via
   the ectopic expression of WNT target genes - an oncogenic mechanism
   associated with mutations in Adenomatous Polyposis Coli. Our results are
   likely to have clinical implications, because gain-of-function mutations
   may cause tumors when heterozygous, and the life expectancy of
   individuals with SMAD4(100T) is likely to be different from those with
   other SMAD mutations. From a larger perspective, our study shows that
   the genetic characterization of missense mutations, particularly in
   modular proteins, requires experimental verification.}},

Abstract = {{Gnathostomes express a common proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene in the
   pars distalis (PD) and the pars intermedia (PI) of the pituitary gland.
   In contrast, the sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus expresses one distinct
   gene in each lobe; proopiocortin (POC) encoding adrenocorticotropic
   hormone (ACTH) and beta-endorphin (END) is expressed in the PD and
   proopiomelanotropin (POM) encoding melanophore-stimulating hormone
   (MSH), and a different beta-END is expressed in the PI. We characterized
   the genomic structure of the sea lamprey POC and POM genes including
   their 5'-flanking regions. Both genes have two introns at positions
   similar to those of gnathostomes. Each exon encodes genetic information
   seen in the gnathostome POMC gene: exon 1 encodes an untranslated
   nucleotide sequence, exon 2 encodes a signal peptide and the N-terminal
   short part of POC or POM, and exon 3 encodes all other parts including
   ACTH, MSHs or beta-END. Intron-A of POM (2289 bp) is six times longer
   than that of POC (379 bp). The POM intron-A has three transposon-like
   sequences (TnL-1, -2, -3), the total length of which is 1781 bp,
   suggesting that it has expanded via the insertion of TnLs. The
   5'-flanking region of the POC gene contains two TATA boxes, a CCAAT box,
   eight E boxes, STAT, RAIE, and one binding site each for Ptx 1, Pit-1,
   and Tpit. The POM gene contains four TATA boxes, eight E boxes, three
   STATs, two RAIEs, two CRE-like elements, and one binding site for Pit I.
   However, there is virtually DO similarity between the two genes in the
   distribution of the elements. The transcriptional regulation of POC and
   POM may have diverged with the functional differentiation of the two
   genes. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The carbon and energy metabolisms of a variety of cultured
   chemolithoautotrophic Epsilonproteobacteria from deep-sea hydrothermal
   environments were characterized by both enzymatic and genetic analyses.
   All the Epsilonproteobacteria tested had all three key reductive
   tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle enzymatic activities-ATP-dependent
   citrate lyase, pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, and
   2-oxoglutarate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase-while they had no ribulose
   1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (RubisCO) activity, the key enzyme in the
   Calvin-Benson cycle. These results paralleled the successful
   amplification of the key rTCA cycle genes aclB, porAB, and oorAB and the
   lack of success at amplifying the form I and 11 RubisCO genes, cbbL and
   cbbM. The combination of enzymatic and genetic analyses demonstrates
   that the Epsilonproteobacteria tested use the rTCA cycle for carbon
   assimilation. The energy metabolisms of deep-sea Epsilonproteobacteria
   were also well specified by the enzymatic and genetic characterization:
   hydrogen-oxidizing strains had evident soluble acceptor:methyl viologen
   hydrogenase activity and hydrogen uptake hydrogenase genes (hyn operon),
   while sulfur-oxidizing strains lacked both the enzyme activity and the
   genes. Although the energy metabolism of reduced sulfur compounds was
   not genetically analyzed and was not fully clarified, sulfur-oxidizing
   Epsilonproteobacteria showed enzyme activity of a potential
   sulfite:acceptor oxidoreductase for a direct oxidation pathway to
   sulfate but no activity of AMP-dependent adenosine 5'-phosphate sulfate
   reductase for a indirect oxidation pathway. No activity of
   thiosulfate-oxidizing enzymes was detected. The enzymatic and genetic
   characteristics described here were consistent with cellular carbon and
   energy metabolisms and suggest that molecular tools may have great
   potential for in situ elucidation of the ecophysiological roles of
   deep-sea Epsilonproteobacteria.}},

Title = {{Formation of DNA adducts with cholyl adenylate, a putative intermediate

Abstract = {{Cholyl adenylate is a putative intermediate for biosynthesis of cholic
   acid-coenzyme A (CoA) thioester conjugates by acyl-CoA synthetase. Early
   studies showed the conjugated acid anhydride moiety of cholyl adenylate
   to be reactive, attacking proteins to form protein-cholic acid adducts.
   In the present study, to clarify reactions of cholyl adenylate with DNA
   under physiological conditions, products with nucleosides were analyzed.
   HPLC-MS analyses indicated cholyl adenylate to primarily attack hydroxy
   groups of ribose moieties of nucleosides. Moreover, as speculated from
   UV and MS studies, exocyclic amino groups of 2'-deoxycytidine and
   2'-deoxyadenosine were found to serve as targets of cholyl adenylate;
   the corresponding cholic amides, N-4-cholyl-2'-deoxycytidine and
   N-6-cholyl-2'-deoxyadenosine, were formed at yields of 0.32 and 0.06\%,
   respectively. Structures of these base modified adducts were confirmed
   by direct comparison with synthetic compounds obtained from coupling
   reactions of cholic acid with each nucleoside in the presence of
   dicyclohexylearbodiimide in pyridine at 70 degrees C.
   N-4-Cholyl-2'-deoxycytidine was also obtained at a level of 1.6 adducts
   per 10(5) nucleosides from enzymatic hydrolysates of calf thymus DNA
   reacted with cholyl adenylate. These results suggest that cholyl
   adenylate, released from CoA synthetase, may have some possibility as a
   DNA modifier in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) are implicated in
   immunopathogenic mechanisms of autoimmune disease. We show here that
   SOCS expression in retina is temporarily correlated with progression of
   experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), an organ-specific autoimmune
   disease that serves as model of human uveitis. Peak of EAU correlates
   with highest SOCS genes expression while disease resolution coincides
   with their down-regulation. Surprisingly, SOCS5 is constitutively
   expressed in retina, SOCS5 expression increases significantly during EAU
   and remains elevated even after disease resolution. Our data suggest
   that cytokine-inducible SOCS members may be involved in negative
   regulation of inflammatory cytokines activities during EAU, while
   constitutively expressed SOCS5 may have neuroprotective functions.

Abstract = {{The oxytocin receptor (OXTR) and its ligand, oxytocin (OXT), regulate
   reproductive physiology (i.e., parturition and lactation) and
   sociosexual behaviors. To define the essential functions of OXTR, we
   generated mice with a null mutation in the Oxtr gene (Oxtr(-/-)) and
   compared them with OXT-deficient (Oxt(-/-)) mice. Oxtr(-/-) mice were
   viable and had no obvious deficits in fertility or reproductive
   behavior. Oxtr(-/-) dams exhibited normal parturition but demonstrated
   defects in lactation and maternal nurturing. Infant Oxtr(-/-) males
   emitted fewer ultrasonic vocalizations than wild-type littermates in
   response to social isolation. Adult Oxtr(-/-) males also showed deficits
   in social discrimination and elevated aggressive behavior. Ligand
   Oxt(-/-) males from Oxt(-/-) dams, but not from Oxt(+/-) dams, showed
   similar high levels of aggression. These data suggest a developmental
   role for the OXT/OXTR system in shaping adult aggressive behavior. Our
   studies demonstrate that OXTR plays a critical role in regulating
   several aspects of social behavior and may have important implications
   for developmental psychiatric disorders characterized by deficits in
   social behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Data from 1668 men (316 cardiovascular disease events) from the
   Framingham Offspring Study was reanalysed, specifically examining
   APOE:smoking interactions. Overall hazard ratio (HR) for smoking was
   1.95 (1.52, 2.50) compared to non-smokers. Using epsilon 3/3 as a
   referent group, in non-smokers HRs for epsilon 2 carriers (epsilon 2+;
   1.04 (0.61, 1.76) and epsilon 4 carriers (epsilon 4+; 1.04 (0.70, 1.54)
   showed no major risk increase. In smokers, HRs were 1.96 (1.26, 2.78) in
   epsilon 3 epsilon 3 men, 3.46 (2.14, 5.60; p = 0.09 for interaction) in
   epsilon 2+ and 3.81 (2.49, 5.84; p = 0.01 for interaction), with a
   significant interaction between daily cigarette consumption and APOE
   genotype on risk (p = 0.03). The potential mechanism for this APOE
   epsilon 4:smoking interaction was examined in a second study of 728
   Caucasian patients with diabetes, where markers of reactive oxygen
   species were available. APOE genotype was not associated with plasma
   OX-LDL or total antioxidant status (TAOS) in non-smokers. However, in
   smokers epsilon 4+ had 26.7\% higher plasma OX-LDL than other genotypes
   (APOE:smoking interaction p = 0.04), while epsilon 2+ had 28.4\% higher
   plasma TAOS than epsilon 3 epsilon 3 and epsilon 4+ combined
   (APOE:smoking interaction p = 0.026). Although direct extrapolation
   needs to be considered with caution, these results identify that the
   cardiovascular disease risk-raising effect of epsilon 4+ is confined to
   smokers, and a feasible mechanism is presented by the reduced
   antioxidant capacity/increased OX-LDL of apoE4.}},

Abstract = {{A new process to form fibroin spongy porous 3-D structure is reported
   herein. The process involves freezing and thawing fibroin aqueous
   solution in the presence of a small amount of an organic solvent. The
   process requires no freeze-drying, chemical cross-linking, or the aid of
   other polymeric materials. The solvent concentration, fibroin
   concentration, freezing temperature, and freezing duration affect the
   sponge formation, its porous structure, and its mechanical properties.
   Measurements by XRD and FTIR indicate that silk I and silk II
   crystalline structures exist in the fibroin sponge and that the
   secondary structure of fibroin is transformed to a beta-sheet from a
   random coil during this process. The tensile strength decreased
   slightly, but the fibroin sponge showed no deformation after
   autoclaving. Therefore, the fibroin sponge was sterilized using an
   autoclave. For 3 weeks, MC3T3 cells proliferated in the sterilized
   fibroin sponge. The fibroin sponge formed by this new process is
   applicable as a tissue-engineering scaffold because it is formed from
   biocompatible pure silk fibroin and offers both porous structure and
   mechanical properties that are suitable for cell growth and handling.}},

Abstract = {{Norovirus is the most important cause of nonbacterial acute
   gastroenteritis. We have shown previously that the isolated P domain
   containing the hinge forms a dimer and binds to histo-blood group
   antigen (HBGA) receptors with a low affinity (M. Tan, R. S. Hegde, and
   X. Jiang, J. Virol. 78:6233-6242, 2004). Here, we reported that the P
   domain of VA387 without the hinge forms a small particle with a
   significantly increased receptor binding affinity. An end-linked
   oligopeptide containing one or more cysteines promoted P-particle
   formation by forming intermolecular disulfide bridges. The binding
   sensitivity of the P particle to HBGAs was enhanced > 700-fold compared
   to the P dimer, which was comparable to that of virus-like particles.
   The binding specificity of the P particle was further confirmed by
   strong binding to the Caco-2 cells, a human colon carcinoma cell line.
   This binding enhancement was observed in the P particles of both
   norovirus GI and GII strains. The P particle is estimated to contain 12
   P dimers, in which the P2 subdomain builds up the outer layer, while the
   P1 subdomain forms the internal core. Taken together, our data indicate
   that the P domain is involved not only in dimerization but also in
   polymerization of the protein during the capsid assembling. The enhanced
   receptor binding of the P particle reflects the intrinsic feature of the
   viral capsid. The easy production of the P particle and its strong
   binding to HBGAs suggest that the P particle is useful in studying
   pathogenesis and morphogenesis of norovirus and candidates for antiviral
   or vaccine development.}},

Abstract = {{Pacific Islands populations can be broadly divided into Austronesians
   (AN) and Non-Austronesians (NAN); obesity and type 2 diabetes are
   prevalent in the former, although leptin levels in both groups have
   seldom been investigated. Thirty-seven (20 male and 17 female) adult
   pairs, matched by age and percent body fat, from AN-speaking Balopa and
   NAN-speaking Huli, all of whom migrated to settle in Port Moresby, the
   capital of Papua New Guinea, were selected for comparison of their serum
   leptin concentrations. The Balopa did not differ significantly from the
   Huli in age (30.5 +/- 9.7 and 30.0 +/- 8.7 years for males, 33.7 +/- 8.9
   and 34.1 +/- 7.5 years for females, respectively) or percent body fat
   (19.4 +/- 5.6 and 18.8 +/- 4.6 for males, 34.1 +/- 6.2 and 33.3 +/- 5.0
   for females), although the BMI of females was lower in the Balopa (26.4
   +/- 4.9) than in the Huli (29.7 +/- 4.7) (P = 0.02). In both ethnic
   groups, females had markedly higher leptin concentrations than males,
   but there was no significant inter-group difference in males (3.5 +/-
   2.6 and 3.1 +/- 4.7 ng/ml, P = 0.14) or females (22.7 +/- 12.9 and 19.7
   +/- 11.9 ng/ml, P = 0.40), after controlling for lifestyle factors and
   serum lipids. Multiple regression analysis revealed that significant
   predictors of leptin concentration were \% body fat (beta = 0.58), sex
   (male, 0; female, 1; beta = 0.27), and smoker status (non-smoker, 2 0;
   smoker, 1; beta = -0.15) (R-2 = 0.80), implying that the leptin
   concentration was primarily determined by lifestyle-derived body
   fatness. In conclusion, the NAN populations do not endogenously differ
   in leptin status from the AN populations, who have been recognized as a
   typical group with a ``thrifty{''} genotype.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Fc gamma receptors (Fc gamma Rs) may play an important role
   in positive and negative regulation of immune cell responses and immune
   complex (IC) clearance. Mesangial IgG deposition and circulating
   IgG/IgA-IC in sera are observed in patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN).
   Therefore, the pathological roles of IgG-IC in IgAN have been discussed.
   On the other hand, several studies have identified Fc gamma R
   polymorphisms (Fc gamma RIIa, Fc gamma RIIIa and Fc gamma RIIIb) that
   determine susceptibility to autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus
   erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. The objective of the present
   study was to clarify whether Fc gamma R polymorphisms influence
   susceptibility to IgAN, clinical features or severity in patients with
   IgAN.
   Methods. Japanese patients with IgAN (n = 124) and healthy controls (n =
   100) were genotyped for Fc gamma R polymorphisms (Fc gamma RIIa-131H or
   R, Fc gamma RIIIa-176F or V and Fc gamma RIIIb-NA1 or -NA2). The
   genotyping of these polymorphisms was performed using allele-specific
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. Associations among Fc gamma R
   polymorphisms and susceptibility, age of onset, levels of serum
   immunoglobulins, intensity of glomerular IgG deposition and pathological
   severity were analysed.
   Results. These three Fc gamma R polymorphisms showed no significant
   differences in genotype and allele frequencies between the IgAN patients
   and healthy controls. Each Fc gamma R polymorphism had no influence on
   age of onset, serum levels of IgG and glomerular IgG deposition in IgAN.
   However, Fc gamma RIIa-131R (R/R or H/R) or Fc gamma RIIIa-176V
   homozygous carriers (V/V) showed significantly more severe injury than
   Fc gamma RIIa-131H homozygous (H/H) (P < 0.03) or Fc gamma RIIIa-176F
   carriers (F/F or F/V) (P < 0.03), respectively.
   Conclusion. The present study shows that polymorphisms of Fc gamma RIIa
   and Fc gamma RIIIa influence the severity of IgAN in Japanese patients
   but not the incidence, suggesting that IgG-IC may play important roles
   in the progression and prognosis of this disease via Fc gamma Rs.}},

Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{5283-5293}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The Wnt signaling pathway is important in the formation of neural crest
   cells in many vertebrates, but the downstream targets of neural crest
   induction by Wnt are largely unknown. Here, we examined quantitative
   changes in gene expression regulated by Wnt-mediated neural crest
   induction using quantitative PCR (QPCR). Induction was recapitulated in
   vitro by adding soluble Wnt to intermediate neural plate tissue cultured
   in collagen, and induced versus control tissue were assayed using
   gene-specific primers at times corresponding to premigratory (18 and 24
   h) or early (36 h) stages of crest migration. The results show that Wnt
   signaling up-regulates in a distinct temporal pattern the expression of
   several genes normally expressed in the dorsal neural tube (slug, Pax3,
   Msx1, FoxD3, cadherin 6B) at ``premigratory{''} stages. While slug is
   maintained in early migrating crest cells, Pax3, FoxD3, Msx1 and
   cadherin 6B all are down-regulated by the start of migration. These
   results differ from the temporal profile of these genes in response to
   the addition of recombinant BMP4, where gene expression seems to be
   maintained. Interestingly, expression of rhoB is unchanged or even
   decreased in response to Wnt-mediated induction at all times examined,
   though it is up-regulated by BMP signals. The temporal QPCR profiles in
   our culture paradigm approximate in vivo expression patterns of these
   genes before neural crest migration, and are consistent with Wnt being
   an initial neural crest inducer with additional signals like BMP and
   other factors maintaining expression of these genes in vivo. Our results
   are the first to quantitatively describe changes in gene expression in
   response to a Wnt or BMP signal during transformation of a neural tube
   cell into a migratory neural crest cell.}},

Abstract = {{Bateman's principles, their corollaries and predictions constitute a
   paradigm for the study of sexual selection theory, evolution of mating
   systems, parental investment theory, and sexual dimorphism in male and
   female behavior. Some aspects of this paradigm have been challenged in
   recent years, while others have been supported by empirical and
   theoretical research. We re-examine Bateman's 1948 paper in detail,
   including some methodological problems. Additionally, we review three
   areas in which an over-reliance on Bateman's predictions about sexual
   dynamics hindered our ability to understand the potential importance of
   certain behaviors: 1) male mate choice and sperm allocation; 2) the role
   of females in initiating and soliciting extra-pair copulations and
   fertilizations; and 3) the role of females in lekking systems, in which
   recent evidence suggests that copulations with multiple males
   (polyandrous behavior) may be common. We conclude this introduction to
   the symposium by emphasizing the heuristic value of Bateman's
   contributions, as well as the problems that arise when Bateman's
   paradigm is viewed through the lens of modern behavioral ecology and
   evolutionary theory.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a complete framework of posterior probability
   support vector machines (PPSVMs) for weighted training samples using
   modified concepts of risks, linear separability, margin, and optimal
   hyperplane. Within this framework, a new optimization problem for
   unbalanced classification problems is formulated and a new concept of
   support vectors established. Furthermore, a soft PPSVM with an
   interpretable parameter nu is obtained which is similar to the nu-SVM
   developed by Scholkopf et al., and an empirical method for determining
   the posterior probability is proposed as a new approach to determine nu.
   The main advantage of an PPSVM classifier lies in that fact that it is
   closer to the Bayes optimal without knowing the distributions. To
   validate the proposed method, two synthetic classification examples are
   used to illustrate the logical correctness of PPSVMs and their
   relationship to regular SVMs and Bayesian methods. Several other
   classification experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the
   performance of PPSVMs is better than regular SVMs in some cases.
   Compared with fuzzy support vector machines (FSVMs), the proposed PPSVM
   is a natural and an analytical extension of regular SVMs based on the
   statistical learning theory.}},

   Apparent digestibility of protein and calcium in 100 and 150 mg/kg
   fluorine-treated groups was significantly lower than that of the control
   (p < 0.05). On the other hand, iron, copper, zinc, and manganese levels
   in most tissues of the 100 and 150 mg/kg fluorine groups were markedly
   changed compared to the control (p < 0.05). However, growth performance,
   nutrient digestibility, and mineral concentrations in all tissues of
   pigs were not significantly affected by the addition of 50 mg/kg
   fluorine (p > 0.05). Thus, this study suggested that excess fluoride
   levels could decrease growth performance and change the retention of
   iron, copper, zinc, and manganese in pigs.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have found that class II-restricted T cells from
   CD4-deficient mice reconstituted with a tail-less CD4 transgene have a
   specific defect in the development of Th2 effector cells; however, the
   reason for this defect was not clear. Following stimulation with a high
   potency peptide and exogenous IL-4, CD4-dependent signaling is required
   for optimal generation of a Th2 effector population. However, initial
   IL-4 and GATA-3 transcription is appropriately induced, suggesting that
   the initial stages of Th2 development are intact and independent of CD4
   after priming with a strong agonist peptide. In addition to the defect
   in Th2 development, CD4 mutant T cells are also relatively resistant to
   activation-induced cell death (AICD). Furthermore, inhibition of AICD in
   wild-type T cells causes a defect in Th2 development similar to that
   seen in the CD4 mutant T cells. These data support the hypothesis that
   CD4-dependent signaling pathways regulate a distinct checkpoint in the
   expansion and commitment phase of Th2 development, which is related to
   dysregulation of AICD.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Breast-conserving therapy for centrally located tumours
   has in the past been viewed with reservation, but is now an accepted
   treatment. There is little published evidence, however, to show that it
   is safe and cosmetically acceptable.
   Methods: In a prospective investigation carried out between 1996 and
   2002, 44 women had surgery for 45 breast carcinomas with suspected
   nipple involvement. The breast was conserved and the nipple-areola
   complex removed. Secondary mastectomy was performed in three women
   because the tumour was found to reach the resection margin. Forty-one
   women underwent further observation. The mean tumour size at the time of
   operation was 18 (range 4-50) mm. Six women received preoperative
   chemotherapy.
   Results: Histologically, there were seven preinvasive and 35 invasive
   cancers. No local failure had occurred at a median follow-up of 51
   months. Six women developed distant metastasis, of whom five died. The
   mean score for cosmetic results (evaluated on a scale of 1-5 where a
   score of 1 was excellent) was 1.5 for patients and 1.7 for physicians.
   Conclusion: Breast-conserving therapy is a safe and cosmetically
   acceptable alternative to mastectomy for subareolar breast cancer.}},

   neoplasias (NHT, including epithelial, mesenchymal, and mixed, n = 20),
   and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA, n = 8). SAA and CRP were analyzed
   using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
   kits, and Hp and Cp were measured using colorimetric methods, all
   previously validated for use in dogs. Increased concentrations of all
   APPs were observed in all groups of diseased dogs, but statistical
   significance only was observed with Hp (I, P < .001; HT, P < .05), Cp

   diseases was found with no significant differences between leukemia and
   lymphoma as well as among different types of neoplasia. The AIHA group
   had smaller increases in Hp, SAA, and CRP but higher concentrations of
   Cp. When follow-up of individual cases was possible, a decrease in APPs
   generally was found in cases with favorable outcome. The results of this
   study suggest that neoplasia and hematologic diseases such as AIHA
   should be considered as possible causes of mild increases in APPs in
   dogs. Measurement of APPs may be helpful to assess clinical evolution
   and monitor treatment of these processes.}},

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL CELL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{310}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{344-356}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Constitutive heterochromatin was once thought to be remarkably stable in
   composition and transcriptionally inert, but has recently been shown to
   be surprisingly dynamic. Here, we show that terminal muscle
   differentiation results in a global reorganisation and spatial
   clustering of constitutive heterochromatin. This is accompanied by
   enhanced histone H3K9 and H4K20 tri-methylation across major satellite
   regions and increased levels of major and minor satellite-encoded
   transcripts. Historic deacetylase (HDAC) activity is known to be
   important for initiating muscle differentiation. However, here, we show
   that low doses of HDAC inhibitors applied after the onset of muscle
   differentiation prevent the spatial reorganisation of constitutive
   heterochromatin while allowing terminal differentiation to proceed.
   Under these conditions, HDAC inhibition interferes with historic
   methylation and blocks centromere clustering, but does not prevent the
   temporal expression of muscle regulatory factors or the accumulation of
   centromere-derived transcripts. The demonstration that HDAC activity is
   required for spatial relocation of centromeres in differentiating muscle
   provides a convenient system in which the molecular drivers of
   differentiation-induced chromosome repositioning can be dissected. (c)

Abstract = {{Results of new high-precision measurements of the viscosity of water
   vapor at low densities are reported. The measurements were performed
   using an all-quartz oscillating-disk viscometer with small gaps. Ten
   isochoric series were carried out at temperatures between (298 and 438)
   K and at densities from (0.001 to 0.013) mol center dot L-1. The
   uncertainty is estimated to be +/- 0.2\% at ambient temperature
   increasing up to +/- 0.3 \% at higher temperatures. Isothermal values
   were analyzed with a density series for the viscosity in which only a
   linear contribution is considered. Values for the viscosity of the
   saturated vapor were also obtained at low temperatures. The new results
   and reliable data sets from literature are used to represent the
   viscosity of water vapor at moderately low densities. The second
   viscosity virial coefficient was modeled by means of the
   Rainwater-Friend theory. An individual correlation according to the
   extended theorem of corresponding states was necessary to describe the
   zero-density viscosity coefficient within its uncertainty and is
   particularly reliable at temperatures down to 280 K. The good agreement
   between the new values and older data from literature, not considered in
   the IAPWS formulation, requires the improvement of this correlation at
   low temperatures.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Pages = {{4559-4573}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A series of 11 standardised, reproducible, assays have been developed of
   physico-chemical functions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in
   freshwaters. The assays provide quantitative information on light
   absorption, fluorescence, photochemical fading, pH buffering, copper
   binding, benzo(a)pyrene binding, hydrophilicity and adsorption to
   alumina. To obtain DOM for the assays, a 45 L sample of filtered
   freshwater was rotary-evaporated to reduce the volume to ca. 500 cm(3).
   The concentrate was then passed through a strong cation exchanger, in
   the Na+ form, to remove alkaline-earth cations, and then through 0.7 and
   0.2 pm filters. Eight samples, two each from a lake and three
   streamwaters, were processed. The yields of dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) ranged from 70\% to 107\% (average 91\%). The samples of DOM,
   stored in the dark at 4 degrees C, retained their functional assay
   characteristics for up to 7 months. When assaying the concentrates,
   parallel assays were performed with Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA),
   as a quality control standard. For most of the assays, the results for
   eight freshwater DOM samples are similar to those obtained with SRFA,
   the chief exception being the greater hydrophilicity of the DOM samples.
   For eight of the assays, variability among the DOM samples is
   significantly (p < 0.01) greater than can be explained by analytical
   error, i.e. by comparison with results for the SRFA quality standard;
   the three exceptional assays are photochemical fading, copper binding
   and benzo(a)pyrene binding. The two lakewater samples studied gave the
   most extreme assay results, probably because of the influence of
   phytoplankton-derived DOM. Significant correlations of hydrophilicity
   and adsorption with optical absorbance may mean that some DOM functional
   properties can be predicted from comparatively simple measurements. (c)

Abstract = {{The autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays a rote in a wide range of
   somatic and mental diseases. Using a model of neurovisceral integration,
   this article describes how autonomic imbalance and decreased
   parasympathetic tone in particular may be the final common pathway
   linking negative affective states and conditions to ill health. The
   central nervous system (CNS) network that regulates autonomic balance
   (central autonomic network, CAN) is closely related and partially
   overlaps with networks serving executive, social, affective,
   attentional, and motivated behavior (anterior executive region, AER; and
   Damasio's {[}Damasio, A.R., 1998. Emotion in the perspective of an
   integrated nervous system. Brain Res. Rev. 26, 83-86.] `emotion
   circuit'). A common reciprocal inhibitory cortico-subcortical neural
   circuit serves to regulate defensive behavior, including autonomic,
   emotional and cognitive features. This inhibitory cortico-subcortical
   circuit may structurally, as well as functionally, link psychological
   processes with health-related physiology. When the prefrontal cortex is
   taken `offline' for whatever reason, parasympathetic inhibitory action
   is withdrawn and a relative sympathetic dominance associated with
   disinhibited defensive circuits is released, which can be pathogenic
   when sustained for long periods. This state is indicated by tow heart
   rate variability (HRV), which is a marker for low parasympathetic
   activation and prefrontal hypoactivity. Consistent with this, HRV is
   associated with a range of psychological and somatic pathological
   conditions, including immune dysfunction. Finally, we discuss supportive
   evidence from recent studies of the reflexive startle blink, attention
   and working memory, which shows that tow HRV predicts hypervigilance and
   inefficient allocation of attentional and cognitive resources. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Coping strategies in relation to unfair treatment or conflicts at work
   are discussed. `Covert coping' has been assessed by means of a short
   questionnaire. Its relationship with cardiovascular risk and sick Leave
   has been examined in an epidemiological study (WOLF) of working men and
   women in Stockholm. The findings indicate that in men `covert coping' is
   associated with elevated cardiovascular risk and prospective long-term
   sick leave. In women such a coping strategy is related to current sick
   leave, but not to cardiovascular risk or long-term sick leave. Openness
   of coping strategies is also discussed in relation to bouts of anger
   preceding myocardial infarction. Another epidemiological study (SHEEP,
   ONSET) has shown that severe bouts of anger are reported significantly
   more often than expected during the hour preceding myocardial
   infarction. This was not the case in subjects who reported,open coping
   patterns', however. Openness of coping strategies is partly determined
   by the working climate-the higher the decision latitude, the less
   `covert' the coping strategies. The results support the idea that
   dialogue in the work place may be health promoting. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The penetration of water into cross-linked high amylose starch tablets
   was studied at different temperatures by nuclear magnetic resonance
   (NMR) imaging, which follows the changes occurring at the surface and

   swelling was anisotropic, whereas water diffusion was almost isotropic.
   The water proton image profiles at the initial stage of water
   penetration were used to calculate the initial diffusion coefficient.
   The swelling and water concentration gradients in this controlled
   release system show significant temperature dependence. Diffusion
   behavior changed from Fickian to Case 11 diffusion with increasing
   temperature. The observed phenomena are attributed to the gelatinization
   of starch and the pseudo-cross-linking effect of double helix formation.}},

Abstract = {{The existing power and desalination capacity installed in the Middle
   East represent a huge asset which yearly requires considerable
   investment. In particular desalination plants reliability is essential
   as the entire economy depend on water produced by desalination plants
   and the interval allowed for shut down and rehabilitation works is
   limited to few weeks per year. Several desalination plants constructed
   in the 70s are still successfully in operation and their life can be
   further extended for other 10 years or more. The real problem is that
   the design methods adopted at the construction times of these plants
   became obsolete and do not comply with modern criteria of water and
   power production. Upgrading and up-rating of existing brown fields will
   therefore more and more play a key role in the framework of an
   intelligent rehabilitation work ensuring comparatively fast investment
   recovery times and immediate benefits in plant output and management. In
   June 2004 Deutsche Babcock was awarded a contract for the rehabilitation
   of Ras Abu Fontas units 3,4,5,6 in Qatar. The rehabilitation project is
   aiming at further extending the service life of the 5 MIGD MSF units,
   which were installed between 1975 and 1978 by Weir Westgarth. Ras Abu
   Fontas units 3,4,5,6 have like several existing MSF desalination plants
   installed in the same period present an available heat transfer surface
   which could be theoretically used to increase the distillate water
   capacity of the plant. Taking advantage of this feature, Deutsche
   Babcock proposed, along with the rehabilitation work, a 3\% augmentation
   of distillate production by partial redesign of evaporator auxiliary
   systems. This project followed the same philosophy adopted for the
   up-rating carried out along with the rehabilitation of SEWA Layyah unit
   4-5 {[}1] The present paper aims to describe the design approach to this
   achievement.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The current study compared the prevalence of disordered
   eating attitudes and behaviors among adolescent ballet dancers at
   national, regional, and local schools.
   Method: Female ballet students (N = 239; mean age = 15.0 +/- 1.5 years)
   from five geographically disparate summer programs completed the Eating
   Disorder Inventory (EDI) and answered questions regarding eating
   disorder symptoms.
   Results: Students from both national and local schools reported

   self-induced vomiting compared with regional and local students.
   Conclusion: Eating pathology among adolescent ballet dancers may be a
   function of both genetic and environmental risk. Dancers who exhibit
   high levels of perfectionism and, perhaps consequently, place themselves

   increased risk for disordered eating in comparison to dancers who are

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1114-1121}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Low birth weight ( LBW; < 2500 g) is the result of complex
   and poorly understood interactions between the biological determinants
   of the mother and the fetus, the parent's socioeconomic status, and
   medical care. After controlling for these established risk factors, the
   extent of regional variation in LBW rates remains unknown. This study
   measures regional variation in LBW rates and identifies regions of
   neonatal health services with significantly high or low adjusted rates.
   Methods. Linking the United States 1998 singleton birth cohort (N = 3.8
   million) with county and health care characteristics, we conducted a
   small area analysis of LBW across 246 regions of neonatal health
   services. We measured observed rates and then used a multivariable,
   hierarchical model to estimate adjusted LBW rates by regions. We then
   stratified these rates by race for the 208 regions with adequate sample
   size.
   Results. Observed LBW rates varied across regions from 3.8 to 10.6 per
   100 live births (interquartile range: 5.0 - 6.8 {[}25th - 75th
   percentile]; median: 5.9). After controlling for known maternal and area
   risk factors, 67 (27.0\%) regions had rates significantly below and 98
   (39.8\%) regions had rates significantly higher than the national rate
   of 6.0 per 100 live births. Although black mothers were more likely to
   give birth to an LBW newborn, regional adjusted rates still varied >
   3-fold within both black and nonblack subgroups.
   Conclusions. After controlling for known maternal and area risk factors,
   LBW rates markedly varied across US regions of neonatal health services
   for both black and nonblack mothers. Additional analyses of these
   regions may provide opportunities for regional accountability in
   pregnancy outcomes, LBW research, and targeted improvement
   interventions, especially in high-risk populations.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the importance of the forest overstorey relative
   to other factors in controlling the spatial variability in understorey
   species composition in near-natural temperate broadleaved forests. We
   addressed this question for the 19 ha ancient forest Suserup Skov (55
   degrees 22' N, 11 degrees 34' E) in Denmark, one of the few old-growth
   temperate broadleaved forest remnants in north-western Europe, by
   inventorying understorey species composition and environmental
   conditions in 163 100 m(2) plots. We use unconstrained and constrained
   ordinations, variation partitioning, and Indicator Species Analysis to
   provide a quantitative assessment of the importance of the forest
   overstorey in controlling understorey species composition. Comparison of
   the gradients extracted by unconstrained and constrained ordinations
   showed that the main gradients in understorey species composition in our
   old-growth temperate broadleaved forest remnant are not caused by
   variability in the forest overstorey, but are related to topography and
   soil, edge effects, and unknown broad-scale factors. Nevertheless,
   overstorey-related variables uniquely accounted for 15\% of the total
   explained variation in understorey species composition, with the pure
   overstorey-related (R-po), topography and soil (R-pt), edge and
   anthropogenic disturbance effects (R-pa), and spatial (R-ps) variation
   fractions being of equal magnitude. The forward variable selection
   showed that among the overstorey-related variables understorey light
   availability and to a lesser extent vertical forest structure were most
   important for understorey species composition. No unique influence of
   overstorey tree species identity could be documented. There were many
   indicator species for high understorey light levels and canopy gap
   centres, but none for medium or low light or closed canopy. Hence, no
   understorey species behaved as obligate shade plants. Our study shows
   that, the forest overstorey has a weak control of understorey species
   composition in near-natural broadleaved forest, in contrast to results
   from natural and managed forests comprising both conifer and broadleaved
   species. Nevertheless, > 20\% of the understorey species found were
   indicators of high light conditions or canopy openings. Hence,
   variability in canopy structure and understorey light availability is
   important for maintaining understorey species diversity.}},

Abstract = {{During posthatching development the fins of fishes undergo striking
   changes in both structure and function. In this article we examine the
   development of the pectoral fins from larval through adult life history
   stages in the zebrafish (Danio rerio), describing in detail their
   pectoral muscle morphology. We explore the development of muscle
   structure as a way to interpret the fins' role in locomotion. Genetic
   approaches in the zebrafish model are providing new tools for examining
   fin development and we take advantage of transgenic lines in which
   fluorescent protein is expressed in specific tissues to perform detailed
   three-dimensional, in vivo fin imaging. The fin musculature of larval
   zebrafish is organized into two thin sheets of fibers, an abductor and
   adductor, one on each side of an endoskeletal disk. Through the juvenile
   stage the number of muscle fibers increases and muscle sheets cleave
   into distinct muscle subdivisions as fibers orient to the developing fin
   skeleton. By the end of the juvenile period the pectoral girdle and fin
   muscles have reoriented to take on the adult organization. We find that
   this change in morphology is associated with a switch of fin function
   from activity during axial locomotion in larvae to use in swim
   initiation and maneuvering in adults. The examination of pectoral fins
   of the zebrafish highlights the yet to be explored diversity of fin
   structure and function in subadult developmental stages. (c) 2005

Title = {{Suppression of endothelial progenitor cells in human coronary artery
   disease by the endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric
   dimethylarginine}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES We tested the hypothesis that asymmetric dimethylarginine
   (ADMA) may be an endogenous inhibitor of endothelial progenitor cells
   (EPCs).
   BACKGROUND Endothelial progenitor cells play a pivotal role in
   regeneration of injured endothelium, thereby limiting the formation of
   atherosclerotic lesions. Reduced numbers of EPCs may affect progression
   of coronary artery disease. Regulation of EPC mobilization and function
   is mediated in part by nitric oxide (NO). Endogenous inhibitors of NO
   synthases, such as ADMA, contribute to endothelial dysfunction and
   injury.
   METHODS We used flow cytometry and in vitro assays to investigate the
   relationship between EPC number and function with ADMA plasma levels in
   patients with stable angina.
   RESULTS The plasma concentration of ADMA was related to the severity of
   coronary artery disease and correlated inversely with the number of
   circulating CD34(+)/CD133(+) progenitor cells (r = -0.69; p < 0.0001)
   and endothelial colony forming units (CFUs) (r = -0.75; p < 0.0001).
   Adjusting for all patient characteristics, we confirmed these findings
   in multivariate regression analyses. In vitro differentiation of EPCs
   was repressed by ADMA in a concentration-dependent manner. Compared with
   untreated cells, ADMA reduced EPC incorporation into endothelial
   tube-like structures to 27 11\% (p < 0.001). Asymmetric dimethylarginine
   repressed the formation of CFUs from cultured peripheral blood
   mononuclear cells to 35 7\% (p < 0.001). Asymmetric dimethylarginine
   decreased endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity in EPCs to 64 6\%
   (p < 0.05) when compared with controls. Co-incubation with the
   hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor rosuvastatin
   abolished the detrimental effects of ADMA.
   CONCLUSIONS Asymmetric dimethylarginine is an endogenous inhibitor of
   mobilization, differentiation, and function of EPCs. This contributes to
   the cardiovascular risk in patients with high ADMA levels and may
   explain low numbers and function of EPCs in patients with coronary
   artery disease.}},

Abstract = {{The shortage of energy, especially fossil energy including coal, oil and
   gas, always is a world focus issue in which the world economic growth is
   influenced and limited strongly in developed countries and developing
   countries. The scarcity of freshwater and especially potable water is
   jeopardizing many regions of the world. Seawater desalination is a kind
   of technology gaining freshwater from seawater which need to consume a
   large amount of energy, so nuclear desalination technology is more and
   more important while the world oil price is over US\$50 per boe and not
   down in recent years. Under the background of new world oil price, the
   economic competitiveness of seawater desalination projects between
   nuclear and fossil fuel was analyzed and presented, in which the power
   plant type include a pressurized light-water reactor (PWR), a
   pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR), a superheated steam boiler using
   pulverized coal (PC), a combined cycle gas turbine (CC) and an open
   cycle gas turbine (GT), in a middle and large scale of about 600 MWe and
   900 MWe, and coupled with the desalination technology: multi-stage flash
   (MSF). The calculation program is the desalination economic evaluation
   program (DEEP 2.1) developed by international atom energy agency (IAEA).
   The assumed sites of the seawater desalination plants studied are chosen
   to location in North Africa, Red Sea and South East Asia regions with
   similar seawater and economic conditions with respect to seawater
   desalination. The results based on the assumed site and economic
   conditions indicated: the averaged discounted water cost of nuclear
   options is economically visible compared to that of fossil fuel options.
   The four sensitive factors are used in the sensitive analysis: discount
   rate, fuel oil price, power plant investment and water plant size.}},

Title = {{Human multidrug resistance associated protein 4 confers resistance to

Abstract = {{Purpose. The multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP) 4 is a member
   of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter family.
   Camptothecins (CPTs) have shown substantial anticancer activity against
   a broad spectrum of tumors by inhibiting DNA topoisomerase I, but tumor
   resistance is one of the major reasons for therapeutic failure.
   P-glycoprotein, breast cancer resistance protein, MRP1, and MRP2 have
   been implicated in resistance to various CPTs including CPT-11
   (irinotecan), SN-38 (the active metabolite of CPT-11), and topotecan. In
   this study, we explored the resistance profiles and intracellular
   accumulation of a panel of CPTs including CPT, CPT-11, SN-38, rubitecan,
   and 10-hydroxy-CPT (10-OH-CPT) in HepG2 cells with stably overexpressed
   human MRP4. Other anticancer agents such as paclitaxel,
   cyclophosphamide, and carboplatin were also included.
   Methods. HepG2 cells were transfected with an empty vehicle plasmid
   (V/HepG2) or human MRP4 (MRP4/HepG2). The resistance profiles of test
   drugs in exponentially growing V/HepG2 and MRP4/HepG2 cells were
   examined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazonium
   bromide (MTT) assay with 4 or 48 h exposure time of the test drug in the
   absence or presence of various MRP4 inhibitors. The accumulation of
   CPT-11, SN-38, and paclitaxel by V/HepG2 and MRP4/HepG2 cells was
   determined by validated high-performance liquid chromatography methods.
   Results. Based on the resistance folds from the MTT assay with 48 h
   exposure time of the test drug, MRP4 conferred resistance to CPTs tested
   in the order 10-OH-CPT (14.21) > SN-38 carboxylate (9.70) > rubitecan
   (9.06) > SN-38 lactone (8.91) > CPT lactone (7.33) > CPT-11 lactone
   (5.64) > CPT carboxylate (4.30) > CPT-11 carboxylate (2.68). Overall,
   overexpression of MRP4 increased the IC50 values 1.78- to 14.21-fold for
   various CPTs in lactone or carboxylate form. The resistance of MRP4 to
   various CPTs tested was significantly reversed in the presence of
   dl-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO, a gamma-glutamylcysteine
   synthetase inhibitor), MK571, celecoxib, or diclofenac (all MRP4
   inhibitors). In addition, the accumulation of CPT-11 and SN-38 over 120
   min in MRP4/HepG2 cells was significantly reduced compared to V/HepG2
   cells, whereas the addition of celecoxib, MK571, or BSO significantly
   increased their accumulation in MRP4/HepG2 cells. There was no
   significant difference in the intracellular accumulation of paclitaxel
   in V/HepG2 and MRP4/HepG2 cells, indicating that P-glycoprotein was not
   involved in the observed resistance to CPTs in this study. MRP4 also
   conferred resistance to cyclophosphamide and this was partially reversed
   by BSO. However, MRP4 did not increase resistance to paclitaxel,
   carboplatin, etoposide (VP-16), 5-fluorouracil, and cyclosporine.
   Conclusions. Human MRP4 rendered significant resistance to
   cyclophosphamide, CPT, CPT-11, SN-38, rubitecan, and 10-OH-CPT. CPT-11
   and SN-38 are substrates for MRP4. Further studies are needed to explore
   the role of MRP4 in resistance, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of CPTs
   and cyclophosphamide.}},

   likelihood ratio tests (GLRTs) are employed to detect an ultrawideband
   (UWB) waveform propagating through dense multipath and to estimate the
   associated timing and channel parameters in closed form. Capitalizing on
   the pulse repetition pattern, the GLRT boils down to an amplitude
   estimation problem, based on which closed-form timing acquisition
   estimates can be obtained without invoking any line search. The proposed
   algorithms only employ digital samples collected at a low symbol rate,
   thus reducing considerably the implementation complexity and acquisition
   time. Analytical acquisition performance bounds and corroborating
   simulations are also provided.}},

   and those simulating intraoral conditions (35 degrees C and 92 +/- 5\%).
   Mean volumetric shrinkage values were calculated for each resin
   composite and the data were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance
   and t-test (alpha = 0.05) to determine if significant differences
   existed between the amount of volumetric polymerization shrinkage that
   occurred under ambient room conditions and that which occurred under
   simulated intraoral conditions. Mean volumetric shrinkage values
   measured for the resin composites were: 2.26 +/- 0.04\% (ambient) and
   2.61 +/- 0.04\% (intraoral) for Z100; 1.96 +/- 0.04\% (ambient) and 2.28
   +/- 0.04\% (intraoral) for Filtek A110 and 4.53 +/- 0.06\% (ambient) and
   5.34 +/- 0.05\% (intraoral) for 4 Seasons Flow. For each resin
   composite, statistical analysis indicated that the amount of volumetric
   shrinkage measured under simulated intraoral conditions was
   significantly greater than what was measured under ambient room
   conditions (P<0.0001).}},

Abstract = {{It was demonstrated that flicker-noise spectroscopy (FNS) generalizes
   the concepts underlying fluctuation-dissipation relationships (FDRs),
   which are normally used to relate the characteristics of fluctuation
   dynamics of thermodynamically equilibrium systems with the kinetic
   parameters describing Maxwellian relaxations. The essence of the FNS
   approach is to extract information from irregular components of signals
   (spikes, jumps, kinks in derivatives of various orders) at each
   space-time level of the hierarchical structure of the system, with the
   corresponding information-carrying parameters obtained from an analysis
   of the power spectrum S(f) (f is the frequency) and the difference
   moments Phi((p))(tau) (tau is the time delay parameter) of various
   orders p of the measurable dynamic variables. Both the
   information-carrying functions, S(f) and Phi((p))(tau), not one as in
   the traditional approach, were treated as FDRs. FDRs for systems in a
   state close to thermodynamic equilibrium (fluctuations of the electric
   potential in electron-conductive systems and Levi diffusion) and for
   strongly non-equilibrium stationary systems (fully developed turbulence
   and flicker noise) were considered as examples.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of cold water releases, as a by-product of storing
   irrigation water in large dams, has been a source of great concern for
   its impact on native freshwater fish for some time. The Mitta Mitta
   River, northeast Victoria, is impacted by altered thermal regimes
   downstream of the fourth largest dam in Australia, Dartmouth dam, with
   some daily temperatures 10-12 degrees C below normal. Murray cod
   (Maccullochella peelii peelii) were endemic to the Mitta Mitta River;
   however, resident Murray cod have not been found in this river since
   1992. The response of eggs and hatched larvae from Murray cod to
   different temperature gradients of water were measured and the
   post-spawning survival recorded. As a case study, post-spawning survival
   was then inferred from flow data for each year of operation of Dartmouth
   Dam, recorded since first operation in 1978, and included in a
   stochastic population model to explore the impact of the altered
   (historical) thermal regime on population viability. Experimental
   results revealed no egg and larval survival below 13 degrees C and
   predicted historical temperature regimes point to more than 15 years of
   low temperatures in the Mitta Mitta River. Population modelling
   indicates that the impact of cold water releases on post-spawning
   survival is a significant threatening process to the viability of a
   Murray cod population. Additionally, we consider changes to the thermal
   regime to explore how the thermal impact of large dams may be minimized
   on downstream fish populations through incrementally increasing the
   temperature of the releases. The modelled Murray cod population responds
   to minor increases in the thermal regime; however, threats are not
   completely removed until an increase of at least 5-6 degrees C.

Abstract = {{The paper proposes a framework for the analysis and representation of
   external systems for online optimisation studies. The basis for this
   framework is the equivalent OPF (EOPF), an optimisation model obtained
   by partitioning of the OPF model. The EOPF is mathematically redefined
   in the paper to accommodate the concept of a buffer zone. The resulting
   model is more useful for online optimisation, since external information
   obtained through intercontrol-centre exchange contracts can be used to
   improve internal control calculation. Numerical results obtained with
   original studies involving the boundary-matching procedure have provided
   a conceptual basis for the definition of a buffer zone for optimisation
   studies with the EOPF. In the proposed framework, the accuracy of the
   external representation in optimisation studies is evaluated by
   comparing the controls obtained by an EOPF procedure with those obtained
   by the reference-optimisation procedure defined in this paper. The
   framework is then used to evaluate the accuracy of equivalent
   optimisation studies involving the IEEE 118-bus test system and the
   Brazilian South Southeast 810-bus system. The results show that the
   incorporation of a buffer zone improves the external system
   representation for all optimisation studies performed.}},

Abstract = {{The Soil-Plant-Environment Research (SPER) facility at USDA Agricultural
   Research Service at Bushland, Texas, opened in 1990 with 48 weighable
   lysimeters containing monolithic soil cores of three major soil groups

   intensive plant water stress research and evaluate the impact of soil
   hydraulic characteristics on irrigation management strategies. The
   facility has now been upgraded with the addition of a fourth soil type
   collected using static weights, the installation of 48 deck (platform)
   scales for the continuous measurement of evapotranspiration (ET), and
   the use of a pressure-compensating drip system. The additional soil was
   selected to provide a wider range of nutrient and water supplying
   capacity compared with the other three soils. The conversion to weighing
   lysimeters allows the collection of diurnal ET data needed for plant
   physiological studies and validation of ET measurement equipment and
   models. The drip system reduces labor, increases precision of
   application amount, and reduces disturbance around the lysimeters. These
   improvements to the SPER facility will expand the type and quality of

Abstract = {{Introduction: In the World Health Organization (WHO) MONICA
   (multinational MONItoring of trends and determinants in CArdiovascular
   disease) Project considerable effort was made to obtain basic data on
   non-respondents to community based surveys of cardiovascular risk
   factors. The first purpose of this paper is to examine differences in
   socio-economic and health profiles among respondents and
   non-respondents. The second purpose is to investigate the effect of
   non-response on estimates of trends. Methods:Socio-economic and health
   profile between respondents and non-respondents in the WHO MONICA
   Project final survey were compared. The potential effect of non-response
   on the trend estimates between the initial survey and final survey
   approximately ten years later was investigated using both MONICA data
   and hypothetical data. Results: In most of the populations,
   non-respondents were more likely to be single, less well educated, and
   had poorer lifestyles and health profiles than respondents. As an
   example of the consequences, temporal trends in prevalence of daily
   smokers are shown to be overestimated in most populations if they were
   based only on data from respondents. Conclusions: The socio-economic and
   health profiles of respondents and non-respondents differed fairly
   consistently across 27 populations. Hence, the estimators of population
   trends based on respondent data are likely to be biased. Declining
   response rates therefore pose a threat to the accuracy of estimates of
   risk factor trends in many countries.}},

   gamma(E) and C-1 alpha(E) <= alpha(phi(E)) <= C alpha(E), where C
   depends only on the bilipschitz constant of phi. Further, we show that
   if mu is a Radon measure on C and the Cauchy transform is bounded on
   L-2(,U), then the Cauchy transform is also bounded on L-2(phi\#mu),
   where phi\#mu is the image measure of mu by phi. To obtain these

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The incidence of blunt traumatic vertebral
   artery dissection/thrombosis varies widely in published trauma series
   and is associated with spinal trauma. The purpose of this study was to
   determine the frequency of traumatic vertebral artery thrombosis (VAT)
   in cervically injured patients by using routine MR angiography (MRA) and
   MR imaging and identify associations with the severity of neurologic
   injury.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of 1283 patients with nonpenetrating
   cervical spine fractures with or without an associated spinal cord
   injury (SCI) was performed. Imaging consisted of routine cervical MR
   imaging and 2D time-of-flight MRA of the neck. The cervical injury
   level, neurologic level of injury, and American Spinal Injury
   Association (ASIA) grade were recorded.
   RESULTS: In this study, 632 patients met the inclusion criteria, 83
   (13\%) of whom had VAT on the admission MR imaging/MRA. Fifty-nine
   percent (49/83) of VAT patients had an associated SCI. VAT was
   significantly more common in motor-complete patients (ASIA A and B,
   20\%) than in neurologically intact (ASIA E, 11\%) cervical
   spine-injured patients (P = .019). VAT incidence was not significantly
   different between motor-incomplete (ASIA C and D, 10\%) and
   neurologically intact (ASIA E, 11\%) cervical spine-injured patients (P
   = .840).
   CONCLUSION: The absence of neurologic symptoms in a patient with
   cervical spine fracture does not preclude VAT. VAT associated with
   cervical spinal injury occurs with similar frequency in both
   neurologically intact (ASIA E) and motor-incomplete patients (ASIA C and
   D) but is significantly more common in motor-complete SCI (ASIA A and
   B).}},

Abstract = {{Delayed density-dependent mortality induced by delayed numerical

   high-amplitude cycles. We studied numerical response of goshawks
   Accipiter gentilis to varying densities of their main prey (forest
   grouse) in western Finland during 1979-1996. Occupancy rate of goshawk
   territories tracked grouse numbers with a two year lag. Occupancy rate
   of goshawk territories and pooled number of adult and young goshawks
   correlated negatively with a 1-2 year lag to the chick production of
   grouse. Goshawk to grouse ratio was negatively related to grouse
   density. This suggests that goshawk predation on grouse is inversely
   dependent on grouse density. We conclude that in northern Europe with
   few alternative preys, goshawk predation might contribute to the
   generation of multiannual cycles of forest grouse. This should be tested
   experimentally.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Previous studies have demonstrated an inverse association
   between meal frequency and the prevalence of obesity in adulthood. The
   aim of this study was to assess the relationship between meal frequency
   and childhood obesity.
   Research Methods and Procedures: Stature and weight of 4370 German
   children ages 5 to 6 years were determined in six Bavarian (Germany)
   public health offices during the obligatory school entry health
   examination in 2001/2002. An extensive questionnaire on risk factors for
   obesity was answered by their parents. Obesity was defined according to
   sex- and age-specific BMI cut-off points proposed by the International
   Obesity Task Force. The main exposure was daily meal frequency.
   Results: The prevalence of obesity decreased by number of daily meals:
   three or fewer meals, 4.2\% {[}95\% confidence interval (0), 2.8 to
   6.1]; four meals, 2.8\% (95\% Cl, 2.1 to 3.7); and 5 or more meals,
   1.7\% (95\% Cl, 1.2 to 2.4). These effects could not be explained by
   confounding due to a wide range of constitutional, sociodemographic, and
   lifestyle factors. The adjusted odds ratios for obesity were 0.73 (95\%
   Cl, 0.44 to 1.21) for four meals and 0.51 (95\% Cl, 0.29 to 0.89) for
   five or more meals. Additional analyses pointed to a higher energy
   intake in nibblers compared with gorgers.
   Discussion: A protective effect of an increased daily meal frequency on
   obesity in children was observed and appeared to be independent of other
   risk factors for childhood obesity. A modulation of the response of
   hormones such as insulin might be instrumental.}},

Journal = {{PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{182}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{562-569}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Rationale: Harmane and norharmane (two beta-carbolines) are tobacco
   components or products. The effects of harmane and norharmane on
   serotonergic raphe neurons remain unknown. Harmane and norharmane are
   inhibitors of the monoamine oxidases A (MAO-A) and B (MAO-B),
   respectively.
   Objectives: To study the effects of harmane, norharmane, befloxatone
   (MAOI-A), and selegiline (MAOI-B) on the firing of serotonergic neurons.
   To compare the effects of these compounds to those of nicotine (whose
   inhibitory action on serotonergic neurons has been previously
   described). The effects of cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine known to
   interact with serotonergic systems, are also tested.
   Methods: In vivo electrophysiological recordings of serotonergic dorsal
   raphe neurons in the anaesthetized rat.
   Results: Nicotine, harmane, and befloxatone inhibited serotonergic
   dorsal raphe neurons. The other compounds had no effects. The inhibitory
   effect of harmane (rapid and long-lasting inhibition) differed from that
   of nicotine (short and rapidly reversed inhibition) and from that of
   befloxatone (slow, progressive, and long-lasting inhibition). The
   inhibitory effects of harmane and befloxatone were reversed by the
   5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100 635. Pretreatment of animals with
   p-chlorophenylalanine abolished the inhibitory effect of befloxatone,
   but not that of harmane.
   Conclusions: Nicotine, harmane, and befloxatone inhibit the activity of
   raphe serotonergic neurons. Therefore, at least two tobacco compounds,
   nicotine and harmane, inhibit the activity of serotonergic neurons. The
   mechanism by which harmane inhibits serotonergic dorsal raphe neurons is
   likely unrelated to a MAO-A inhibitory effect.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the elastic flexural-torsional buckling of
   concentrically loaded columns with oblique eccentric restraints. Oblique
   flexural restraints may resist deflections as well as flexural
   rotations, while torsional restraints may resist twist rotations and
   warping. Flexural restraints may act at the shear center or may be
   eccentric. Restraints may be concentrated at points along a column or
   distributed along portions of its length, and may be rigid or elastic.
   Oblique flexural restraints cause coupling between the principal axis
   deflections and rotations, while eccentric flexural restraints cause
   coupling between the principal axis deflections and rotations and the
   twist rotations and warping displacements. The general buckling mode
   involves simultaneous bending about both principal axes and torsion.
   This paper discusses the nature of oblique eccentric restraints,
   summarizes their finite element analysis, presents examples of their
   effects on the elastic buckling of columns, and demonstrates the design
   of columns with oblique eccentric restraints.}},

Abstract = {{Most current models of lexical or `lemma' selection propose the parallel
   activation of a set of possible candidates where candidates compete to
   meet, a `best match' criterion. One method for testing the competitive
   activation hypothesis is to manipulate the recency with which a likely
   competitor word has been produced by priming it. Under certain
   assumptions one would predict that the point at which a target reaches
   criterion will be delayed if a competitor has been given Such a head
   start. Implicit in the idea of competition among lemmas is the idea that
   the activation cohort is limited to items that share both semantic and
   syntactic features with the target item, as lemmas are argued to specify
   semantic and syntactic features of lexical items. We set out to explore
   the importance of syntactic class in determining the composition of the
   competitor cohort by comparing priming effects for semantically related
   items that either shared syntactic Class - a noun printing a noun - or
   were from different syntactic classes-a verb priming a noun. We show
   that the competitor effect is a general one not limited to items drawn
   from the same syntactic class: giving either it related noun or it
   related verb a head start increases the time taken to produce the name
   of a pictured object. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Adherence to a Mediterranean diet has been reported to
   increase longevity, but concerns have been expressed that such a diet
   may promote overweight and obesity.
   Objective: The objective was to investigate whether adherence to the
   traditional Mediterranean diet, as operationalized in a Mediterranean
   diet score, is associated with body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip
   ratio (WHR).
   Design: In a general population sample of 23 597 adult men and women
   participating in the Greek European Prospective Investigation into
   Cancer and Nutrition Study, a validated food-frequency questionnaire was
   interviewer-administered, and anthropometric, sociodemographic, physical
   activity, and other lifestyle characteristics were recorded. BMI and WHR
   were regressed on a score that reflects adherence to the traditional
   Mediterranean diet and potentially confounding variables.
   Results: In models in which total energy intake was included, adherence
   to the Mediterranean diet was unrelated to BMI in both sexes and was
   weakly related to WHR only in women. When energy intake was not
   controlled for, a 2-point increase in the score was found to correspond
   to increases of approximate to 650 and 150 g in the weight of an
   average-height man and woman, respectively, whereas the WHR was found to
   increase by approximate to 0.001 units in men and 0.004 units in women.
   Conclusions: Adherence to a Mediterranean diet was essentially unrelated
   to BMI, with small differences depending on model choice and having no
   practical consequences. Overweight is a genuine problem in Greece and
   perhaps other Mediterranean countries, but it is likely to be related to
   limited physical activity in conjunction with excessive positive energy
   balance.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To assess tradeoffs in time spent with aligned visual axes or
   stereopsis and risked reoperations between three strategies for the
   treatment of large-angle infantile esotropia: first surgery at 6, 24, or
   48 months of age.
   DESIGN: Decision analysis.
   METHODS: We simulated three hypothetic cohorts of children with this
   condition until their eighth year. Potential achievement of stereopsis,
   the diagnosis of dissociated vertical divergence or inferior oblique
   over, action, and various complications were modeled. Probability
   estimates were obtained from a comprehensive literature review. Analyses
   aimed to determine the strategy that was associated with longer time
   spent with aligned eyes and/or stereopsis and fewer reoperations.
   RESULTS: Eight-year,old children are expected to spend 72.6 vs 58.0 vs
   37.8 months with aligned eyes and 26.8 vs 9.0 vs 1.5 months with
   stereopsis and to receive on average 1.76 vs 1.67 vs 1.46 surgeries, if
   they first underwent operation at 6 vs 24 vs 48 months, respectively.
   Children at 8 years are expected to have stereopsis at the rate of
   36.1\% vs 17.2\% vs 5.1\%, respectively. Operation at 6 months instead
   of 48 months is expected to yield an additional 9\% of total follow-up
   time in health states with eye alignment and 11\% in health states with
   stereopsis, per 5\% increase in risk for extra operations (5\% and 7\%,
   respectively, per 5\% increase in risk for operation at 6 vs 24 months).
   Wide-range sensitivity analyses and long,term projections point to the
   same direction.
   CONCLUSION: Given the benefit/risk tradeoffs, it is probably warranted
   to attempt to correct large,angle infantile esotropia as early as
   possible.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived hormone with
   antidiabetic, antiatherosclerotic, and antiinflammatory properties. This
   study investigated the relations between maternal adiponectin
   concentration and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and other
   metabolic parameters during midpregnancy.
   Methods: Two-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance tests were performed in
   253 pregnant women at 24 to 31 wk of gestation. Two hundred nineteen who
   had normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and 34 women who had GDM and their
   newborns were investigated. Fasting maternal blood samples were drawn to
   determine plasma concentrations of adiponectin; glucose, insulin,
   C-peptide, free fatty acid, and blood lipids. Blood samples at 1 and 2 h
   after an oral glucose load were obtained to measure plasma glucose,
   insulin, and C-peptide concentrations.
   Results: Plasma adiponectin concentrations were significantly lower in
   women who had GDM than in those who had NGT (P = 0.014). Maternal age,
   body mass index (before pregnancy and at blood collection), and plasma
   level of free fatty acid were significantly greater in those who had GDM
   than in those who had NGT. Logistic regression analysis,showed that
   maternal adiponectin level and GDM were significantly correlated (P =
   0.043), but that the correlation became weaker (P = 0.116) after
   adjusting for maternal body mass index and plasma level of free fatty
   acid before pregnancy. In the NGT group, maternal adiponectin
   concentrations were significantly negatively correlated with plasma
   fasting insulin, fasting C-peptide, fasting C-peptide/fasting glucose
   ratio, 2-h glucose, triacylglycerol, and maternal body mass index and
   positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
   concentration. In the GDM group, maternal adiponectin level was
   negatively correlated with neonatal birth weight.
   Conclusions: Midpregnancy hypoadiponectinemia may be associated with a
   higher risk of GDM. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the study was to investigate the temperature impact on
   the elasticity of porcine thoracic aorta. Under general anesthesia, 16
   Landrace pigs were subjected to thoracotomy, and the descending thoracic
   aorta was removed and stored in normal saline. Serial sections of the
   vessel created cylindrical aortic specimens which were tested in a
   uniaxial tension device to determine the elastic properties of the
   aortic wall. In the control, Group A (n = 8), the aortic tissues were
   tested while immersed in normal saline bath of temperature TA = 37.0 +/-
   0.5 degrees C, while in Group B, the temperature was TB = 40.0 +/- 0.5
   degrees C. Each experiment took place only after the tissues had
   remained for 15 min in temperature TA or TB. For the results, the
   stiffness modulus of Group B showed a significant decrease (P < 0.05) at
   medium strain level deformation (e = 1, SB1 = 114 +/- 8 Pa) as well as
   at high strain level deformation (e = 2, SB1 = 1182 +/- 48 Pa) in
   comparison with the control, Group A (e = 1, SA1 = 147 +/- 15 Pa; e = 2,
   SA1 = 1479 +/- 64 Pa). It is concluded that temperature increase
   facilitates, in vitro, the expansion of descending thoracic aorta. We
   assume that thermal treatment may be another means against the
   stiffening of aorta, which calls for further research.}},

Abstract = {{The condition for large angle scattering in ion-grain collisions, which
   determine the nonlinear part of the ion drag force, coincides with the
   condition for the grain screening to be nonlinear (parallel to e phi
   parallel to/T-i>1 where phi is the electrostatic grain potential and T-i
   is the ion mean energy), a condition met in many laboratory experiments.
   A self-consistent treatment of the nonlinear ion-drag force therefore
   requires a correct treatment of nonlinear screening. A model to account
   for the nonlinearity is presented and the drag force calculated, showing
   that it can be substantially larger than that for linear screening. An
   important physical feature found in the present investigation is that
   nonlinear screening corresponds to almost full screening inside a finite
   radius and that large angle scattering occurs only inside this radius.
   The nonlinear ion-drag force is found to have a strong dependence on the
   grain size, ratio of ion to electron temperatures, and ion density. (C)

Abstract = {{The aim of this preliminary study was to compare the initial bond
   strength of the glass-fiber-reinforced composite veil to the surface of
   the porcine calvarial compact bone using different adhesives.
   Fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) made of E-glass fiber veil with the
   BisGMA-PMMA resin system was used in the study. For the shear bond
   strength test, porcine calvarial bone cubes were mounted into resin
   matrix. FRC-veil discs were bonded to compact bone with different types
   of adhesives: (A) BisGMA-HEMA based (3M-ESPE Scotchbond Multi-Purpose
   Adhesive), (B) 4-META/UDMA/BisGMA based (Unifil Bond Bonding Agent) and
   MDP based (Clearfil Se Bond adhesive), (C) UDMA/BisGMA/PMMA-based
   experimental adhesive, and (D) silane-based (APS, ICS, MPS) experimental
   adhesives. The surface of the bone was mechanically roughened and was
   either used as such, treated with dental primers (Unifil Bond
   Self-etching Primer, Clearfil Se Bond Primer), or treated with an
   experimental silane mixture (APS, ICS, MPS), or with a mixture of the
   experimental silane liquid and Clearfil Se Bond Primer. The 3M-ESPE
   Scotchbond Multi-Purpose Adhesive and UDMA/BisGMA/PMMA experimental
   adhesive gave poor results in the shear bond test (0.58 and 0.40 MPa,
   respectively). Unifil Bond Bonding Agent and Clearfil Se Bond adhesive
   with respective primers markedly improved the shear bond strength; with
   Unifil the result was 3.40 MPa, and with Clearfil it was 6.19 MPa. When
   the bone surface was primed with a mixture of Clearfil Se Bond Primer
   and Clearfil Porcelain Bond Activator, the Clearfil Se Bond
   adhesive-impregnated FRC veil gave the best adhesion to the bone surface
   in this test: 9.50 MPa. The addition of bioactive glass granules between
   the veil and the bone lowered the shear bond strength in the test system
   described above to 6.72 MPa. The test systems with the silane mixture
   were also promising. In the SEM study, it was found that the mechanical
   treatment reveals the pores of the bone surface. Chemical treatments of
   the bone surface improved the adhesion of the FRC veil to the bone. The
   results showed that the adhesion of the FRC to the surface of the bone
   can be significantly improved with mechanical roughening and with
   special chemical treatments of the bone surface. (c) 2005 Wiley

Abstract = {{Thymus samius, a rare species endemic to the island of Samos (East
   Aegean, Greece), has been considered to be of possible hybrid origin,
   with Thymus cilicicus, Thymus parnassicus or Thymus zygioides as
   putative parents. Morphologically it also resembles Thymus atticus. In
   order to evaluate any possible chemotaxonomic relationships indicated by
   the qualitative and/or quantitative differentiation of volatile
   compounds, the essential oils of T. samius, T. parnassicus and T.
   atticus were analyzed and the oils of T. cilicicus and T. zygioides were
   used for comparison. T. atticus presents considerable variation in
   chemical constituents, with all Greek populations being poor in
   thymol/carvacrol and rich in (E)-nerolidol, germacrene D,
   (E)-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide, 1,8-cineole, a-pinene and
   camphene, depending on the sample. T. parnassicus shows remarkable
   qualitative stability in its volatile constituents, and all its
   populations have a similar profile with (E)-caryophyllene being the most
   prominent compound. T. samius is characterized by the presence of
   germacrene D and beta-bisabolene, which constitute almost half its oil
   percentage. This species is also characterized by a low amount of
   monoterpenes; the latter exist in a considerable percentage in the
   related species. Our results indicate that T. samius does not show
   similarity or intermediacy in chemical compounds with any given couple
   of T. atticus, T. parnassicus, T. cilicicus, or T. zygioides. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Two basic types of experiments were made to study the transport
   mechanisms of butane as a condensable gas through a Vycor glass
   membrane, measurements of (a) gas fluxes using a steady state permeation
   arrangement and (b) liquid fluxes. Steady state experiments enable to
   study butane transport for different concentration profiles in the
   pores. Measurements of liquid fluxes are indispensable for the
   evaluation of the presence of condensate in pores during gas permeation.
   Differences between the gas flux (at both sides of the membrane the
   butane is in the gas phase) and the liquid butane flux (on the high
   pressure side of the membrane is liquid, on the opposite side is gas)
   were observed for the same pressure gradients across the membrane. The
   differences between these fluxes decrease with decreasing pressure
   gradients. For a pressure gradient higher than 2 bar the flux of the
   liquid butane is approximately two times higher, for a pressure gradient
   of 1.3 bar the ratio of liquid and gas fluxes decreases to 1.7. No
   difference between liquid and gas fluxes was registered for the lowest
   pressure gradient investigated (pressures on the two sides of the
   membrane: 2.22 and 1.91 bar). From the results obtained it can be
   concluded that the condensation of butane in pores occurs at high
   pressures on both sides if simultaneously the pressure difference is
   small. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The human Mut-L-Homologon-1 (MLH1) and Mut-S-Homologon-2
   (MSH2) are post replication mismatch repair (MMR) genes.
   Methods: We examined the correlation of the clinical features of 122
   patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) with the
   expression of MLHI and MSH2 by immunohistochemical analysis.
   Results: According to our criteria, 34 and 25 cases did not express MLHI
   and MSH2, respectively. Expression of both the MLHI and MSH2 gene
   products was observed in 73 (59.8\%) cases; loss of MLH1 or MSH2
   expression was detected in 35(28.7\%) cases. Fourteen (11.5\%) cases
   demonstrated loss of both MLHI and MSH2 expression in ESCC. Loss of MLH1
   and/or MSH2 gene expression significantly correlated with increases in
   malignancy, as evidenced by increases in the existence of metastatic
   lymph nodes (P = 0.0056), extensive invasion (P = 0.0007), and poor
   differentiation (P = 0.0992). The MLH1-negative patients had a
   significantly poorer prognosis than those in the MLH1-positive group (P
   = 0.0043). Similar results were observed for MSH2 expression (P =
   0.0002). Patients both MLH1 and MSH2 negative exhibited the most poor
   clinical outcome than other patients (P < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: We conclude that MMR protein expression, detected by
   immunohistochemistry, is a useful marker providing information necessary
   to decide appropriate therapeutic strategies in patients with ESCC.}},

Abstract = {{Background. We aimed to assess the influence of reduced working hours on
   training in a UK teaching hospital as the specialist registrar grade was
   introduced in 1996, the New Deal was implemented in 2001 and the Working
   Time Directive (WTD) took effect for doctors in training in 2004.
   Methods. We analysed data from operating theatres in our hospital
   looking at grade of anaesthetist, time of day, emergency category, and
   specialty for more than 50 000 cases.
   Results. Although direct supervision of trainees increased from 32 to 37
   to 47\%, senior house officer (SHO) and specialist registrar (SpR)
   caseload reduced by 20 and 21\%, respectively, while that of the
   consultants rose.
   Conclusions. The reduction in total operating theatre cases for our
   trainees was evident across the epochs analysed, case numbers fell after
   introduction of the New Deal as well as more recently following the WTD,
   particularly for SHOs who are now doing a larger proportion of their
   work at night. SHOs and SpRs are doing more obstetric cases than in
   previous times but these are regional and not general anaesthetics.}},

Journal = {{DOCUMENTA OPHTHALMOLOGICA}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{111}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{169-178}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine whether patients with congenital stationary night
   blindness (CSNB) have electrophysiological evidence of optic nerve fibre
   mis-routing similar to that found in patients with ocular albinism (OA).
   Method: We recorded the Pattern Onset VEP using a protocol optimised to
   detect mis-routing of optic nerve fibres in older children and adults.
   We tested 20 patients (age 15-69 yrs) with X-linked or autosomal
   recessive CSNB, 14 patients (age 9-56 yrs) with OA and 13 normally
   pigmented volunteers (age 21-66 yrs). We measured the amplitude and
   latency of the Cl component at the occipital midline and over left and
   right occipital hemispheres. We also assessed the computed
   inter-hemispheric ``difference{''} signal. Subjects with CSNB were
   classified as having the ``complete{''} or ``incomplete{''} phenotype on
   the basis of their ERG characteristics. Members of X-linked CSNB
   pedigrees underwent mutation screening of the NYX and CACNA1F genes.
   Results.- CI was significantly smaller over the ipsilateral hemisphere
   and more prominent over the contralateral hemisphere in OA patients
   compared with both controls and CSNB patients. In CSNB patients CI
   response amplitudes were not significantly different from controls but
   peak latency was prolonged at all three electrodes compared with
   controls. The inter-hemispheric ``difference{''} signal was abnormal for
   the OA group but not for the CSNB group. Contralateral dominance of Cl
   could be identified in the majority of OA patients and the
   ``difference{''} signal was opposite in polarity for left compared with
   right eye stimulation in every patient in this group. Only 3 of 20
   patients with CSNB showed significant inter-hemispheric asymmetry
   similar to that seen in the OA patients. All 3 CSNB patients with
   evidence for optic nerve fibre mis-routing had X-linked pedigrees: 2 had
   an identified mutation in the NYX gene but no mutation in either the NYX
   or CACNA1F genes was identified in the third. VEP evidence of optic
   nerve fibre mis-routing was present in 3 of the I I subjects with
   ``complete{''} phenotype and none of the 9 patients with
   ``incomplete{''} phenotype CSNB. Conclusion.- Mis-routing of optic nerve
   fibres does occur in CSNB but we found evidence of it in only 15\% of
   our patients.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive automated planning systems that can, over time, improve the
   quality of plans they produce are a promising prospect. The first part
   of the article discusses the issues involved in designing quality
   improving learning for planning systems and reviews recent work on

   the Performance Improving Planning (PIP) System. The heart of PIP is an
   analytic technique that compares two planning episodes for solving a
   planning problem that led to two different quality solutions-a
   higher-quality solution and a lower quality solution-and identifies the
   critical differences that were responsible for the resulting differences
   in the quality of the completed plans. We compare the effectiveness of
   two different ways of storing and applying the knowledge learned from
   this analysis-as search-control rules and as rewrite rules. The results
   show that the search-control rules are more effective in improving plan
   quality. Further analysis of PIP-search-control-the version of PIP that
   stores the learned knowledge as search-control rules-shows that it is an
   effective technique for improving plan quality in a variety of
   situations.}},

Abstract = {{Meiofauna communities of four intertidal sites, two sheltered and two
   more exposed, in Kongsfjorden (Svalbard) were investigated in summer
   2001 at two different tidal levels (i.e. the low-water line and close
   below the driftline, referred to as mid-water (MW) level). A total of
   seven melofaunal higher taxa were recorded with nematodes, oligochaetes
   and turbellarians being numerically dominant. Mean total meiofaunal
   densities ranged between 50 ind. 10 cm(-2) and 903 ind. 10 cm-2. Our
   data showed a clear decrease in total meiofaunal densities with
   increasing coarseness of the sediment. Total meiofaunal biomass varied
   from 0.2 g dwt m(-2) to 2 g dwt m(-2) and, in general, was high even at
   low meiofaunal densities, i.e. larger interstitial spaces in coarser
   sediments supported larger meiofauna, especially turbellarians. The
   results on the vertical distribution of meiofauna contrasted sharply
   with typical meiobenthic depth profiles on other beaches, probably in
   response to ice-scouring and concomitant salinity fluctuations.
   Oligochaetes were the most abundant taxon, with a peak density of 641
   ind. 10 cm(-2) at Breoyane Island. They were mainly comprised of
   juvenile Enchytraeidae, which prohibited identification to species/genus
   level. Nematode densities ranged between 4 ind. 10 cm(-2) and 327 ind.
   10 cm(-2). Nematodes were identified up to genus level and assigned to
   trophic guilds. In total, 28 nematode genera were identified.
   Oncholaimus and Theristus were the most abundant genera. The composition
   of the nematode community and a dominance of predators and deposit
   feeders were in agreement with results from other arctic and temperate
   beaches. Nematode genus diversity was higher at the more sheltered
   beaches than at the more exposed ones. Low-water level stations also
   tended to harbour a more diverse nematode communities than stations at
   the MW level. Differences in nematode community structure between low-
   and MW stations of single beaches were more pronounced than community
   differences between different beaches and were mainly related to
   resources quality and availability.}},

Abstract = {{The interest in safer raw fish products obtained by high pressure

   evaluate the stabilizing effect of sucrose, trehalose, sorbitol and
   their mixtures (1:1) on myofibrillar arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes
   stomias) proteins subjected to pressure treatments. Fish proteins
   solubilized with 2.5\% salt and 4, 8 and 12\% sucrose, sorbitol,
   trehalose or 1:1 mixtures of sucrose-sorbitol and trehalose-sorbitol
   were subjected to 600 MPa for 5 min. Texture profile analysis, protein
   solubility, heat induced gelling and color parameters were used to
   quantify pressure effects. Sorbitol at 8 and 12\% was the most efficient
   stabilizing agent against high pressure effects on protein

Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of
   ribavirin on bone mineral metabolism in patients with chronic hepatitis
   C who had been treated with interferon and ribavirin.
   Methods: Twenty patients (3 female, 17 male) with chronic hepatitis C
   were enrolled. Age range was 6 to 15 years (mean SD, 11.15 +/- 2.3
   years). Thirteen patients received combined interferon alpha-2b and
   ribavirin therapy (Group 1), and 7 patients received only interferon
   alpha-2b (Group 2). Both groups were treated for 12 months. Bone mineral
   density, z-scores and biochemical bone markers were evaluated in both
   groups before and after treatment.
   Results: There were no significant differences between the groups in age
   or gender. Mean lumbar vertebral bone mineral density and mean z-scores
   in groups 1 and 2 before and after treatment were not significantly
   different. In both groups, serum and urinary biochemical values and bone
   markers were all normal and there were no differences between the
   pretreatment and post-treatment values.
   Conclusion: Contrary to studies in adults, we did not find any
   ribavirin-dependent changes related to bone mineral metabolism in our
   pediatric study groups. Further studies are needed to obtain more
   detailed information about the effects of ribavirin on bone mineral
   density.}},

Abstract = {{Staphylococcus epidermidis is an opportunistic pathogen associated with
   foreign body infections and nosocomial sepsis. The pathogenicity of S.
   epidermidis is mostly due to its ability to colonize indwelling
   polymeric devices and form a thick, multilayered biofilm. Biofilm
   formation is a major problem in treating S. epidermidis infection as
   biofilms provide significant resistance to antibiotics and to components
   of the innate host defenses. Various cell surface associated bacterial
   factors play a role in adherence and accumulation of the biofilm such as
   the polysaccharide intercellular adhesin and the autolysin AtIE.
   Furthermore, recent studies have shown that global regulators such as
   the agr quorum sensing system, the transcriptional regulator sarA and
   the alternative sigma factor sigB have an important function in the
   regulation of biofilm formation. Understanding the many complex
   mechanisms involved in biofilm formation is a key factor in the search

Abstract = {{Fairness is an important issue when accessing a shared wireless channel.
   With fair scheduling, it is possible to allocate bandwidth in proportion

   a fully distributed algorithm for fair scheduling in a wireless LAN. The
   algorithm can be implemented without using a centralized coordinator to
   arbitrate medium access. The proposed protocol is derived from the
   Distributed Coordination Function in the IEEE 802.11 standard.
   Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is able to schedule
   transmissions such that the bandwidth allocated to different flows is
   proportional to their weights. An attractive feature of the proposed
   approach is that it can be implemented with simple modifications to the
   IEEE 802.11 standard.}},

Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Male ageing is in focus nowadays. The aim of this study was to
   investigate conceptions of the male menopause (also known as andropause)
   in the educational and professional literature of Finnish physicians
   from 1982 to 2002, and the main point of interest was how the
   presentation of the male menopause and its treatments have changed.
   Published items for analysis were retrieved from the two main Finnish
   medical Journals and from introductory gynaecology and urology textbooks
   using keywords for male ageing and hormones. It was found that
   disagreements about the male menopause have been marked. Some authors
   described it as a consequence of the decline in gonad functioning that
   comes with increased age, and some argued that we are making a disease
   out of normal ageing, but its association with sexual problems has risen
   in prominence: libido and potency disorders have recently been
   identified as symptoms. The treatment provided for male menopause was
   androgens, about which opinions diverged, especially the effect of
   androgen therapy on cardiovascular diseases and osteoporosis. New forms
   of testosterone treatment have been eagerly adopted, but opinions varied
   on the appropriate duration of the therapies. By the 2000S, the male
   menopause was increasingly likened to the female menopause, with
   emphasis upon the similar symptoms. While gerontological thinking
   largely sees the male menopause as an aspect of ageing and a normal
   condition, the andrological approach regards it as a treatable disease
   and its rapid adoption can be seen as a reflection of both private and
   public concerns about increased longevity.}},

Abstract = {{Although migraine is characterised by an abnormal cortical excitability
   level, whether the central nervous system is hyper- or hypo-excitable in
   migraine still remains an unsolved problem. The aim of our study was to
   compare the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) recovery cycle, a
   marker of the somatosensory system's excitability, in a group of 15
   children suffering from migraine without aura (MO) (mean age 11.7 +/-
   1.6 years, five males, 10 females) and 10 control age-matched Subjects
   (CS) (mean age 10.9 +/- 2.1 years, six males, four females). We
   calculated the SEP's latency and amplitude modifications after paired
   electrical stimuli at 5, 20 and 40 ms interstimulus intervals (ISIs),
   comparing it with a single stimulus condition assumed as the baseline.
   In MO patients, the amplitudes of the cervical N13 and of the cortical
   N20, P24 and N30 responses at 20 and 40 ms ISIs showed a higher recovery
   than in CS (two-way ANOVA, P < 0.05). Since, the SEP recovery cycle
   depends on the inhibitory interneuron function, our findings suggest
   that a somatosensory system disinhibition takes place in migraine. This
   is a generalized phenomenon, not limited to the cerebral cortex, but
   concerning also the cervical grey matter. The SEP recovery cycle
   reflects the intracellular concentration of Na+, therefore, the
   shortened recovery cycle in our MO patients suggests a high level of
   intracellular Na+ and a consequent depolarized resting membrane
   potential, possibly due to an impaired Na+-K+ ATPase function in
   migraine. (c) 2005 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Abstract = {{This laboratory study examined the feasibility of non-invasive, in vivo
   peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) method in evaluation
   of bioactive glass incorporation with bone. An intramedullary defect
   model of the rat tibia was applied. The defect was filled with bioactive
   glass microspheres (diameter of 250-315 mu m) or was left to heal
   without filling (empty controls). The results of the pQCT analysis were
   compared with those of histomorphometry. In the control defects, there
   was a good correlation (r(2) = 0.776, p < 0.001) between the pQCT
   density of the intramedullary space and the amount of new bone measured
   by histomorphometry, In the defects filled with bioactive glass, the use
   of thresholding techniques of the applied pQCT system (Stratec XCT
   Research M) failed in separation of new bone formation and bioactive
   glass particles. However, detailed analysis of the pQCT attenuation
   profiles showed time-related changes which well matched with the
   histomorphometric results of new bone formation both in control and
   bioactive glass filled defects. The biphasic pQCT attenuation profiles
   of bioactive glass filled defects could be separated into two distinct
   peaks. In statistical analysis of various variables, the center (i.e.
   the value of attenuation) of the major attenuation peak was found to be
   the most significant indicator of the incorporation process. The center
   of the peak initially decreased (during the first 4 weeks of healing)
   and thereafter increased. These two phases probably reflect the primary
   resorption and reactivity of the bioactive glass microspheres in vivo
   followed by secondary new bone formation on their surfaces. Based on
   these results, pQCT-method seems to be suitable for in vivo follow-up of
   the bioactive glass incorporation processes. Although the imaging
   technique is not able to discriminate the individual microspheres from
   invading new bone unambiguously, the attenuation profiling seems to give
   adequate information about the state of the incorporation process. This
   information may help to establish non-invasive imaging techniques of
   synthetic bone substitutes for preclinical and clinical testing of their
   efficacy. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Our objective of this study was to describe the clinical course of
   severe functional constipation in early childhood. Eligible patients
   were 47 children (60\% boys; median age, 3.5 months) who had
   constipation in their first year of life. Follow-up data were obtained
   through a standardized questionnaire. Success was defined as a period of
   at least 4 weeks with >= 3 painless bowel movements per week. Six months
   after initial evaluation, 69\% of the children were recovered. After
   initial success, a relapse occurred in 15\% of the children within 3
   years. A duration of symptoms < 3 months before referral correlated
   significantly with better outcome. We conclude that most infants with
   severe constipation evaluated at a tertiary center are recovered after 6
   months. Early therapeutic intervention may beneficially contribute to
   the resolution of constipation.}},

Abstract = {{In vitro Studies investigating the influence of electric DC current on
   bacterial detachment have demonstrated that continuous currents of only
   25-125 mu A stimulated Staphylococcal strains to detach from surgical
   stainless steel. However, DC Currents produce more power that has to be
   dissipated by the skin as compared to alternating currents. Also, an
   excess of ions on the steel can Cause negative osteogenesis and fixation
   results. Therefore, it is the aim of this paper to examine whether
   detachment of Staphylococcus epidermidis from stainless steel Surfaces
   in a parallel plate flow chamber can also be Stimulated using electric
   block Currents. Block currents of 15, 60 and 100 mu A with different
   frequencies (0.1-2Hz) and duty cycles (5-50\%) were applied to induce
   bacterial detachment. Block Currents of 100 mu A cause detachment of
   about 76\% of adhering staphylococci from stainless steel, whereas in
   addition the remaining bacteria are less viable, as determined by
   culturing the remaining bacteria on agar plates. Therewith, block
   current-induced detachment of adhering bacteria from stainless steel
   appears to be an equally promising method to prevent infection of
   orthopaedic fixation pins and screws than application of DC Currents.

Abstract = {{Forkhead members of the `O' class (FoxO) are transcription factors
   crucial for the regulation of metabolism, cell cycle, cell death and
   cell survival. FoxO factors are regulated by insulin-mediated activation
   of PI3K (phosphomositide 3-kinase)-PKB (protein 3-kinase) signalling.
   Activation of PI3K-PKB signalling results in the phosphorylation of FoxO
   factors on three conserved phosphorylation motifs, which are essential
   for the translocation of FoxO factors from the nucleus to the cytosol.
   FoxO6, however, remains mostly nuclear due to the fact that its
   shuttling ability is dramatically impaired. FoxO1, FoxO3 and FoxO4 all
   contain an N- and C-terminal PKB motif and a motif located in the
   forkhead domain. FoxO6 lacks the conserved C-terminal PKB motif, which
   is the cause of the shuttling impairment. Since FoxO6 can be considered
   constitutively nuclear, we investigated whether it is also a
   constitutively active transcription factor. Our results show that FoxO6
   transcriptional activity is inhibited by growth factors, independent of
   shuttling, indicating that it is not constitutively active. The PKB site
   in the forkhead domain (Ser(184)) regulated the DNA binding
   characteristics and the N-terminal PKB site acted as a growth factor
   sensor. In summary, FoxO6 is not a constitutively active transcription
   factor and can be regulated by growth factors in a Thr(26)- and
   Ser(184)-dependent manner, independent of shuttling to the cytosol.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: Imbalances in the genetically controlled pro- and
   anti-inflammatory cytokine production may promote ongoing low-grade
   inflammation after an acute gastroenteritis, and subsequently, irritable
   bowel syndrome (IBS) (post-infectious IBS, PI-IBS). We studied gene
   promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha (TNF-alpha, pro-inflammatory) and interleukin-10 (IL-10,
   anti-inflammatory) in IBS patients and controls.
   METHODS: DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes of 111 IBS
   patients and 162 healthy controls. Genotype and allele frequencies were
   assessed by analyzing SNPs at position -308 (TNF-alpha) and -1082 and
   -819 (IL-10).
   RESULTS: Homozygous high producers for TNF-alpha (A/A) were rare
   (overall prevalence 2.6\%). The heterozygous TNF-alpha genotype (G/A,
   high producer) was significantly more prevalent in IBS compared to
   controls (41\%vs 26\%, p= 0.02). More patients (41\%) than controls
   (30\%) were positive for the A allele (p= 0.044; odds ratio (OR) 1.68,
   95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-2.79), with a similar trend for
   diarrhea (54\%) versus constipation and alternating subtypes (< 33\%, p=
   0.079), but not for subgroups according to a history of acute
   gastroenteritis. IL-10 genotypes were similarly distributed in patients
   and controls for both SNPs. Possession of a high producer TNF-alpha and
   a low producer IL-10 genotype were significantly more prevalent in IBS
   (9\%) versus controls (3\%, p= 0.035; OR 3.11, 95\% CI 1.03-9.36) and in
   diarrhea (20\%) compared to other IBS subtypes (< 4\%, p= 0.026).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the emerging hypothesis that
   genetically determined immune activity plays a role in the
   pathophysiology of IBS. Future studies in larger, clinically relevant,
   IBS subgroups are warranted to establish definite associations with
   cytokine gene polymorphisms.}},

Abstract = {{In `belief revision' a theory K is revised with a formula. resulting in
   a revised theory K{*}phi. Typically, -phi is in K, one has to give up
   belief in -phi by a process of retraction, and. is in K{*}phi. We
   propose to model belief revision in a dynamic epistemic logic. In this
   setting, we typically have an information state (pointed Kripke model)
   for the theory K wherein the agent believes the negation of the revision
   formula, i.e., wherein B-phi is true. The revision with. is a program
   {*}phi that transforms this information state into a new information
   state. The transformation is described by a dynamic modal operator
   {[}{*}phi], that is interpreted as a binary relation {[}{[}{*}phi]]
   between information states. The next information state is computed from
   the current information state and the belief revision formula. If the
   revision is successful, the agent believes. in the resulting state,
   i.e., B. is then true. To make this work, as information states we
   propose `doxastic epistemic models' that represent both knowledge and
   degrees of belief. These are multi-modal and multi-agent Kripke models.
   They are constructed from preference relations for agents, and they
   satisfy various characterizable multi-agent frame properties. Iterated,
   revocable, and higher-order belief revision are all quite natural in
   this setting. We present, for an example, five different ways of such
   dynamic belief revision. One can also see that as a non-deterministic
   epistemic action with two alternatives, where one is preferred over the
   other, and there is a natural generalization to general epistemic
   actions with preferences.}},

   culture was significantly correlated with both organizational goal
   achievement and an objective indicator of economic performance. This
   finding was confirmed in Study 2, using change-of-profitability data

Abstract = {{Background: Glutamatergic dysfunction has been implicated in the
   pathophysiology of schizophrenia. However, so far there is limited
   direct evidence of altered in vivo glutamate concentrations in the
   brains of patients with schizophrenia. To test the hypothesis that
   altered glutamatergic neurotransmission might play a role in the
   pathogenesis of schizophrenia, we measured glutamate and glutamine
   concentrations in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus of patients
   with chronic schizophrenia using high-field magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy.
   Methods. Twenty-one patients with schizophrenia and 32 healthy
   volunteers were examined clinically and by means of short echo time
   single voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. Absolute concentrations of
   neurometabolites were calculated.
   Results: Absolute concentrations of glutamate were significantly higher
   in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus in the patient group.
   Factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed no significant
   interactions between duration of schizophrenia, number of
   hospitalizations, or hype of antipsychotic medication and glutamate

Abstract = {{The pestivirus glycoprotein E-rns, a ribonuclease, is expressed on the
   surface of virions and in infected cells as a disulfide-linked
   homodimer. E-rns is involved in the infection process and its RNase
   activity is probably involved in viral replication and pathogenesis. The
   most C- terminal cysteine residue forms an intermolecular disulfide bond
   with another E-rns monomer, resulting in an E-rns dimer. To study the
   function of dimerisation of E-rns for viral replication, the cysteine
   residue at amino acid position 438 was mutated into a serine residue.
   The mutated C438S gene was cloned into a vector containing an infectious
   cDNA copy of the CSFV C- strain genome. Using reverse genetics, a mutant
   virus was generated that only expressed monomeric E-rns, confirming that
   Cys 438 is essential for homodimerisation. Characterization of this
   mutant virus and of a baculovirus- expressed C438S mutant protein
   indicated that the loss of the dimeric state of Erns reduced the
   affinity of binding of virions and E-rns to heparan sulphate (HS), the
   receptor for E-rns on the cell surface of SK6 cells. This suggests that
   interaction of virus-bound E-rns homodimers with membrane associated HS
   may be a joined action of the two HS-binding domains (one in each
   monomer) present in the homodimer.}},

Abstract = {{The diffusion of tritiated water (HTO) in Opalinus clay (OPA) samples
   from bore cores from the Benken area ( Northern Switzerland) was studied
   using the radial through- and out-diffusion technique. Results from
   inverse modelling of out-diffusion data for HTO indicated the presence
   of two preferential diffusion pathways: a fast and a slow one. Analysing
   through- diffusion data, however, provides hardly any information
   concerning a second transport-relevant porosity. Only by also analysing
   the out-diffusion phase can finer details of the diffusion process and
   information on sample heterogeneity be recognised. The extracted values
   for the effective diffusion coefficient are in the order of 3 x 10(-11)
   m(2) s(-1) for the faster transport porosity and roughly an order of
   magnitude smaller for the slower type of porosity. We had to account for
   tritium sorption on the clay minerals by a small but non-zero K-d-value
   in the order of 10(-5) m(3) kg(-1) in order to reproduce the data with
   acceptable precision. In the model applied both porosities are
   considered as being independent from each other. Roughly 30\% of the
   tracer diffused through the second, slower porosity; such a fact might
   be interesting for future performance assessments for radioactive waste
   repositories hosted by clay formations. Based on our present picture
   from water-saturated OPA, on a microscopic scale three different kind of
   waters can be discriminated: free water, double layer water and
   interlayer water. However, using HTO as tracer only, it could not be
   deduced which type of water-filled pores finally account for the
   transport-relevant porosity.}},

Abstract = {{Background. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a predictor of coronary heart
   disease, total mortality and chronic allograft nephropathy in renal
   transplant recipients. The determinants of CRP have been investigated in
   the general population, but not in renal transplant recipients. CRP
   might reflect metabolic aberrations in association with central obesity
   and systemic atherosclerosis. However, it may also reflect a low-grade
   immune-mediated response to the graft. In this study we investigated the
   factors associated with CRP in a renal transplant population.
   Methods. Between August 2001 and July 2003, renal transplant recipients
   with a functioning graft for more than 1 year (n = 847) were eligible
   for investigation at their next visit to the outpatient clinic. A total
   of 606 patients ( 55\% male, aged 51 +/- 12 years) participated at a
   median (interquartile range) time of 6.0 (2.6-11.4) years
   post-transplant.
   Results. Median CRP concentration was 2.0 (0.80-4.8) mg/l and mean 24 h
   creatinine clearance was 62 +/- 22 ml/min. CRP was significantly
   associated with body mass index, waist circumference and waist-to-hip
   ratio (P-value < 0.0001). None of the transplant characteristics except
   creatinine clearance was associated with CRP. In multiple regression
   analysis, waist circumference, log sICAM-1 concentration, gender,
   creatinine clearance and current smoking were independently associated
   with CRP.
   Conclusions. In renal transplant recipients waist circumference and
   smoking are the two most important modi. able independent determinants
   of CRP. Furthermore, CRP is independently associated with the
   endothelial function parameter sICAM-1 and, in univariate analyses,
   associated with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. CRP is not
   associated with any of the transplant-related factors, except for renal
   transplant function.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this study was to develop in effective
   curriculum to teach hysteroscopy, as well as to develop an objective
   assessment instrument (OSATS).
   Study design: All 24 residents in out-training program attended a 3-hour
   hysteroscopy curriculum in each of 3 years. Each year after the
   curriculum, an OSATS was administered consisting of an assembly and
   operative task. Each task was evaluated with a task-specific checklist
   and a previously validated global assessment form. Twenty-four residents
   from an outside institution served as controls. All residents were
   examined by blinded and unblinded examiners.
   Results: The reliability coefficient was .7857 for the checklist and
   .9763 for the global scale. Interrater reliability for the checklist was
   .7478 and ranged from .4222 to .9329 for the global instruments.
   Evaluation of construct validity revealed that the junior residents at
   both locations did significantly worse on the checklist and global scale
   than the senior residents for all 3 years of the study (P < .001). Those
   residents provided the curriculum did significantly better on both the
   checklist and the global scale than the resident controls with a mean of
   45\% versus 63\% for the checklist and 18.3 versus 24.9 for the global
   score. (P = .001 checklist, P = .007 global scale).
   Conclusion: This curriculum is all effective way to impart knowledge and
   skill in the assembly and use of the operative hysteroscope. The
   checklist developed for this OSATS has excellent reliability and
   construct validity. (C) 2005 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The myelin sheath is an electrically insulating layer that consists of
   lipids and proteins. It plays a key role in the functioning of the
   nervous system by allowing fast saltatory conduction of nerve pulses.
   Profiling of the proteins present in myelin is an indispensable
   prerequisite to better understand the molecular aspects of this dynamic,
   functionally active membrane. Two types of protein, the myelin basic
   protein and the proteolipid protein, account for nearly 85\% of the
   protein content in myelin. Identification and characterization of the
   other ``minor{''} proteins is, in this respect, a real challenge. In the
   present work, two proteomic strategies were applied in order to study
   the protein composition of myelin from the murine central nervous
   system. First, the protein mixture was separated by 2D-gel
   electrophoresis and, after spot excision and in-gel digestion, samples
   were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Via this approach, we identified 57
   protein spots, corresponding to 38 unique proteins. Alternatively, the
   myelin sample was digested by trypsin and the resulting peptide mixture
   was further analyzed by off-line 2D-liquid chromatography. After the
   second-dimension separation (nanoLC), the peptides were spotted
   ``on-line{''} onto a MALDI target and analyzed by MALDI TOF-TOF mass
   spectrometry. We identified 812 peptides by MALDI MS/MS, representing 93
   proteins. Membrane proteins, low abundant proteins, and highly basic
   proteins were all represented in this shotgun proteomic approach. By
   combining the results of both approaches, we can present a comprehensive
   proteomic map of myelin, comprising a total of 103 protein
   identifications, which is of utmost importance for the molecular
   understanding of white matter and its disorders.}},

Abstract = {{The protein constituents of gap junctions, connexins, have a rapid basal
   rate of degradation even after transport to the cell surface. We have
   used cell surface biotinylation to label gap junction-unassembled plasma
   membrane pools of connexin43 (Cx43) and show that their degradation is
   inhibited by mild hyperthermia, oxidative stress, and proteasome
   inhibitors. Cytosolic stress does not perturb endocytosis of
   biotinylated Cx43, but instead it seems to interfere with its targeting
   and/or transport to the lysosome, possibly by increasing the level of
   unfolded protein in the cytosol. This allows more Cx43 molecules to
   recycle to the cell surface, where they are assembled into long-lived,
   functional gap junctions in otherwise gap junction assembly-inefficient
   cells. Cytosolic stress also slowed degradation of biotinylated Cx43 in
   gap junction assembly-efficient normal rat kidney fibroblasts, and
   reduced the rate at which gap junctions disappeared from cell interfaces
   under conditions that blocked transport of nascent connexin molecules to
   the plasma membrane. These data demonstrate that degradation from the
   cell surface can be down-regulated by physiologically relevant forms of
   stress. For connexins, this may serve to enhance or preserve gap
   junction-mediated intercellular communication even under conditions in
   which protein synthesis and/or intracellular transport are compromised.}},

Abstract = {{Acute renal failure (ARF) after liver transplantation is a factor of
   poor prognosis associated with a high mortality. Selection of the donor,
   recipient, and intraoperative and postoperative treatment has crucial
   importance in the management of these critical patients. Thus,
   optimization of the use of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI), the main
   nephrotoxic substances in the immediate postoperative period, may
   decrease ARF incidence, allowing for early recovery of renal function in
   this period. Most protocols are based on the reduction or late
   introduction of CNI, based on the use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)
   with/without antiCD25 (basilximab/daclizumab). Recently, thymoglobulin
   (ATG) is also being tested to further delay the use of the CNI. A
   20\%-30\% acute rejection incidence with the usual protocols allows
   recovery of renal function in more than 80\% of patients without
   increasing the incidence of infections or adverse effects. However, it
   is still unknown whether there is a long-term negative effect of
   chimeric-humanized monoclonal antibodies and MMF combination on
   reinfection with hepatitis C virus in transplant recipients.}},

   We discuss some recent results obtained from XMM-Newton observations of
   Seyfert 1 galaxies. Particular attention will be given to the remarkable
   similarity found between the timing properties of Seyferts and black

   (time delays and coherence), and their implications for the physical
   processes at work in Seyferts.}},

Abstract = {{The recent isolation of a natural mutant of castor bean with high oleic
   acid and low ricinoleic acid concentration opens up new potential uses
   for castor oil. The objective of the present research was to monitor
   fatty acid and tocopherol accumulation in developing seeds of the high
   oleic acid mutant OLE-1 in comparison with seeds of the standard high
   ricinoleic acid line A74. Seed samples were collected at regular
   intervals from 6 to 60 days after pollination (DAP) and analyzed for oil
   content, fatty acid composition, and tocopherol content and composition.
   Oil accumulation followed a similar pattern in both lines from 12 to 18
   DAP, but from this stage oil accumulated much more actively in A74,
   resulting in a significant difference of about 15\% oil content between
   both lines at maturity. The concentrations of palmitic, linoleic, and
   linolenic acid were similar in both lines at all stages, whereas stearic
   acid was about 0.5\% higher in A74 during the whole seed filling period.
   Both lines exhibited contrasting accumulation patterns for oleic and
   ricinoleic acid. Ricinoleic acid concentration raised rapidly from zero
   at 9 DAP to above 80\% at 21 DAP in A74, whereas its concentration in
   OLE-1 seeds raised at a much lower rate, from zero at 9 DAP to about
   15\% at 36 DAR Conversely, oleic acid concentration remained practically
   unchanged in A74, whereas it raised drastically from about 10\% at 12
   DAP to around 75\% at 18 DAR The increase in oleic acid was not
   accompanied by a concomitant raise of linoleic acid concentration, which
   suggests that the low linoleic acid concentration in conventional castor
   oil is not the result of competition between the hydroxylation and
   desaturation pathways. At 6 DAP, both lines contained very low levels of
   tocopherols, mainly in the form of alpha-tocopherol. The synthesis of
   beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherol started between 12 and 15 DAP, with
   a maximum total tocopherol content at 21 DAP for A74 and 24 DAP for
   OLE-1. The accumulation pattern of gamma-tocopherol content was similar
   in both lines. However, OLE-1 seeds reached higher levels of beta- and
   delta-tocopherol, which resulted in a higher total tocopherol content at
   maturity, about 785 mg kg(-1) dry seed weight in comparison with 605 mg
   kg(-1) dry seed weight in A74. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The Albanerpetontidae are salamander-like, Middle Jurassic to Neogene
   lissamphibians from Laurasia and North Africa. Extensive series of
   albanerpetontid bones recently identified in collections from the
   Csarnota 2 locality, south-central Hungary, extend the temporal range of
   the clade forward about seven million years from the middle Miocene to
   the early Pliocene. The Hungarian material is diagnostic for the
   Euramerican type genus Albanerpeton and pertains to a new species, A.
   pannonicus sp. nov., which differs from the seven previously reported
   congeners (Early Cretaceous-Miocene) in a distinctive combination of
   primitive and derived character states of the jaws and frontals,
   including a unique ventromedian keel on the azygous frontals. Some of
   the Hungarian specimens are articulated sets of skull bones, including
   ones containing the first three-dimensional examples of a nasal and
   jugals known for albanerpetontids, that help clarify some details of
   cranial osteology in these amphibians. Cladistic analysis nests A.
   pannonicus within the robust-snouted clade, as the sister taxon to an
   unnamed late Palaeocene species from Canada and A. inexpectatum from
   early-middle Miocene deposits in France, Austria and Germany. This
   phylogeny and recent reports of diagnostic Albanerpeton material from
   the Campanian of France and Maastrichtian of Romania suggest the
   evolutionary history of Albanerpeton was more complex than previously
   hypothesized, with Europe having played a larger role. The 25
   fossiliferous layers at Csarnota 2 record a shift from forest to
   grassland palaeoenvironments. Fossils of A. pannonicus are present in
   all layers, implying that this species was not adversely affected by the
   change in palaeoenvironments.}},

   where the sensors are allowed to collaborate, we consider three coding
   schemes for reliable transmission: spreading code independent, spreading
   code dependent transmission and coding across sensors. These schemes are
   compared in terms of achievable rates and random coding error exponents.
   The coding across sensors scheme has comparable achievable rates to the
   spreading code dependent scheme, but requires the additional
   transmission of sensor ID. However, the scheme does not require the
   mobile AP to send data through the beacon unlike the other two schemes.
   The use of these coding schemes to overcome sensitivity is demonstrated
   through simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Briefly presented arrows, made indistinguishable by masks that contain
   arrows, inversely prime responses to following visible arrows. This
   inverse effect might reflect general regularities of masked priming or
   be either due to the task-relevant elements of the mask or to special
   features of arrows. Here we report a slow negative EEG potential
   recorded from the scalp above the visual cortex, which is evoked by
   masks that contain arrows. Even being evoked when arrows masks were
   presented in isolation, this ``Nd-mask{''} appeared to be an obligatory
   response. Yet Nd-mask was enhanced when primes and targets were arrows
   and was reduced in the other cases, and even reversed its polarity with
   appropriate control stimuli. These findings provide support both for the
   special status of arrows and for the notion of mask relevance. Nd-mask
   might be one instance of negative EEG potentials evoked by stimuli with
   familiar gestalts.}},

Abstract = {{Background A number of studies have reported increased violence in
   patients with schizophrenia.
   Aims To determine the prevalence of violence among those with
   schizophrenia in samples from 1949,1969,1989 and 2000 in Prague (Czech
   Republic) and to examine trends in this behaviour.
   Method Records from 404 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for
   schizophrenia were screened for violence (defined as 3 points on the
   Modified Overt Aggression Scale) from the first observed psychotic
   symptoms until the time of latest available information.
   Results Logistic regression revealed a marginally significant increase
   in violence only in the 2000 cohort. Overall, violence was associated
   with schizophrenia in 41.8\% of men and 32.7\% of women, with no
   association between substance misuse and violence.
   Conclusions The violence rate found in our sample is expected to remain
   stable over time under stable conditions. Substance misuse is not the
   leading cause of violence among those with schizophrenia.

Abstract = {{Background: The Veterans Administration is an ideal setting for
   multisite studies; however, individual VA Institutional Review Board
   (IRB) approval is necessary. This study examines the burden of multisite
   IRB approval on a Health Services Research and Development (HSRD)
   ventral hernia outcomes observational study.
   Methods: Data gathered on the IRB process per site included time
   required for application completion, staff training and compliance, IRB
   affiliation (VA or university), approval status, and time to IRB
   approval. Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to determine differences in
   median times for application completion and approval. Financial and
   temporal expenses were calculated.
   Results: Significant differences were found in median time to complete
   applications by IRB affiliation (P <.01) and median time to approval by
   changes required to the consent letter (P <.05).
   Conclusions: The IRB process for a multisite observational study is
   expensive in both time and money. A VA national IRB for multisite
   studies would significantly decrease the financial and temporal burden
   for observational Studies. (c) 2005 Excerpta Medica Inc. All fights

Abstract = {{STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of recurrence of deep
   endometriosis after conservative surgery.
   DESIGN: Retrospective analysis (Canadian Task Force classification
   II-3). SETTING: Tertiary care university hospital.
   PATIENTS: One hundred fifteen symptomatic patients operated on in our
   department from 1996 through 2002 with postoperative follow-up of at
   least 12 months.
   INTERVENTION: All patients underwent conservative surgery for deep
   infiltrating endometriosis.
   MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: Risk factors for recurrence of symptoms
   and clinical findings and for repeated surgery were evaluated by
   univariate and multivariate analysis. During follow-up, we observed 28
   patients with pain recurrence and 15 patients with recurrent clinical
   findings, and 12 patients required reoperation for deep endometriosis.
   Recurrence rates of pain and clinical findings during 36 months were
   20.5\% and 9\%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that only age
   was a significant predictor of pain recurrence (OR 0.9, 95\% Cl
   0.81-0.99, p <.05), enhancing the risk in younger patients. Recurrence
   of clinical signs of deep endometriosis was predicted by obliteration of
   the pouch of Douglas (OR 1.46, 95\% Cl 1.16-16.2, p <.05). Reoperation
   for deep endometriosis was predicted only by the incompleteness of first
   operation (OR 21.9, 95\% Cl 3.2-146.5, p <.001).
   CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that age, obliteration of the pouch of
   Douglas, and surgical completeness may have a significant influence on
   the recurrence of the disease. (c) 2005 AAGL. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A very close relationship between the compaction, retraction, and
   constraint satisfaction problems has been established earlier providing
   evidence that it is likely to be difficult to give a complete
   computational complexity classification of the compaction and retraction
   problems for reflexive or bipartite graphs. In this paper, we give a
   complete computational complexity classification of the compaction and
   retraction problems for all graphs (including partially reflexive
   graphs) with four or fewer vertices. The complexity classification of
   both the compaction and retraction problems is found to be the same for
   each of these graphs. This relates to a long-standing open problem
   concerning the equivalence of the compaction and retraction problems.
   The study of the compaction and retraction problems for graphs with at
   most four vertices has a special interest as it covers a popular open
   problem in relation to the general open problem. We also give complexity
   results for some general graphs. The compaction and retraction problems
   are special graph colouring problems, and can also be viewed as
   partition problems with certain properties. We describe some practical
   applications also. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   The fibres were chemically treated with chlorine/Hercosett resin and

   of the chemical treatments and the root-mean-square roughness of

   chlorine/Hercosett resin tended to cause formation of etch holes (in the
   absence of resin), which closed up when resin was added. In contrast,
   etching with Caro's acid/ Wacker resin caused no hole formation and
   otherwise the two treatments similarly affected the fibre cuticle
   morphology and therefore its shrink-resist properties. We recommend that
   the less environmentally polluting Caro's acid/Wacker resin combination
   be used to replace the traditionally used chlorine/Hercosett resin in
   the shrinkproofing of wool fibres, because the latter contaminates

Abstract = {{This report shows the PCR-based identification of the eight known self-
   (in)compatibility alleles (S, to S, and S,) of apricot (Prunus
   arineniaca L.). Two sets of consensus primers, designed from P.
   armeniaca S-RNase genomic sequences and sweet cherry (P. avium L.)
   S-RNase-cDNAs, were used to amplify fragments containing the first and
   the second S-RNase intron, respectively. When the results obtained from
   the two PCRs were combined, all S-alleles could be distinguished. The
   identity of the amplified S-alleles was verified by sequencing the first
   intron and 135 base pairs (bp) of the second exon. The deduced amino
   acid sequences of these fragments showed the presence of the C1 and C2
   Prunus L. S-RNase conserved regions. These results allowed us to confirm
   S-genotypes previously assigned by stylar ribonuclease analyses and to
   propose one self- (in)compatibility group (1) and one universal donor
   group (0) containing unique S-genotypes and self-compatible cultivars
   (SC). This PCR-based typing system also facilitates the identification
   of the S-c-allele and might be a very useful tool for predicting
   self-compatibility in apricot breeding progenies.}},

   1-Chloro-4-naphthol and 1-chloronaphthoic acid are discussed as possible
   indicators for anaerobic degradation processes. Results of inorganic and
   compound specific stable carbon isotope analyses revealed only a minor
   degree of microbiological transformation. Thus, sorption was
   characterized as the main attenuation process within the aquifer
   affecting the contamination described. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Exposure to ultrafine particles (UFPs) from vehicle exhaust has been
   related to risk of cardiovascular and pulmonary disease and cancer, even
   though exposure assessment is difficult. We studied personal exposure in
   terms of number concentrations of UFPs in the breathing zone, using
   portable instruments in six 18-hr periods in 15 healthy nonsmoking
   subjects. Exposure contrasts of outdoor pollution were achieved by
   bicycling in traffic for 5 days and in the laboratory for I day.
   Oxidative DNA damage was assessed as strand breaks and oxidized purines
   in mononuclear cells isolated from venous blood the morning after
   exposure measurement. Cumulated outdoor and cumulated indoor exposures
   to UFPs each were independent significant predictors of the level of
   purine oxidation in DNA but not of strand breaks. Ambient air
   concentrations of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of <=
   10 mu m (PM10), nitrous oxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and/or
   number concentration of UFPs at urban background or busy street
   monitoring stations was not a significant predictor of DNA damage,
   although personal UFP exposure was correlated with urban background
   concentrations of CO and NO2, particularly during bicycling in traffic.
   The results indicate that biologic effects of UFPs occur at modest
   exposure, such as that occurring in traffic, which supports the
   relationship of UFPs and the adverse health effects of air pollution.}},

Abstract = {{How do honeybees use visual odometry and goal-defining landmarks to
   guide food search? In one experiment, bees were trained to forage in an
   optic-flow-rich tunnel with a landmark positioned directly above the
   feeder. Subsequent food-search tests indicated that bees searched much
   more accurately when both odometric and landmark cues were available
   than when only odometry was available. When the two cue sources were set
   in conflict, by shifting the position of the landmark in the tunnel
   during test, bees overwhelmingly used landmark cues rather than
   odometry. In another experiment, odometric cues were removed by training
   and testing in axially striped tunnels. The data show that bees did not
   weight landmarks as highly as when odometric cues were available,
   tending to search in the vicinity of the landmark for shorter periods. A
   third experiment, in which bees were trained with odometry but without a
   landmark, showed that a novel landmark placed anywhere in the tunnel
   during testing prevented bees from searching beyond the landmark
   location. Two further experiments, involving training bees to relatively
   longer distances with a goal-defining landmark, produced similar results
   to the initial experiment. One caveat was that, with the removal of the
   familiar landmark, bees tended to overshoot the training location,
   relative to the case where bees were trained without a landmark. Taken
   together, the results suggest that bees assign appropriate significance
   to odometric and landmark cues in a more flexible and dynamic way than
   previously envisaged.}},

Abstract = {{The history of the development of potentiometric sensors over the past
   century demonstrates progress in constructing single, discrete (i.e.,
   separate, to distinguish from sensor arrays) ion sensors, which have
   been made as selective as possible. Only a few types reveal high
   selectivity. However, easy measurement procedure, with low cost and
   availability, give rise to the search for new ways for their successful
   application. The present document describes a new concept for
   application of potentiometric multisensor systems, viz., sensor arrays
   for solution analysis, and the performance of this new analytical
   tool-the ``electronic tongue{''}. The electronic tongue is a multisensor
   system, which consists of a number of low-selective sensors and uses
   advanced mathematical procedures for signal processing based on the
   pattern recognition (PARC) and/or multivariate analysis {[}artificial
   neural networks (ANNs), principal component analysis (PCA), etc.].
   Definitions of the multisensor systems and their parameters are
   suggested. Results from the application of the electronic tongue, both
   for quantitative and qualitative analysis of different mineral water and
   wine samples, are presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A frequently stated advantage of fractional-factorial (FF) designs over
   one-factor-at-a-time (1FAT) designs is their high relative efficiency.
   We study k-factor, 2k-run designs, where k is a power of 2 or is
   divisible by 4, for which the usually stated relative efficiency is k in
   favor of the resolution IV FF design over an orthogonal 1FAT design. We
   examine other ways to measure efficiency under main-effects-only
   modeling in the case when all factors are quantitative, which enables
   rescaling of their settings. If both designs are restricted to lie in
   smallest-sized hypercubes or hyperspheres of equal volume, then the
   relative efficiency of the FF design is 1 under the full model (k
   effects active). We also show that the designs are identical in an
   important sense: The 1FAT design can be rescaled and rotated to become a
   resolution IV FF design. The primary advantage of the FF design lies in
   its projection properties; if at most k' factors are expected to be
   active, then, under equal-volume designs, the efficiency of the FF is at
   least k/k'. Next, taking a size-of-effects-based approach, we rescale
   the FF by restricting the design to have the same probability as a 1FAT
   design of producing too-large swings in the response (i.e., swings that
   produce unusable runs). Here the efficiency of the FF usually remains
   greater than 1, but it can reach 1/k in the limit. We show how these
   ideas may be used to help scale back originally planned settings in a
   fractional factorial design to reduce the chance of unusable runs while
   still maintaining the other advantages of FF designs.}},

Abstract = {{Much recent research has found that states generally comply with the
   treaties they sign. The implications of this finding, however, are
   unclear: do states comply because the legal commitment compels them to
   do so, or because of the conditions that led them to sign? Drawing from
   previous research in this Review on Article VIII of the IMF Treaty
   (Simmons 2000a), I examine the problem of selection bias in the study of
   treaty compliance. To understand how and whether international legal
   commitments affect state behavior, one must control for all sources of
   selection into the treaty-including those that are not directly
   observable. I develop a statistical method that controls for such
   sources of selection and find considerable evidence that the
   unobservable conditions that lead states to make the legal commitment to
   Article VIII have a notable impact on their propensity to engage in
   compliant behavior. The results suggest that the international legal
   commitment has little constraining power independent of the factors that
   lead states to sign.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Various preparative protocols have been proposed for the
   acquisition and cultivation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Whereas
   surface antigen markers have failed to precisely define this population,
   microarray analysis might provide a better tool for characterization of
   MSC.
   Methods. In this study, we have analyzed global gene expression profiles
   of human MSC isolated from adipose tissue (AT), from umbilical cord
   blood (CB), and from bone marrow (BM) under two growth conditions and
   have compared them to terminally differentiated human fibroblasts
   (HS68). Profiles were compared using our Human Genome Microarray
   representing 51.144 different cDNA clones.
   Results. Cultured with the appropriate conditions, osteogenic and
   adipogenic differentiation could be confirmed in all MSC preparations
   but not in fibroblasts. No phenotypic differences were observed by flow
   cytometry using a panel of 22 surface antigen markers. Whereas MSC
   derived from different donors using the same culture procedure yielded a
   consistent and reproducible gene expression profile, many genes were
   differentially expressed in MSC from different ontogenetic sources or
   from different culture conditions. Twenty-five genes were overlapping
   and upregulated in all MSC preparations from AT, CB, and BM as compared
   to HS68 fibroblasts. These genes included fibronectin, ECM2, glypican-4,
   ID1, NF1B, HOXA5, and HOXB6. Many genes upregulated in MSC are involved
   in extracellular matrix, morphogenesis, and development, whereas several
   inhibitors of the Wnt pathway (DKK1, DKK3, SFRP1) were highly expressed
   in fibroblasts.
   Conclusion. Our results have provided a foundation for a more
   reproducible and reliable quality control using genotypic analysis for
   defining MSC. (c) 2005 International Society for Experimental

Abstract = {{Ascaphus truei Stejneger, 1899 relies on cool, fast-flowing, forested
   mountain streams, which receive little protection from logging
   activities. During recovery of post-logging habitats, local extirpation
   of Ascaphus is a concern because their recolonization may be slow. In
   British Columbia, Oregon, and California, coastal Ascaphus populations
   are designated as ``at risk{''}. To infer fragmentation impacts from
   patterns of genetic structure, we used RAPD molecular markers and
   compared population genetic structures of Ascaphus larvae in an old
   growth with an adjacent clearcut stream located in coastal British
   Columbia. In the clearcut, larvae were less genetically diverse than in
   the old growth and exhibited no relationship between physical distance
   and genetic relatedness, whereas in the old growth, genetic similarity
   decreased with physical distance. Patterns of gene flow between the
   clearcut and old-growth streams were significantly different. The
   clearcut population went through a bottleneck/founding event, but also
   exhibited greater dispersal. The frogs were perhaps searching for new
   habitat (which would lower isolation by distance) and suffering
   mortality (which would decrease diversity). Most problems in
   conservation will require genetic and ecological data, and future
   research should aim to incorporate methodologies from both fields.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical models of cognitive mechanisms assumed to be involved in
   recurrent depression are discussed and a cognitive battle process
   between compensatory coping strategies and the automatic processing of
   negative information is suggested. Preliminary support for the model
   comes from a study that investigated preferences for positive and
   negative tape-recorded self-statements in clinically depressed (CD),
   previously depressed (PD) and never depressed (ND) individuals. The
   results showed (1) a positive correlation between dysfunctional
   attitudes and dysphoric symptoms in CDs and PDs, but not in NDs; (2) NDs
   preferred positive self-statements, whereas CDs preferred neither
   positive nor negative self-statements; (3) PDs exhibited different
   patterns of preference depending on the levels of dysfunctional
   attitudes and dysphoric symptoms. For example, simultaneous high levels
   of both dysfunctional attitudes and dysphoric symptoms in PDs resulted
   in a preference for positive self-statements. This finding is discussed
   as a possible compensatory strategy of avoiding negative information in
   PDs. Clinical implications for treatment and prevention of depression
   are discussed. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Background Epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) play an important role in
   cutaneous immunological reactions. Freshly obtained or intraepidermal
   LCs are incapable of activating autologous naive T cells. However, when
   they are cultured for 2-3 days, LCs are able to activate autologous T
   cells. It has been proposed that haptoglobin (Hp) is the inhibitor that
   prevents LC functional transformation in the skin. Abundant Hp has been
   found in the cytoplasm of epidermal LCs. However, the source of Hp in
   LCs has not been addressed.
   Objectives To determine the expression of Hp in epidermal cells, and to
   provide evidence that there is a functional relationship between LCs and
   keratinocytes (KCs) through Hp.
   Methods Normal human epidermal cells and HaCaT cells were used for
   detection of Hp mRNA by in situ hybridization and reverse
   transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and Hp protein by
   immunohistochemical staining, immunofluorescence counterstaining and
   Western blotting.
   Results Hp mRNA was expressed in normal human KCs and HaCaT cells, but
   not in normal human epidermal LCs. Hp protein was detected by
   immunohistochemical staining and immunofluorescence counterstaining in
   CD1a+ epidermal dendritic cells (LCs), but not in KCs. Hp protein was
   weakly expressed by HaCaT cells.
   Conclusions Hp mRNA is present in normal human KCs and HaCaT cells,
   suggesting that they have the potential to synthesize Hp protein. Normal
   human epidermal LCs are unable to synthesize Hp protein by themselves,
   although they have abundant Hp protein in their cytoplasm. It is likely
   that LCs acquire Hp through an exogenous pathway.}},

   Firstly, linear stability of the model is investigated by analyzing the

   According to the analysis results, the bifurcation diagram is drawn in

   occurs when the delay passes through a sequence of critical values. Then
   the explicit algorithm for determining the direction of the Hopf
   bifurcations and the stability of the bifurcating periodic solutions are
   derived, using the theory of normal form and center manifold. Finally,

Abstract = {{To investigate the measurement of free glutathione of both reduced or
   oxidized (i.e. GSH and GSSG) in plasma, and to evaluate the redox state
   of GGSH/GSSG in human plasma, both GSH and GSSG in plasma were measured
   by fluorophotometry based on the facts that one molar GSSG can be
   reduced to two molar GSH by dithiothreitol(DTT) under the condition of
   the pH being about 6.0, and GSH can provide both primary amine and thiol
   groups to react with the two carbonyl groups of O-phthaldehyde(OPA) to
   form a fluorescent ternary isoindole complex at pH 8.0. This method can
   at least measure 16 picomole GSH and 8 picomole GSSG respectively in the
   tube. The variation coefficient (CV) for intra-ssay and intera-ssay is
   about 4..6\% and 3.9\% for GSH and 3.5\% and 4.1\% for GSSG
   respectively. The recovery of GSH and GSSG added to the plasma is
   (99.77\% +/- 5.70)\% and (99.28\% +/- 4.73)\% respectively. The
   concentration of GSH and GSSG in the plasma of young healthy volunteer
   is (16.5 +/- 2.4)nmol(.)mL(-1) and (1.7 +/- 0.35) nmol(.)mL(-1)
   respectively, without significant difference between male and female.
   This measurement method is simple with great sensitivity and selectivity
   for rapid measuring GSH and GSSG in human plasma simultaneously.}},

Abstract = {{The electroless deposition of Ni-68-Fe-10.5-P-21.5 alloy has been

Abstract = {{The antennal lobe (AL) is the first center for processing odors in the
   insect brain, as is the olfactory bulb (OB) in vertebrates. Both the AL
   and the 013 have a characteristic glomerular structure; odors sensed by
   olfactory receptor neurons are represented by patterns of glomerular
   activity. Little is known about when and how an odor begins to be
   perceived in a developing brain. We address this question by using
   calcium imaging to monitor odor-evoked neural activity in the ALs of
   bees of different ages. We find that odor-evoked neural activity already
   occurs in the ALs of bees as young as I or 2 days. In young bees, the
   responses to odors are relatively weak and restricted to a small number
   of glomeruli. However, different odors already evoke responses in
   different combinations of glomeruli. In mature bees, the responses are
   stronger and are evident in more glomeruli, but continue to have
   distinct odor-dependent signatures. Our findings indicate that the
   specific glomerular patterns for odors are conserved during the
   development, and that odor representations are fully developed in the AL
   during the first 2 weeks following emergence. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents a technique for exploiting input statistics
   for,energy and performance optimization of embedded software. The
   proposed technique is based on the fact that the computational
   complexities of programs or subprograms are often highly dependent on
   the values assumed by input and intermediate program variables during
   execution. This observation is exploited in the proposed software
   synthesis technique by augmenting the program with optimized versions of
   one or more subprograms that are specialized to, and executed under,
   specific input subspaces. We propose a methodology for input
   space-adaptive software synthesis that consists of the following steps:
   1) control and value profiling of the input program; 2) application of
   compiler transformations in a preprocessing step; 3) identification of
   subprograms and corresponding input subspaces that hold the highest
   potential for optimization; and 4) an iterative application of known
   compiler transformations to realize performance and energy savings. We
   propose novel metrics based on the entropies of program variables to
   characterize subprograms and input subspaces that hold significant
   potential for optimization. The chosen subprograms are optimized by
   translating the input subspaces into value constraints on their
   variables, and iteratively applying known compiler transformations (that
   were not applicable in the context of the original program). We have
   evaluated input space-adaptive software synthesis by compiling the
   resulting optimized programs to two commercial embedded systems: an
   embedded system based on the Fujitsu SPARClite processor, and the Compaq
   iPAQ personal digital assistant (PDA) {[}64 MB memory, 206 MHz Intel
   StrongARM central processing unit (CPU)]. The energy and execution-time
   savings were calculated using energy-aware instruction-level simulators,
   as well as through direct-current measurement on the iPAQ. Our results
   demonstrate that the proposed technique can reduce energy by up to
   54.5\% (average of 30.6\% and 25.6\% for the SPARClite-based system and
   the iPAQ, respectively) while simultaneously improving performance by up
   to 59.6\% (average of 31.3\% and 31.5\% for the SPARClite-based system
   and the iPAQ, respectively). In effect, improvements in the energy-delay
   product of up to 81.1\% (average of 51.0\% and 47.7\% for the
   SPARClite-based system and the iPAQ, respectively) were observed. The
   energy savings resulting from our technique are, fairly processor
   independent, and complementary to conventional compiler optimizations.}},

Abstract = {{Metastasis is the major cause of prostate cancer deaths and there is a
   need for clinically relevant in vivo models allowing elucidation of
   molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying metastatic behavior. Here
   we describe the development of a new in vivo model system for metastatic
   prostate cancer. Pieces of prostate cancer tissue from a patient were
   grafted in testosterone-supplemented male NOD-SCID mice at the subrenal
   capsule graft site permitting high tumor take rates. After five serial
   transplantations, the tumor tissues were grafted into mouse prostates.
   Resulting tumors and suspected metastatic lesions were subjected to
   histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. Samples of
   metastatic tissue were regrafted in mouse anterior prostates and their
   growth and spread examined, leading to isolation from lymph nodes of a
   metastatic subline, PCa1-met. Orthotopic grafting of PCa1-met tissue in
   47 hosts led in all cases to metastases to multiple organs ( lymph
   nodes, lung, liver, kidney, spleen and, notably, bone).
   Histopathological analysis showed strong similarity between orthotopic
   grafts and their metastases. The latter were of human origin as
   indicated by immunostaining using antibodies against human mitochondria,
   androgen receptor, prostate-specific antigen and Ki-67. Spectral
   karyotyping showed few chromosomal alterations in the PCa1-met subline.
   This study indicates that transplantable subrenal capsule xenografts of
   human prostate cancer tissue in NOD-SCID mice can, as distinct from
   primary cancer tissue, be successfully grown in the orthotopic site.
   Orthotopic xenografts of the transplantable tumor lines and metastatic
   sublines can be used for studying various aspects of metastatic prostate
   cancer, including metastasis to bone.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes two space-time joint channel parameter estimation
   and signal detection algorithms for downlink DS-CDMA systems with
   multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) wireless multipath fading
   channels. The proposed algorithms initially use the space-time MUSIC to
   estimate the DOA-delays of the multipath channel. Based on these
   estimated DOA-delays, a space-time channel decoupler is developed to
   decompose the multipath downlink channel into a set of independent
   parallel subchannels. The fading amplitudes of the multipath can then be
   estimated from the eigen space of the output of the space-time channel
   decoupler. With these estimated channel parameters, signal detection is
   carried out by a maximal ratio combiner on a pathwise basis. Computer
   simulations show that the proposed algorithms outperform the
   conventional space-time RAKE receiver while having the similar
   performance compared with the space-time minimum mean square error
   receiver.}},

Abstract = {{While the usefulness of measuring the plasma levels of brain natriuretic
   peptide (BNP) in cases with worsening heart failure and severe heart
   failure has already been established, the benefits of evaluation of this
   parameter in asymptomatic stable patients with left ventricular
   dysfunction is still under debate. Left ventricular function was
   evaluated in 141 ambulatory outpatients with a previous history of
   myocardial infarction not associated with symptoms of heart failure for
   at least one year. The plasma BNP level was also determined in these
   patients for comparative study. No correlation between the plasma level
   of BNP and EF was noted in the normal-EF group, while a negative
   correlation between the two parameters was observed in the low-EF group
   (Y = 0.439 - 0.000266X) (R2 = 0.244, P < 0.0001). The sensitivity was
   91.5\%, specificity 56.3\%, positive predictive accuracy value 61.9\%,
   and negative predictive accuracy value 83.8\% for a plasma BNP cut-off
   level of 89.0 pg/mL.
   The results suggested that it might be meaningful to measure the plasma

Abstract = {{Mutants of the Micromonospora viridifaciens sioalidase, Y370E and Y370F
   are catalytically active retaining enzymes that operate by different
   mechanisms. Previous substitutions with smaller amino acids, including
   Y370D, yielded inverting sialidases. At least one water molecule can fit
   into the active-site cavity of this mutant and act as a nucleophile from
   the face opposite the leaving group (Biochemistry 2003, 42, 72682).
   Thus, addition of a CH2 unit (Asp versus Glu) changes the mechanism from
   inversion back to retention of configuration. Based on Bronsted values,
   it is proposed that the Y370E mutant reacts by a double-displacement
   mechanism (beta(lg), on k(cat)/K-m-0.36 +/- 0.04) with Glu370 acting as
   the nucleophile. However, the Y370F mutant (beta(lg), on k(cat)/K-m.
   -0.79 +/- 0.12) reacts via a dissociative transition state. The crystal
   structure of the Y370F mutant complexed with
   2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid shows no significant
   active-site perturbation relative to the wild-type enzyme.}},

Abstract = {{The expression and report of pain is influenced by social environment
   and culture. Previous studies have suggested ethnically determined
   differences in report of pain threshold, intensity and affect. The
   influence of ethnic differences between White British and South Asians
   has remained unexplored. Twenty age-matched, male volunteers in each
   group underwent evaluation. Cold and warm perception and cold and heat
   threshold were assessed using an ascending method of limits. Magnitude
   estimation of pain unpleasantness and pain intensity were investigated
   with thermal stimuli of 46, 47, 48 and 49 degrees C. Subjects also
   completed a pain anxiety questionnaire. Data was analysed using t-test,
   Mann-Whitney and repeated measures analysis of variance as appropriate.
   There were no differences in cold and warm perception between the two
   groups. There was a statistically significant difference between the two
   groups for heat pain threshold (P = 0.006) and heat pain intensity
   demonstrated a significant effect for ethnicity (F = 13.84, P = 0.001).
   Although no group differences emerged for cold pain threshold and heat
   unpleasantness, South Asians demonstrated lower cold pain threshold and
   reported more unpleasantness at all temperatures but this was not
   statistically significant. Our study shows that ethnicity plays an
   important role in heat pain threshold and pain report, South Asian males
   demonstrated lower pain thresholds and higher pain report when compared
   with matched White British males. There were no differences in pain
   anxiety between the two groups and no correlations were identified
   between pain and pain anxiety Haemodynamic measures and anthropometry
   did not explain group differences. (c) 2005 International Association

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the
   mortality and morbidity for extremely preterm infants with a gestational
   age from 22 to 26 weeks. All infants were born in Austria during the
   years 1999-2001.
   Methods: Data were collected from 16 neonatal intensive care units in
   Austria.
   Main outcome criteria: Mortality, the rates of chronic lung disease
   (CLD) and severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP >= stage 3) to
   determine the short-term outcome; the rate of cerebral palsy (CP) at the
   corrected age of twelve months to assess the long-term outcome.
   Results: Overall, 796 preterm infants with a gestational age less than
   27 weeks were born in Austria and 581 (73\%) were registered as
   live-born infants. Of those live born, 508 (87\%) were analyzed.
   The mortality rates were 83\%, 76\%, 43\%, 26\% and 13\% for 22, 23, 24,
   25 and 26 weeks' gestation, respectively. The rates of CLD were 33\% (22
   weeks), 36\% (23 weeks), 42\% (24 weeks), 31\% (25 weeks) and 22\% (26
   weeks). The rates of ROP a stage 3 were 0\% (22 weeks), 29\% (23weeks),
   23\% (24weeks), 18\% (25 weeks) and 10\% (26 weeks).
   The rates of CP at the corrected age of 12 months were 33\%, 50\%, 33\%,
   26\% and 25\% for 22, 23, 24, 25 and 26 weeks' gestation, respectively.
   Conclusions: The results of this national study are in accordance with
   the international literature: mortality and morbidity increased with
   decreasing gestational age.}},

Abstract = {{To answer the question whether Hordeum spontaneum K. Koch. and Hordeum
   vulgare L. are conspecific taxonomic entities or not{''}, we carried out
   an investigation with amplified restriction fragment length polymorphism
   (AFLP (TM)) using H. vulgare cultivars, H. spontaneum from the Fertile
   Crescent, and material from China, primarily Xizang (Tibet), containing
   landraces and accessions identified morphologically as Hordeum
   agriocrithon angstrom berg. and H. spontaneum. Population genetic
   analyses and discriminant analyses were based on three groupings, H.
   vulgare, H. spontaneum, and H. agriocrithon, determined from morphology.
   To independently find groups, cluster analyses were carried out followed
   by population-genetic analyses and discriminant analyses of the
   clusters. The results of population-genetic analyses of morphologically
   based groups were not very different from those of comparable analyses
   of groups inferred from clustering. Based on 795 AFLP bands scored on
   506 individuals, genetic diversity was 30\% higher within H. spontaneum
   than within H. agriocrithon or H. vulgare. The variation among the three
   entities was 27.3\% (F-CT = 0.27) and among populations within the three
   was 40.4\% (F-SC = 0.56) leaving 32.3\% (F-ST = 0.68) within
   populations/accessions. Three entities were clearly defined by
   clustering and supported by discriminant analyses, and then
   nomenclaturally formulated, two as species and one as an interspecific
   hybrid. The first, H. spontaneum, comprises populations in the Near
   East, the second, H. vulgare, comprises the cultivars, and the third, H.
   xagriocrithon, comprises all barley landraces and hybrids from China as
   well as hybrids from the Near East. We discuss evolutionary perspectives
   of speciation and conclude that barley cultivars form a species distinct
   from the wild progenitor, H. spontaneum. This analysis may highlight the
   dilemma regarding other cultivated plants and domesticated animals, a
   still unresolved evolutionary-taxonomic problem.}},

Abstract = {{Confined water is of considerable current interest owing to its
   biophysical importance and relevance to cryopreservation. It can be
   studied in its amorphous or supercooled state in the ``no-man's
   land{''}, i.e., in the temperature range between 150 and 235 K, in which
   bulk water is always crystalline. Amorphous deuterium oxide (D2O) was
   obtained in the intermembrane spaces of a stack of purple membranes from
   Halobacterium salinarum by. ash cooling to 77 K. Neutron diffraction
   showed that upon heating to 200 K the intermembrane water space
   decreased sharply with an associated strengthening of ice diffraction,
   indicating that water beyond the first membrane hydration layer. owed
   out of the intermembrane space to form crystalline ice. It was concluded
   that the confined water undergoes a glass transition at or below 200 K
   to adopt an ultraviscous liquid state from which it crystallizes to form
   ice as soon as it finds itself in an unconfined, bulk-water environment.
   Our results provide model-free evidence for translational diffusion of
   confined water in the no-man's land. Potential effects of the
   confined-water glass transition on nanosecond membrane dynamics were
   investigated by incoherent elastic neutron scattering experiments. These
   revealed no differences between flash-cooled and slow-cooled samples (
   in the latter, the intermembrane space at temperatures <250 K is
   occupied only by the first membrane hydration layers), with dynamical
   transitions at 150 and 260 K, but not at 200 K, suggesting that
   nanosecond membrane dynamics are not sensitive to the state of the water
   beyond the first hydration shell at cryotemperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Diatom blooms generated by the alleviation of iron limitation in high
   nitrate-low chlorophyll (HNLC) regions of the oceans often are composed
   of pennate diatoms of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia, many of which
   periodically produce the potent neurotoxin domoic acid. We show that
   toxigenic diatoms have an inducible high-affinity iron uptake capability
   that enables them to grow efficiently on iron complexed by strong
   organic ligands in seawater. This low-iron adaptive strategy requires
   copper and domoic acid, a copper chelator whose production increases
   sharply when both iron and copper are limiting. Addition of either
   domoic acid or copper to seawater improves the growth of
   Pseudo-nitzschia spp. on strongly complexed iron during deck incubation
   experiments with natural phytoplankton. Our findings indicate that
   domoic acid is a functional component of the unusual high-affinity iron
   acquisition system of these organisms. This system may help explain why
   Pseudo-nitzschia spp. are persistent seed populations in oceanic HNLC
   regions, as well as in some neritic regions. Our findings also indicate
   that in the absence of an adequate copper supply, iron-limited natural
   populations of Pseudo-nitzschia will become increasingly toxic.}},

Journal = {{PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{169}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{928-934}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Many evidences had indicated that both salicylic acid (SA), a likely
   signal in resistance responses of plants to stresses, and phenylalanine
   ammonia-lyase (PAL; EC 4.3.1.5), a key enzyme in the phenylpropanoid
   pathway, could perform defense-related functions. However, whether to
   regulate PAL activity by SA has been to date obscure. The present
   experiment, using the technique of in vivo incubation of the grape berry
   (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon) tissue in the SA-contained
   medium, showed that SA could induce the accumulation of PAL mRNA and the
   synthesis of new PAL protein, and increase the activity. The activation
   of PAL by SA could be blocked by the pretreatments of berry tissues with
   the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, mRNA transcription
   inhibitor actinomycin D and PAL inhibitor 2-amino-2-indanophonic acid
   (AIP), respectively. These results suggest that the development of
   acquired resistance by SA previously reported may be attributed, at
   least partly, to the SA-induced PAL gene expression and activation. (c)

Abstract = {{\textbackslash{}Inorganic polyphosphate (iPoP)-linear chains of up to
   hundreds of phosphate residues-is ubiquitous in nature and appears to be
   involved in many different cellular processes. In Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae, iPoP has been detected in high concentrations, especially
   after transfer of phosphate-deprived cells to a high-phosphate medium.
   Here, the dynamics of iPoP synthesis in yeast as a function of the
   growth phase as well as glucose and phosphate availability have been
   investigated. To address this question, a simple, fast and novel method
   for the quanti. cation of iPoP from yeast was developed. Both the iPoP
   content during growth and the iPoP ``overplus'' were highest towards the
   end of the exponential phase, when glucose became limiting. Accumulation
   of iPoP during growth required excess of free phosphate, while the iPoP
   ``overplus'' was only observed after the shift from low- to
   high-phosphate medium. The newly developed iPoP quanti. cation method
   and the knowledge about the dynamics of iPoP content during growth made
   it possible to de. ne specific growth conditions for the analysis of
   iPoP levels. These experimental procedures will be essential for the
   large-scale analysis of various mutant strains or the comparison of

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to develop T-1 rho as an MR marker of the
   compositional and functional condition of cartilage. Specifically, we
   investigate the correlation of changes in cartilage biomechanical and
   biochemical properties with T-1 rho relaxation rate in a
   cytokine-induced model of degeneration. Bovine cartilage explants were
   cultured with 30 ng/mL of interleukin-1 beta to mimic the cartilage
   degradation of early osteoarthritis. The average rate of T-1 rho
   relaxation was calculated from T-1 rho maps acquired on a 4.7 T research
   scanner. Stress-relaxation biomechanical tests were conducted with a
   confined compression apparatus to measure uniaxial aggregate modulus
   (H-A) and hydraulic permeability (k(o)) using linear biphasic theory.
   Proteoglycan, collagen, and water content were measured via biochemical
   assays. Average T-1 rho relaxation rate was strongly correlated with
   proteoglycan content (R-2 = 0.926), H-A (R-2 = 0.828), and log(10) k(0)
   (R-2 = 0.862). Results of this study demonstrate that T-1 rho MRI can
   detect changes in proteoglycan content and biomechanical properties of
   cartilage in a physiologically relevant model of cartilage degeneration.
   The T-1 rho. technique can potentially be used to noninvasively and
   quantitatively assess the biochemical and biomechanical characteristics

Abstract = {{Petroleum-derived hydrocarbons continue to persist in Wild Harbor, West
   Falmouth, MA, following a spill of No. 2 fuel oil in 1969 from the barge
   Florida. Recent analysis of marsh sediments revealed that residues of
   degraded oil are present with concentrations of total petroleum
   hydrocarbons as high as similar to 9 mg g(-1). Polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs) constitute only a minor fraction of these residues
   with maximum concentrations of 134 mu g g(-1), but their fate is of
   interest because of their potential toxicity to organisms. As compared
   to typical unweathered No. 2 fuel oil, the current distribution of PAHs
   in the sediments reflects substantial weathering by abiotic and biotic
   processes, specifically a preferential loss of naphthalenes relative to
   phenanthrenes, as well as isomer-specific biodegradation of alkylated
   PAHs. Based on comparison to results from an earlier study, it appears
   that little or no change has occurred to the distribution of PAHs since
   1989, indicating that weathering at this site has stalled or is now
   proceeding at a significantly slower rate. To assess whether
   sediment-water partitioning and molecular diffusion in the interstitial
   medium are now the dominant processes controlling the vertical
   distribution of PAHs, downcore profiles were compared to a numerical
   model. While in some cases the model accurately reproduced the measured
   data, there were instances where the distribution of PAHs was slightly
   under or overestimated. Reasons for these discrepancies are discussed
   and are likely due to bioturbation, colloid-facilitated transport, or
   both. Assessment of the influence of these processes on the spilled oil
   expands our understanding of the overall fate of these compounds and
   their potential long-term effects on the environment.}},

Abstract = {{Determining the nature of root and shoot competition can elucidate the
   competitive ability of an invasive species and direct management
   strategies. In a set of competition experiments, artichoke thistle
   (Cynara cardunculus), an exotic invasive perennial forb, was subjected
   to full or shoot competition with four species: black mustard (Brassica
   nigra), an exotic annual forb; ripgut grass (Bromus diandrus), an exotic
   annual grass; purple needle-grass (Nassella pulchra), a native perennial
   grass; and itself For shoot competition, a smaller pot nested in a
   larger experimental pot sequestered the target plant root system. A bare
   ground invasion experiment, in which all plants were transplanted on the
   same date, and a community invasion experiment, in which competitor
   species were planted 1 mo before targets, were conducted. In the bare
   ground invasion experiment, target plant size was reduced (P <= 0.05)
   when exposed to full competition with the exotic species, but not purple
   needle-grass. Effects on target plants included reductions in height,
   number of leaves, rosette diameter, and shoot and leaf dry weight. In
   the community invasion experiment, full competition with all species
   reduced target plant growth (P : 0.05). Shoot competition was more
   important when all species were planted synchronously, whereas root
   competition was more important when target plant establishment was
   delayed. In a separate experiment, artichoke thistle was grown under
   four light levels simulating field conditions under canopies of the same
   competitors. Midday carbon assimilation decreased linearly with
   increased shade, indicating the likely effects of shoot competition on
   artichoke thistle. Results indicated that exotic species are more
   competitive than native purple needle-grass against artichoke thistle
   and that restoration directly to native grassland after artichoke
   thistle removal might be difficult. However, artichoke thistle seedling
   growth is reduced by root competition from grasses that emerge earlier,
   indicating that early season management of grasslands to delay artichoke
   thistle establishment might provide effective control.}},

Abstract = {{Mild hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for many diseases, including
   cardiovascular disease. We determined the effects of insulin resistance
   and of type 2 diabetes on homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism using Zucker
   diabetic fatty rats (ZDF/Gmi fa/fa and ZDF/Gmi fa/?). Plasma total Hcy
   was reduced in ZDF fa/fa rats by 24\% in the prediabetic
   insulin-resistant stage, while in the frank diabetic stage there was a
   59\% reduction. Hepatic activities of several enzymes that play a role
   in the removal of Hcy: cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), cystathionine
   gamma-lyase, and betaine:Hcy methyltransferase (BHMT) were increased as
   was methionine adenosyltransferase. CBS and BHMT mRNA levels and the
   hepatic level of S-adenosylmethionine were also increased in the ZDF
   fa/fa rats. Studies with primary hepatocytes showed that Hcy export and
   the trans-sulfuration flux in cells from ZDF fa/fa rats were
   particularly sensitive to betaine. Interestingly, liver betaine
   concentration was found to be significantly lower in the ZDf fa/fa rats
   at both 5 and 11 weeks. These results emphasize the importance of
   betaine metabolism in determining plasma Hcy levels in type 2 diabetes.}},

Volume = {{61}},

Abstract = {{The implementation of innovative medical technologies can raise
   unprecedented ethical, legal and social dilemmas. This is particularly
   so in the area of antenatal screening, which is dominated by the
   language of risk and probabilities. Second trimester serum screening for
   Down's syndrome and neural tube defects has a well-established place in
   antenatal care. Increasingly, first trimester screening with biochemical
   and ultrasound markers is being proposed as advance on this, yielding
   higher detection rates of Down's syndrome at an earlier gestational age.
   This article explores the experiences of 14 women offered innovative
   first trimester screening, which takes place within the context of a
   detailed ultrasound scan. The study is set within the UK, where recent
   policy changes mean that the offer of screening for fetal anomalies,
   particularly Down's syndrome, will become a routine part of antenatal
   care and offered to all pregnant women.
   This paper focuses on the significance of the scan in first trimester
   screening, and some of the potential dilemmas for women that can result
   from this. It then discusses the ways in which women made their
   decisions about screening, in particular, their work as `moral
   pioneers'. We found that the part played by the ultrasound scan in first
   trimester screening, particularly in relation to the higher-quality
   images now being obtained, has the potential to introduce new and novel
   ethical dilemmas for pregnant women. Although concerns have been raised
   about pregnant women viewing ultrasound scans as benign, many of the
   women reported having thought carefully through their own moral beliefs
   and values prior to screening. It seems that whatever other implications
   they may have, first trimester screening technologies will continue the
   tradition of pregnant women acting as `moral pioneers' in increasingly
   complex settings. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   The current article rejects this assessment and argues that the prison
   film can discharge several useful penal reform functions and that the
   importance of screen portrayals of prisons and prisoners has been
   understated.}},

Abstract = {{The management of clinically locally advanced prostate carcinoma (M)
   remains a controversial issue. The clinical stage cT3 consists of a
   mixture of overstaged T2 carcinomas but also contains lymph
   node-positive cases. Treatment options consist of radical prostatectomy,
   external beam radiotherapy, hormonal deprivation (early or delayed) and
   the so-called watchful waiting. In many cases multimodal therapy is
   used.
   Radical prostatectomy in the clinical stageT3 can achieve acceptable
   tumour-specific survival rates if patients are well selected. In this
   way, tumour-specific survival rates can be reached for pT3 patients
   which closely approach those of pT2 cases. In lymph node-positive cases
   after radical prostatectomy adjuvant hormonal treatment can prolong
   survival, but not in lymph node-negative cases.
   A benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy has not
   been proven. Although it can postpone or prevent biochemical recurrence,
   it does not prolong overall survival. Treatment of stage cT3 by external
   beam radiotherapy alone results in unfavourable tumour-specific survival
   rates. In these cases definite improvement can be achieved by adjuvant
   androgen deprivation with LHRH analogues. If in case of severe
   comorbidity or advanced age primary hormonal treatment is chosen, early
   vs deferred treatment seems to prolong survival marginally.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the molecular evolution of methicillin-resistant
   Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in a large metropolitan area in Germany,
   398 nonrepetitive MRSA isolates recovered from patients from various
   teaching and nonteaching hospitals in Cologne between 1984 and 1998 were
   characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). On this basis,
   95 representative isolates were selected and further investigated by
   multilocus sequence typing (MLST), spa typing, and staphylococcal
   cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing. Overall, there were 9 MLST
   types and 16 spa types. The most prevalent sequence types (STs) were
   ST239 (38\% of isolates), ST247 (29\%), and ST228 (18\%); the most
   prevalent spa types were 37 (32\%) and 51 (29\%). ST239 comprised five
   major PFGE types and various unique PFGE patterns, and ST5 comprised two
   PFGE types. While the same PFGE pattern was not observed among strains
   with different STs, spa type 37 was observed among strains representing
   two different STs (ST239 and ST241), and these belonged to the same
   clonal complex as single-locus variants. ST239 was the earliest
   predominant ST, with the highest prevalence from 1984 to 1988 (96\%),
   followed by ST247 from 1989 to 1993 (83\%) and ST228 from 1994 to 1998
   (40\%). Spa type 37 was the most prevalent from 1984 to 1988 (96\%), spa
   type 51 was the most prevalent from 1989 to 1993 (83\%), and spa types 1
   and 458 were the most prevalent from 1994 to 1998 (26\% and 14\%,
   respectively). The prevalence of SCCmec type III decreased from 96\%
   from 1984 to 1988 to 8\% from 1989 to 1993, the prevalence of SCCmec
   type 1 increased from 4\% from 1984 to 1988 to 97\% from 1989 to 1993
   and decreased to 62\% from 1994 to 1998. While the genetic diversity of
   MRSA increased from 1984 to 1998, one prevalent ST usually accounted for
   most of the isolates in a given time period.}},

Abstract = {{Laser-induced incandescence (LII) is a promising new diagnostic for
   measuring the volume fraction of elemental carbon in engine exhaust. The
   technique is considerably more precise and sensitive than conventional
   measurement procedures, and can be applied either with or without
   dilution. However, LII has been slow to gain acceptance because of
   presumed complexity of use and high initial cost. In this paper we
   demonstrate a prototype LII system that offers turn-key operation and
   long-term cost that is highly competitive with other techniques because
   of very low labor costs. The LII system ran unattended for 7.5 weeks,
   logging 1078 heavy-duty diesel engine tests during 24/7 operation of a
   dilution tunnel facility. Among the tests logged were 363 FTP
   steady-state mode tests and 250 FTP transient tests for which
   gravimetric measurements of total particulate matter (PM) were obtained.
   Of these tests, removal of the filter-based volatile matter using
   supercritical fluid extraction was performed on 142 and 147 of the
   tests, respectively. The correlation between the time-integrated LII
   signals and the dry gravimetric measurements for the steady-state mode
   tests is used to calibrate the LII measurements in mass units. This
   calibration is then used to evaluate the correlation between the LII and
   dry gravimetric measurements for the transient tests. Finally,
   time-resolved LII measurements for the steady-state mode tests are
   presented to illustrate three forms of unsteadiness that would seem
   undesirable.}},

Abstract = {{During latency, the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus genome is
   maintained as a circular episome, replicating in synchrony with host
   chromosomes. Replication requires the latency-associated nuclear antigen
   (LANA) and an origin of latent DNA replication located in the viral
   terminal repeats, consisting of two LANA binding sites (LBSs) and a
   GC-rich sequence. Here, we show that the recruitment of a LANA dimer to
   high-affinity site LBS-1 bends DNA by 57 degrees and towards the major
   groove. The cooccupancy of LBS-1 and lower-affinity LBS-2 induces a
   symmetrical bend of 110 degrees. By changing the origin architecture,
   LANA may help to assemble a specific nucleoprotein structure important
   for the initiation of DNA replication.}},

Abstract = {{The electrodeposition of lead from very alkaline media has been studied
   by cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry under stationary and convective
   conditions. Experimental parameters like lead concentration and
   temperature have been varied. From NaOH 6M the metal deposition takes
   place at about -0.90V versus SCE far from the hydrogen evolution
   reaction (HER) which is seen at -1.30V, but both processes are favoured
   by the lead content increase and the NaOH concentration decrease. The
   analyses of the chronoamperometric responses support the view of a 3D
   growth and suggest a substantial influence of lead concentration on the
   type of nucleation. Progressive nucleation is observed for the
   deposition from solutions with low content in lead but as this
   concentration increases a tendency towards instantaneous nucleation is
   revealed. The voltammetry with the rotating platinum disc electrode has
   confirmed that the lead electrodeposition is a mass transfer controlled
   process, and also allowed the estimation of diffusion coefficients. (C)

Journal = {{GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{1-18}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The Maldive Islands are often used as case studies within research into
   the impacts of potential future sea level change. Therefore, if such
   studies are to be realistic, it is important that the past and future
   variations of sea level in the islands are understood as well as
   possible. That objective led a fieldwork team to the Maldives, and
   resulted in a conclusion that sea level in the islands fell by
   approximately 30 cm during the past few decades. In the present paper,
   the suggestion of such a fall has been examined from meteorological and
   oceanographic perspectives and found to be implausible. A number of
   met-ocean data sets and regional climate indices have been examined, at
   least one of which would have been expected to reflect a large sea level
   fall without any supporting evidence being found. In particular, a
   suggestion that an increase in evaporation could have caused the fall
   has been demonstrated to be incorrect. Without any real evidence for a
   hitherto-unrecognised process which could lead to a sea level change as
   significant as that proposed by the fieldwork team, one concludes that a
   rise in sea level of approximately half a metre during the 21st century,
   as suggested by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Third
   Assessment Report, remains the most reliable scenario to employ in
   future studies of the islands. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We present ASCA SIS observations of the wind-blown bubble NGC 6888.
   Owing to the higher sensitivity of the SIS for higher energy photons
   compared to the ROSAT PSPC, we are able to detect a T similar to 8 x
   10(6) K plasma component in addition to the T similar to 1.3 x 10(6) K
   component previously detected in PSPC observations. No significant
   temperature variations are detected within NGC 6888. Garcia-Segura \&
   Mac Low's analytical models of WR bubbles constrained by the observed
   size, expansion velocity, and mass of the nebular shell underpredict the
   stellar wind luminosity and cannot reproduce simultaneously the observed
   X-ray luminosity, spectrum, surface brightness profile, and SIS count
   rate of NGC 6888's bubble interior. The agreement between observations
   and expectations from models may be improved if one or more of the
   following ad hoc assumptions are made: (1) the stellar wind luminosity
   was weaker in the past, (2) the bubble is at a special evolutionary
   stage and the nebular shell has recently been decelerated to 1 2 of its
   previous expansion velocity, and (3) the heat conduction between the hot
   interior and the cool nebular shell is suppressed. Chandra and
   XMM-Newton observations with high spatial resolution and high
   sensitivity are needed to accurately determine the physical conditions
   of NGC 6888's interior hot gas for critical comparisons with bubble

Abstract = {{We present a case of polypoid sinusitis with maxillary sinus antrolith,
   which is composed of Aspergillus species. Unlike most muddy or necrotic
   fungal balls, this first reported fungal antrolith is solid and
   extremely hard. Aspergillus served as a central fungal nidus associated
   with long-standing sinusitis, and poor sinus drainage could be a
   possible pathophysiology for the formation of a sinus stone.
   Aspergillosis infection should be considered in the differential
   diagnosis of a radiopaque paranasal sinus lesion. The endoscopic sinus
   surgery can be a reliable and minimally invasive method not only for the
   removal of the stone, but also for the restoration of ventilation and
   drainage of the diseased sinus. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Ospemifene is a new selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that is
   being developed for the treatment of urogenital atrophy and
   osteoporosis. Similarly to other SERMs, ospemifene exhibits
   antiestrogenic effects in breast tissue, which led to the hypothesis
   that it may be a potential breast cancer chemopreventive agent. We first
   assessed the ability of ospemifene, compared to tamoxifen and
   raloxifene, to prevent dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary
   tumors in female Sencar mice. Ospemifene (N = 18), tamoxifen (N = 20)
   and raloxifene (N = 17), each dosed at 50 mg/kg, were administered daily
   by oral gavage, in combination with 20 mu g DMBA for the first 6 weeks.
   Control mice (N = 2 1) received vehicle plus DMBA only for the first 6
   weeks. Daily treatment then continued for 37 weeks. As hypothesized,
   ospemifene greatly reduced the incidence of mammary carcinomas compared
   to control mice (p = 0.003), similar to tamoxifen (p = 0.0004); however,
   in the raloxifene group, no significant effect was seen in mammary tumor
   prevention (p = 0.20). A follow-up study comparing ospemifene (N = 20)
   to tamoxifen (N = 20) in the same model was then performed to confirm
   the results of the first study. The results of the follow-up study,
   which extended the treatment to 52 weeks, confirmed the results of our
   previous study, with ospemifene (p = 0.01) and tamoxifen (p = 0.004)
   significantly decreasing mammary carcinomas compared to controls. The
   results of these two studies suggest that women taking ospemifene for
   osteoporosis and/or urogenital atrophy may further benefit from
   ospemifene's breast cancer chemopreventive effects. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Ethyl (R)-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutyrate was synthesized from ethyl
   2-oxo-4-phenylbutyrate by enantioselective hydrogenation on
   Pt/gamma-Al2O3 modified by 10,11-dihydrocinchonidine. The effects of
   modifier amount, substrate concentration, hydrogen pressure and reaction
   temperature on hydrogenation rate and enantiomeric excess were
   investigated. It was found that the initial rate and enantioselectivity
   showed a maximum in a range of modifier amounts and in a range of
   substrate concentration. The reaction rate increased with the increase
   of hydrogen pressure, which almost had no effect on the
   enantioselectivity. Higher temperature could enhance the reaction rate
   remarkably, but it had adverse influence on enantiomeric excess. On the
   basis of the previous conclusions and the kinetic results in this paper,
   it was suggested that the modifier quinoline was adsorbed with its ring
   parallel to Pt surface. After protonated, the modifier interacted with
   the adsorbed substrate via si face, which led to (R)-product. Being
   different from the enantioselective hydrogenation of ethyl pyruvate, the
   competitive adsorption between modifier and substrate was obvious in
   this reaction. According to the proposed mechanism, the kinetic equation
   of enantioselective hydrogenation was obtained, it could depict the
   experimental results well.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of drug treatment of human hosts upon a population of
   schistosome parasites depend upon a variety of factors. Previous models
   have shown that multiple strains of drug-resistant parasites are likely
   to be favored as the treatment rate increases. However, such models have
   neglected to account for the complex nature of schistosome mating
   biology. To more accurately account for the biology of these parasites,
   a simple mating structure is included in a multi-strain schistosome
   model, with parasites under the influence of drug treatment of their
   human hosts. Parasites are assumed to pay a cost for drug resistance in
   terms of reduced reproduction and transmission. The dynamics of the
   parasite population are described by a system of homogeneous
   differential equations, and the existence and stability of the
   exponential solutions for this system are used to infer the impact of
   drug treatment on the maintenance of schistosome genetic diversity. (c)

Abstract = {{Objectives: The present study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and
   clinical feasibility of using monopolar stimulation with the Clarion
   Simultaneous Analog Stimulation (SAS) strategy in patients with cochlear
   implants.
   Methods: Speech recognition by 10 Clarion cochlear implant users was
   evaluated by means of 4 different speech processing strategy/electrode
   configuration combinations; ie, SAS and Continuous Interleaved Sampling
   (CIS) strategies were each used with monopolar (MP) and bipolar (BP)
   electrode configurations. The test measures included consonants, vowels,
   consonant-nucleus-consonant words, and Hearing in Noise Test sentences
   with a +10 dB signal-to-noise ratio. Additionally, subjective judgments
   of sound quality were obtained for each strategy/configuration
   combination.
   Results: All subjects but 1 demonstrated open-set speech recognition
   with the SAS/MP combination. The group mean Hearing in Noise Test
   sentence score for the SAS/MP combination was 31.6\% (range, 0\% to
   92\%) correct, as compared to 25.0\%, 46.7\%, and 37.8\% correct for the
   CIS/BP, CIS/MP, and SAS/BP combinations, respectively. Intersubject
   variability was high, and there were no significant differences in mean
   speech recognition scores or mean preference ratings among the 4
   strategy/configuration combinations tested. Individually, the best
   speech recognition performance was with the subject's everyday
   strategy/configuration combination in 72\% of the applicable cases. If
   the everyday strategy was excluded from the analysis, the subjects
   performed best with the SAS/MP combination in 37.5\% of the remaining
   cases.
   Conclusions: The SAS processing strategy with an NIP electrode
   configuration gave reasonable speech recognition in most subjects, even
   though subjects had minimal previous experience with this
   strategy/configuration combination. The SAS/MP combination might be
   particularly appropriate for patients for whom a full dynamic range of
   electrical hearing could not be achieved with a BP configuration.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: We studied the effects of biofeedback treatment on voiding and
   urodynamic parameters in children with voiding dysfunction.
   Materials and Methods: We prospectively studied 188 children between
   June 1998 and November 2003. Biofeedback was performed with a
   urodynamics processor that enables simultaneous recording of urine flow
   and electromyography, and visual display of flow/electromyography
   activity. At the beginning of the study this treatment was performed
   once weekly. After patients understood the concept and performed
   homework regularly sessions were scheduled at 3 to 4-week intervals and
   continued for 6 months. All children were evaluated at 6 months and
   again at 2 years after completing biofeedback training.
   Results: The number of the children completing biofeedback was 168
   (89.4\%). Improvement was obtained in all parameters, ranging from
   59.2\% to 87.8\% at 6 months. Maximum improvement was acquired with
   flattened voiding in 65 of 74 children (87.8\%), whereas the least
   improvement was acquired with daytime wetting in 58 of 98 children
   (59.2\%). These improvements continued at 2-year followup, and ranged
   from 53.1\% to 87.3\%. While the rate of improvement for nocturnal
   enuresis, staccato voiding, detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia,
   vesicoureteral reflux and urinary tract infection had increased, the
   remaining parameters had decreased at 2-year followup.
   Conclusions: Biofeedback training is a simple, effective and well
   tolerated treatment modality in children for various parameters
   resulting from bladder dysfunction. Motivation and willingness to
   participate in biofeedback treatment are important selection criteria.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of age-related hyperintensities of the corpus callosum has
   not been thoroughly evaluated. Fifty-two patients of 50 years of age or
   older (mean, 71 years; range, 50-87 years) were included in this study.
   Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images were obtained in three
   orthogonal planes. Periventricular hyperintensities (PVHs) and deep
   white matter hyperintensities (DWMHs) were graded according to Fazekas'
   rating scale. Correlations between the presence of hyperintensities in
   the corpus callosum and age, and the grade of PVH and DWMH were
   statistically analyzed. PVH was categorized as grade 0 (n=4), grade 1
   (n=28), grade 2 (n=10), or grade 3 (n=10). DWMH was categorized as grade
   0 (n=4), grade 1 (n=25), grade 2 (n=8), or grade 3 (n=15).
   Hyperintensity was considered present in the corpus callosum in 31 of
   the 52 patients (60\%). In these 31 patients, PVH was categorized as
   grade 1 (n=16), grade 2 (n=7), or grade 3 (n=8), while DWMH was
   categorized as grade 0 (n=1), grade 1 (n=10), grade 2 (n=7), or grade 3
   (n=13). The presence of callosal hyperintensities was significantly
   correlated with age (p=0.001), and with PVH (p=0.04) and DWMH grades
   (p=0.004). Hyperintensities may be present in the corpus callosum with
   aging, and are correlated with PVH and DWMH.}},

Abstract = {{Purification of arachiclonic acid (AA) from Mortierella alpina
   single-cell oil was attempted. The process comprised three steps: (i)
   preparation of FFA by nonselective hydrolysis of the oil with
   Alcaligenes sp. lipase; (ii) elimination of long-chain saturated FA from
   the resulting FFA by urea adduct fractionation; and (iii) enrichment of
   AA through lipase-catalyzed selective esterification with lauryl alcohol
   (LauOH). In the third step, screening of industrially available lipases
   indicated that Burkholderia cepacia lipase (Lipase-PS, Amano Enzyme
   Inc., Aichi, Japan) acted on AA more weakly than on other FA and was the
   most effective for enrichment of AA in the FFA fraction. When the FFA
   obtained by urea adduct fractionation were esterified with 2 molar
   equivalents of LauOH at 30 degrees C for 16 h in a mixture with 20\%
   water and 20 units (U)/g-mixture of Lipase-PS, the esterification
   reached 39\% and the content of AA in the FFA fraction was raised from
   61 to 86 wt\%. To further increase the content of AA, unesterified FFA
   were allowed to react again under the same conditions as those in the
   first selective esterification except for the use of 50 U/g Lipase-PS. A
   series of procedures raised the content of AA to 97 wt\% with a 49\%
   recovery based on the initial content in the single-cell oil. These
   results indicated that the three-step process for selective
   esterification with LipasePS was effective for purifying AA from the
   single-cell oil.}},

Abstract = {{A taxonomic study was carried out on a bacterial strain, designated
   KM-45(T), isolated from forest soil collected near Daejeon, South Korea.
   Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated a clear
   affiliation of this bacterium to the `Betaproteobacteria' and that it
   was related most closely to Chitinibacter tainanensis BCRC 17254 T,
   Formivibrio citricus DSM 6150(T) and lodobacter fluviatilis ATCC
   33051(T) (92(.)4, 91(.)2 and 88(.)9\% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity,
   respectively). Cells were Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, motile
   and rod-shaped. The strain grew well on R2A medium and utilized a broad
   spectrum of carbon sources. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 58
   mol\% and the predominant ubiquinone was Q-8. Major fatty acids were
   C-16:0, C(16:1)omega 7c/iso-C-15:0 2-OH, C(18:1)omega 7c/omega 9t/omega
   12t and C-17:0 cyclo. On the basis of the evidence presented, it is
   proposed that strain KM-45T should be placed in a novel genus and
   species, for which the name Silvimonas terrae gen. nov., sp. nov. is
   proposed. The type strain is KM-45T (=KCTC 12358(T)=NBRC 100961(T)).}},

Abstract = {{The Brucella melitensis 16M genome was examined for proteins in excess
   of 100 amino acids and for immunogenicity-associated genes. One subset
   of 32 annotated genes or open reading frames was identified, and each of
   these were cloned into the eukaryotic vector pcDNA3.1. Purified
   recombinant plasmids were used to intramuscularly (i.m.) immunize BALB/c
   mice. After challenge with B. melitensis 16M strain, two protective
   antigens were found: the periplasmic protein, bp26, and the chaperone
   protein, trigger factor (TIT). Protective efficacy was confirmed with
   DNA vaccines for these two B. melitensis proteins and, when combined,
   protection against wild-type challenge was significantly enhanced. Both
   proteins were found to be immunogenic since elevated serum
   immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies without a specific IgG subclass bias
   were induced subsequent to i.m. DNA immunization. Antigen-restimulation
   assays revealed that bp26 and TF stimulated gamma interferon and only
   bp26 induced interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, and IL-6 cytokines as measured
   by cytokine enzyme-linked immunospot assay. These collective results
   suggest that both bp26 and TF are excellent candidates for use in future
   vaccination studies against brucellosis.}},

   is highly active and selective to the reaction. The mechanism of
   oxidations of alcohols is inclined to oxidative dehydrogenation at low
   temperature region (< 550 K). The facets of silver are ideal versatile
   facets to activate molecular oxygen and generate oxidative, strong basic
   oxygen species (Odelta-), and weak acidic sites (Agdelta+) which can
   stabilize the organic intermediates, quickly. The facets of silver
   containing oxygen integrate several active catalytic sites existing in
   liquid-phase catalytic oxidation of alcohols and make catalytic reaction

Abstract = {{We performed the present study to identify the mutation in patients in
   Taiwan with malignant hyperthermia (MH). We also test the hypothesis
   that a denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC)
   protocol can be used for mutation detection in these patients. We
   identified five Taiwanese patients with typical clinical presentations
   of MH after general anesthesia. We also enrolled 50 healthy volunteers.
   Polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the ryanodine receptor
   (RYR1) gene mutation hot spots and DHPLC techniques were used to screen
   for mutations. Upon detection of a heterozygous elution pattern in DHPLC
   analysis, DNA sequencing reaction was performed to identify the
   nucleotide variations. We identified a RYR1 mutation in all 5 patients
   with MH. There were 4 different mutations in the 5 patients: Tyr522Cys,
   Arg552Trp, Va12168Met, and Thr2206Arg. Among the 5 patients, 2 unrelated
   patients had the same Thr2206Arg mutation. Three of the mutations had
   been reported before, but the Tyr522Cys mutation was novel. None of the
   MH-related mutations were found in the control group. In conclusion, we
   identified RYR1 mutations in 5 Taiwanese patients with MH using a
   DHPLC-based approach. A DHPLC-based genetic test may be developed as a
   noninvasive and convenient test for MH.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the study was to define the bacteriological profile and
   antibiotic resistance patterns of a burn intensive care unit (ICU) and
   to compare them with the patterns from three other hospital areas in the
   same center (ie, cardiovascular-coronary ICU, a general ICU, and the
   hospital service unit). Bacterial isolates were collected prospectively
   from the burned patients and the patients from the other hospital areas
   between May 2001 and November 2003. In the burn ICU, Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa was the isolated pathogen most frequently (40.4\%), followed
   by Staphylococcus aureus (29.3\%) and Acinetobacter spp. (9.8\%). S.
   aureus was the most common isolated pathogen in other hospital areas.
   The agents that were most effective against P. aeruginosa in the burn
   ICU were piperacillin/tazobactam and sulbactam/cefoperazon. We observed
   higher antimicrobial resistance in burn ICU than in the other hospital
   areas studied. In conclusion, bacteriological profile and antibiotic
   resistance patterns of patients in the burn ICU are significantly
   different from those in other ICUs and hospital units at our center.
   This knowledge is crucial for early treatment of infections in burned
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{Puberty has a key role in bone development. During puberty, several
   nutritional and hormonal factors play a major role in this process. The
   aim of this study was to determine the changes in areal bone mineral
   density (BMD), gonadal steroids, bone formation markers, and growth
   parameters in healthy Turkish pubertal girls and boys at different
   pubertal stages. In additional, we aimed to detect the relationship
   between BMD, sex steroids, and growth parameters, and to reveal the most
   important determinant of BMD in the pubertal period. BMD of the lumbar
   spine and total body was performed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
   (Lunar DPX series) in 174 healthy pubertal children (91 girls, 83 boys),
   aged 11-15 years. Height and weight were measured. Pubertal stages were
   assesed. Bone formation markers and gonadal steroids were measured. BMD
   values significantly increased until stage IV in girls. In boys, BMD
   values also increased during puberty (P < 0.05), but it was
   significantly higher in stage IV compared with that in other pubertal
   stages (P < 0.01). Testosterone levels increased until stage IV in both
   sexes, particularly in boys. Estrogen levels significantly increased
   during puberty in girls, whereas it was significantly higher at stage IV
   in boys (P < 0.001). Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) level was
   higher in early and midpuberty, and decreased in late puberty in girls
   (P < 0.001). BAP level was higher in stage IV in boys. Osteocalcin level
   was shown not to change significantly in pubertal stages. There was a
   modest correlation between BMD values and estrogen and testosterone
   levels in boys. In girls, there was a correlation between BMD values and
   estrogen levels only (P < 0.05). Weight was significantly associated
   with BMD in both sexes (P < 0.05). Estrogen had a significant influence
   on BMD in boys and girls. In conclusion, bone mass increased throughout
   puberty in both sexes. Peak bone mass was not achieved in girls, but was
   obtained at stage IV in boys. Bone formation markers were good
   predictors of bone mass in girls, but not in boys. Estrogen level made
   the greatest contribution to bone mineral acquisition in boys and girls.
   The achievement of peak bone mass was sustained by estrogen in boys. The
   major independent determinant of BMD in both sexes was weight.}},

Title = {{Molecular dynamics simulation of discontinuous volume phase transitions
   in highly-charged crosslinked polyelectrolyte networks with explicit
   counterions in good solvent}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{The volumetric properties of highly-charged defect-free polyelectrolyte
   networks with tetrafunctional crosslinks are studied through molecular
   dynamics simulations in the canonical ensemble. The network backbone
   monomers, which are monovalent, and the counterions, which are mono-,
   di-, or trivalent, are modeled explicitly in the simulations, but the
   solvent is treated implicitly as a dielectric medium of good solvation
   quality. The osmotic pressure of the network-solvent system is found to
   depend greatly on the strength of electrostatic interactions.
   Discontinuous volume phase transitions are observed when the
   electrostatic interactions are strong, and the onset of these
   transitions shifts to higher solvent dielectricity as the counterion
   valency increases. The roles of the various virial contributions to the
   osmotic pressure are examined. The network elasticity entropy is found
   to behave nearly classically. As the network contracts and collapses
   with increasing strength of electrostatic interactions, the loss of
   counterion entropy leads to increased counterion osmotic pressure
   contributions via two mechanisms. The reduction in available
   configurational space increases the counterion translational entropy
   contribution to the ideal part of the osmotic pressure, and the greater
   number of counterion-monomer contacts formed due to counterion
   condensation and confinement increases the counterion excluded-volume
   entropy contribution to the excess part of the osmotic pressure. These
   observations contrast the decrease in the single ideal-gas-like
   counterion translational entropy contribution to the osmotic pressure
   predicted by the counterion condensation-charge renormalization theory.
   An accompanying decrease in the total electrostatic energy balances the
   loss of counterion excluded-volume entropy as the polyelectrolyte
   networks collapse in low-dielectric solvents. This interplay between the
   electrostatic energy and the counterion excluded-volume entropy appears
   to be responsible for the discontinuous volume phase transitions that
   are observed in polyelectrolyte networks. The structure of the
   polyelectrolyte network is also found to be affine in the swollen state,
   with constituent chains nearly fully extended, and nonaffine in the
   collapsed state, with the chains adopting a Gaussian conformation.}},

Abstract = {{The microstructure and oxidation property of NbSi2/alpha-Si3N4
   nanocomposite coating formed on Nb substrate by a prior nitridation
   process followed by pack siliconizing process were investigated. The
   Nb-nitride layers formed by nitridation process at 1300 degrees C
   consisted of two layers, i.e. the outer layer of mixed nitrides of NbN
   and Nb4N3 and the inner layer of Nb2N. While the monolithic NbSi2
   coating showed the typical columnar microstructure perpendicular to the
   Nb substrate, the NbSi2/alpha-Si3N4 nanocomposite coating formed by the
   solid-state displacement reaction of the outer Nb-nitride layer with Si
   was composed of the equiaxed NbSi2 grains and the alpha-Si3N4 particles
   with the oblate-spheroidal shape, which were mostly located at the grain
   boundaries of NbSi2. The average size of equiaxed NbSi2 grains and
   alpha-Si3N4 particles were about 44-125 and 33-45 nm, respectively. The
   nanocomposite coating formed by the solid-state displacement reaction of
   the inner Nb-nitride layer with Si showed the columnar microstructure.
   The average diameters of NbSi2 grains and the alpha-Si3N4 particles were
   about 255 and 43 nm, respectively. The volume percentage of alpha-Si3N4
   particles ranged from 16.8 to 24.4\% with respect to nitrogen
   concentration in Nb-nitride layers. No cracks were observed in the
   nanocomposite coating, indicating that its thermal expansion coefficient
   was close to that of Nb substrate. The isothermal oxidation resistance
   of NbSi2/alpha-Si3N4 nanocomposite coating in 80\% Ar-20\% O-2
   atmosphere at 1100 degrees C was superior to that of monolithic NbSi2
   coating. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2005}},

Abstract = {{The aerosol direct radiative forcing (ADRF) is calculated using aerosol
   robotic network (AERONET) data, and based on aerosol categorization
   results, the global ADRF is estimated. The CRM-2.1.2, a stand-alone
   version of the radiative transfer model implemented in NCAR's community
   climate model, CCM-3.6, is used for the evaluation. A method of
   determining the aerosol optical parameters is proposed for the ADRF
   calculation using AERONET data. Linear regression in the log-log plane
   makes it possible to represent the wavelength-dependent optical
   properties in the model using AERONET measurements.
   The local ADRF is estimated at Gosan, Jeju in Korea in Spring from 2001
   to 2003, and the ground-based radiation measurements during the ACE-Asia
   IOP are used to validate the calculation. Using 3 years of AERONET data,
   the mean forcing efficiency at 500 nm at Gosan in Spring season is
   evaluated as -80.5 +/- 13.2 Wm(-2) at the surface and -29.9 +/- 4.9
   Wm(-2) at the top of atmosphere (TOA).
   The seasonal variations of the ADRF at eight AERONET sites are
   calculated from AERONET climatology data. The ADRF calculation at the
   TOA is compared with the CERES/Terra measurement, and the comparison
   verifies that the methodology used in this study is suitable for the
   global ADRF evaluation. Finally, the ADRF values in 14 regions are
   evaluated. Large ADRF values in Asia and Sahara regions suggest the
   relative importance of the aerosols on the energy budget in these
   regions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As a new alternative countermeasure to riprap for scour protection

   wire gabions. An equation for sizing of a wire gabion is proposed in
   terms of Froude number and factors reflecting both the effect and limit

Abstract = {{A closed-loop circulation system for supercritical fluids that operates

   initial loading densities, p(ini), of 550-800 kg/m(3) and density
   differences, Delta rho(eff), between heating and cooling sources of the
   loop of 62-121 kg/m(3). One-dimensional finite-difference simulation
   could predict the velocities at most conditions to within 35\%. The flow
   rates achieved in the system could be correlated in terms of Grashof and
   Prandtl numbers and a dimensionless effective density difference between
   heating and cooling sources to within 25\% and by an empirical equation
   in terms of the system pressure, loaded density and heating and cooling
   source average density difference to within 10\%. Average flow
   velocities as high as 4 m/min could be obtained with heating and cooling
   source (wall) temperature differences of 3-8 degrees C. The system

Abstract = {{The order Zoraptera (angel insects) is one of the least known insect
   groups, containing only 32 extant species. The phylogenetic position of
   Zoraptera is poorly understood, but it is generally thought to be
   closely related to either Paraneoptera (hemipteroid orders: booklice,

   phylogenetic position of Zoraptera by analyzing nuclear 18S rDNA
   sequences, which we aligned according to a secondary structure model.
   Maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses both supported a close
   relationship between Zoraptera and Dictyoptera with relatively high

Abstract = {{Nanoprobe-based lithography techniques have attracted tremendous
   interst. However, most of these techniques have the several technical
   problems still to be resolved such as low throughput, reproducibility,
   extensive processing time and tip-wear problem. We considered that a
   patterning process with a multi-array tip can be a solution. The purpose
   of this study is to build up the database in order to design a
   multi-array tip for patterning. In this study, the effects of
   tip-geometry factors (indenter shape and tip radius) and process
   parameters (pattern pitch and normal load) on the deformation behaviors
   and etching chracteristics of hard-brittle materials (Pyrex 7740 glass
   and silicon) were investigated by using both experiment and finite
   element analysis. The results of the investigation will be applied to
   the design of the multi-array tip for patterning.}},

Abstract = {{Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is one of the major serine/threonine
   protein phosphatases in the cell and plays a variety of regulatory roles
   in metabolism and signal transduction. Previously, we described the
   structure and expression of two genes encoding PP2A catalytic subunits
   (PP2Ac)-OsPP2A-1 and OsPP2A-3-in the rice plant (Yu et al. 2003). Here,
   we report the isolation and characterisation of a second structurally
   distinguishable PP2Ac subfamily comprised of three additional isogenes,
   OsPP2A-2, OsPP2A-4 (each containing ten introns) and OsPP2A-5 (which
   contains nine introns). Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the
   three isogenes are ubiquitously expressed in all rice tissues during
   plant development, and differentially expressed in response to high
   salinity and the combined stresses of drought and heat. Phylogenetic
   analyses indicated that the two PP2Ac subfamilies are descended from two
   ancient lineages, which derived from gene duplications that occurred
   after the monocotyledon-dicotyledon split. In the second subfamily, it
   is proposed that two duplication events were involved; in which, the
   initial duplication of a ten-intron primordial gene yielded OsPP2A-2 and
   the progenitor of OsPP2A-4 and OsPP2A-5. The OsPP2A-4/OsPP2A-5
   progenitor, in turn, underwent a second duplication event, resulting in
   the present day OsPP2A-4 and OsPP2A-5. It is proposed that loss of the
   5'-most intron from OsPP2A-5 occurred after these two duplication
   events.}},

Abstract = {{Conduction behaviour of n-MOSFET capacitors with an oxide thickness

   strongly depends on the low sense voltages. Conduction mechanism of the
   low voltage SILC (LV-SILC) was analysed systematically, based on the
   assumption that the LV-SILC is due to interface trap-assisted tunnelling
   (ITAT) process. Using the LV-SILC as a probe, the generation of
   interface defects was probed by the LV-SILC. Interface defects in both
   anode and cathode are involved in the ITAT process, but the former
   dominates the oxide reliability. Based on the results of interface
   defect generation sensed by the LV-SILC, a new method to project
   lifetime (T-BD) or monitor the oxide reliability was set up.}},

   single row of holes with two pitch-to-diameter ratios (p/D) of 3 and 6.
   It then presents and discusses the effects of introducing inline and

   The row spacing in the inline and staggered rows is 12.5 diameters in
   the streamwise direction. The short but engine representative hole
   length (L/D = 4) is constant for all geometries. The blowing ratio
   ranges from 0.33 to 2, and the freestream Reynolds number based on the
   freestream velocity and hole diameter (Re-D) was 8563. Both local values

   averaged value across the central hole. The current results are compared
   with the experimental results obtained by other researchers, the effects
   of the additional inline and staggered rows, and of the variations in

Abstract = {{An amperometric urea sensor is more suitable than an optical and
   potentiometric urea sensor to diagnose hyperammonemia. However, because
   sensitivity at low concentration decreases remarkably, although the
   amperometric urea sensor has been studied for a long time, it has not
   been applied for clinical diagnosis. In this paper, a new structure for
   an amperometric urea sensor is fabricatcd by electrochemical etching
   techniques. As sensor, three thin-film electrodes are patterned on
   porous silicon (PS) substrate by using platinum RF sputtering, gold and
   silver evaporation. The attachment of urease (Urs) to a
   carboxylic-terminated self-assembled monolayer (SAM) chemisorbed onto
   gold electrode was achieved by using carbodiimide coupling. The
   formation of a self-assembled chemisorbed layer of urease on gold has
   been studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Their
   electrochemical properties are characterized by the amperometry method.
   Measured sensitivity of the Urs/SAM/Au/PS electrode is ca.. 11.21 mu
   A/mMcm(2) and that of the Urs/SAM/Au/Planar Si electrode is ca. 4.39 mu
   A/mMcm(2). An about three-fold sensitivity increase is observed with the
   porous-silicon-based electrode.}},

   first provides a decision whether the system should produce part at
   make-to-stock or at make-to-order mode. The decision provided by the
   first fuzzy-logic control is then used by the second fuzzy-logic control
   to specify at what production rate the part should be produced.
   Simulation and implementation have been performed by controlling an
   unreliable machine using the developed fuzzy-logic controller. Then, the
   simulation results are compared with the simulation results given by the
   optimal control policy (hedging-point methodology). The results show
   that the performance of the developed fuzzy logic outperforms and is
   more precise than the hedging-point method under certain conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The ITER neutral beam test facility (NBTF) is planned to be built, after
   the approval of the ITER construction and the choice of the ITER site,
   with the agreement of the ITER international team and of the JA and RF
   participant teams. The key purpose is to progressively increase the
   performance of the first ITER injector and to demonstrate its
   reliability at the maximum operation parameters: power delivered to the
   plasma 16.5 MW, beam energy 1 MeV, accelerated D- ion current 40 A,
   pulse length 3600 s.
   Several interventions for possible modifications and for maintenance are
   expected during the early operation of the ITER injector in order to
   optimise the beam generation, aiming and steering. The maintenance
   scheme and the related design solutions are therefore a very important
   aspect to be considered for the NBTF design.
   The paper describes consistently the many interrelated aspects of the
   design, such as the optimisation of the vessel and cryopump geometry, in
   order to get a better maintenance flexibility, an easier man access and
   a larger access for diagnostic and monitoring. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to examine factors influencing women's
   compliance with medical therapy for osteoporosis in Israel. The study
   population consisted of women diagnosed with osteoporosis using a DEXA
   examination in the year 2000. Medication purchases for a period of 13
   months after the exam were analyzed. Data were gathered from the
   computerized data base of Clalit Health Care Services and phone
   interviews. Treatment was divided into specific drugs and food additives
   (preparation of calcium plus vitamin D). Full, intermediate, low and no
   compliance were defined as > 80, 50-80, 25-50 and < 25\% of treatment
   days, respectively. In the study, 857 women with a mean age of 73.6
   years were enrolled; 581 (67.8\%) were interviewed by telephone. Most of
   women were undereducated and unemployed. Twenty percent did not purchase
   any specific drug; 4.5\% did not purchase any drug or food additive for
   osteoporosis; 60\% were fully or intermittently compliant (by
   purchasing) with drug therapy. The most frequent single specific drugs
   purchased were bisphosphanates and SERM: 62.3 and 76.3\% purchased
   bisphosphanates and/or food additives, respectively. Multi-variant
   analysis showed that predictors of compliance were healthy women,
   compliant with calcium plus vitamin D preparations, and/or spending more
   on drugs. Reasons for low or non-compliance were inconsistent
   recommendations by various physicians and the side effects of specific
   drugs. The relatively high compliance rate of osteoporosis treatment may
   be attributed to the increase in awareness of its benefits. The effect
   of physicians on compliance needs further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Ab initio calculations for the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) in Co/Cu,
   Fe/Cr, and Fe/Au multilayers are presented. The electronic structure of
   the multilayers and the scattering potentials of point defects therein
   are calculated self-consistently. Residual resistivities are obtained by
   solving the quasiclassical Boltzmann equation including the electronic
   structure of the layered system, the anisotropic scattering cross
   sections derived by a Green's function method, and the vertex
   corrections. Furthermore, the influence of scattering centers at the
   interfaces and within the metallic layers is incorporated by averaging
   the scattering cross sections of different impurities at various sites.
   An excellent agreement of experimental and theoretical results
   concerning the general trend of GMR in Co/Cu systems depending on the
   type and the position of impurities is obtained. Due to the quantum
   confinement in magnetic multilayers GMR can be tailored as a function of
   the impurity position. In Co/Cu and Fe/Au systems impurities in the
   magnetic layer lead to high GMR values, whereas in Fe/Cr systems defects
   at the interfaces are most efficient to increase GMR.}},

Abstract = {{Polycarbonate (PC) detector is one of the common detectors for neutron
   and radon gas detection. Using this detector it is possible to measure
   the dose in mSv, by counting tracks/cm(2) on an etched surface. In this
   paper, a special procedure has been suggested to determine the dose
   based on current drain during the etching process. In these experiments
   the effects of voltage, frequency, effective etched area, PC detector's
   thickness, etched area (one side or two sides), etching solution
   temperature and dose absorbed by the PC foil have been studied.
   The results obtained show the current drain variation for a voltage of
   200-1600V, a frequency of 2-10kHz, effective area owith a diameter of
   2-12 cm, PC thickness of 125-250-375-500 mu m and a temperature of
   etching solution of 25-35 degrees C.
   Lexan PC foils were exposed to doses of 0.1, 1, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 10 rad
   (0.001...0.1 Gy) of neutrons. The unexposed foils were considered as the
   background (BG) foils. Most of the experiments were performed at a
   voltage of 800V, a frequency of 2 and 8 kHz, foil thickness of 250 mu m,
   diameter of effective etched area of foils of 2, 6 and 12 cm,
   temperatures of 25 and 35 degrees C and the etching process from 0 up to
   overload stage. Overload stage occurs when the foil becomes so thin due
   to growth of the tracks that it leads to sparking between phase and null
   that makes a hole in the foil.
   Current drain curves versus the function of the etching time are
   absolutely different for various doses from zero (13G) to 10 rad (BG up
   to 0.1 Gy). This is true especially for the time interval from 3 h of
   etching up to overload stage. In this way, it is possible to obtain a
   calibration of PC detector net current drain based on its absorbed dose.
   In this experiment, the number and diameter of tracks and their relation
   with drain current and PC foil residual thickness at overload stage have
   been studied.
   The same experiment has been performed for various concentrations of
   radon gas (Bq/m3) as well. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the topic of defining phonetic broad classes needed
   during acoustic modeling for speech recognition in the procedure of
   decision tree based clustering. The usual approach is to use phonetic
   broad classes which are defined by an expert. This method has some
   disadvantages, especially in the case of multilingual speech
   recognition. A new data-driven method is proposed for the generation of
   phonetic broad classes based on a phoneme confusion matrix. The
   similarity measure is defined using the number of confusions between the
   master phoneme and all other phonemes included in the set. This proposed
   method is compared to the standard approach based on expert knowledge
   and to the randomly generated broad classes approach. The proposed
   data-driven method is implicitly evaluated within a speech recognition
   experiment. The intention of the first evaluation stage is to test the
   generated acoustic models in a monolingual environment (Slovenian), to
   show that the proposed method does not contain a multilingual influence.
   In the second evaluation stage, the generated acoustic models are tested
   in a multilingual environment (Slovenian, German and Spanish). All
   experiments were based on SpeechDat(II) speech databases. The proposed
   data-driven method for the generation of phonetic broad classes, based
   on phoneme confusion matrix, improved speech recognition results when
   compared to the method based on expert knowledge. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The Fe3+ doped TiO2 oxygen sensitive thin films deposited on single
   crystal silicon substrates were prepared by a sol-gel method. The phase
   structure of the thin films was measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The
   morphologies were,observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The
   results showed that the anatase phase appeared with a small grain size
   dispersed homogeneously in the thin film. The rutile phase appeared with
   a morphology of special clustered grains and large sizes in the thin
   film. It was exhibited evidently that the formation of the rutile phase
   in the thin film on a single crystal substrate was dependent on Fe3+
   doping in the system. The formation temperature was about 100 degrees C
   lower with 3mol\% Fe3+ doped than that without Fe3+ doping. The largest
   content of the rutile phase appeared in the thin film while Fe3+ doping
   of about 6mol\%. In addition, the crystal lattice of both the anatas
   phase and the rutile phase decreased with the substitution of a small
   size of Fe ions for a large size of Ti ions when doping Fe ions
   concentrantion below 6mol\%. As Fe ions doped was above 6mol\%, the c
   axis of the rutile phase increased while the a axis kept almost constant
   with the increase of Fe and thus both oxygen vacancy and structure
   distortion increased. The oxygen sensitivity of Fe doped TiO2 thin films
   was controled by the concentration of the oxygen vacancies and the
   content of the rutile phase in TiO2 thin films. The rutile phase and the
   sensitivity in the Fe doped TiO2 thin film showed maximum while Fe
   doping was 6mol\%, and its oxygen sensitivity was 19 times more than

Abstract = {{]Impaired rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) is commonly, observed in
   Alzheimer's disease, suggesting injury to mesopontine cholinergic
   neurons. We sought to determine whether abnormal beta-amyloid peptides
   impair REMS and injure mesopontine cholinergic neurons in transgenic
   (hAPP695.SWE) mice (Tg2576) that model brain amyloid pathologies. Tg2576
   mice and wild-type littermates were studied at 2, 6, and 12 months by
   using sleep recordings, contextual fear conditioning, and
   immunohistochemistry. At 2 months of age, REMS was indistinguishable by
   genotype but was reduced in Tg2576 mice at 6 and 12 months. Choline
   acetyltransferase-positive neurons in the pedunculopontine tegmentum of
   Tg2576 mice at 2 months evidenced activated caspase-3 immunoreactivity,
   and at 6 and 12 months the numbers of pedunculopontine tegmentum choline
   acetyltransferase-positive neurons were reduced in the Tg2576 mice.
   Other cholinergic groups involved in REMS were unperturbed. At 12
   months, Tg2576 mice demonstrated increased 3-nitrotyrosine
   immunoreactivity in cholinergic projection sites but not in cholinergic
   soma. We have identified a population of selectively compromised
   cholinergic neurons in young Tg2576 mice that manifest early onset REMS
   impairment. The differential vulnerability of these cholinergic neurons
   to A beta injury provides an invaluable tool with which to understand
   mechanisms of sleep/wake perturbations in Alzheimer's disease.}},

Abstract = {{The receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 (HER-2/neu) is over-expressed in up
   to 30\% of breast cancers and is associated with poor prognosis and an
   increased likelihood of metastasis especially in node-positive tumors.
   In this proteomic study, to identify the proteins that are associated
   with the aggressive phenotype of HER-2/neu-positive breast cancer, tumor
   cells from both HER-2/neu-positive and -negative tumors were procured by
   laser capture microdissection. Differentially expressed proteins in the
   two subsets of tumors were identified by two-dimensional electrophoresis
   and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS. We found differential expression of several key
   cell cycle modulators, which were linked with increased proliferation of
   the HER-2/neu-overexpressing cells. Nine proteins involved in glycolysis
   (triose-phosphate isomerase (TPI), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), and
   enolase 1 (ENO1)), lipid synthesis (fatty acid synthase (FASN)),
   stress-mediated chaperonage (heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27)), and
   antioxidant and detoxification pathways (haptoglobin, aldo-keto
   reductase (AKR), glyoxalase I (GLO), and prolyl-4-hydrolase beta-isoform
   (P4HB)) were found to be up-regulated in HER-2/neu-positive breast
   tumors. HER-2/neu-dependent differential expression of PGK1, FASN,
   Hsp27, and GLO was further validated in four breast cancer cell lines
   and 12 breast tumors by immunoblotting and confirmed by partially
   switching off the HER-2/neu signaling in the high HER-2/neu-expressing
   SKBr3 cell line with Herceptin treatment. Statistical correlations of
   these protein expressions with HER-2/neu status were further verified by
   immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray comprising 97 breast tumors.
   Our findings suggest that HER-2/neu signaling may result, directly or
   indirectly, in enhanced activation of various metabolic, stress-
   responsive, anti-oxidative, and detoxification processes within the
   breast tumor microenvironment. We hypothesize that these identified
   changes in the cellular proteome are likely to drive cell proliferation
   and tissue invasion and that the key cell cycle modulators involved,
   when uncovered by future research, would serve as naturally useful
   targets for the development of therapeutic strategies to negate the
   metastatic potential of HER-2/neu-positive breast tumors.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To investigate the specific role of myosin II, a critical
   biochemical determinant of cellular contraction, in modulation of
   aqueous humor outflow facility through the trabecular meshwork (TM)
   pathway.
   METHODS. Expression of the nonmuscle myosin II heavy chains (IIA, IIB,
   and IIC) in human TM and ciliary body ( CB) cells was determined by
   RT-PCR analyses. The effects of inhibition of myosin II on cell
   morphology, actomyosin organization, and cell adhesions were evaluated
   in porcine TM and CB cells treated with blebbistatin, a cell-permeable,
   specific inhibitor of myosin II adenosine triphosphatase ( ATPase)
   activity. Changes in aqueous humor outflow facility were determined in
   enucleated porcine eyes by using a constant-pressure Grant perfusion
   model system. Ultrastructural integrity of the outflow pathway in
   drug-perfused eyes was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy.
   RESULTS. Expression of nonmuscle myosin IIA and IIB was confirmed in
   both human TM and CB cells. Confluent cultures of primary porcine TM and
   CB cells treated with blebbistatin in the presence of serum revealed
   dose ( 10 - 200 mu M)-dependent changes in cell morphology, decreases in
   actin stress fiber content and in focal adhesions and adherens
   junctions. These changes were found to be reversible within 24 hours of
   drug withdrawal from the cell culture media. Blebbistatin did not affect
   the status of myosin light chain phosphorylation in TM cells. Perfusion
   of enucleated porcine eyes for 5 hours with 100 and 200 mu M
   blebbistatin produced a significant increase ( P < 0.01, n = 7) in
   aqueous outflow facility (53\% and 64\%, respectively) from the baseline
   facility, compared with a 21\% facility increase in sham control
   specimens. The integrity of the inner wall of aqueous plexi in
   drug-perfused porcine eyes was found to be intact, and TM cell
   morphology appeared to be similar to that noted in sham-treated eyes.
   CONCLUSIONS. These data demonstrate that selective inhibition of myosin
   II in the aqueous humor outflow pathway leads to increased aqueous
   outflow facility, suggesting a critical role for myosin II in the
   regulation of aqueous humor outflow facility. This study also suggests
   myosin II as a potential therapeutic target for lowering intraocular
   pressure in patients with glaucoma.}},

   polyacrylic acid (PAA), polymethylacrylic acid (PMAA), and acrylic
   acid-methyl acrylate copolymer (AA-MA), and calcite crystal have been
   simulated by molecular dynamics (MD). The results show that the orders
   of binding energies for three polymers with two calcite crystal surfaces
   are PAA > AA-MA > PMAA, and the interactions of polymers with calcite
   (110) face are significantly stronger than those with (104) face. The
   binding energies are mainly determined by coulomb nteraction by analysis
   various interactions and the pair correlation functions of the systems.
   Polymers deform during their combining with calcite crystal surfaces,
   and the deformation energies of polymers on (110) face are about 2 times
   as those on (104) face, but all of them are far lower than respective
   nonbonding energies. The dynamics behaviors of carboxyls at different
   positions of polymer chains are widely different. Carboxyls at the end
   of chains oscillate more rapidly than those in the middle, so the middle
   ones hinder scale crystal growth more effectively than the end segments
   because they combine with calcite crystal more firmly.}},

Abstract = {{The paper investigates the ability to retrieve the true soil moisture
   profile by assimilating near-surface soil moisture into a soil moisture
   model with an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) assimilation scheme,
   including the effect of ensemble size, update interval and
   nonlinearities in the profile retrieval, the required time for full
   retrieval of the soil moisture profiles, and the possible influence of
   the depth of the soil moisture observation. These questions are
   addressed by a desktop study using synthetic data. The ``true{''} soil
   moisture profiles are generated from the soil moisture model under the
   boundary condition of 0.5 cm d(-1) evaporation. To test the assimilation
   schemes, the model is initialized with a poor initial guess of the soil
   moisture profile, and different ensemble sizes are tested showing that
   an ensemble of 40 members is enough to represent the covariance of the
   model forecasts. Also compared are the results with those from the
   direct insertion assimilation scheme, showing that the EnKF is superior
   to the direct insertion assimilation scheme, for hourly observations,
   with retrieval of the soil moisture profile being achieved in 16 h as
   compared to 12 days or more. For daily observations, the true soil
   moisture profile is achieved in about 15 days with the EnKF, but it is
   impossible to approximate the true moisture within 18 days by using
   direct insertion. It is also found that observation depth does not have
   a significant effect on profile retrieval time for the EnKF. The
   nonlinearities have some negative influence on the optimal estimates of
   soil moisture profile but not very seriously.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To elucidate the involvement of the endothelin (ET) pathway in the
   pathogenesis of monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary arterial
   hypertension (PAH) and the therapeutic effect of CPU 86017
   (p-chlorobenzyltetrahydroberberine chloride) in rats. Methods: Rats were
   injected with a single dose (60 mg/kg, sc) of MCT and given CPU 86017
   (20, 40, and 80 mg.kg(-1.)d(-1), po) or saline for 28 d. The
   hemodynamics, mRNA expression, and vascular activity were evaluated.
   Results: Right ventricular systolic pressure and central venous
   pressures were elevated markedly in the PAH model and decreased by CPU
   86017. In the PAH group, the endothelin-1 (ET-1) in serum and lungs was
   dramatically increased by 54\% (79.9 pg/ mL, P < 0.01) and 93\% (166.2
   pg/mL, P < 0.01), and mRNA levels of preproET-1, eNOS, and iNOS also
   increased dramatically compared with control. Compared with PAH group,
   CPU 86017 decreased the content of ET-1 to the normal level in lung
   tissue, but was less effective in serum. The level of NO was
   significantly increased in CPU 86017 at 80 and 40 mg(.)kg(-1.)d(-1)
   groups in tissue, whereas the difference in serum was not significant. A
   significant reduction in MDA production and an increase in the SOD
   activity in the serum and lungs was observed in all three CPU 86017
   groups. CPU 86017 80 mg(.)kg(-1.)d(-1) po increased the activity of cNOS
   by 33\% (P < 0.01). The up-regulation of eNOS and iNOS mRNA levels
   induced by MCT was significantly reversed in 3 CPU 86017 groups, and
   preproET-1 mRNA abundance was also reduced notably in CPU 86017 80
   mg(.)kg(-1.)d(-1) group vs the PAH group. The KCl-induced
   vasoconstrictions in the calcium-free medium decreased markedly in PAH
   group but recovered partially after CPU 86017 intervention. The
   constrictions in the presence of Ca2+ was not improved by CPU 86017. The
   phenylephrine-induced vasoconstrictions in the calcium-free medium
   decreased markedly in PAH group but not recovered after CPU 86017
   intervention. The constrictions in the presence of Ca2+ completely
   returned to the normal after CPU 86017 intervention. Conclusion: CPU
   86017 suppressed MCT-induced PAH mainly through an indirect suppression
   of the ET-1 system, which was involved in the pathogenesis of the
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{Jining Cenozoic basaltic field, located on the northern edge of the
   North China craton and to the west of Hannuoba basaltic field, is mainly
   made up of subalkaline tholeiitic basalt, alkaline olivine basalt,
   basanite, and tephrite. Their SiO2 and TiO2 contents vary from 44.10
   similar to 52.27 wt. \% and 1.57 similar to 2.95 wt. \%, respectively,
   with variable Mg-nuniber (43-63) and Ni contents (27 similar to 210ppm).
   The Primitive-mantle normalized incompatible element diagrams and
   Chondrite-normalized REE patterns are similar to those of OIB. Sr, Nd
   isotopic ratios are more enriched than Hannuoba basalts. The basalts
   were mantle-derived magmas with the fractional crystallization of
   olivine and clinopyroxene, but their trace-elenient and Sr, Nd, Pb
   isotopic geochemistry preclude the possibility that the magmas were
   contaminated significantly by crustal materials. The correlations of
   Nd-143/(NdSr)-Nd-144-Sr-87/Sr-86 vs. Pb-206/Pb-204 indicates that Jining
   basalts were generated by the mixing of at least two mantle Components:
   EMI and PREMA, similar to Hannuoba basalts. The mixing of low degree
   melts of spinel Iherzolite (2 similar to 5\%) and garnet Iherzolite (<
   2\%) can explain the REE features in Jining basalts. It can be
   speculated that EMI mantle component came from the lithospheric mantle
   of a depth < 70km, and PREMA mantle component from asthenospheric
   mantle. It is possible that the differences between the subalkaline and
   alkaline basalts may be produced by the mixing of the melts from
   lithospheric EMI mantle and asthenospheric PREMA mantle in different
   proportion, implying that strong interactions have occurred between
   lithosphere and asthenosphere beneath Jining area. The similar isotopic
   ratios and correlations suggest a similar mantle source for Jining and
   Hannuoba basalts. Therefore, the formation of Hammoba basalts can be
   also interpreted by the mixing of the melts from EMI mantle and PREMA
   mantle in different proportion.}},

Abstract = {{Mudstones and shales in the Lower Cambrian Shipai Formation in the Three
   Gorge area, Hubei, China, are richly fossiliferous, containing common
   shelly fossils and some soft-bodied fossils. The latter provide
   important new information about the nature and variety of Cambrian
   soft-bodied organisms. Identifiable, non-mineralized taxa include
   components of the Chengjiang fauna, such as Vetulicola Hou, 1987, a
   palaeoscolecidan referable to Maotianshania Sun \& Hou, 1987, and a
   brachiopod Diandongia pista with pedicle preserved (not illustrated).
   Cambrorhytium Conway Morris \& Robison, 1988, co-occurring both in the
   Burgess Shale and the Chengjiang Lagerstatte, was also recovered.
   Additionally, a new worm is described based on two specimens. This
   taxon, in common with many other fossil worms, has a slender,
   cylindrical body with annulations, but it is characterized by each
   annulus bearing an elevated ridge and lacking surface ornamentation. The
   occurrence of exceptional preservation in the Shipai Formation has
   likely been overlooked due to the relatively poor resolution of
   soft-bodied fossils; nevertheless, this occurrence is all important
   extension of the Burgess Shale-type biotas in China, over 1500 km
   northeast of the provenance of the Chengjiang Lagerstatte.}},

Abstract = {{Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic respiratory pathogen that
   infects the majority of patients with cystic fibrosis, initiates host
   inflammatory responses through interaction with airway epithelial cells.
   The Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of pathogen pattern
   recognition receptors that play key roles in host innate immunity. In
   this study we aimed to determine whether TLRs mediate the interaction
   between P. aeruginosa and airway epithelial cells. Individual murine
   TLRs (TLR1 to TLR9) and dual combinations of these TLRs that activate an
   NF-kappa B-driven luciferase reporter in response to PAO1 were screened
   in HEK 293 cells. TLR5, TLR2, a combination of TLR1 and TLR2, or a
   combination of TLR2 and TLR6 responded to PAO1. Another A aeruginosa
   strain, strain PAK, activated TLR5 similarly, while the isogenic
   flagellin-deficient strain PAK/fliC and the flagellum-free bacterium
   Haemophilus influenzae failed to activate TLR5. Reverse
   transcription-PCR was used to probe the presence of multiple TLRs
   (including TLR5) in primary human airway epithelial cells (HAECs).
   Immunostaining with TLR5 antibodies showed that TLR5 was expressed in
   HAECs and on the apical surface of the human trachea epithelium. In
   HAECs, PAO1, PAK, and Burkholderia cepacia, but not flagellin-deficient
   strain PAK/fliC or a B. cepacia fliC mutant, activated the NF-kappa B
   reporter. Dominant negative TLR5 specifically blocked the response to P.
   aeruginosa but not to the response to lipoteichoic acid, a specific
   ligand of TLR2. We also determined that MyD88, IRAK, TRAF6, and
   Toll-interacting protein (Tollip), but not TIRAP, were involved in the
   TLR-mediated response to P. aeruginosa in HAECs. These findings
   demonstrate that the airway epithelial receptor TLR5 senses P.
   aeruginosa through its flagellin protein, which may have an important
   role in the initiation of the host inflammatory reaction to clear the
   invading pathogen.}},

Abstract = {{The Pre-pilot Hole No. 1 of the Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling
   Project (CCSD-PPH1) in the southern Sulu terrane recovered a continuous
   core of eclogite, garnet peridotite, orthogneiss, paragneiss, and minor
   schist and quartzite. Geochemical characteristics indicate that the
   garnet peridotite was derived from depleted mantle; all other rock types
   are metamorphosed supracrustal rocks with continental affinities. The
   eclogite consists of garnet, omphacite, phengite, quartz (coesite),
   amphibole, rutile, and zircon; P-T estimates of peak metamorphism are
   785-820 degrees C and >2.7 to 3.7 GPa. The gneisses show common
   amphibolite-facies mineral assemblages consisting of plagioclase,
   K-feldspar, muscovite, and quartz, with minor garnet, epidote (or
   zoisite), and biotite; coesite inclusions in zircon indicate that the
   gneisses together with eclogites were subjected to an early UHP
   metamorphism prior to amphibolite-facies retrogression. The Garnet
   peridotites show porphyroblastic textures, and consist mainly of garnet,
   clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, and olivine with minor phlogopite. Garnet
   and clinopyroxene porphyroblasis show significant compositional zoning.
   Applying relevant geothermobarometers, core compositions of the minerals
   indicate P-T conditions of 6.0-7.0 GPa and 1100-1200 degrees C. For the
   rim, similar or slightly higher P-T conditions compared to the eclogites
   were obtained. We suggest that the former represent crystallization
   conditions of garnet peridotite in the upper mantle, whereas the latter
   reflect reequilibrium conditions during incorporation of mantle rocks
   into the subducted slab. We conclude that the garnet peridotite may have
   been derived from the mantle wedge above the subduction zone. If so,
   these mantle-derived rocks were sandwiched between continental-derived
   country rocks.}},

Abstract = {{The no-loss peak of Ag 3d photoelectrons and 3d XPS spectra at different
   incidence angles of X-rays were measured with a double angular
   photoelectron intelligent analyzers (DAPHNIA) attached to a wide energy
   range X-ray beam line BL15XU at SPring-8. Ag 3d X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were simulated by a Monte Carlo (MC) method
   using an effective energy loss function. Confirming that the MC
   simulation based on the use of the effective energy loss function
   describes successfully Ag 3d XPS spectrum, we applied the MC simulation
   to the angular distribution of Ag 3d X-ray photoelectrons for different
   incidence angles of X-rays, and for different take-off angles of
   photoelectrons. The simulation results agree very well the experimental
   data for small and medium incidence angle; but there is a large
   discrepancy for X-ray glancing incidence due to stronger surface
   generations of photoelectrons in this case. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The tolerable voltage limits and the maximum predicted voltage values
   calculated using empirical formulae given in five currently applicable
   standards, namely IEEE 80 (2000), EA-TS 41-24 (1992), BS 7354 (1990),
   ITU-T K.33 (1996) and CENELEC HD 637 S1 (1999) are compared. The
   calculated results from CDEGS-HIFREQ are also included. The step, touch
   and mesh voltages, and hot zones are calculated according to the
   recommendations given in the five standards, and the differences between
   them are investigated and clarified. The results show that IEEE 80 with
   50 kg body weight touch voltage case gives the lowest tolerable limits
   whereas BS 7354 gives the highest in most cases. The maximum predicted
   touch voltage obtained from CDEGS-HIFREQ is higher than that obtained
   from the empirical formulae of EA-TS 41-24 and BS 7354, and the mesh
   voltage is lower than that from IEEE 80. The derivation of `safety
   limit-curves' is proposed related to the magnitude and duration of fault
   current for a given earthing grid design based on the assumptions used
   in each standard. Following this new proposed procedure, it is
   established that, if the fault current parameters, i.e. grid current
   magnitude and duration, are within the safety zone of IEEE 80, they also
   satisfy the criteria of EA-TS 41-24 and BS 7354.}},

Abstract = {{A first-generation porcine oligonucleotide set, representing 13,297
   cDNAs and ESTs, has been designed by Qiagen-Operon for transcriptional
   profiling. To validate this set, microarrays containing each 70-mer
   oligonucleotide, referred to as the Qiagen-NRSP8 array, were hybridized
   with targets from porcine adult liver, lung, muscle, or small intestine.
   Transcriptome analyses showed that 11,328 of the oligonucleotides
   demonstrated expression in at least one tissue. Statistical analyses
   revealed that 1810 genes showed differential expression among tissues
   (Bonferroni adjusted p < 0.05). Biological pathways identified by
   DAVID/EASE analysis using a list of 423 tissue-selective genes matched
   archetypal pathways in the corresponding human or mouse tissue.
   Real-time quantitative PCR confirmed expression patterns for 9 of I I
   genes tested. Our results demonstrate that this first-generation porcine
   oligonucleotide array is informative and the specificity is high. This
   is essential validation for investigators using the Qiagen-NRSP8 array
   for porcine functional genomics and for using the pig in modeling
   important physiological problems. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{To identify the unknown proteins that would contaminate the alpha- and
   beta-subunits of nitrogenase MoFe protein on sodium dodecyl
   sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), the partially
   purified MoFe protein (Av1) preparation was obtained from Azotobacter
   vinelandii Lipmann OP by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose (DE52) and
   Sephacryl S-200 columns and analyzed by PAGE and matrixassisted laser
   desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. The
   Av1 preparation was shown to have two main bands at the position of the
   alpha- and beta-subunits of crystalline Av1 on the SDS gel. However, on
   the anoxic native PAGE, in addition to the Av1 band, the preparation was
   shown to have three other main bands that migrated slower than Av1. Of
   these three main bands, the protein with the fastest migration was
   identified as bacterioferritin elsewhere. The proteins on the other two
   bands, termed Upper and Middle, were suggested to be two different
   homopolymers with the same apparent subunit electrophoretic mobilities
   as the alpha- and beta-subunits of Av1, respectively. By analysis of
   MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, the Upper was identified as GroEL, which
   belongs to the heat shock protein 60 family, and the Middle was
   identified as glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (PGI). In our preparation,
   anoxic native electrophoresis indicated that GroEL was composed of 14
   identical subunits and that PGI was composed of 10 identical subunits.
   This is the first report of PGI, with so many subunits. The
   contaminating proteins in the Av1 preparation, mainly GroEL and PGI,
   could be totally or partially removed from Av1 if the shoulders and
   center of the elution peak were collected separately from the Sephacryl
   S-200 column and the center fraction was purified further by Q-Sepharose
   developed with an NaCl concentration gradient. Thus, Av1 with more than
   90\% purity was obtained. Obviously, this modified method is useful for
   the purification of mutant MoFe proteins with a high purity.}},

Abstract = {{The latest time-frequency tool, wavelet analysis, is presented to
   extract the phase information phi(x, y) from a single spatial carrier
   fringe pattern. First, the fringe pattern is generated and projected
   onto an object. The spatial carrier fringe pattern, carrying the 3-D
   shape of the object, is then captured using a CCD camera. Afterward, the
   spatial carrier fringe pattern is modulated by two high-frequency waves,
   which makes the spectrum of the carried phase relatively lower among the
   spectra of two modulated patterns. Following this, the spectrum of the
   object is separated into the approximation subband using a wavelet
   transform. The phase map of the 3-D shape of the object is then
   extracted from the mixed spectra by reconstructing only the
   approximation of their wavelet transforms. Finally, the 3-D shape of the
   object can be calculated from the phase map. (c) 2005 Society of

Abstract = {{The daily 1 degrees x 1 degrees data of the Aviation (AVN) model, the
   black body temperature (TBB) data of cloud top, and cloud images by
   geostationary meteorological satellite (GMS) are used to identify a
   dew-point front near the periphery of the western Pacific subtropical
   high (WPSH). The results clearly demonstrate the existence of the
   dew-point front, and its thermodynamic and dynamic structural
   characteristics are analyzed in detail. The dew-point front is a
   transitional belt between the moist southwest monsoon flow and the dry
   adiabatic sinking flow near the WPSH, manifested by a large horizontal
   moisture gradient in the mid-lower troposphere and conjugated with the
   mei-yu front to form a predominant double-front structure associated
   with intense rainfall in the mei-yu period. The mei-yu front is located
   between 30 degrees and 35 degrees N, vertically extends from the ground
   level to the upper level and shifts northward. The dew-point front is to
   the south of the mei-yu front and lies up against the periphery of the
   WPSH. Generally, it is located between 850 hPa and 500 hPa. On the
   dew-point front side, the southwesterly prevails at the lower level and
   the northeasterly at the upper level; this wind distribution is
   different from that on the mei-yu front side. Vertical ascending motion
   exists between the two fronts, and there are descending motions on the
   north side of the mei-yu front and on the south side of the dew-point
   front, which form a secondary circulation. The dynamics of the double
   fronts also have some interesting features. At the lower level, positive
   vertical vorticity and obvious convergence between the two fronts are
   clearly identified. At the mid-lower level, negative local change of the
   divergence (corresponding to increasing convergence) is often embedded
   in the two fronts or against the mei-yu front. Most cloud clusters occur
   between the two fronts and propagate down stream in a wave-like manner.}},

Journal = {{SPEECH COMMUNICATION}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{243-264}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Noise-robust speech recognition has become an important area of research
   in recent years. In current speech recognition systems, the
   Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCCs) are used as recognition
   features. When the speech signal is corrupted by narrow-band noise, the
   entire MFCC feature vector gets corrupted and it is not possible to
   exploit the frequency-selective property of the noise signal to make the
   recognition system robust. Recently, a number of sub-band speech
   recognition approaches have been proposed in the literature, where the
   full-band power spectrum is divided into several sub-bands and then the
   sub-bands are combined depending on their reliability. In conventional
   sub-band approaches the reliability can only be set experimentally or
   estimated during training procedures, which may not match the observed
   data and often causes degradation of performance. We propose a novel
   sub-band approach, where frequency sub-bands are multiplied with
   weighting factors and then combined and converted to cepstra, which have
   proven to be more robust than both full-band and conventional sub-band
   cepstra in our experiments. Furthermore, the weighting factors can be
   estimated by using maximum likelihood adaptation approaches in order to
   minimize the mismatch between trained models and observed features. We
   evaluated our methods on AURORA2 and Resource Management tasks and
   obtained consistent performance improvement on both tasks. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Objective To investigate the interleukin-10 (IL-10) gene -592 A/C
   polymorphism in Chinese patients with lupus nephritis (LN) and evaluate
   the role of IL-10 in the pathogenesis and clinical/pathological
   diversity of LN.
   Methods Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length
   polymorphism (RFLP) analyses were used to detect the IL-10 gene -592 A/C
   polymorphism in 265 LN patients and 100 ethnically matched controls.
   Frequencies of the genotypes were compared between LN patients and
   controls and among LN patients with different pathological classes. The
   clinical and pathological characteristics of the patients with different
   genotypes were also analyzed. Serum IL-10 levels of the patients were
   determined by ELISA.
   Results No significant differences were found in the distribution of the
   polymorphism between healthy controls and LN patients. The parameters of
   disease activity index (DAI), percentage of positive serum anti-dsDNA
   antibodies, proteinuria and hematuria, and frequency of glomerular
   thrombi were all higher in patients with -592 AC/CC genotypes than those
   with AA genotype. AC/CC genotypes were, more frequent in patients with
   LN-IV than in those with LN-II and Va. There was no significant
   difference in the serum IL-10 levels in patients with these three
   genotypes.
   Conclusion The IL-10 gene -592 A/C polymorphism appears to be associated
   with disease activity and renal pathology of LN, but not associated with
   LN susceptibility or serum IL-10 levels. Patients carrying the -592 C
   allele had a higher risk of diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis,
   indicating the genetic influence of the IL-10 gene polymorphisin in the
   renal lesions of LN.}},

Abstract = {{Campylobacter jejuni is the most prevalent cause of bacterial diarrhea
   worldwide. Despite the serious health problems caused by this bacterium,
   human innate immune responses to C. jejuni infection remain poorly
   defined. Human beta-defensins, a family of epithelial antimicrobial
   peptides, are a major component of host innate defense at the
   gastrointestinal mucosal surface. In this study, the effect of two
   different C. jejuni wild-type strains on human intestinal epithelial
   innate responses was investigated. Up-regulation of P-defensin gene and
   peptide expression during infection was observed and recombinant
   beta-defensins were shown to have a direct bactericidal effect against
   C. jejuni through disruption of cell wall integrity. Further studies
   using an isogenic capsule-deficient mutant showed that, surprisingly,
   the absence of the bacterial polysaccharide capsule did not change the
   innate immune responses induced by C jejuni or the ability of C. jejuni
   to survive exposure to recombinant beta-defensins. This study suggests a
   major role for this family of antimicrobial peptides in the innate
   immune defense against this human pathogen.}},

Abstract = {{Despite a lack of signaling motifs in their cytoplasmic domain, major
   histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules trigger a variety of
   intracellular signals that regulate antigen-presenting cell function.
   They thus may use associated effector molecules as demonstrated on B
   cells and dendritic cells. The starting point of this study comes from
   our previous work, which demonstrated that the ecto-enzyme CD38 is
   functionally linked to MHC class II molecules. We report that CD38 and
   human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) are functionally and physically
   associated in lipid rafts microdomains of cell-surface monocytes and
   that the integrity of these domains is necessary for the HLA-DR and CD38
   signaling events. Moreover, we identified the tetraspanin CD9 molecule
   as a partner of the CD38/HLA-DR complex and demonstrated that HLA-DR,
   CD38, and CD9 share a common pathway of tyrosine kinase activation in
   human formation between monocytes presenting superantigen and T cells
   shows the active participation of CD9 and HLA-DR on the monocyte
   surface. Together, these observations demonstrate the presence of a CD38
   and HLA-DR signaling complex within tetraspanin-containing lipid rafts
   and the functional impact of their molecular partner CD9 in antigen

Abstract = {{A new CE method for ascorbic acid (AA) and uric acid (UA) detection in
   human plasma has been developed. Analytes were resolved in less than 4
   min by employing sodium glycylglycine (Glygly) as electrolyte run buffer
   at pH 8.0. Using the diode array detector ability to measure multiple
   wavelengths simultaneously, detection was optimized by monitoring the
   run at 262 nm for AA and at 288 nm for UA. Electrophoretic parameters
   such as resolution, migration times, efficiency, and peak areas of this
   new method were compared to those obtained by the two CE assays
   described in literature, in which the analytes separation was achieved
   by using sodium borate (that allows faster migration times but poor
   resolution) or tricine (with the highest resolution but elevated
   migration times) as electrolyte run buffer. Sodium Glygly allows to
   obtain the same good resolution given by the tricine buffer but with the

Abstract = {{In the past 20 years, there has been increasing recognition that for
   some women, pregnancy may be burdened with mood problems, in particular
   depression, that may impact both mother and child. With identification
   of risk factors for postpartum depression and a growing knowledge about
   a biologic vulnerability for mood change following delivery, research
   has accumulated on attempts to prevent postpartum depression using
   various psychosocial, psychopharmacologic, and hormonal strategies. The
   majority of psychosocial and hormonal strategies have shown little
   effect on postpartum depression. Notwithstanding, results from
   preliminary trials of interpersonal therapy, cognitive-behavioural
   therapy, and antidepressants indicate that these strategies may be of
   benefit. Information on prevention of postpartum depression using
   dietary supplements is sparse and the available evidence is
   inconclusive. Although a few studies show promising results, more
   rigorous trials are required. The abounding negative evidence in the
   literature indicates that postpartum depression cannot be easily
   prevented, yet.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: The host response to microbial challenge depends on the
   recruitment of homing leucocytes and may be related to the experience to
   infectious insults over years. Purpose: The aim of this study was to
   investigate the soft tissue reactions to de novo plaque formation at
   sites treated with either open flap debridement or with the use of
   resective means during periodontal therapy.
   Material and Methods: Fifteen patients, who had been treated for
   periodontal disease (severe generalized chronic periodontitis),
   participated in the study. Surgical therapy was performed using either
   gingivectomy (GV) or open flap debridement (OFD) procedures in a split
   mouth design. After 6 months of healing (day 0), two gingival biopsies
   were obtained, one from the GV- and one from the OFD-treated sites. The
   experimental gingivitis model was applied and plaque accumulation was
   allowed for 3 weeks. New biopsies were obtained from the remaining
   quadrants on day 21 of plaque formation. The biopsies were snap frozen
   and prepared for immunohistochemical analysis.
   Results: Following 3 weeks of plaque accumulation, the size of the
   lesion in OFD sites was more than twice as large than that in GV sites
   (0.42 versus 0.19mm(2)). In the GV units, the lesion was characterized
   by almost similar proportions of T cells (CD3(+), 6.0\%) and B cells
   (CD19(+), 6.6\%), while the ICT in OFD sites was dominated by B cells
   (13.8\%). During the 3-week period of plaque formation the increase in
   cell densities of T and B cells was three times larger in OFD than in GV
   sites. The proportion of ELAM-1 (CD62(+) cells) decreased in GV (-
   0.4\%) and increased in OFD (0.9\%) sites.
   Conclusions: The host response that occurred in the gingival sites
   treated with OFD was more pronounced than the reaction that under
   similar experimental conditions took place in the regenerated gingiva at
   sites treated by resective means.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Aims: In the cirrhotic liver, gene expression of the
   multifunctional cytokine oncostatin M (OSM) is up-regulated, but its
   cellular origin is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the expression of
   OSM protein and its specific receptor subunits, OSMR beta and LIFR beta
   in normal and cirrhotic human liver using immunohistochemical and
   Western blot analysis.
   Results: OSM protein was expressed in Kupffer cells, variably in normal
   liver but consistently in cirrhosis. OSMR beta was expressed at low
   level in hepatocytes of all normal livers examined, but in no cirrhotic
   sample. In contrast, LIFR beta receptor was expressed weakly in normal
   livers, but much more intensely in cirrhosis, in reactive ductules, bile
   duct epithelial cells and perisinusoidal areas. Double immunostaining
   showed co-localization of LIFR beta with cytokeratin 7, proliferating
   cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), in
   bile duct epithelial cells, but not with alpha-smooth muscle actin, a
   myolibroblast marker.
   Conclusions: In human liver, OSM protein is expressed in Kupffer cells,
   variably in normals but universally in cirrhosis. The differential
   expression pattern of OSM and its receptors could allow for differential
   OSM signaling by alternative utilization of receptors to promote
   hepatocyte proliferation in acute injury and, with its homologue LIF,
   for the bile ductular reaction in cirrhosis. (c) 2005 European

Abstract = {{Data from animal studies and from genetic scans in humans suggest that
   brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a member of the neurotrophic

   this polymorphism in 103 methamphetamine- and 200 heroin-dependent cases

   distribution were found between subjects dependent on methamphetamine (P
   = 0.046) or heroin (P = 0.045) and controls, suggesting that the lower
   66Met carrier frequency is associated with substance abuse. Furthermore,
   in the heroin-dependent group, the Val/Val homozygotes had a later onset
   of substance abuse compared with the Met allele carriers. The results
   suggest that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism or a nearby locus may be
   involved in the pathogenesis of substance abuse. Our findings support
   previous genetic scan results showing that BDNF may contribute to
   substance abuse vulnerability. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Cupric oxide is one of the most important additives used (a) to catalyze
   decomposition reactions in gas generators to obtain cooler reaction
   gases, (b) as burning enhancer for ammonium perch lorate-based composite
   propellants, and (c) as coloring agent in pyrotechnics. In this context,
   the reaction of Cu2+ ions in aqueous ammonia solution with
   bis(tetrazolyl)amine (H(2)bta) was investigated. Depending on the
   reaction conditions three complexes were obtained: Cu(bta)(NH3)(2) (1),
   Cu(bta)(NH3)(2).H2O (2), and (NH4)(2)Cu(bta)(2)(.)2.5H(2)O (3). The
   crystal structures of 1 and 2 are discussed with respect to the
   coordination mode of the dianion of N,N-bis(1(2)H-tetrazol-5-yl)-amine
   (bta), which mediates in the case of 1 and 2 weak superexchange
   interactions between the adjacent magnetic transition-metal Cu-II
   cations. These antiferromagnetic interactions result from 1D copper
   chains over an hidden azide end-to-end bridge. Interestingly, the
   structural arrangement of 1 completely changes in the presence of
   crystal-bound water. Moreover, some physicochemical properties (e.g.,
   heat of formation, friction, and impact sensitivity, DSC) of these
   complexes with respect to high-energetic materials are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The neurofibromatosis type2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene product, merlin,
   is structurally related to the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) family of
   proteins that anchor the actin cytoskeleton to specific membrane
   proteins and participate in cell signaling. However, the basis of the
   tumor suppressing activity of merlin is not well understood. Previously,
   we identified a role of merlin as an inhibitor of the Ras-ERK signaling
   pathway. Recent studies have suggested that phosphorylation of merlin,
   as of other ERM proteins, may regulate its function. To determine
   whether phosphorylation of merlin affects its suppression of Ras-ERK
   signaling, we generated plasmids expressing full-length merlin with
   substitutions of serine 518, a potential phosphorylation site. A
   substitution that mimics constitutive phosphorylation (S518D) abrogated
   the ability of merlin to suppress effects of the Ras-ERK signaling
   pathway such as Ras-induced SR-E trans activation, Elk-mediated SRE
   transactivation, Ras-induced ERK phosphorylation and Ras-induced focus
   formation. On the other hand, an S518A mutant, which mimics
   nonphosphorylated merlin, acted like wild type merlin. These
   observations show that mimicking merlin phosphorylation impairs not only
   growth suppression by merlin but also its inhibitory action on the
   Ras-ERK signaling pathway.}},

Abstract = {{We have constructed an AFLP-based linkage map of Japanese red pine
   (Pinus densiflora Siebold et Zucc.) using haploid DNA samples of 96
   megagametophytes from a single maternal tree, selection clone Kyungbuk
   4. Twenty-eight primer pairs generated a total of 5,780 AFLP fragments.
   Five hundreds and thirteen fragments were verified as genetic markers
   with two alleles by their Mendelian segregation. At the linkage criteria
   LOD 4.0 and maximum recombination fraction 0.25(0), a total of 152
   markers constituted 25 framework maps for 19 major linkage groups. The
   maps spanned a total length of 2,341 cM with an average framework marker
   spacing of 18.4 cM. The estimated genome size was 2,662 cM. With an
   assumption of equal marker density, 82.2\% of the estimated genome would
   be within 10 cM of one of the 230 linked markers, and 68.1\% would be
   within 10 cM of one of the 152 framework markers. We evaluated map
   completeness in terms of LOD value, marker density, genome length, and
   map coverage. The resulting map will provide crucial information for
   future genomic studies of the Japanese red pine, in particular for QTL
   mapping of economically important breeding target traits.}},

   base ligands. The major flaw of most of these attempts, however, was the
   weak coordination of the chiral Lewis base ligands to the metal center,
   which led either to high ees only at the very beginning of the catalytic
   reaction (low conversion) or to generally low enantiomeric excesses. The
   heterogenisation of the Mo(VI) complexes was, at least in some cases,
   successfully achieved but with the same drawbacks with respect to the

Abstract = {{Several reports suggest that the canonical nuclear factor-kappaB
   (NF-kappa B) pathway is constitutively activated in a subset of prostate
   cancer cells. However, except for RelA (p65), little is known about the
   status of NF-kappa B transcription factors in prostate cancer tissues.
   To clarify the status of NF-kappa B subunits, we analysed the expression
   and subcellular localisation of RelA, RelB, c-Rel, p50, and p52 on
   tissue array sections containing respectively 344, 346, 369, 343, and
   344 cores from 75 patients. The subcellular localisation of NF-kappa B
   factors was tested against relevant clinical parameters ( preoperative
   prostate-specific antigen, pathological stage, and postoperative Gleason
   grade). With the exception of c-Rel, each subunit was detected in the
   nucleus of cancer cells: significant nuclear expression of RelB, RelA,
   p52, and p50 was seen in 26.6, 15.6, 10.7, and 10.5\% of cores,
   respectively. Surprisingly, cores expressing both nuclear RelA and p50
   canonical pathway proteins were less frequently observed than cores
   expressing other subunit combinations such as RelB - p52 and RelA -
   RelB. In addition, the nuclear localisation of RelB correlated with
   patient's Gleason scores ( Spearman correlation: 0.167; P = 0.018). The
   nuclear localisation of both canonical and noncanonical NF-kappa B
   subunits in prostate cancer cells suggests for the first time that
   different NF-kappa B pathways and dimers may be activated in the
   progression of the disease.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the synthesis and characterization of
   pyridine-substituted artificial oligopeptides with an aminoethylglycine
   backbone of varying length, which are designed to act as scaffolds for
   the self-assembly of multimetallic structures, The identities and
   purities of the oligopeptides are confirmed with mass spectrometry, H-1
   NMR, HPLC, and pH titrations. The acid dissociation constants for the
   oligopeptides were determined and were found to decrease with increasing
   pyridine units. Titrations of the oligopeptides with Cu(II) and Pt(II)
   complexes containing the tridentate ligands 2,2':6',2{''}-terpyridine
   and pyridine 2,6-dicarboxylic acid were monitored using UV-visible
   absorption spectroscopy and showed stoichiometric binding based on the
   number of pyridines on the peptide strand, Metal titrations performed
   using an analogous oligopeptide with methyl substituents (in place of
   the pyridine ligands) showed very weak or no binding. In the case of the
   oligopeptides containing bound Pt(terpyridine)(2+) complexes, cyclic
   voltammetry reveals two sequential one-electron reductions at formal
   potentials that do not vary as a function of oligopeptide length. The
   measured diffusion coefficients were measured with chronoamperometry and
   were found to decrease with increasing oliopeptide length.}},

Abstract = {{All members of Mycobacterium avium complex are serious pathogens for
   humans and animals. The aim of this study was to look for and analyze
   VNTR-MIRU loci in the genome of M. avium complex and their preliminary
   application to test these isolates. In the present study, we identified
   22 novel VNTR-MIRU by using Tandem Repeat software: five with a
   structure similar to MIRU and 17 without MIRU structure; these latter
   were designated as VNTR. Most VNTR were located within predicted coding
   regions. Most MIRU were intercistronic with their extremities
   overlapping the termination and initiation codons of their flanking
   genes. Some of these VNTR-MIRU exhibited polymorphism among M. avium
   complex isolates due to insertion or deletion of whole repeats and/or of
   nucleotide sequence degeneration. We determined the variability of six
   VNTR-MIRU loci in 21 M. avium subsp. hominissuis and 26 M. avium subsp.
   paratuberculosis. The analysis identified 15 different alleles with the
   combination of six VNTR-MIRU in the 21 M. avium subsp. hominissuis with
   16 different IS1245 RFLP and four different profiles with
   PCR-restriction analysis of hsp65 (PRA). However, neither the six
   VNTR-MIRU loci nor the PRA were able to distinguish M. avium subsp.
   paratuberculosis isolates with five different IS900 RFLP profiles. In
   conclusion, some of the VNTR-MIRU loci identified were useful to
   differentiate M. avium subsp. hominissuis but not M. avium subsp.
   paratuberculosis isolates here included. However, we observed
   polymorphism in VNTR-MIRU loci between M. avium subsp. hominissuis and
   M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis genomes, which could be important in
   the understanding of the obvious differences in the pathogenic effects
   of these mycobacteria. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of a technique, global positioning system (GPS) has
   become progressively less expensive, lighter and easier to use. The
   accuracy of GPS has been improved and it appears applicable to the
   continuously monitoring morphology changes on the earth surface with
   small and slow change. The objective of this study is to use GPS to
   measure the morphology Of gullies in a small catchment near Suide,
   Shaanxi Province, China. There are three main gully types in the study
   area: bank gullies, floor gullies, and hill slope gullies, and this
   study mainly focuses on the hill slope gullies. The hill slope gullies
   in the study area are mainly discontinuous and are developing rapidly.
   The gully density in the Study area is very large. The retreat rate of
   hill slope gullies is 0.16-2.02 m year(-1). The relationships between
   the upslope drainage area (A) and the critical slope gradient (S) for
   hill slope gullies is S=0.1839A(-0-21115). The values of AS(2) range
   from 41 to 814 m(2) for the hill slope gully headcuts, and most of them
   fell into the range of 100-300 m(2). Both of these relationships are
   suggested as indexes for estimating the location of gully headcuts. (c)

Abstract = {{The present study examines the effect of preheating of cast material on

   The stretch formability of sheets has been characterized in terms of
   limit strains in forming limit diagrams (FLDs). Both conditions
   developed good combinations of strength and formability, giving forming
   limits in biaxial stretching comparable to those of commercial purity
   aluminum. Strain hardening, strain-rate hardening and surface
   roughening, which is developed during the plastic deformation of the
   material are found to be the key parameters. It appears that strain
   hardening and strain-rate hardening are the dominant factors at low
   annealing temperatures, while surface roughening is more important in
   the homogenized materials annealed at high temperatures. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Ion-exchanged Co and PdCo-BEA zeolite-based catalysts were studied for
   the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO with methane under oxygen
   excess. Bimetallic samples were submitted to several hydrothermal
   treatments (steaming) and tested under dry and wet conditions (2\% H2O).
   These hydrothermal treatments resulted in significant modifications in
   the amount and distribution of metal species, namely an increase of Co
   oxides and Co-oxo species, simultaneously with the preservation of Co2+
   isolated exchanged cations. H-2-TPR measurements detected, on these
   catalysts, a fraction of Co species more easily reducible, eventually
   interacting with Pd species and possibly related to dispersed nanosized
   oxide species, placed in more accessible positions. All the steamed
   catalysts exhibit a higher NO conversion into N-2 and an increased water
   resistance. The Co and/or Co-Pd species formed during steaming
   treatment, the balance between them and the framework dealumination are
   important issues for the high and stable catalyst activity under the
   presence of water vapor. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by reverse co-precipitation and an
   industrial catalyst were used for the low-temperature water gas shift
   reaction. The catalysts were characterized by chemical analysis (atomic
   absorption spectroscopy), BET surface area, nitrous oxide chemisorption,
   X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and catalytic activity in the target
   reaction. The catalyst prepared by reverse co-precipitation showed
   higher BET and copper surface areas, as well as higher catalytic
   activity. XRD patterns showed that the aurichalcite and hydrozincite
   precursors were converted into crystalline CuO and ZnO oxides when
   calcined in air at 623 K. TPR profiles revealed that Cu(I) oxide forms
   prior to Cu. Binding energies corresponding to several copper states on
   fresh catalysts were observed by XPS, but copper was in the metallic
   state during the reaction conditions (reduced catalyst). By varying the
   catalytic reaction conditions, such as vapor/carbon ratio and the time
   of contact, it is possible to obtain different conversion rates of
   carbon monoxide and thus operate under conditions of lower vapor
   consumption. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   analysis of spectra and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)
   data revealed that Mn was present in three different octahedral

   pyrolusite phase while the other two can be associated to Mn in
   ramsdellite-like environment and Mn in a octahedral site with
   Mn-vacancies in the second shell of coordination. The different oxides
   were analyzed in the reaction of total oxidation of ethanol and we found
   that the catalytic activity was enhanced when the couple Mn3+-Mn4+ was

Abstract = {{The experimental design methodology was applied having in mind the

   concentration of 0.3 mM and pH 3. The multivariate experimental design
   allowed to develop quadratic models for: (i) color removal and (ii)
   total organic carbon (TOC) reduction (both after 2 h of reaction), which
   were adequate to predict responses in all the range of experimental
   conditions used. Under the optimum conditions, performances of 99.7 and
   70.7\% for color and TOC removal, respectively, were experimentally
   reached. It was found that both H2O2 concentration and temperature have
   an important effect in the organic matter degradation efficiency. (c)

Abstract = {{A new method for estimating incidence and prevalence is developed, which
   only requires observation of occurrence of health-related events within
   a given time window. Occurrence data are often easy to collect but
   estimating incidence and prevalence of a disease from such data is
   non-trivial, since the true disease status is not directly observed for
   all at the beginning of the study period. Our method for overcoming this
   problem is based on an idea first presented in The waiting time
   distribution as a graphical approach to epidemiologic measures of drug
   utilization' (Epidemiology 1997; 8:666-670). Their fundamental idea is
   to analyse the waiting time from start of the window to the first event
   of each individual, and we formalize this by establishing a parametric
   likelihood which allows ordinary maximum likelihood analysis and
   explicit modelling of censoring. The developed method is used to analyse
   incidence and prevalence of hypertension in a Danish cohort of
   70+-year-olds. A simulation study on the finite sample properties of the
   method is reported, which indicates that the method gives a quite robust
   and cost-effective alternative to ordinary surveys and follow-up studies
   for estimating incidence and prevalence. Copyright (C) 2005 John Wiley

   alpha,beta-Unsaturated carbonyl compounds are important intermediates,

   thermal decomposition of a hydrotalcite and an X zeolite exchanged with
   cesium and impregnated with cesium species was studied using the aldol
   condensation reaction between glyceraldehyde acetonide and acetone
   producing the corresponding alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound.
   These catalysts were active for the studied reaction. The product
   distribution has shown that besides the principle product, other
   compounds obtained from different aldol reactions were observed. The
   rehydration of the Mg,Al-mixed oxide generated a catalyst that was
   selective to the condensation product of glyceraldehyde acetonide and

   the main product over the Mg,Al-mixed oxide sample. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objectives: To assess ECG changes after percutaneous atrial septal
   defect (ASD) closure in children with significant left-to-right shunt.
   Methods: Analysis of data of 36 consecutive children with an ASD who had
   successful percutaneous ASD closure with an Amplatzer Septal Occluder.
   Assessment comprised echocardiograpk and ECG the day before and after
   the procedure and at 1, 6 and 12 months follow-up.
   Results: The median age (interquartile range) of children was 7.3 (5.3)
   years. On the day after the procedure the end diastolic diameter of the
   right ventricle showed already a diminution (34 (12) mm/m(2) before
   intervention vs. 32 (12) mm/m(2)). ECG changes were first observed at I
   month follow-up (PR interval before intervention 139 (20) ms vs. 132
   (20) ms; QRS duration 88 (18) ins vs. 82 (19) ms) and at 6 months
   follow-up (QRS axis 77 degrees (33) before intervention vs. 72 degrees
   (53)). With the exception of the QRS duration, ECG intervals and axis
   were in a normal range in all patients before the procedure. Median QRS
   duration normalised at 1 year follow-up (83 (8) ms).
   Conclusion: After transcatheter ASD closure, decrease in right
   ventricular size began rapidly and was followed by reduction of the QRS
   duration and PR interval within weeks. Shifting to the left of the QRS
   axis was observed within 6 months follow-up. This study showed that ECG
   changes due to right ventricular volume overload can regress and
   normalise after percutaneous ASD closure in children.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies show that a single observation of tall precipitation in
   a hurricane's eyewall is often associated with intensification of that
   hurricane's surface wind. Using WSR-88D radars, we show that repeated
   observation of precipitation height provides even more information about
   wind intensification. If the frequency of tall precipitation in the
   eyewall is at least 33\% (1 in 3 radar volume scans), we find an 82\%
   chance of wind intensification. If this threshold is not met, the chance
   of wind intensification drops from 82\% to just 17\%. We show that the
   WSR-88D height measurements are reasonable using the TRMM Precipitation
   Radar.}},

Volume = {{27}},

Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{The study explores teachers' experiences of teaching a context-based
   chemistry course, Salters Advanced Chemistry, as compared with teachers
   of a conventional course. Second, main factors that appear to influence
   decisions over whether or not to adopt context-based courses are
   investigated. Two hundred and twenty-two teachers' views of a
   context-based and a conventional school advanced chemistry course were
   obtained from a questionnaire. Responses were analysed in six
   dimensions: motivation, chemical knowledge and development of concepts,
   learning activities, assessment, challenge to teachers and students, and
   teacher support. Both sets of teachers agreed that the context-based
   course is more motivating to study and teach, that students would be
   more interested in chemistry and more likely to go to university to
   study chemistry, that students would be better able to study
   independently but that it is more demanding to teach and study. The
   groups differed principally about concept development and teaching
   strategy. The context-based teachers believed that their course gave as
   good a foundation for further study as a traditional course and that the
   spiral curriculum was advantageous. Conventional course teachers
   disagreed with both statements. One significant implication to emerge
   from the study is the crucial role played by in-service support in
   influencing the impact of a curriculum innovation.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{40}},
Pages = {{6338-6347}},
Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{AIM: Recent studies demonstrating the direct involvement of dendritic
   cells (DC) in the activation of pathogenic T cells in animal models of
   inflammatory bowel disease identify DC as important antigen presenting
   cells in the colon. However, very little is known about the properties
   of colonic DC.
   METHODS: Using immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy and flow
   cytometry we have characterized and compared colonic DC in the colon of
   healthy animals and interleukin-2-deficient (IL2(-/-)) mice that develop
   colitis.
   RESULTS: In the healthy colon DC resided within the lamina propria and
   in close association with the basement membrane of colonic villi. Type 1
   myeloid (CD11c(+), CD11b(+), B220(-), CD8 alpha(-)) DC made up the
   largest (40-45\%) population and all DC expressed low levels of CD80,
   CD86, and CD40, and had high endocytic activity consistent with an
   immature phenotype. In colitic IL2(-/-) mice, colonic DC numbers
   increased four-to fivefold and were localized within the epithelial
   layer and within aggregates of T and B cells. They were also many more
   DC in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN). The majority (>85\%) of DC in the
   colon and MLN of IL2(-/-) mice were type 1 myeloid, and expressed high
   levels of MHC class II, CD80, CD86, CD40, DEC 205 and CCR5 molecules and
   were of low endocytic activity consistent with mature DC.
   CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate striking changes in the number,
   distribution and phenotype of DC in the inflamed colon. Their intimate
   association with lymphocytes in the colon and draining lymph nodes
   suggest that they may contribute directly to ongoing inflammation in the
   colon. (C) 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We have observed that CoO films grown on different substrates show
   dramatic differences in their magnetic properties. Using polarization
   dependent x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Co L-2,L-3 edges, we
   revealed that the magnitude and orientation of the magnetic moments
   strongly depend on the strain in the films induced by the substrate. We
   presented a quantitative model to explain how strain together with the
   spin-orbit interaction determine the 3d orbital occupation, the magnetic
   anisotropy, as well as the spin and orbital contributions to the
   magnetic moments. Control over the sign and direction of the strain may,
   therefore, open new opportunities for applications in the field of

Abstract = {{The stereomutations in nonsymmetrical salophen ligands 1-4 were studied
   by means of dynamic NMR and HPLC methods. DNMR experiments showed that
   in DMSO-d(6) hindered ligands 2-4 exist in two chiral conformations,
   depending on whether the imine carbon atoms are in a cis or trans
   disposition with respect to the plane of the central o-phenylenediamine
   ring, the latter being more stable by 1.0 kcal mol(-1). Owing to its
   higher dipole moment, in the apolar solvent C6D6 the cis conformer is
   destabilized with respect to the trans one, in agreement with the
   results of ab initio calculations. In DMSO-d6 solution the two
   conformers are in equilibrium through the less hindered rotation about
   the C6-N7 bond aligned to the a(6,7) axis, and the interconversion
   barriers range from 18.4 to 19.3 kcal mol(-1). The enantiomerization
   process is a two step-process that implies sequential rotations around
   the C6-N7 and the C1-N8 bonds, so that the rate determining step is the
   slower rotation around the more hindered C1-N8 bond aligned to the
   alpha(1,8) axis, and the energy barriers range from 21.4 to 21.9 kcal
   mol-(1). These values compare well with those determined by
   chromatography on an enantioselective HPLC column at low temperature,
   thus confirming that DNMR and DHPLC can be conveniently employed as
   complementary techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Machado-Joseph's disease is caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat
   expansion that is translated into an abnormally long polyglutamine tract
   in the protein ataxin-3. Except for the polyglutamine region, proteins
   associated with polyglutamine diseases are unrelated, and for all of
   these diseases aggregates containing these proteins are the major
   components of the nuclear proteinaceous deposits found in the brain.
   Aggregates of the expanded proteins display amyloid-like morphological
   and biophysic properties.
   Human ataxin-3 containing a non-pathological number of glutamine
   residues (14Q), as well as its Caenorhabditis elegans (IQ) orthologue,
   showed a high tendency towards self-interaction and aggregation, under
   near-physiological conditions. In order to understand the discrete steps
   in the assembly process leading to ataxin-3 oligomerization, we have
   separated chromatographically high molecular mass oligomers as well as
   medium mass multimers of non-expanded ataxin-3. We show that: (a)
   oligomerization occurs independently of the poly(Q)-repeat and it is
   accompanied by an increase in beta-structure; and (b) the first
   intermediate in the oligomerization pathway is a Josephin
   domain-mediated dimer of ataxin-3. Furthermore, non-expanded ataxin-3
   oligomers are recognized by a specific antibody that targets a
   conformational epitope present in soluble cytotoxic species found in the
   fibrillization pathway of expanded polyglutamine proteins and other
   amyloid-forming proteins. Imaging of the oligomeric forms of the
   non-pathological protein using electron microscopy reveals globular
   particles, as well as short chains of such particles that likely mimic
   the initial stages in the fibrillogenesis pathway occurring in the
   polyglutamine-expanded protein. Thus, they constitute potential targets
   for therapeutic approaches in Machado-Joseph's disease, as well as
   valuable diagnostic markers in disease settings. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The human reduced folate carrier (hRFC) mediates the membrane transport
   of reduced folates and classical anti-folates into mammalian cells. RFC
   is characterized by 12 transmembrane domains (TMDs), internally oriented
   N and C termini, and a large central linker connecting TMDs 1 - 6 and 7
   - 12. By co-expression and N-hydroxysuccinimide methotrexate (Mtx)
   radioaffinity labeling of hRFC TMD 1 - 6 and TMD 7 - 12 half-molecules,
   combined with endoproteinase GluC digestion, a substrate binding domain
   was previously localized to within TMDs 8 - 12 (Witt, T. L., Stapels, S.
   E., and Matherly, L. H. ( 2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 46755 - 46763). In
   this report, this region was further refined to TMDs 11 - 12 by
   digestion with 2-nitro-5-thiocyanatobenzoic acid. A transport-competent
   cysteine-less hRFC was used as a template to prepare single
   cysteine-replacement mutant constructs in which each residue from
   Glu-394 to Asp-420 of TMD11 and Tyr-435 to His-457 of TMD 12 was
   replaced individually by a cysteine. The mutant constructs were
   transfected into hRFC-null HeLa cells. Most of the 50 single
   cysteine-substituted constructs were expressed at high levels on Western
   blots. With the exception of G401C hRFC, all mutants were active for Mtx
   transport. Treatment with sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl) methanethiosulfonate
   ( MTSES) had no effect on hRFC activity for all of the cysteine mutants
   within TMD 12 and for the majority of the cysteine mutants within TMD
   11. However, MTSES inhibited Mtx uptake by the T404C, A407C, T408C,
   T412C, F416C, I417C, V418C, and S419C mutants by 25 - 65\%. Losses of
   activity by MTSES treatment for T404C, A407C, T412C, and I417C hRFCs
   were appreciably reversed in the presence of excess leucovorin, a hRFC
   substrate. Our results strongly suggest that residues within TMD11 are
   likely critical structural and/or functional components of the putative
   hRFC transmembrane channel for anionic folate and anti-folate
   substrates.}},

Abstract = {{Sialyltransferases (STs) are involved in the biosynthesis of
   glycoconjugates with important biological activities. Most STs utilize
   cytidine-5'-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac) as a common
   donor substrate. A bisubstrate analogue containing the donor substrate
   (CMP-Neu5Ac mimic) and the acceptor substrate (galactose) was
   synthesized. Four donor analogues having the partial structure of the
   bisubstrate analogue were also synthesized to support study of the
   structure-activity relationship. Each analogue contains an ethylene
   group in place of the exocyclic anomeric oxygen of CMP-Neu5Ac. The
   bisubstrate analogue exhibited only weak inhibitory activity to rat
   recombinant (alpha-2,3- and alpha-2,6-ST (IC50 = 1.3, 2.4 mM).
   Conversion of the C-1 carboxylate of the Neu5Ac moiety to carboxyamide,
   hydroxymethyl, or methylene phosphate each resulted in a reduction in
   inhibitory activity. Among the synthesized analogues, cytidin-5'-yl
   sialylethylphosphonate (4) was the most potent inhibitor against rat

   Neonatal ablation of NPY/AgRP neurons had minimal effects on feeding,

Abstract = {{In this paper a modification of the well known phenol-sulphuric acid
   method for the colorimetric determination of total carbohydrates in
   environmental samples is proposed. As in environmental samples different
   typologies of carbohydrates can be present, the solutions of glucose
   used as standard samples for conventional univariate calibration are
   replaced by solutions including neutral, uronic acid and aminosugars
   simultaneously to simulate better the qualitative composition of real
   samples. Then, principal component regression (PCR) or partial least
   squares (PLS) replace the univariate calibration. PCR and PLS show to be
   more accurate than univariate calibration because they are able to take
   into account the non-additive contributions to the spectral absorptions
   depending on the simultaneous presence in solution of neutral
   carbohydrates, uronic acids and aminosugars. In addition, the proposed
   procedure shows to have some potential applications in the speciation of
   neutral and uronic acid sub-fractions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{AIM: To determine the role of interleukin (IL)-17 in gastric
   ulcerogenesis.
   METHODS: Thirty-six gastric ulcer (GU) patients and 29 non-ulcer (NU)
   patients were enrolled in this study. Mucosal biopsy samples were
   obtained from the gastric antrum and GU site during endoscopy. Samples
   were used in in situ stimulation for 48 h in the presence of 10 mu g/mL
   phytohemagglutinin-P (PHA), histological examination, and Helicobacter
   pylori (H pylori) culture. IL-17 and IL-8 protein levels in culture
   supernatants were assayed by ELISA. IL-17 mRNA expression was analyzed
   by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). H pylori
   cagA and vacA status was assessed by reverse hybridization using a line
   probe assay (LiPA). IL-8 levels in culture supernatants were assayed
   after AGS cells were co-cultured with H pylori strain 26 695 or
   recombinant human (rh) IL-17.
   RESULTS: All 36 GU patients and 15 of 29 NU patients were found to be H
   pylori-positive, while 14 NU patients were H pylori-negative. All 51 H
   pylori strains from both GU and NU patients were cagA- and
   vacAs1/m1-positive. Antral mucosal tissues from H pylori-positive
   patients contained significantly (H pylori-positive NU patients: median
   467 pg/mg/protein, range 53-2 499; H pylori-negative NU patients: median
   104 pg/mg/protein, range 16-312, P < 0.0005) higher levels of IL-17 than
   those from uninfected patients. IL-17 levels at the ulcer site were
   significantly (ulcer site: median 1 356 pg/mg/protein, range 121-1 3730;
   antrum: median 761 pg/mg/protein, range 24-7 620, P < 0.005) higher than
   those at distant sites in the antrum. Biopsies from H pylori-positive GU
   and NU patients showed IL-17 mRNA expression in all samples whereas
   those from the antrum of the H pylori-negative controls showed no
   detectable expression. A significant correlation was seen between IL-17
   and IL-8 levels at each biopsy site (ulcer: r = 0.62, P < 0.0001;
   antrum: r = 0.61, P < 0.0001) in GU patients. RhIL-17 and H pylori
   strain 26 695 each stimulated IL-8 production from AGS cells.
   CONCLUSION: IL-17 may play an important role in the inflammatory
   response to H pylori colonization, and may ultimately influence the
   outcome of H pylori-associated diseases that arise within the context of
   gastritis. (C) 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{NOD2/CARD15 is the first characterized susceptibility gene in Crohn
   disease. The Nod2 1007fs (Nod2fs) frameshift mutation is the most
   prevalent in Crohn disease patients. Muramyl dipeptide from bacterial
   peptidoglycan is the minimal motif detected by Nod2 but not by Nod2fs.
   Here we investigated the response of human peripheral blood mononuclear
   cells (PBMCs) from Crohn disease patients not only to muramyl dipeptide
   but also to several other muramyl peptides. Most unexpectedly, we
   observed that patients homozygous for the Nod2fs mutation were totally
   unresponsive to MurNAc-L-Ala-D-Glu-meso-diaminopimelic acid (DAP)
   (M-Tri(DAP)), the specific agonist of Nod1, and to Gram-negative
   bacterial peptidoglycan. In contrast, PBMCs from a patient homozygous
   for the Nod2 R702W mutation, also associated with Crohn disease,
   displayed normal response to Gram-negative bacterial peptidoglycan. In
   addition, the blockage of the Nod1/M-Tri(DAP) pathway could be partially
   overcome by co-stimulation with the Toll-like receptors agonists
   lipoteichoic acid or lipopolysaccharide. Investigation into the
   mechanism of this finding revealed that Nod2fs did not act as a
   dominant-negative molecule for the Nod1/M-Tri(DAP) pathway, implying
   that the blockage is dependent upon the expression or activity of other
   factors. We demonstrated that PBMCs from Nod2fs patients express high
   levels of the peptidoglycan recognition protein S, a secreted protein
   known to interact with muramyl peptides. We proposed that through a
   scavenger function, peptidoglycan recognition protein S may dampen
   M-Tri(DAP)-dependent responses in Nod2fs patients. Together, our results
   identified a cross-talk between the Nod1 and Nod2 pathways and suggested
   that down-regulation of Nod1/M-Tri(DAP) pathway may be associated with
   Crohn disease.}},

Abstract = {{The invasive ability of tumor cells plays a key role in prostate cancer
   metastasis and is a major cause of treatment failure. Urokinase
   plasminogen activator- (uPA) and its receptor ( uPAR)-mediated signaling
   have been implicated in tumor cell invasion, survival, and metastasis in
   a variety of cancers. This study was undertaken to investigate the
   biological roles of uPA and uPAR in prostate cancer cell invasion and
   survival, and the potential of uPA and uPAR as targets for prostate
   cancer therapy. uPA and uPAR expression correlates with the metastatic
   potential of prostate cancer cells. Thus, therapies designed to inhibit
   uPA and uPAR expression would be beneficial. LNCaP, DU145, and PC3 are
   prostate cancer cell lines with low, moderate, and high metastatic
   potential, respectively, as demonstrated by their capacity to invade the
   extracellular matrix. In this study we utilized small hairpin RNAs
   (shRNAs), also referred to as small interfering RNAs, to target human
   uPA and uPAR. These small interfering RNA constructs significantly
   inhibited uPA and uPAR expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in
   the highly metastatic prostate cancer cell line PC3. Our data
   demonstrated that uPA-uPAR knockdown in PC3 cells resulted in a dramatic
   reduction of tumor cell invasion as indicated by a Matrigel invasion
   assay. Furthermore, simultaneous silencing of the genes for uPA and uPAR
   using a single plasmid construct expressing shRNAs for both uPA and uPAR
   significantly reduced cell viability and ultimately resulted in the
   induction of apoptotic cell death. RNA interference for uPA and uPAR
   also abrogated uPA-uPAR signaling to downstream target molecules such as
   ERK1/2 and Stat 3. In addition, our results demonstrated that
   intratumoral injection with the plasmid construct expressing shRNAs for
   uPA and uPAR almost completely inhibited established tumor growth and
   survival in an orthotopic mouse prostate cancer model. These findings
   uncovered evidence of a complex signaling network operating downstream
   of uPA-uPAR that actively advances tumor cell invasion, proliferation,
   and survival of prostate cancer cells. Thus, RNA interference-directed
   targeting of uPA and uPAR is a convenient and novel tool for studying
   the biological role of the uPA-uPAR system and raises the potential of
   its application for prostate cancer therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Transition polynomials for 4-regular graphs were defined by Jaeger {[}On
   transition polynomials of 4-regular graphs, in: Hahn et al. (Eds.),
   Cycles and Rays, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, 1990, pp.
   123-150.]. Many polynomials with a wide range of applications in
   mathematics and physics are transition polynomials. Such is the case for
   Penrose, Martin and Kauffman bracket polynomials. The Tutte polynomial
   of a plane graph is also a transition polynomial (in the case x = y).
   The authors in {[}J.A. Ellis-Monaghan, I. Sarmiento, Medical graphs and
   the Penrose polynomial, Congr. Numer. 150 (2001) 211-222.] generalized
   Jaeger's transition polynomials to a class of graphs including planar
   drawings of non-planar graphs. A further generalization was obtained in
   {[}J.A. Ellis-Monaghan, I. Sarmiento, Generalized transition
   polynomials, Congr. Numer. 150 (2003) 211-222.] where the authors
   defined transition polynomials for all Eulerian graphs. In {[}J.A.

   Sarmiento, Generalized transition polynomials, Congr. Numer. 150 (2003)
   211-222.] transition polynomials were seen as homomorphisms of Hopf
   algebras. Following a different approach, Aigner and Mielke {[}The
   Penrose polynomial of binary matroids, Monatsh. Math. 131 (2000) 1-13.]
   defined a transition polynomial for isotropic systems associated to

Abstract = {{RNA synthesis and processing are coordinated by proteins that associate
   with RNA polymerase II (pol II) during transcription elongation. The
   yeast Paf1 complex interacts with RNA pol II and mediates histone
   modifications during elongation. To elucidate the functions of this
   complex, we isolated missense mutations in the gene encoding the Rtf1
   subunit and used them to identify functionally interacting proteins. We
   identified NAB3 as a dosage suppressor of rtf1. Nab3, together with
   Nrd1, directs 3' end formation of nonpolyadenylated RNA pol II
   transcripts, such as snoRNAs. Deletion of Paf1, but not the Set1, Set2,
   or Dot1 histone methyltransferases, causes accumulation of snoRNA
   transcripts that are extended at their 3' ends. The Paf1 complex
   associates with and facilitates Nrd1 recruitment to the SNR47 gene,
   suggesting a direct involvement in 3' end formation. Our results reveal
   a posttranscriptional function for the Paf1 complex, which appears
   unrelated to its role in histone methylation.}},

Abstract = {{Hermatypic (or reef-building) corals live in obligatory Mutualistic
   symbiosis with the symbiotic dinoflagellates Symbiodinium spp.
   (generally known as zooxanthellae). In an attempt to establish a model
   symbiosis system consisting of a coral host and a monoclonal population
   of zooxanthellae, infectivity of five cultured Symbiodinium cell lines
   was tested on naturally aposymbiotic juveniles of Acropora tenuis. A
   clade A3 strain (PL-TS-1) infected the juveniles at high density and
   promoted growth of the host. To identify host genes involved in the
   establishment or maintenance of symbiosis, mRNA expression patterns were
   compared between aposymbiotic and PL-TS-1-infected juvenile polyps using
   the suppression subtractive hybridization technique. Two mRNAs, the
   expression levels of which were augmented more than twofold by the
   presence of the symbionts, were thereby identified. One of the mRNAs,
   AtSym-02, encodes a novel protein of 322 amino acids which is predicted
   to be a glycosylated trans-membrane protein. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Magnetic properties, phase evolution, and microstructure of melt spun
   PryFe88-yTi2B10 nanocomposite ribbons with different Pr concentration (y
   = 9.5-7) have been investigated. For Pr9.5Fe78.5Ti2B10, only the 2:14:1
   phase and the alpha-Fe phase existed, while an additional Fe3B phase
   appears for the ribbons with y = 9-7.5. On further decrease of the Pr
   content (y = 7), one extra phase, 2:23:3, is found. The exchange
   coupling effect, as evidenced by a Henkel plot is found, to decrease
   with the decrease of the rare earth content, which is attributed to the
   increasing of grain size with decreasing of Pr content. The magnetic
   properties of the ribbons first improve with the decrease of y, reaching
   a maximum at y = 8.5 (B-r = 9.6 kG, H-i(c) = 8.5 kOe, and (BH)(max) =
   17.8 MGOe), then decrease with further decrease of the Pr content (B-r =
   9.8 kG, H-i(c) = 5.6 kOe, and (BH)(max), = 14.5 MGOe for y = 7). In
   comparison with the Ti-free PryFe88-yTi2B10 (x = 9.5-7) ribbons,
   improved magnetic properties with higher intrinsic coercivity can be
   obtained in PryFe88-yTi2B10 nanocomposites. The maximum magnetic
   properties of PryFe88-yTi2B10 nanocomposites can be found in the ribbons
   with lower rare earth content, i.e. x = 9.5 for the former and y = 8.5
   for the latter. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All fights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal decomposition of bulk Ba(NO3)2, Ba(NO3)2 impregnated on
   gamma-Al2O3, and the release of NO2 stored on BaO/gamma-Al2O3 are
   investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and infrared
   spectroscopy (IR) as a function of baria loading. Two distinct weight
   loss events at similar to 434 degrees C and >= 545 degrees C are
   observed on the gamma-Al2O3 supported samples, corresponding to the
   decomposition of dispersed and bulk-like Ba(NO3)(2) to BaO,
   respectively. Decomposition of dispersed phase having a temperature of
   150 degrees C lower than bulk Ba(NO3)(2) is attributed to a strong
   interaction between dispersed BaO and alumina. Bulk-like phase shows a
   similar decomposition characteristics to bulk Ba(NO3)2 as BaO loading
   increases to 31.8\%. The decomposition products vary from predominantly
   NO2 at low temperature (<= 434 degrees C) to NO at high temperature (>=
   545 degrees C), consistent with the trend expected from the NO2 <-> NO +
   1/2O(2) thermal equilibrium. As the total baria loading is increased,
   the amount of dispersed phase saturates at a baria loading of 14\% (w/w)
   while the bulk-like phase increases without reaching saturation. Both
   phases can be regenerated on 15 min exposure of corresponding BaO/Al2O3
   to NO2 at room temperature. The release of these regenerated nitrates
   mimics the decomposition characteristics of impregnated Ba(NO3)(2) on
   gamma-Al2O3. X-ray powder diffraction and IR spectra show that the
   stored NO2 species gradually convert to a crystalline, bulk-like
   Ba(NO3)(2) phase when aged at room temperature. These results are useful
   for optimizing BaO loading strategies for lean NO, trap catalyst. (c)

Abstract = {{High-level ab initio molecular orbital theory is used to calculate the
   geometries, vibrational frequencies, atomic charges, and binding
   energies of the small clusters (LiH)(n), (NaH)(n), (BeH2)(n), and
   (MgH2)(n), (n = 1-4). For (LiH)(n) and (NaH)(n), there are planar cyclic
   structures when n = 2, 3. We have found the cubic structure T-d in
   addition to the planar cyclic D-4h when n = 4. The D-4h is less stable
   than the T-d geometry. For (BeH2)(n) and (MgH2)(n), when n = 3, there
   are three kinds of structures: chain C-2v, planar cyclic D-3h, and
   hat-like C-2v. The C-2v geometry is more stable than the others. When n
   = 4, there are four kinds of structures: chain D-2h, cubic T-d,
   string-like C-2, and cubic transformation C-1. The most stable compounds
   in the families of (LiH)(n), (NaH)(n), (BeH2)(n), and (MgH2)(n), are
   cubic T-d, cubic T-d, chain D-2h, and string-like C-2 geometries,
   respectively, when n = 4. Calculated binding energies range from -24 to
   -37 kcal/mol for (LiH)(n) and -19 to -30 kcal/mol for (NaH)(n),
   (BeH2)(n), and (MgH2)(n). The hydrogen atoms in hydride clusters always
   have negative charges. The atomic charges of planar cyclic structures
   are weaker than those of cubic structures, and there is a tendency of
   reducing along with the increase of the cluster size. The vibrational
   frequencies of planar cyclic structures have consistent tendency, too.
   It indicates that the bond distance increases with the ionic character
   of the bond.}},

Abstract = {{Palaeognathous birds (Aves, Palaeognathae) are uncontroversially the
   most basal clade among modern birds (Neornithes), having been defined
   for more than 100 years on the basis of their palatal morphology.
   However, because many fossil specimens that have been described to date
   lack detailed skull material (especially in association with
   postcrania), aspects of the early evolutionary history of these birds
   remain unclear, and their relationships on the basis of anatomical
   characters are as yet unresolved. In this paper we present a new and
   exceptionally well-preserved specimen of the Lower Eocene fossil
   palaeognath Lithornis that has a remarkable three-dimensionally
   preserved and complete skull. New anatomical information provided by
   this Danish fossil leads us to suggest that a number of cranial
   characters previously considered diagnostic for ratites may in fact be
   primitive among palaeognaths. The presence of members of Lithornithidae
   in the Lower Eocene (earliest Tertiary) is consistent with the
   hypothesis that basal divergences within Palaeognathae occurred at an
   earlier geological time, perhaps prior to the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T)
   boundary, as has been proposed based on evidence from much less
   well-preserved fossil material.}},

   intravenous infusion of Indium-111-labeled MSCs followed by whole body
   scintigraphies and autoradiographies of different harvested organs. In a
   second set of experiments, enhanced-GFP labeling allowed to observe
   distribution at later times using sequential infusions during the 3-week
   hypoxia exposure.
   Results: A 30\% pulmonary retention was observed by scintigraphies and
   no differences were observed in the global repartition between hypoxic
   and control groups. Intrapulmonary radioactivity repartition was
   homogenous in both groups, as shown by autoradiographies. BM-derived
   GFP-labeled MSCs were observed with a global repartition in liver, in
   spleen, in lung parenchyma and rarely in the adventitial layer of
   remodeled vessels. Furthermore this global repartition was not modified
   by hypoxia. Interestingly, these cells displayed in vivo bone marrow
   homing, proving a preservation of their viability and function. Bone
   marrow homing of GFP-labeled MSCs was increased in the hypoxic group.
   Conclusion: Adhesive BM- derived CD45(-) CD73(+) CD90(+) MSCs are not
   integrated in the pulmonary arteries remodeled media after repeated
   intravenous infusions in contrast to previously described in systemic
   vascular remodeling or with endothelial progenitor cells infusions.}},

Abstract = {{High-frequency temporal and spatial shifts in the various dissolved P
   pools (total, inorganic, and organic) are linked to upwelling/relaxation
   events and to phytoplankton bloom dynamics in the upwelling-dominated
   Oregon coastal system. The presence and regulation of alkaline
   phosphatase activity (APA) is apparent in the bulk phytoplankton
   population and in studies of cell-specific APA using Enzyme Labeled
   Fluorescence (ELF 1). Spatial and temporal variability are also evident
   in phytoplankton community composition and in APA. The spatial pattern
   of dissolved phosphorus and APA variability can be explained by
   bottom-controlled patterns of upwelling, and flushing times of different
   regions within the study area. The presence of APA in eukaryotic taxa
   indicates that dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) may contribute to
   phytoplankton P nutrition in this system, highlighting the need for a

Abstract = {{A method for the measurement of the photocatalytic activity of titanium
   dioxide dispersed in cementitious building materials was developed as
   part of the European Project Photocatalytic Innovative Coverings
   Applications for Depollution Assessment (PICADA). The method is based on
   a specially designed stirred flow reactor. It is aimed at the measuring
   of the photodegradation of organic compounds in air at ppb level at the
   surface of photocatalytic materials. The use of an actively mixed flow
   reactor results in a uniform concentration of reactants at the catalytic
   material surface at high conversion factors which also allows to measure
   the photocatalytic activity bypassing the limitations imposed by the
   concentration gradients of unmixed flow reactors. A titanium dioxide
   modified cementitious material was studied by applying the described
   method, with a benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and o-xylene (BTEX)
   mixture used as organic pollutant standard. The pollutant concentrations
   and irradiation levels used throughout the study were comparable to
   those that can be found under real ambient conditions. The effects of
   variation of pollutant concentration, irradiation level and titanium
   dioxide percentage in the cementitious materials were studied. The
   photocatalytic activity of a pure titanium dioxide film was also
   measured to stand as reference benchmark. The cementitious
   photocatalytic material showed an interesting photocatalytic activity
   with linear dependence versus pollutant air concentration and
   irradiance. On the other hand the variation of titanium dioxide content
   (from 0 to 5.6\% as dry powder) in the cementitious mixture showed a
   non-linear relationship denoting a relative loss of efficiency at higher
   concentrations. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The excitation energy in the multiphoton ionization spectrum of the
   trans-1-naphthol/N-2 cluster shows only a small red shift with respect
   to isolated naphthol, indicating a van der Waals pi-bound structure
   rather than a hydrogen-bonded one. To confirm this interpretation,
   high-level electronic structure calculations were performed for several
   pi and hydrogen-bonded isomers of this cluster. The calculations were
   carried out at the second order Moller-Plesset (MP2) level of
   perturbation theory with the family of correlation consistent basis sets
   up to quintuple-xi quality including corrections for the basis set
   superposition error and extrapolation to the MP2 complete basis set
   (CBS) limit. We report the optimal geometries, vibrational frequencies,
   and binding energies (D-e), also corrected for harmonic zero-point
   energies (D-0), for three energetically low-lying isomers. In all
   calculations the lowest energy structure was found to be an isomer with
   the N-2 molecule bound to the pi-system of the naphthol ring carrying
   the OH group. In the CBS limit its dissociation energy was computed to
   be D-0 = 2.67 kcal/mol (934 cm(-1)) as compared to D-0 = 1.28 kcal/mol
   (448 cm(-1)) for the H-bound structure. The electronic structure
   calculations therefore confirm the assignment of the experimental
   electronic spectrum corresponding to a van der Waals pi-bound structure.
   The energetic stabilization of the pi-bound isomer with respect to the
   hydrogen-bonded one is rather unexpected when compared with previous
   findings in related systems, in particular phenol/N-2.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the adsorption and the
   photocatalytic properties of TiO2 (P25) for the treatment of azo dyes,
   including one monoazo dye Procion Red MX-5B, and two diazo dyes Procion
   Yellow HE4R and Procion Red HE3B, are investigated by
   Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurement, spectrophotometer, total
   organic carbon (TOC), high proficiency liquid chromatography (HPLC),
   Raman spectroscopy (Raman), photoluminescence (PL), electron
   paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
   analyses. The results show that compared with activated carbon (AC),
   CNTs can comparatively better improve the adsorption of the dyes onto
   P25 due to the strong interaction between P25 and CNTs. Residual TOC in
   the solutions and the amount of cyanuric acid evolved after degradation
   both confirm that the adsorption ability of P25 is enhanced by CNTs.
   CNTs also facilitate the photocatalytic activity of P25 in the
   degradation of the three azo dyes more efficiently than AC. With PL and
   EPR analysis, the mechanism of the enhancement of the photocatalytic
   activity of P25 by CNTs is proposed. The excited e(-) in conduction band
   of TiO2 may migrate into CNTs, of which have special structure and the
   ability for e- transport. Thus, the possibility of the recombination of
   e(-)/h(+) pairs decreases. Meanwhile, O-2 adsorbed on the surface of
   CNTs may accept e(-) and form center dot O-2(-), which also leads to the
   formation of center dot OH in the system. Therefore, there are more
   radicals in the system, resulting in the quicker degradation of the
   dyes. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Evaluation of high-resolution images allows a systematic
   characterization of the walls of Dao and Harmakhis Valles, Mars.
   Variations in wall morphology are classified into three archetypes
   (exposed, mantled, and incised). Gullies are exposed by removal of
   semi-competent mantling deposits, suggesting progressive development of
   feature-types in an idealized sequence from i) mantled walls, to ii)
   incised mantle, and eventually iii) walls that display exposed gullies.
   Analysis of latitude, elevation, and wall orientation of 420
   representative sample sites reveals spatial patterns that display
   preferential clustering of the two end member morphologies: exposed
   gullies are favored at lower latitude, higher elevation, and on east
   facing walls; mantled walls are more prevalent at higher latitude, lower
   elevation, and on south and southwest facing walls. These morphologies
   and their patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that gullies
   emerge from beneath an ice-rich mantle that is degrading in response to
   local variations in total solar insolation.}},

Abstract = {{{[}1] Thermal and hydrological conditions in the active layer were
   investigated at a mature larch forest and an experimental cutover, to
   clarify the characteristics of heat and water budget in the active layer
   and to assess the influence of clear-cutting on permafrost and active
   layer conditions. Clear-cutting enhanced ground thawing and the
   difference in the active layer thickness between the forest and the
   cutover after 1 year was 14 cm. The soil water content drastically
   decreased at the forest, while that at the cutover was retained during
   the first thaw season after clear-cutting. Although the ground heat flux
   continued to increase at the cutover (the difference in the total
   amounts between sites from May to August were 44 and 69 MJ/m(2) in 1
   year and 2 years after the clear-cutting, respectively) marked changes
   in the active layer conditions were limited only to the first thaw
   season. The correspondent differences in the active layer thickness
   between the sites were 16 and 14 cm in 2 years and 3 years,
   respectively. Further increases in the maximum thaw depth at the cutover
   site were inhibited by the thermal inertial effect of the larger amount
   of ice in the second spring after disturbance. This suggests a
   self-retention mechanism of the active layer thickness after forest
   disturbance in this continuous permafrost zone.}},

Abstract = {{In this report, we outline a highly enantio- and diastereoselective
   one-pot method for the efficient synthesis of synthetically useful
   acyclic epoxy alcohols and allylic epoxy alcohols. Our method takes
   advantage of a highly enantioselective C-C bond-forming reaction to set
   the initial chirality. The resulting allylic zinc alkoxide intermediate
   is then epoxidized in situ using either dioxygen or TBHP in the presence
   of a titanium tetraalkoxide. Epoxy alcohols with up to three contiguous
   stereocenters are formed in one pot with excellent enantio- and
   diastereoselectivity. In cases where the zinc alkoxide intermediates
   contain two different allylic olefins, the more electron-rich double
   bond is chemoselectively epoxidized to afford an allylic epoxy alcohol.
   This method represents a highly efficient, stereoselective, and
   chemoselective approach to the synthesis of a wide range of useful epoxy
   alcohol and allylic epoxy alcohol products that were previously
   difficult to access.}},

Abstract = {{Density functional theory (DFT) was employed to investigate the behavior
   of a series of catalysts used in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER,
   2H(+) + 2e(-) - H-2). The kinetics of the HER was studied on the
   {[}NiFe] hydrogenase, the {[}Ni(PS3{*})(CO)](1-) and {[}Ni(PNP)(2)](2+)
   complexes, and surfaces such as Ni(111), Pt(111), or Ni2P(001). Our
   results show that the {[}NiFe] hydrogenase exhibits the highest activity
   toward the HER, followed by {[}Ni(PNP)(2)](2+) > Ni2P >
   {[}Ni(PS3{*})(CO)](1-) > Pt > Ni in a decreasing sequence. The slow
   kinetics of the HER on the surfaces is due to the fact that the metal
   hollow sites bond hydrogen too strongly to allow the facile removal of
   H-2. In fact, the strong H-Ni interaction on Ni2P(001) can lead to
   poisoning of the highly active sites of the surface, which enhances the
   rate of the HER and makes it comparable to that of the {[}NiFe]
   hydrogenase. In contrast, the promotional effect of H-poisoning on the
   HER on Pt and Ni surfaces is relatively small. Our calculations suggest
   that among all of the systems investigated, Ni2P should be the best
   practical catalyst for the HER, combining the high thermostability of
   the surfaces and high catalytic activity of the {[}NiFe] hydrogenase.
   The good behavior of Ni2P(001) toward the HER is found to be associated
   with an ensemble effect, where the number of active Ni sites is
   decreased due to presence of P, which leads to moderate bonding of the
   intermediates and products with the surface. In addition, the P sites
   are not simple spectators and directly participate in the HER.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular and behavioral evidence suggests that acid-sensing ion
   channels (ASICs) contribute to pain processing, but an understanding of
   their precise role remains elusive. Existing ASIC knock-out mouse
   experiments are complicated by the heteromultimerization of ASIC
   subunits. Therefore, we have generated transgenic mice that express a
   dominant-negative form of the ASIC3 subunit that inactivates all native
   neuronal ASIC-like currents by oligomerization. Using whole-cell
   patch-clamp recordings, we examined the response properties of acutely
   isolated dorsal root ganglion neurons to protons (pH 5.0). We found that
   whereas 33\% of the proton-responsive neurons from wild-type mice
   exhibited an ASIC-like transient response, none of the neurons from the
   transgenic mice exhibited a transient inward current. Capsaicin-evoked
   responses mediated by the TRPV1 receptor were unaltered in transgenic
   mice. Adult male wild-type and transgenic mice were subjected to a
   battery of behavioral nociceptive assays, including tests of thermal,
   mechanical, chemical/inflammatory, and muscle pain. The two genotypes
   were equally sensitive to thermal pain and to thermal hypersensitivity
   after inflammation. Compared with wild types, however, transgenic mice
   were more sensitive to a number of modalities, including mechanical pain
   (von Frey test, tail-clip test), chemical/inflammatory pain (formalin
   test, 0.6\% acetic acid writhing test), mechanical hypersensitivity
   after zymosan inflammation, and mechanical hypersensitivity after
   intramuscular injection of hypotonic saline. These data reinforce the
   hypothesis that ASICs are involved in both mechanical and inflammatory
   pain, although the increased sensitivity of transgenic mice renders it
   unlikely that they are direct transducers of nociceptive stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{Arg(8)-vasopressin (AVP), a circadian clock-controlled gene product, is
   released from the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) in mice in a
   circadian fashion. Previously reported differences in two mouse lines,
   initially selected for thermoregulatory nest-building behavior (building
   small nests (S-mice) or big nests (B-mice)) with different circadian
   organization of behavior and in number of SCN-AVP immunoreactive
   neurons, were further investigated. We confirmed and expanded the
   finding that S-mice exhibited constant high levels of SCN-AVP content
   with no apparent circadian rhythmicity, whereas B-mice had lower numbers
   of AVP positive cells which varied with time of day. We found that AVP
   mRNA expression levels at midnight and midday were similar in both
   lines, as established by in situ hybridization. When AVP transport and
   release were blocked by colchicine, SCN-AVP immunoreactivity was similar
   in both lines. This suggests that differences in SCN-AVP content depend
   on transport or release. Organotypic SCN cultures of B-mice showed more
   AVP release per neuron than cultures of S-mice. These results reveal
   that on a mechanistic level the mouse lines differed in transport and/or
   release of AVP in the SCN, rather than differential regulation of AVP
   gene transcription or number of AVP immunoreactive neurons. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Many cancers possess elevated levels of PtdIns (3,4,5)P-3, the second
   messenger that induces activation of the protein kinases PKB/Akt and S6K
   and thereby stimulates cell proliferation, growth, and survival {[}1,
   2]. The importance of this pathway in tumorigenesis has been highlighted
   by the finding that PTEN, the lipid phosphatase that breaks down
   PtdIns(3,4,5)P-3 to PtdIns(4,5)P-2, is frequently mutated in human
   cancer {[}3, 4].Cells lacking PTEN possess elevated levels of
   PtdIns(3,4,5)P-3, PKB, and S6K activity {[}5-8] and heterozygous PTEN+/-
   mice develop a variety of tumors {[}9-11]. Knockout of PKB alpha in
   PTEN-deficient cells reduces aggressive growth and promotes apoptosis
   {[}12], whereas treatment of PTEN+/- mice with rapamycin, an inhibitor
   of the activation of S6K, reduces neoplasia {[}13]. We explored the
   importance of PDK1, the protein kinase that activates PKB and S6K
   {[}14], in mediating tumorigenesis caused by the deletion of PTEN. We
   demonstrate that reducing the expression of PDK1 in PTEN+/- mice,
   markedly protects these animals from developing a wide range of tumors.
   Our findings provide genetic evidence that PDK1 is a key effector in
   mediating neoplasia resulting from loss of PTEN and also validate PDK1
   as a promising anticancer target for the prevention of tumors that
   possess elevated PKB and S6K activity.}},

Abstract = {{Background-Sildenafil inhibits phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5A) to elevate
   intracellular cGMP and to induce vasodilation. This effect has led to
   its use for treating erectile dysfunction. Although its influence on
   rest heart function has appeared minimal, recent animal studies suggest
   that sildenafil can have potent effects on hearts stimulated by
   beta-adrenergic or pressure overloads. We therefore tested whether
   sildenafil blunts dobutamine-stimulated cardiac function in humans.
   Methods and Results-Thirty-five healthy volunteers underwent a
   randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which cardiac
   function was assessed in response to dobutamine before and after oral
   sildenafil (100 mg, n =19) or placebo ( n = 16). Echo Doppler and
   noninvasive blood pressure data yielded load-independent contractility
   indexes ( maximal power index and end-systolic elastance), ejection
   fraction, and measures of diastolic function. In the initial dobutamine
   test, systolic and diastolic function improved similarly in both
   treatment groups (eg, peak power index rose 80 +/- 28\% in the placebo
   group and 82 +/- 31\% in the sildenafil group; P = NS). However, in
   subjects who then received sildenafil, their second dobutamine response
   was significantly blunted, with peak power, ejection fraction, and
   end-systolic elastance changes reduced by 32 +/- 34\%, 66 +/- 64\%, and
   56 +/- 63\%, respectively ( each P < 0.001 versus the initial response).
   This contrasted to the placebo group, which displayed similar functional
   responses with both dobutamine tests. Sildenafil treatment did not
   significantly alter diastolic changes induced by dobutamine compared
   with results with placebo.
   Conclusions-PDE5A inhibition by sildenafil blunts systolic responses to
   beta-adrenergic stimulation. This finding supports activity of PDE5A in
   the human heart and its role in modifying stimulated cardiac function.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Fruit and vegetable consumption is associated with lower
   rates of coronary heart disease. Results from observational studies
   suggest a similar association with stroke. Objective: To assess the
   evidence from prospective observational studies on fruit and vegetable
   intake and risk of stroke. Methods: A meta-analysis of prospective
   studies was conducted to examine the association between fruit and
   vegetable intake and stroke. Studies were selected if they reported
   relative risk (RR) and 95\% CI for any type of stroke and used a
   validated questionnaire for food intake assessment. Pooled RR were
   calculated and linearity of the associations was examined. Results:
   Seven studies were eligible for the meta-analysis, including 90,513 men,
   141,536 women, and 2,955 strokes. The risk of stroke was decreased by
   11\% ( RR 95\% CI: 0.89 {[}0.85 to 0.93]) for each additional portion
   per day of fruit, by 5\% (RR: 0.95 {[}0.92 to 0.97]) for fruit and
   vegetables, and by 3\% ( RR: 0.97 {[}0.92 to 1.02]; NS) for vegetables.
   The association between fruit or fruit and vegetables and stroke was
   linear, suggesting a dose-response relationship. Conclusions: This
   meta-analysis of cohort studies suggests that fruit and fruit and
   vegetable consumption decreases the risk of stroke.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, thermodynamic properties, namely retention volume,
   infinitely dilute weight fraction activity coefficient, Flory-Huggins
   interaction parameter, solubility parameter of the polymer, partition
   coefficient and diffusion coefficients of the various solvents in
   poly(methyl methacrylate co butyl methacrylate) (PMMA co BMA) at
   infinite dilution of the solvent have been determined by inverse gas
   chromatography (IGC). In this technique, a small amount of the solvent
   was injected into the capillary column and its retention time was
   measured and used to calculate several polymer-solvent interaction
   parameters which are mentioned above. The solvents used in this study
   were methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, methyl acetate, ethyl
   acetate, propyl acetate, dichloromethane, trichloromethane, acetone,
   methyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate for PMMA co BMA. The
   thermodynamic results, obtained from the experiments, indicated that
   trichloromethane and dichloromethane were the most suitable solvents
   among all the solvents studied for PMMA co BMA. The partition (K) and
   diffusion coefficients (D-p) of various solvents at infinite dilution of
   the solvent were calculated by using the model developed by Pawlisch et
   al. {[}C.A. Rawlisch, A. Macris, R.L. Laurence, Solute diffusion in
   polymers. I. The use of capillary column inverse gas chromatography,
   Macromolecules 20 (1987) 1564-1578]. The optimum K and Dp values that
   best fit the data were found and the model predicted experimental data
   very well. Vrentas-Duda free volume theory was used to correlate the
   diffusion data and to investigate the effect of solvent size on
   diffusion process. The theory has shown to correlate diffusion data
   above the glass transition temperature very well for the

Abstract = {{A core region surrounded by a rim characterizes biological interfaces.
   We ascertain the importance of the core by showing the sequence
   entropies of the residues comprising the core to be smaller than those
   in the rim. Such a distinction is not seen in the 2-fold-related, non
   physiological interfaces formed in crystal lattices of monomeric
   proteins, thereby providing a procedure for characterizing the
   oligomeric state from crystal structures of protein molecules. This
   method is better than those that rely on the comparison of the sequence
   entropies in the interface and the rest of the protein surface,
   especially in cases where the surface harbors additional binding sites.
   To a good approximation there is a correlation between the accessible
   surface area lost because of complexation and Delta Delta G values
   obtained through alanine-scanning mutagenesis (26-38 cal per angstrom 2
   of the surface buried) for residues located in the core, a relationship
   that is not discernable for rim residues. If, however, a residue
   participates in hydrogen bonding across the interface, the extent of
   stabilization is 52 cal/mol per 1 angstrom 2 of the nonpolar surface
   area buried by the residue. As opposed to an amino acid classification
   used earlier, an environment-based grouping of residues yields a better
   discrimination in the sequence entropy between the core and the rim.}},

Abstract = {{Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have the potential to damage cellular
   components, such as protein, resulting in loss of function and
   structural alteration of proteins. The oxidative process affects a
   variety of side amino acid groups, some of which are converted to
   carbonyl compounds. We have previously shown that a prostaglandin D-2
   metabolite, 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PGJ(2)), is
   the potent inducer of intracellular oxidative stress on human
   neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells {[}Kondo, M., Oya-Ito, T., Kumagai, T.,
   Osawa, T., and Uchida, K. (2001) Cyclopentenone prostaglandins as
   potential inducers of intracellular oxidative stress, J. Biol. Chem.
   276, 12076-12083]. In the present study, to elucidate the molecular
   mechanism underlying the oxidative stress-mediated cell degeneration, we
   analyzed the protein carbonylation on SH-SY5Y cells when these cells
   were submitted to an endogenous inducer of ROS production. Upon exposure
   of SH-SY5Y cells to this endogenous electrophile. we observed
   significant accumulation of protein carbonyls within the cells.
   Proteomic analysis of oxidation-sensitive proteins showed that the major
   intracellular target of protein carbonylation was one of the regulatory
   subunits in 26 S proteasome, S6 ATPase. Accompanied by a dramatic
   increase in protein carbonyls within S6 ATPase, the electrophile-induced
   oxidative stress exerted a significant decrease in the S6 ATPasc
   activities and a decreased ability of the 26 S proteasome to degrade
   substrates. Moreover, in vitro oxidation of 26 S proteasome with a
   metal-catalyzed oxidation system also confirmed that S6 ATPase
   represents the most oxidation-sensitive subunit in the proteasome. These
   and the observation that down-regulation of S6 ATPase by RNA
   interference resulted in the enhanced accumulation of ubiquitinated
   proteins suggest that S6 ATPase is a molecular target of ROS under
   conditions of electrophile-induced oxidative stress and that oxidative
   modification Of this regulatory subunit of proteasome may be
   functionally associated with the altered recognition and degradation of
   proteasomal substrates in the cells.}},

   novel QRS detection algorithm is developed and applied to the analysis
   for HRV of patients with sleep apnea. The advantageous of the proposed
   algorithm is the combination of digital filtering and reverse R wave
   detection techniques to enhance the accuracy of R wave detection and
   easily implement into portable ECG monitoring system with light
   complexities of computation. The proposed algorithm is verified by

Abstract = {{We investigate the interparticle interactions, phase behavior, and
   structure of microsphere-nanoparticle mixtures that possess high size
   and charge asymmetry.(1) We employ a novel Monte Carlo simulation
   scheme(2) to calculate the effective microsphere interactions in
   suspension, yielding new insight into the origin of the experimentally
   observed behavior.(3) The initial settling velocity, final sediment
   density, and three-dimensional structure of colloidal phases assembled
   from these binary mixtures via gravitational settling of silica
   microspheres in water and index-matched solutions exhibit a strong
   compositional dependence. Confocal laser scanning microscopy is used to
   directly image and quantify their structural evolution during assembly.
   Below a lower critical nanoparticle volume fraction (phi(nano) <
   phi(L,C)), the intrinsic van der Waals attraction between microspheres
   leads to the formation of colloidal gels. These gels exhibit enhanced
   consolidation as phi(nano) approaches phi(L,C). When phi(nano) exceeds
   phi(L,C), an effective repulsion arises between microspheres due to the
   formation of a dynamic nanoparticle halo around the colloids. From this
   stable fluid phase, the microspheres settle into a crystalline array.
   Finally, above an upper critical nanoparticle volume fraction (phi(nano)
   > phi(U,C)), colloidal gels form whose structure becomes more open with
   increasing nanoparticle concentration due to the emergence of an
   effective microsphere attraction,(3) whose magnitude exhibits a
   superlinear dependence on phi(nano).}},

Abstract = {{Friend spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) causes rapid erythroleukemia in
   mice due to expression of its unique envelope glycoprotein, gp55.
   Erythroid cells expressing SFFV gp55 proliferate in the absence of their
   normal regulator erythropoietin (Epo) because of constitutive activation
   of Epo signal transduction pathways. Although SFFV infects many cell
   types, deregulation of cell growth occurs only when SFFV infects
   erythroid cells, suggesting that these cells express unique proteins
   that the virus requires to mediate its biological effects. Not only do
   erythroid cells express the Epo receptor (EpoR), but those from mice
   susceptible to SFFV-induced erythroleukemia also express a short form of
   the receptor tyrosine kinase Stk (sf-Stk). In erythroid cells, SFFV gp55
   interacts with the EpoR complex and sf-Stk, leading to activation of the
   kinase and constitutive activation of signal transducing molecules. In
   this study, we demonstrate that SFFV gp55 can also deregulate the growth
   of nonerythroid cells when it is coexpressed with sf-Stk. Expression of
   SFFV gp55 in rodent fibroblasts engineered to express sf-Stk induced
   their transformation, as demonstrated by focus formation and
   anchorage-independent growth in vitro. This transformation by SFFV gp55
   requires the kinase activity of sf-Stk and the presence of its
   extracellular domain but not expression of the EpoR or the tyrosine
   kinase Jak2, which is required for activation of signal transduction
   pathways through the EpoR. Thus, expression of SFFV gp55 in nonerythroid
   cells coexpressing sf-Stk results in their uncontrolled growth,
   demonstrating a previously unrecognized mechanism for retrovirus
   transformation of rodent fibroblasts and providing insight into
   SFFV-induced disease.}},

Abstract = {{The cytoplasmic domain of the human erythrocyte anion exchanger I
   (cdAE1) serves as a center of organization for the red blood cell
   cytoskeleton as well as several metabolic enzymes and hemoglobin. The
   protein is known to undergo a reversible pH-dependent conformational
   change characterized by a 2-fold change in the intrinsic fluorescence
   and an I I angstrom change in the Stokes radius. While the exact changes
   in the molecular structure are unknown, on the basis of the crystal
   structure of the protein at pH 4.8 and site-directed mutagenesis
   studies, Zhou and Low (19) have proposed that the peripheral protein
   binding (PPB) domain of cdAE1 moves away from the dimerization domain in
   response to increasing alkalinity. To test this hypothesis, we have
   applied luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) to measure the
   intermonomer distance between donor and acceptor probes at the Cys(201)
   site (located in the PPB domain) within the cdAE1 dimer. This distance
   was found to increase as the pH is increased from 5 to 10, in
   recombinant forms of both the wild type and a mutant (C317S) of cdAE1.
   Furthermore, LRET measurements in red blood cell inside-out vesicles
   indicate that when cdAE1 is linked to the membrane, the intermonomer
   distance is larger at pH 5, compared to that of the purified cdAE1
   segments, and exhibits a different pH-dependent behavior. An increase in
   the distance was also observed on binding of a metabolic enzyme,
   glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, to cdAE1. These data provide
   the first demonstration of a defined change in the molecular structure
   of cdAE1, and also indicate that the structure under physiological
   conditions is different from the crystal structure determined at low pH.}},

Abstract = {{Epithelial cadherin is important in establishing and maintaining cell to
   cell interactions in epithelial cells, thereby playing an important role
   during morphogenesis. The epithelial cadherin molecules have three main
   regions: the N-terminal extracellular region, the transmembrane region
   that spans the cell membrane once, and the C-terminal cytoplasmic region
   that communicates with the cytoskeletal actin filaments through
   catenins. We report studies of the calcium-dependent stability of
   extracellular domains 1 and 2 of epithelial cadherin as a two-domain
   construct (MECAD12). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of MECAD12
   indicated a typical beta-sheet conformation in all solution conditions.
   Thermal- and denaturant-induced unfolding was monitored by CD. Distinct
   calcium stabilization was observed as a shift in T-m, from 40 (apo) to
   65 degrees C (10 mM Ca2+). Spectroscopic experiments agreed well with
   calorimetric (DSC). In the absence of calcium, the unfolding transition
   was shallow (Delta H-m. = 40 kcal/mol) but not obviously three state.
   Model-dependent analysis indicated that a second transition could be
   assigned to the unfolding, of domain 2. A calcium-binding constant was
   derived from the calcium-dependent shift in temperature denaturation
   profiles. The K-d that was obtained (55 mu M) was consistent with
   literature values. Thus, the modular domains of epithelial cadherin
   exhibit context-dependent behavior in both the apo and calcium-bound
   states. This cooperativity between the modules is consistent with the
   physiological role of epithelial cadherin in signal transduction through
   cell-adhesive contacts.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Major neurologic improvement at 24 hours after
   administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in
   acute stroke may predict good outcome at 3 months. Objective: To
   identify predictors of major neurologic improvement at 24 hours after IV
   rt-PA administration and its relationship with outcome at 3 months.
   Methods: The authors analyzed patients with acute stroke treated with IV
   rt-PA from two academic centers in London, Ontario, and 33 affiliated
   hospitals between 1999 and 2003. Major neurologic improvement was
   defined by a >= 8-point improvement in NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score or
   an NIHSS score of 0 or 1 at 24 hours. Good outcome was defined as a
   3-month modified Rankin Scale of 0 to 1. Results: Of 219 patients with
   acute stroke treated with rt-PA, 61 (28\%) had major neurologic
   improvement at 24 hours. Glucose levels < 8 mmol/L (OR 4.98, 95\% CI 1.6
   to 15.2), lack of cortical involvement on 24 hour CT scan (OR 3.97, 95\%
   CI 1.87 to 8.43), and female sex (OR 2.4, 95\% CI 1.12 to 5.13) were
   associated with major neurologic improvement after adjusting for
   covariates. Patients with major neurologic improvement had a shorter
   hospital stay (6.7 vs 14.3 days; p = 0.001). Major neurologic
   improvement was an independent predictor of good outcome at 3 months (OR
   12.8, 95\% CI 4.72 to 34.6). Conclusions: Major neurologic improvement
   after rt-PA was observed in 28\% of patients and independently predicted
   good outcome at 3 months. Female sex, glucose levels < 8 mmol/L, and
   absence of cortical involvement at 24 hours CT scan were associated with
   major neurologic improvement.}},

Abstract = {{We present results from an XMM-Newton observation of the head-tail radio
   galaxy IC 310 located in the southwest region of the Perseus cluster.
   The spectrum is well fitted by an absorbed power-law model with a photon
   index of 2.50 +/- 0.02 without significant absorption excess. The X-ray
   image shows a point-like emission at IC 310 without any sign of a
   structure correlated with the radio halo tail. The temperature of the
   intracluster medium surrounding IC 310 declines as a function of
   distance from the cluster center, from kT similar to 6keV in the
   northeast corner of the field of view to about 3 keV in the southwest
   region. Although we do not find any sharp edges in the surface
   brightness profile, a brightness excess of about 20\% over a smooth beta
   model is seen. The temperature also rises by about 10\% in the same
   region. This indicates that the IC 310 region is a subcluster probably
   infalling into the Perseus cluster, and the gas in front of IC 310
   towards the Perseus cluster is likely to be compressed by the
   large-scale motion, which supports the view that the IC 310 system is

Abstract = {{The non-a-helical C terminus of Xenopus lamin B3 (LB3T) inhibits the
   polymerization of lamin B3 in vitro and prevents the assembly of nuclei
   in Xenopus egg interphase extracts. To more precisely define the
   functions of LB3T in nuclear assembly, we have expressed subdomains of
   LB3T and determined their effects on nuclear assembly in Xenopus
   extracts. The results demonstrate that the lg-fold motif (LB3T-lg) is
   sufficient to inhibit lamin polymerization in vitro. Addition of the
   LB3T-lg to egg extracts before the introduction of chromatin prevents
   chromatin decondensation and the assembly of the lamina, membranes, and
   pore complexes comprising the nuclear envelope. When added to assembled
   nuclei, LB3T-lg prevents the further incorporation of lamin B3 into the
   endogenous lamina and blocks nuclear growth. The introduction of a point
   mutation in LB3T-lg (R454W; LB3T-IgRW), known to cause Emery-Dreifuss
   muscular dystrophy when present in lamin A, does not inhibit lamin
   polymerization, chromatin decondensation, or nuclear assembly and
   growth. These results shed light on the specific alterations in lamin
   functions attributable to a known muscular dystrophy mutation and
   provide an experimental framework for revealing the effects of other
   mutations causing a wide range of laminopathies.}},

Abstract = {{Fet3p is a multicopper-containing glycoprotein localized to the yeast
   plasma membrane that catalyzes the oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III). This
   ferrous iron oxidation is coupled to the reduction of O-2 to H2O and is
   termed the ferroxidase reaction. Fet3p-produced Fe(III) is transferred
   to the permease Ftr1p for import into the cytosol. The posttranslational
   insertion of four copper ions into Fet3p is essential for its activity,
   thus linking copper and iron homeostasis. The mammalian ferroxidases
   ceruloplasmin and hephaestin are homologs of Fet3p. Loss of the Fe(II)
   oxidation catalyzed by these proteins results in a spectrum of
   pathological states, including death. Here, we present the structure of
   the Fet3p extracellular ferroxidase domain and compare it with that of
   human ceruloplasmin and other multicopper oxidases that are devoid of
   ferroxidase activity. The Fet3p structure delineates features that
   underlie the unique reactivity of this and homologous multicopper
   oxidases that support the essential trafficking of iron in diverse
   eukaryotic organisms. The findings are correlated with biochemical and
   physiological data to cross-validate the elements of Fet3p that define
   it as both a ferroxidase and cuprous oxidase.}},

Title = {{The effects of insoluble surfactants on the linear stability of a
   core-annular flow}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{541}},
Pages = {{115-142}},

Abstract = {{The effects of an insoluble surfactant on the linear stability of a
   two-fluid core-annular flow in the thin annulus limit, for axisymmetric
   disturbances with wavelengths large compared to the annulus thickness,
   h(0), are the focus of this investigation. A base shear flow affects the
   interfacial surfactant distribution, thereby inducing Marangoni forces
   that, along with capillary forces, affect the fluid-fluid interface
   stability. The resulting system's stability differs markedly from that
   of the same system with zero base flow. In the thin-annulus limit (the
   ratio epsilon of the undisturbed annulus thickness to core radius tends
   to zero), common in applications, a scaling and asymptotic analysis
   yields a coupled set of equations for the perturbed fluid-fluid
   interface shape and surfactant concentration. The linear dynamics of the
   annular film fully determine these equations, i.e. the core dynamics are
   slaved to the film dynamics. The theory provides a unified view of the
   mechanism of stability in three different regimes of capillary number Ca
   (defined as the product of the core viscosity, mu(1), and the centreline
   velocity, W-0, divided by the interface tension, sigma(0){*}, that
   corresponds to an undisturbed (signified by the subscript 0) uniform
   surfactant concentration, Gamma(0){*}). In the absence of a base flow or
   in the limit of small Ca(<< epsilon(2)), Marangoni forces deriving from
   non-uniformities in the interface concentration of insoluble surfactants
   oppose the net capillary forces. These latter forces normally stabilize
   the longitudinal curvature and destabilize the circumferential curvature
   of perturbations to the interface. In the limit of large Ca(>>
   epsilon(2)), Marangoni forces destabilize disturbances with wavelengths
   that are large compared to the annulus thickness. For moderately small
   Ca(similar to epsilon(2)), increasing the Marangoni number Ma (defined
   as the product of (-partial derivative sigma{*}/partial derivative
   Gamma{*})(0) and Gamma(0){*} divided by mu(1) W-0) from zero increases
   the growth rates of all disturbances (with wavelengths >> h(0)) and,
   consequently, reduces the marginal wavelength below that typical of the
   capillary instability. However a further increase in Ma eventually
   reverses these trends. A very large value for Ma stiffens the interface,
   which opposes any local variation of the tangential velocity along the
   interface, and this is true whether or not there is a base flow. In the
   limit of infinite Ma, the growth rate of the instability is 1/4 of that
   of the clean interface and the marginal wavenumber, non-dimensionalized
   by the undisturbed core circumference, returns to its clean interface
   (capillary) value of 1. All trends are explained physically.}},

Abstract = {{We describe our vectorized and parallelized adaptive mesh refinement
   (AMR) N-body code with shared time steps, and report its performance on
   a Fujitsu VPP5000 vector-parallel supercomputer. Our AMR N-body code
   puts hierarchical meshes recursively where higher resolution is required
   and the time step of all particles are the same. The parts that are the
   most difficult to vectorize are loops that access the mesh data and
   particle data. We vectorized such parts by changing the loop structure,
   so that the innermost loop steps through the cells instead of the
   particles in each cell, in other words, by changing the loop order from
   the depth-first order to the breadth-first order. We also parallelized
   our code for distributed memory machines. The important part of
   parallelization is data decomposition. We sorted the hierarchical mesh
   data by the Morton order, or the recursive N-shaped order, level by
   level and split and allocated the mesh data to the processors. Particles
   are allocated to the processor to which the finest refined cells
   including the particles are also assigned. Our timing analysis using
   A-dominated cold dark matter simulations shows that our parallel code
   speeds up almost ideally up to 32 processors, the largest number of
   processors in our test.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanistic theories of plant competition developed to explain changes
   in community structure and dynamics along resource availability
   gradients have been mostly applied to temperate forests and grasslands
   where light and nutrients are the two main limiting resources. In
   contrast, the mechanisms underlying the structure and dynamics of
   water-limited plant communities have been little explored. Also previous
   mechanistic models rely either on complex simulators, which are
   difficult to interpret or on simple conceptual models, which ignore too
   many critical details. In this study, we develop a model of stand
   dynamics for light and water-limited forests of intermediate complexity
   and we provide an analytical framework for its analyses. The model is an
   individual-based simulator that describes the feedback between
   transpiration, stomatal function and soil water dynamics with
   asymmetrical competition for light and water. Trees allocate carbon to
   three main compartments: shoot, stem and roots. We use the model to
   explore general patterns that may emerge across levels of biological
   organization from the leaf to the stand. Model predictions are
   consistent with a number of features of Mediterranean forests structure
   and dynamics. At the plant-level the leaf-based tradeoff between carbon
   gain and water loss expresses as a tradeoff between mortality and
   growth. This tradeoff explains plant morphological changes in
   above-ground biomass and root to shoot allocation along a water
   availability gradient. At the community-level, tradeoffs among carbon
   acquisition and water loss govern the sign of plant interactions along
   the gradient. Coexistence among morphological types was not observed for
   the range of parameters and environmental conditions explored. Overall
   the model provides an unifying explanation for the observed changes in
   the sign of plant to plant interactions along environmental gradients as
   well as a process-based formulation that can be linked to empirical
   studies. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{he arrest of meiotic prophase in mouse oocytes within antral follicles
   requires the G protein G(s) and an orphan member of the G
   protein-coupled receptor family, GPR3. To determine whether GPR3
   activates G(s), the localization of G(alpha s) in follicle-enclosed
   oocytes from Gpr3(+/+) and Gpr3(-/-) mice was compared by using
   immunofluorescence and G(alpha s) GFP. GPR3 decreased the ratio of
   G(alpha s) in the oocyte plasma membrane versus the cytoplasm and also
   decreased the amount of G(alpha s) in the oocyte. Both of these
   properties indicate that GPR3 activates G(s). The follicle cells around
   the oocyte are also necessary to keep the oocyte in prophase, suggesting
   that they might activate GPR3. However, GPR3-dependent G(s) activity was
   similar in follicle-enclosed and follicle-free oocytes. Thus, the
   maintenance of prophase arrest depends on the constitutive activity of
   GPR3 in the oocyte, and the follicle cell signal acts by a means other
   than increasing GPR3 activity.}},

   330 g m(-2) when measured by an eddy covariance method or estimated from
   the soil sample endogenous CO2 production. The flux measured directly
   from the soil surface is probably an underestimation due to the ice
   formation within the chamber. Photosynthesis was found to be active also
   during winter and metabolic activity was found to show extrapolated zero

Abstract = {{We have studied mid-infrared intersublevel absorption of samples
   containing two layers of vertically self-aligned, self-assembled InAs
   quantum dots separated by a thin GaAs barrier. Samples with coupled
   quantum dots exhibiting different average size between the two layers

   compared with the absorption of a reference sample containing uncoupled

   narrow absorption line (similar to 20 meV full width at half maximum)
   mainly polarized along the growth axis in the range 110-150 meV. This
   absorption is attributed to the bound-to-bound transition between
   bonding (symmetric-like) and antibonding (antisymmetric-like) s state
   combinations of the double quantum dot structure. This assignment is
   supported by the electronic structure of the coupled quantum dots as

Abstract = {{Cajal's initial glomeruli (IG) and Dogiel's pericellular nests (PCNs)
   were first described from methylene blue preparations of healthy animal
   tissues around the beginning of the last century. Since that time,
   although many reports have been published concerning these structures,
   few have focused on their development and phylogeny in healthy animals.
   The aim of this study was to examine the phylogenetic development of the
   sensory neurons in Cajal's IG (also called axonal glomeruli) and
   Dogiel's PCNs in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) of the healthy adult
   frog, chick, rat, and rabbit. The three-dimensional architecture of the
   neurons was observed in ganglia by scanning electron microscopy after
   removal of the connective tissue. The neurons in the DRG of fish are
   known to be bipolar, but DRG neurons in the species examined here were
   found to be pseudounipolar, with single stem processes. The proportion
   of neurons having IG or PCNs increased with increasing phylogenetic
   complexity in the species examined here. Cajal's initial glomeruli, the
   convolution of the stem process near the parent cell body: In frogs, the
   ganglia were small and the neuronal stem processes were very short and
   straight. In chicks, the stem processes were longer; sometimes very
   long, tortuous processes were observed. However, no neurons with typical
   IG were observed in either species. Typical IG were observed in rats and
   rabbits; their occurrence was much more frequent in rabbits.
   Pseudounipolarization, i.e., the transition from bipolar to
   pseudounipolar neurons, is thought to save space, limit the length of
   neuronal processes, and reduce conduction time. However, an explanation
   of the evolutionary advantage of the IG, which is formed by the
   excessive prolongation of the stem process, remains elusive. The
   cytological and electrophysiological importance of IG has been
   discussed. Dogiel's pericellular nests (PCNs), which resemble balls of
   yarn made of thin unmyelinated nerve fibers around DRG neurons, have
   been observed in the DRG of rats and rabbits, but not in frogs or
   chicks. This interesting structure shows not only ontogenetic
   development in healthy animals but also phylogenetic development among
   species. The nerve fibers in the PCNs were less than 1.2 mu m in
   diameter and had some varicosities. An immunohistochemical study using
   anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) antibody revealed that some PCNs contain
   TH-positive nerve fibers and varicosities. Such TH-positive PCNs
   disappear after sympathectomy. These results suggest that the PCNs are
   made up of autonomic nerve fibers.}},

Abstract = {{The etiologic agents of human dirofilariasis in the Old World are
   Dirofilaria immitis, which cause pulmonary and subcutaneous nodules, and
   Dirofilaria repens, which cause ocular lesions. Although reports of new
   cases of dirofilariasis are sporadic in other parts of the world, a
   considerable amount of information is generated in Europe regarding
   human dirofilariasis. Most cases have been detected in the Mediterranean
   countries, Ukraine, and Russia; however, isolated or short series of
   cases have been reported in the Balkan Republics and central and
   northern European countries. Scroepidemiologic studies have provided
   evidence that humans living in endemic areas present rates of infection
   similar to those of the autochthonous canine populations. Antibodies
   against endosymbiont Wolbachia bacteria have been demonstrated recently
   in human Dirofilaria infections. During D. immitis infections, preadult
   worms and third- and fourth-stage larvae are often destroyed by the host
   reaction, releasing a considerable amount of Wolbachia, and a Th1-type
   response against Wolbachia and/or filarial antigens is mounted. On the
   contrary, infections with D. repens, in which worms frequently remain
   intact, no Th1-type response has been observed. As humans are resistant
   hosts, the Th1-response could have a role in the resistance against
   parasites. The causes for the rise in the incidence of human
   dirofilariasis as well as the possible application of Wolbachia antigens
   in the serodiagnosis of human infections are discussed. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{A genome wide search for new BH3-containing Bcl-2 family members was
   conducted using position weight matrices (PWM) and identified a large
   (480 kDa), novel BH3-only protein, originally called LASU1 (now also
   known as Ureb-1, E3(histone), ARF-BP1, and Mule). We demonstrated that
   LASU1 is an E3 ligase that ubiquitinated Mcl-1 in vitro and was required
   for its proteasome-dependent degradation in HeLa cells. Of note, the BH3
   domain of LASU1 interacted with Mcl-1 but not with Bcl-2 or Bcl-Xl. A
   competing BH3-ligand derived from Bim interacted with Mcl-1 and
   prevented its interaction with LASU1 in HeLa cells, causing elevation of
   the steady-state levels of Mcl-1. This suggests that the unliganded form
   of Mcl-1 is sensitive to LASU1-mediated degradation of Mcl-1. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Atrial fibrillation, the most commonly encountered arrhythmia in
   clinical practice, is associated with substantial morbidity and
   mortality. Its incidence and prevalence are increasing, and it
   represents a growing clinical and economic burden. Recent research has
   highlighted new approaches to both pharmacological and
   non-pharmacological management.
   Pooled data from trials comparing antithrombotic treatment with placebo
   show that warfarin reduces the risk of stroke by 62\% and that aspirin
   alone reduces the risk by 22\%. Overall, in high-risk patients, warfarin
   was better than aspirin in preventing strokes, with a relative risk
   reduction of 36\%, but the risk of major hemorrhage with warfarin was
   twice that with aspirin. Anticoagulation treatment needs to be tailored
   individually for patients on the basis of age, comorbidities, and contra
   indications. However, warfarin remains underprescribed in clinical
   practice, for reasons related to patients (comorbidities) and
   physicians. The limitations of warfarin treatment have prompted the
   development of new anticoagulants with predictable pharmacokinetics that
   do not require as frequent monitoring.
   Ximelagatran, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, was compared with
   warfarin in the SPORTIF program, which found both agents to be broadly
   effective in the prevention of embolic events, but observed abnormal
   liver function tests in 6\% of patients on ximelagatran. Liver function
   monitoring during treatment is thus needed. ldraparinux, a factor Xa
   inhibitor administered by once weekly subcutaneous injections, is being
   evaluated in patients with atrial fibrillation. The ACTIVE trial is
   currently assessing the role of aspirin plus clopidogrel, compared with
   adjusted dose warfarin, in the prevention of vascular events in
   high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation.
   Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II
   receptor-blocking drugs interfere with atrial remodeling and show
   promise in atrial fibrillation, as suggested in the LIFE trial.
   Preliminary studies suggest that statins may reduce the risk of
   recurrence after electrical cardioversion. Finally, percutaneous methods
   for occlusion of the left atrial appendage are currently under
   investigation in patients at high risk of thromboembolism but with
   contraindications for chronic warfarin.}},

Abstract = {{Ab initio calculations that explicitly include spin-orbit interactions
   are reported for the NeCl2 system of electronic states. A surprising
   curve crossing is observed for the C-2v, T-shaped geometry. Away from
   the C-2v geometry, the states mix, as expected. On the basis of these
   new results we propose a new mechanism for electronic energy transfer
   from highly vibrationally excited levels of the B electronic state of
   the chlorine molecule. It is proposed that as long as vibrational
   predissociation of NeCl2 proceeds by direct coupling of the initial
   state to the continuum states the Ne atom does not sample geometries
   that efficiently quench the Cl-2 B electronic state. However, when the
   vibrational dynamics changes to the intramolecular vibrational
   relaxation regime the Ne atom becomes quite effective at coupling the
   Cl-2 B (3)Pi(+)(0u) state with a (3)Pi(2g) state. (c) 2005 American

Abstract = {{Haemoglobin E beta thalassaemia is the commonest form of severe
   thalassaemia in many Asian countries, but little is known about its
   natural history, the reasons for clinical diversity, or its management.
   We studied 109 Sri Lankan patients with the disorder over 5 years. 25
   patients were not receiving transfusion; transfusion was stopped with no
   deleterious effect in a further 37. We identified several genetic and
   environmental factors that might contribute to the phenotypic diversity
   of the disorder, including modifiers of haemoglobin F production,
   malaria, and age-related changes in adaptive function. Our findings
   suggest that haemoglobin E beta thalassaemia can be managed without
   transfusion in many patients, even with low haemoglobin levels.
   Age-related changes in the pattern of adaptation to anaemia suggest that
   different and more cost-effective approaches to management should be
   explored.}},

Abstract = {{Fibrinolysis is the reference treatment for most myocardial infarctions
   with ST-segment elevation; alternatives are angioplasty, with or without
   stent. The earlier fibrinolysis is performed (preferably before
   hospitalization), the more effective it is. It can be optimized by
   adjuvant antiplatelet therapy, such as aspirin, and probably by
   anticoagulant treatment as well.
   Because fibrinolytic therapy is accompanied by intensive thrombin
   generation and activation, immediate and continuous adjunctive
   simultaneous heparin therapy is recommended. The efficacy of
   subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) HBPM) is at least
   equivalent to that of intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH), but its
   risk of severe (but not cerebral) hemorrhage is greater. Bolus LMWH on
   the other hand is associated with an increased risk of cerebral
   hemorrhage.
   Antithrombotic treatment thus appears optimal with bolus UFH at
   fibrinolysis and for at least 48 hours afterwards. An alternative after
   this bolus might be subcutaneous enoxaparin until discharge. Because the
   major drawback of both types of heparin is their rebound activation of
   thrombosis, oral anticoagulants are recommended thereafter.
   The combination of anticoagulant treatment + (low-dose) aspirin is not
   superior to aspirin alone when the target INR is below 2. Adequate
   anticoagulation with INRs greater than 2.0 consistently improves
   angiographic and clinical outcome. Bleeding (except intracerebral) is
   significantly increased whether the INR is greater than or less than
   2.0.
   Other treatments are being investigated. Pentasaccharide (anti-Xa)
   combined with fibrinolysis seems to reduce reocclusion more effectively
   than UFH. Oral postinfarction treatment with ximelagatran (a thrombin
   inhibitor), combined with aspirin, is associated with fewer
   cardiovascular events than aspirin alone. More studies are needed.}},

Abstract = {{Microtubule-associated protein tau is the major component of the
   neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer disease (AD) and is genetically
   linked to frontotemporal dementias (FTDP-17). We have recently shown
   that tau interacts with the SH3 domain of Fyn, an Src family
   non-receptor tyrosine kinase, and is tyrosine-phosphorylated by Fyn on
   Tyr-18. Also, tyrosine-phosphorylated tau is present in the
   neuropathology of AD. To determine whether alterations in the tau-Fyn
   interaction might correlate with disease-related factors in AD and
   FTDP-17, we have performed real-time surface plasmon resonance studies
   on a panel of 21 tau constructs with Fyn SH3. We report that the
   interaction between Fyn SH3 and 3R-tau was 20-fold higher than that with
   4R-tau. In addition, the affinity between 4R-tau and Fyn SH3 was
   increased 25-45-fold by phosphorylation-mimicking mutations or by
   FTDP-17 mutations. In vitro kinase reactions show that tau, with lower
   affinity SH3 interactions, exhibited a lower level of Tyr-18
   phosphorylation under our reaction conditions. Lastly, we have
   demonstrated that tau is phosphorylated on Tyr-18 in the tau P301L mouse
   model for tauopathy (JNPL3). In summary, our results suggest that
   disease-related phosphorylation and missense mutations of tau increase
   association of tau with Fyn. Because these effects are mediated through
   the 4R component of the tau population, these results also have
   implications for the FTDP-17 diseases caused by increased expression of
   4R-tau. Our data support a role for the Fyn-tau interaction in
   neurodegeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Antigen recognition by T cells is a key event in the adaptive immune
   response. T cells scan the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) or
   target cells for specific peptides bound to MHC molecules. In the
   physiological setting, a typical APC presents tens of thousands of
   diverse endogenous self-derived peptides complexed to MHC (pMHC
   complexes). When `foreign' peptides are presented, they constitute a
   small fraction of the total surface peptide repertoire. As T cells seem
   to be capable of discerning minute amounts of `foreign' peptides among a
   complex background of self-peptides, endogenous peptides are generally
   assumed to play no role in recognition. However, recent results suggest
   that these background peptides may alter the sensitivity of T cells to
   foreign peptides. Current experimental limitations preclude analysis of
   peptide mixtures approaching physiological complexity, making it
   difficult to further address the role of complex background peptides. In
   this paper, we present a computational model to test how complex, varied
   peptide populations on an APC could potentially modulate a T cell's
   ability to detect the presence of small numbers of agonist peptides
   among a diverse population. We use the model to investigate the notion
   that under physiological conditions, T cell recognition of foreign
   peptides is context dependent, that is, T cells process signals gathered
   from all pMHC interactions, not just from a few agonist peptides while
   ignoring all others. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, we establish a simple relation between the Dirac
   equation with a scalar and an electromagnetic potential in a
   two-dimensional case and a pair of decoupled Vekua equations. In
   general, these Vekua equations are bicomplex. However, we show that the
   whole theory of pseudoanalytic functions without modifications can be
   applied to these equations under a certain nonrestrictive condition. As
   an example we formulate the similarity principle which is the central
   reason why a pseudoanalytic function and as a consequence a spinor field
   depending on two space variables share many of the properties of
   analytic functions. One of the surprising consequences of the
   established relation with pseudoanalytic functions consists in the
   following result. Consider the Dirac equation with a scalar potential
   depending on one variable with fixed energy and mass. In general, this
   equation cannot be solved explicitly even if one looks for wavefunctions
   of one variable. Nevertheless, for such Dirac equation, we obtain an
   algorithmically simple procedure for constructing in explicit form a
   complete system of exact solutions (depending on two variables). These
   solutions generalize the system of powers 1, z, z(2),... in complex
   analysis and are called formal powers. With their aid any regular
   solution of the Dirac equation can be represented by its Taylor series
   in formal powers.}},

   simplify the analysis of the GEO 600 data set, it is desirable to
   combine these two calibrated outputs to form a single strain signal that
   has optimal signal-to-noise ratio across the detection band. This paper
   describes a time-domain method for doing this combination. The method
   presented is similar to one developed for optimally combining the
   outputs of two colocated gravitational wave detectors. In the scheme
   presented in this paper, some simplifications are made to allow its
   implementation using time-domain methods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents results of singlet oxygen generation experiments in
   a high-pressure, non-self-sustained crossed discharge. The discharge
   consists of a high-voltage, short pulse duration, high repetition rate
   pulsed discharge, which produces ionization in the flow, and a
   low-voltage dc discharge which sustains current in a decaying plasma
   between the pulses. The sustainer voltage can be independently varied to
   maximize the energy input into electron impact excitation of singlet
   delta oxygen (SDO). The results demonstrate operation of a stable and
   diffuse crossed discharge in O-2-He mixtures at static pressures of at
   least up to P-0 = 380 Torr and sustainer discharge powers of at least up
   to 1200 W, achieved at P-0 = 120 Torr. The reduced electric field in the
   positive column of the sustainer discharge varies from E/N = 0.3 x
   10(-16) to 0.65 x 10(-16) V cm(2), which is significantly lower than E/N
   in self-sustained discharges and close to the theoretically predicted
   optimum value for 02 (a (1)Delta) excitation. Measurements of visible
   emission spectra O-2 (b (1)Sigma -> X (3)Sigma) in the discharge
   afterglow show the O-2(b (1)Sigma) concentration to increase with the
   sustainer discharge power and to decrease as the 0,? fraction in the
   flow is increased. Rotational temperatures inferred from these spectra
   in 10\% O-2 - 90\% He flows at P-0 = 120 Torr and mass flow rates of m =
   0.73 - 2.2 g s(-1) are 365 - 465 K. SDO yield at these conditions, 1.7\%
   to 4.4\%, was inferred from the integrated intensity of the (0,0) band
   of the O-2 (a (1)Delta -> X (3)Sigma) infrared emission spectra
   calibrated using a blackbody source. The yield remains nearly constant
   in the discharge afterglow, up to at least 15 cm distance from the
   discharge. Kinetic modelling calculations using a quasi-one-dimensional
   nonequilibrium pulser-sustainer discharge model coupled with the
   Boltzmann equation for plasma electrons predict gas temperature rise in
   the discharge in satisfactory agreement with the experimental
   measurements. However, the model overpredicts the O-2 (a (1)Delta) yield
   by a factor of 2 - 2.5, which suggests that the model's description of
   nonequilibrium O-2-He plasma kinetics at high pressures is not quite
   adequate.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents a methodology for numerical analyses of coupled
   systems exhibiting strong interactions of viscoelastic solids and
   generalized Newtonian fluids. In the monolithic approach, velocity
   variables are used for both solid and fluid, and the entire set of model
   equations is discretized with stabilized space-time finite elements. A
   viscoelastic material model for finite deformations, which is based on
   the concept of internal variables, describes the stress-deformation
   behaviour of the solid. In the generalized Newtonian approach for the
   fluid, the viscosity depends on the shear strain rate, leading to common
   non-Newtonian fluid models like the power-law. The consideration of
   non-linear constitutive equations for solid and fluid documents the
   capability of the monolithic space-time finite element formulation to
   deal with complex material models. The methodology is applied to
   fluidconveying cantilevered pipes in order to determine the influence of
   material non-linearities on stability characteristics of coupled
   systems. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The functional form of ClpP, the proteolytic component of ATP-dependent
   Clp proteases, is a hollow- cored particle composed of two heptameric
   rings joined face- to- face forming an aqueous chamber containing the
   proteolytic active sites. We have found that isolated human
   mitochondrial ClpP ( hClpP) is stable as a heptamer and remains a
   monodisperse species ( s(20,w) 7.0 S; M-app 169, 200) at concentrations
   >= 3 mg/ ml. Heptameric hClpP has no proteolytic activity and very low
   peptidase activity. In the presence of ATP, hClpX interacts with hClpP
   forming a complex, which by equilibrium sedimentation measurements has a
   M-app of 1 x 10(6). Electron microscopy confirmed that the complex
   consisted of a double ring of hClpP with an hClpX ring axially aligned
   on each end. The hClpXP complex has protease activity and greatly
   increased peptidase activity, indicating that interaction with hClpX
   affects the conformation of the hClpP catalytic active site. A mutant of
   hClpP, in which a cysteine residue was introduced into the handle region
   at the interface between the two rings formed stable tetradecamers under
   oxidizing conditions but spontaneously dissociated into two heptamers
   upon reduction. Thus, hClpP rings interact transiently but very weakly
   in solution, and hClpX must exert an allosteric effect on hClpP to
   promote a conformation that stabilizes the tetradecamer. These data
   suggest that hClpX can regulate the appearance of hClpP peptidase
   activity in mitochondria and might affect the nature of the degradation
   products released during ATP- dependent proteolytic cycles.}},

   cyst-hamartomas (RCH) are derived from remnants of the tail gut, the
   most caudal part of the embryonic hind gut, which normally involutes by
   the 8th wk of embryonic development (3-8 mm stage). They have specific
   radiological and histopathological features that distinguish them from
   other similar formations (dermoid cysts, enteric duplication cysts and
   teratomas). We report a patient with adenosquamous carcinoma arising
   within RCH, who underwent complete resection of the cyst through
   anterior laparotomy, and reached complete (recurrence-free for 14 mo, so
   far) functional recovery. The cyst was incidentally discovered during
   hysterectomy 12 years ago. Diagnostic, therapeutic and histopathological
   aspects of this rare case are discussed. The mentioned period between
   diagnosis and surgical treatment suggests that RCH, given enough time,

Abstract = {{Hepatitis C virus non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) is a pleiotropic
   protein with key roles in viral RNA replication, modulation of
   cellular-signaling pathways and interferon (IFN) responses. To search
   for possible host factors involved in mediating these functions of NS5A,
   we adopted an affinity purification approach coupled with mass
   spectrometry to examine protein-protein interactions, and found that
   human arnphiphysin II (also referred to as Bin I) specifically interacts
   with NS5A in mammalian cells. Pull-down assays showed that the Src
   homology 3 (SH3) domain of amphiphysin II is required for NS5A
   interaction and that c-Src also interacts with NS5A in cells. IFN-alpha
   treatment reduced the interaction of NS5A with c-Src, but not
   amphiphysin II, suggesting that the latter is independent of the
   IFN-signaling pathway. NS5A is a phosphoprotein and its phosphorylation
   status is considered to have an effect on viral RNA replication. In
   vitro kinase assays demonstrated that its interaction with amphiphysin
   II inhibits phosphorylation of NS5A. These results suggest that
   amphiphysin II participates in the HCV life cycle by modulating the
   phosphorylation of NS5A. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   IL-23 and IL-17 (rather than IL-12 and IFN gamma) in the establishment
   and persistence of the inflammatory lesion. IL-10 appears to be the
   dominant cytokine mediating recovery. The source of IL-10 includes B
   cells (most probably in the peripheral lymphoid organs). However, the
   key IL-10-producing cell within the central nervous system is a

   significantly suppressed the nociceptive behaviors-evoked by either
   subplantar (1.6 mu g) or intracolonic (149 mu g) application of
   capsaicin. The antinociception produced by alpha- and beta-amyrin
   against subplantar capsaicin-induced paw-licking behavior was neither
   potentiated nor attenuated by ruthenium red (1.5 mg/kg, s.c.), a
   non-specific antagonist of vanilloid receptor (TRPV1), but was greatly
   abolished in animals pretreated with naloxone (2 mg/kg, s.c.),

   and beta-amyrin in the experimental model of visceral nociception evoked
   by intracolonic capsaicin. The triterpene mixture (3 to 30 mg/kg, p.o.)
   neither altered significantly the pentobarbital sleeping time, nor
   impaired the ambulation or motor coordination in open-field and rota-rod
   tests, respectively, indicating the absence of sedative or motor
   abnormality that could account for its antinociception. Nevertheless,
   alpha- and beta-amyrin could significantly block the capsaicin (10
   mg/kg, s.c.)-induced hyperthermic response but not the initial
   hypothermia. These results suggest that the triterpene mixture, alpha-
   and beta-amyrin has an analgesia inducing effect, possibly involving
   vanilloid receptor (TRPV1) and an opioid mechanism. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper we study changes in the size and the composition of the
   labour force in five selected OECD countries from 1983 through 2000. We
   apply a recent decomposition method to quantify the components of the
   change over time in the crude labour force rate and the mean age of the
   labour force. Our results show that the change in the crude labour force
   rate was dominated by the change in age-specific labour force
   participation rates. For the mean age of the labour force we find that
   for males the change in the age composition of the population
   predominately explains the overall change while the results for females
   are less clear-cut.}},

Abstract = {{Immunosuppression associated with measles virus (MV) can be demonstrated
   by cytokine production failure in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis
   (SSPE) and may have implications on the pathogenesis of the disease.
   Cytokines (IL-12, IL-10, IL-4, IL-17, IL-18, IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma) and
   chemokines (CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL2 and CCL5) were measured in the
   cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples from 60 patients with SSPE,
   36 patients with infectious and/or inflammatory (IN) and 28 with other
   non-inflammatory (NIN) neurological diseases by ELISA. IL-12 p70+p40 was
   elevated in CSF and sera of SSPE when compared to the NIN group.
   However, the CSF levels of IL-12 p70 alone were not increased,
   indicating an increase of p40. The CSF of SSPE patients also showed
   relatively higher levels of IL-10 than that of the NIN group. CXCL10
   levels in CSF were significantly higher in SSPE, whereas CXCL8 was
   increased in sera compared to NIN. No difference was detected in
   IFN-gamma, IFN-alpha, IL-17, IL-18, IL-4 or CCL2 and CCL5 levels. These
   results demonstrate that immune response against MV in SSPE may be
   impaired, although some T cell/Th1 inducing stimulations are present.

Abstract = {{Sr2MgSi2O7:Eu3+, nanotubes with red phosphor luminescent properties were
   successfully synthesized via a low-temperature hydrothermal route in
   order to understand the underlying relationship between shape and

   improvement of color purity. From emission spectra, the relative
   intensity of D-5(0) -> F-7(2) to D-5(0) -> F-7(1) transitions in tubular
   phosphors is higher than that of bulk material. The better color purity
   results from the more distorted lattices and relatively lower crystal
   symmetry around Eu3+, ions, which ascribes to the large surface area due
   to synthesize it in the form of nanotubes. Furthermore, the
   as-synthesized tubular red phosphor has shorter fluorescent lifetime and
   blue-shift phenomenon in excitation spectra than that of the bulk
   counterpart. Based on these results, shape-induced luminescent

Abstract = {{Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) activate downstream signaling through
   cognate growth factor receptor-induced dimerization and
   autophosphorylation. Overexpression of RTKs can lead to constitutive
   activation due to increased dimerization in the absence of ligand, and
   downstream signals are presumed to be the same as the ligand-induced
   signals. We have shown that the murine Ron (mRon) receptor tyrosine
   kinase exhibits constitutive activation of the MAP kinase pathway that
   is independent of the two docking site tyrosines, whereas activation of
   this pathway in response to ligand (macrophage-stimulating protein) is
   abolished in the absence of these tyrosines. Furthermore, we identified
   three tyrosines (Tyr-1175, Tyr-1265, and Tyr-1294) within the kinase
   domain that play critical but overlapping roles in controlling
   constitutive Erk activation by mRon. Phenylalanine mutations at these
   three tyrosines results in a receptor that fails to constitutively
   activate the Erk pathway but retains the ability to induce Erk
   phosphorylation in response to ligand stimulation. The ability of mRon
   to activate the MAP kinase pathway is dependent on c-Src activity, and
   we have shown that c-Src co-immunoprecipitates with mRon. c-Src fails to
   interact with mRon when the three tyrosines required for MAP kinase
   activation are mutated, whereas the presence of any one of these
   tyrosines alone restores Erk phosphorylation and recruitment of c-Src.
   Thus, the ligand-dependent and -independent activity of mRon can be
   uncoupled through the alteration of selective sets of tyrosines.}},

Abstract = {{The tryptase locus on mouse chromosome 17A3.3 contains 13 genes that
   encode enzymatically active scrine proteases with different tissue
   expression profiles and substrate specificities. Mouse mast cell
   protease (mMCP) 6, mMCP-7, mMCP-11/protease serine member S (Prss) 34,
   tryptase 6/Prss33, tryptase E/Prss22, implantation serine protease (Isp)
   I/Prss28, and Isp-2 are constitutively exocytosed enzymes. We now
   demonstrate that tryptase 5/Prss32, pancreasin/Prss27, and testis serine
   protease-1 are inserted into plasma membranes via
   glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors analogous to Prss21, and that
   these serine proteases can be released from the cell's surface by a
   phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. These data suggest that
   the C-terminal residues play key roles in determining where tryptases
   compartmentalize in cells. GPI-anchored proteins are targeted to lipid
   rafts. Thus, our identification of a number of GPI-anchored tryptases
   whose genes reside at mouse chromosome 17A3.3 also implicates important
   biological functions for this new family of scrine proteases on the

Abstract = {{The cell surface density of functional Kir1.1 (ROMK, KCNJ1) channels in
   the renal collecting duct is precisely regulated to maintain potassium
   balance. Here, we explore the mechanism by which phosphorylation of
   Kir1.1a serine 44 controls plasmalemma expression. Studies in Xenopus
   oocytes, expressing wild-type, phosphorylation mimic (S44D), or
   phosphorylation null (S44A) Kir1.1a, revealed that phosphorylation of
   serine 44 is required to stimulate traffic of newly synthesized channels
   to the plasma membrane through a brefeldin A-sensitive pathway. ROMK
   channels were found to acquire mature glycosylation in a serine 44
   phosphorylation-dependent manner, consistent with a phosphorylation-
   dependent trafficking step within the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi.
   Serine 44 neighbors a string of three ``RXR{''} motifs, reminiscent of
   basic trafficking signals involved in directing early transport steps
   within the secretory pathway. Replacement of the arginine residues with
   alanine (R35A, R37A, R39A, R41A, or all Arg to Ala) did not restore cell
   surface expression of the phospho-null S44A channel, making it unlikely
   that phosphorylation abrogates a nearby RXR-type endoplasmic reticulum
   (ER) localization signal. Instead, analysis of the compound S44D
   phospho-mimic mutants revealed that the neighboring arginine residues
   are also necessary for cell surface expression, identifying a structure
   that determines export in the biosynthetic pathway. Suppressor mutations
   in a putative dibasic ER retention signal, located within the
   cytoplasmic C terminus (K370A, R371A), restored cell surface expression
   of the phospho-null S44A channel to levels exhibited by the
   phospho-mimic S44D channel. Taken together, these studies indicate that
   phosphorylation of Ser(44) drives an export step within the secretory
   pathway to override an independent endoplasmic reticulum localization
   signal.}},

Abstract = {{The multibubble sonoluminescence (MBSL) emission intensity from aqueous
   solutions containing simple aliphatic organic acids (RCOCH) and bases
   (RNH2) and mixtures of the two types of solutes has been examined as a
   function of pH. In solutions containing either an organic acid or base,
   under pH conditions where the solutes are predominately in their ionized
   form (i.e., RCOO- and RNH3+), the MBSL intensity is identical with that
   obtained in pure water. Alternatively, under pH conditions where the
   solutes are in their un-ionized form the MBSL intensity is suppressed.
   However, in solute mixtures of RCOO- and RNH3+ in the pH range of 7 to
   9, the MBSL intensity was significantly suppressed relative to that from
   water. To explain the results of the mixed solute system it has been
   postulated that when the bubble/solution interface experiences the
   extreme temperature conditions that accompany bubble collapse, proton
   transfer occurs between acid-base ion-pair complexes, {[}RCOO-center dot
   center dot center dot RNH3+], adsorbed at the bubble/solution interface.
   The neutral forms of the solutes then evaporate into the bubble during
   its expansion phase and through a complex series of events, over a
   number of bubble oscillations, reduce the core temperature of the
   collapsing bubble and hence the SL intensity.}},

Abstract = {{Calcium entry through postsynaptic NMDA-Rs and subsequent activation of
   CaMKII trigger synaptic plasticity in many brain regions. Active CaMKII
   can bind to NMDA-Rs, but the physiological role of this interaction is
   not well understood. Here, we test if association between active CaMKII
   and synaptic NMDA-Rs is required for synaptic plasticity. Switching
   synaptic NR2B-containing NMDA-Rs that bind CaMKII with high affinity
   with those containing NR2A, a subunit with low affinity for CaMKII,
   dramatically reduces LTP. Expression of NR2A with mutations that
   increase association to active CaMKII recovers LTP. Finally, driving
   into synapses NR2B with mutations that reduce association to active
   CaMKII prevents LTP. Spontaneous activity-driven potentiation shows
   similar results. We conclude that association between active CaMKII and
   NR2B is required for different forms of synaptic enhancement. The switch
   from NR2B to NR2A content in synaptic NMDA-Rs normally observed in many
   brain regions may contribute to reduced plasticity by controlling the
   binding of active CaMKII.}},

Abstract = {{Two new analogues derived from the platelet activating factor (PAF),
   containing glucosamine instead of the acetyl group, were synthesized,
   and their effect on the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT was evaluated

   Starting with (R)-1,2-isopropylideneglycerol (3), the glycosylation
   acceptor 1-O-octadecyl-3-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-sn-glycerol (6) was
   synthesized in three steps. Glycosylation of 6 with the already known
   O-(3,4,6-tri-O-acetyl-2-deoxy-2-dimethylmaleimido-beta-D-glycopyranosyl)
   trichloracetimidate gave
   1-O-octadecyl-2-O-(3',4',6'-tri-O-acetyl-2'-deoxy-2'-dimethylmaleimido-b
   eta-D-glucopyranosyl)-3-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-sn-glycerol (7). After
   removing the (tert-butyldimethyl)silyl (TBDMS) group with FeCl3 center

   proliferation of HaCaT cells by 26\% at nontoxic concentrations, while 1
   increased the proliferation rate by 30\% at low concentrations. At
   higher concentrations, both compounds showed cytotoxic properties with
   LD50 = 30 mu mol/L (1) and LD50 = 5-6 mu mol/L (2). Both 1 and 2 were

Abstract = {{We have studied the thermodynamic properties of hen egg white lysozyme
   crystals using a novel simulation method combining atomistic Monte Carlo
   simulation to calculate van der Waals interactions and the boundary
   element method to solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation for the
   electrostatic interactions. For computational simplicity, we treat the
   protein as a rigid body, using the crystallographic coordinates of all
   non-hydrogen atoms of the protein to describe the detailed shape. NVT
   Monte Carlo simulations are carried out for tetragonal and orthorhombic
   crystals to obtain the van der Waals energy, incorporating an implicit
   solvation effect. For crystal phases, an optimally linearized
   Poisson-Boltzmann equation is used to include the effect of the Donnan
   equilibrium of the salt ions. The Helmholtz energy is obtained from
   expanded ensemble Monte Carlo simulations. By using the force field
   parameters that had previously been tuned for the solution properties,
   reasonable agreement with experiment is found for the crystallization
   energy of the tetragonal form. The prediction of the entropy is also
   reasonable with a slight underestimation suggesting the release of a few
   water molecules per protein during the crystallization. However, the
   predictions of the properties of the orthorhombic crystal are poor,
   probably due to differences in the solvation structure as indicated by
   experiments, and also as a result of the approximate force field used.}},

   velocity, and source electron population. The energies to which Alfven
   waves can accelerate electrons are primarily determined by the peak
   Alfven speed below the DC potential drop and to a lesser extent by the
   amplitude of the wave parallel electric field. The observed electron
   signatures can be used to obtain information about the peak Alfven

   of critical parameters affecting resolution, was found to be optimum at
   65 : 1. In order to elucidate the resolution mechanism, an
   inclusion-complex of the arylalcohols with sulfonated beta-CD was
   prepared by mixing and shaking in solution, and then characterized by
   cyclic voltammetry (CV). The inclusion mechanism was also discussed
   using experimental results.}},

Title = {{A spectroscopic analysis of blue stragglers, horizontal branch stars,
   and turnoff stars in four globular clusters}},

Abstract = {{We present a spectroscopic analysis of HST STIS and FOS low- and
   intermediate-resolution spectroscopy of 55 stars in four globular
   clusters ( 47 Tucanae, M3, NGC 6752, and NGC 6397). Stars hotter than
   T-eff = 5750 K and with a signal-to-noise ratio larger than 15 were
   analyzed with non-local thermodynamic equilibrium model atmospheres, and
   values for their effective temperatures and gravities were obtained.
   Using photometric fluxes, we also obtained radii, luminosities, and
   spectroscopic masses.
   Twenty-four stars in our sample are blue stragglers (BSs). Their
   photometric colors and magnitudes place these BSs above and redward of
   the clusters' zero-age main sequence: this is consistent with the
   gravities we find for these stars, which are lower than zero-age
   main-sequence gravities. A comparison with stellar evolutionary tracks
   shows that almost all of our BSs are in the Hertzsprung gap. This is
   contrary to theory, because of the short timescale expected for stars in
   this evolutionary phase.
   The mean BS mass is 1.04M(circle dot) for 14 nonvariable stars, or 1.07
   M-circle dot counting all 24 BSs in our sample. For the nonvariable
   stars the mean BS masses for individual clusters are 1.73, 1.01, 0.95,
   and 0.72 M-circle dot for NGC 6397, NGC 6752, 47 Tuc, and M3,
   respectively. Adding the variable stars ( which improves the statistics
   but increases the uncertainty), the mean masses become 1.27, 1.05, 0.99,
   and 0.99 M-circle dot, respectively. Although there is considerable
   scatter, the BS spectroscopic masses correlate with both effective
   temperature and brightness of the stars, as expected.
   The mean nonvariable turnoff star mass ( 0.58 M-circle dot) is
   significantly below the values determined for the BSs and below the
   main-sequence turnoff mass. The mean nonvariable horizontal-branch (HB)
   star mass is higher than expected (0.79 M-circle dot). In particular,
   several HB stars have masses well above the main-sequence turnoff mass.
   Some of these HB stars are suspected of actually being BSs, since most
   of them reside at ambiguous locations on the CMD, making them prone to
   misclassification.
   Values and limits to the stellar rotation rates (v sin i) are imposed by
   fitting weak metal lines, the Ca II K line wings, or the helium lines
   for the hotter stars. Five BSs with reasonably constrained rotations
   show average and median v sin i values of 109 and 100 km s(-1),
   respectively, suggesting v similar to 160 km s(-1). At least some GC BSs
   are very rapid rotators, but this information cannot yet constrain their
   origin as stellar collision or binary mergers because of the lack of
   clear theoretical predictions. Six extreme HB stars have rotation rates
   v sin i between 50 and 200 km s(-1), which are high for these stars and
   might indicate a binary origin.
   De Marco et al. found that four BSs and two HB stars in our sample have
   Balmer jumps that are too large for the effective temperatures implied
   by the slopes of their Paschen continua. Two additional HB stars are now
   identified in the current study as having the same feature. For these
   stars, the presence of a disk of partly ionized material is suspected,
   although high stellar rotation rates could also partly explain the data.}},

Abstract = {{Some laser applications produce high power densities that can be
   dangerous to equipment and operators. We have fabricated thin-film
   coatings by using molecular electrostatic self-assembly to create a
   spectrally selective absorbing coating that is able to withstand thermal
   fluctuations from -20 degrees C to 120 degrees C. We made the thin-film
   coatings by alternating deposition of an organic dye and gold colloidal
   nanoparticles onto glass substrates. Nile Blue A perchlorate, with a
   maximum absorbance slightly above 632 nm, was chosen as the organic dye.
   Strong coupling between the dye molecules and the gold nanoparticles
   provides a redshift that increases as the film's thickness is increased.
   The incorporation of the gold colloidal nanoparticles also decreases the
   resistivity of the film. The resistivity of the film was measured with a
   four-point probe and found to be similar to 10 ohm/cm for the two
   samples measured. Atomic-force microscopy was used to show that film
   thickness increased 2.4 nm per bilayer. The optical properties of the
   film were measured at the end of every 5 thermal cycles from -20 degrees
   C to 120 degrees C, and negligible degradation was observed after 30
   cycles. (c) 2005 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Left-handed Z-DNA is a higher-energy form of the double helix,
   stabilized by negative supercoiling generated by transcription or
   unwrapping nucleosomes(1). Regions near the transcription start site
   frequently contain sequence motifs favourable for forming Z-DNA(2), and
   formation of Z-DNA near the promoter region stimulates
   transcription(3,4). Z-DNA is also stabilized by specific protein
   binding; several proteins have been identified with low nanomolar
   binding constants(5-9). Z-DNA occurs in a dynamic state, forming as a
   result of physiological processes then relaxing to the right-handed
   B-DNA(1). Each time a DNA segment turns into Z-DNA, two B-Z junctions
   form. These have been examined extensively(10-12), but their structure
   was unknown. Here we describe the structure of a B-Z junction as
   revealed by X-ray crystallography at 2.6 angstrom resolution. A
   15-base-pair segment of DNA is stabilized at one end in the Z
   conformation by Z-DNA binding proteins, while the other end remains
   B-DNA. Continuous stacking of bases between B-DNA and Z-DNA segments is
   found, with the breaking of one base pair at the junction and extrusion
   of the bases on each side (Fig. 1). These extruded bases may be sites
   for DNA modification.}},

Abstract = {{Cytochrome c and xylanase were adsorbed onto two mesoporous materials,
   SBA-15 (a pure silicate) and MSE (an organosilicate), with very similar
   physical properties but differing chemical compositions. A methodical
   order was developed whereby the influences of surface area, pore size,
   extent of order, particle size, surface potentials, isoelectric points,
   pH, and ionic strength on immobilization were explored. In silico
   studies of cytochrome c and xylanase were conducted before any
   immobilization experiments were carried out in order to select
   compatible materials and probe the interactions between the adsorbents
   and the mesoporous silicates. The stabilities of the mesoporous
   materials at different pH values and their isoelectric points and zeta
   potentials were determined. Electrostatic attraction dominated protein
   interactions with SBA-15, while weaker hydrophobic interactions are more
   prominent with MSE for both cytochrome c and xylanase. The ability of
   the immobilized protein/enzyme to withstand leaching was measured, and
   activity tests and thermostability experiments were conducted.
   Cytochrome c immobilized onto SBA-15 showed resistance to leaching and
   an enhanced activity compared to free protein. The immobilized
   cytochrome c was shown to have higher intrinsic activity but lower
   thermostability than free cytochrome c. From an extensive
   characterization of the surface properties of the silicates and
   proteins, we describe a systematic methodology for the adsorption of
   proteins onto mesoporous silicates. This approach can be utilized in the
   design of a solid support for any protein.}},

   han, reduced the transcript level of CG13758. We found that Han was
   expressed specifically in 13 pairs of circadian clock neurons in the
   adult brain. han null files showed arrhythmic circadian behavior in
   constant darkness. The behavioral characteristics of han null mutants
   were similar to those of pdf null mutants. We also found that PDF binds
   specifically to S2 cells expressing Han, which results in the elevation
   of c AMP synthesis. Therefore, we herein propose that Han is a PDF
   receptor regulating circadian behavioral rhythm through coordination of
   activities of clock neurons.}},

Abstract = {{We have previously reported that expression of periostin mRNA is
   markedly reduced in a variety of human cancer cell lines, suggesting
   that downregulation of petiostin mRNA expression is correlated with the
   development of human cancers. In our study, to clarify the role of the
   periostin in human bladder carcinogenesis, we examined the expression of
   periostin mRNA in normal bladder tissues, bladder cancer tissues and
   bladder cancer cell lines by Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR analysis.
   Although the expression of periostin mRNA was detected in 100\% (515) of
   normal bladder tissues, it was not detected in 3 human bladder cancer
   cell lines examined. It was also detected in 81.8\% (9/11) of grade 1,
   40.0\% (4/10) of grade 2 and 33.3\% (4/12) of grade 3 bladder cancer
   tissues, indicating that downregulation of periostin mRNA is
   significantly related to higher grade bladder cancer (p < 0.05). To
   assess the tumor suppressor function of periostin, we investigated the
   ability of periostin gene to suppress malignant phenotypes of a bladder
   cancer cell line, SBT31A. Ectopic expression of petiostin gene by a
   retrovirus vector suppressed in vitro cell invasiveness of the bladder
   cancer cells without affecting cell proliferation and tumor growth in
   nude mice. Periostin also suppressed in vivo lung metastasis of the
   mouse melanoma cell line, B16-F10. Mutational analysis revealed that the
   C-terminal region of periostin was sufficient to suppress cell
   invasiveness and metastasis of the cancer cells. Periostin may play a
   role as a suppressor of invasion and metastasis in the progression of
   human bladder cancers. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Results of a study of the valence electronic structure of norbornene
   (C7H10), up to binding energies of 30 eV, are reported. Experimental
   electron momentum spectroscopy (EMS) and theoretical Green's function
   and density functional theory approaches were utilized in this
   investigation. A stringent comparison between the electron momentum
   spectroscopy and theoretical orbital momentum distributions found that,
   among the tested models, the combination of the Becke-Perdew functional
   and a polarized valence basis set of triple-zeta quality provides the
   best representation of the electron momentum distributions for all 19
   valence orbitals of norbornene. This experimentally validated model was
   then used to extract other molecular properties of norbornene (geometry,
   infrared spectrum). When these calculated properties are compared to
   corresponding results from independent measurements, reasonable
   agreement is typically found. Due to the improved energy resolution, EMS
   is now at a stage to very finely image the effective topology of
   molecular orbitals at varying distances from the molecular center, and
   the way the individual atomic components interact with each other, often
   in excellent agreement with theory. This will be demonstrated here.
   Green's Function calculations employing the third-order algebraic
   diagrammatic construction scheme indicate that the orbital picture of
   ionization breaks down at binding energies larger than about 22 eV.
   Despite this complication, they enable insights within 0.2 eV accuracy
   into the available ultraviolet emission and newly presented (e,2e)
   ionization spectra. Finally, limitations inherent to calculations of
   momentum distributions based on Kohn-Sham orbitals and employing the
   vertical depiction of ionization processes are emphasized, in a formal
   discussion of EMS cross sections employing Dyson orbitals.}},

Abstract = {{A field campaign was carried out in the alpine meadow of Heihe River
   Basin, north-west China on 11-15 July 2002. Several bio-geophysical
   parameters such as leaf area index (LAI) were measured according to
   VALERI sampling procedures within 38 elementary sampling units (ESUs) in
   the 3 kin x 3 km `VALERI' site. A quarter scene of Landsat 7 ETM+ with
   acquisition times close to the field campaign time was atmospherically
   and geographically corrected. Three kinds of spectral vegetation index
   maps including NDVI SR and MSAVI in the sampling area were derived from
   the corrected ETM + image. The two sets of LAI data measured with
   LAI-2000 and TRAC instrument at the same site were inter-compared. This
   is particularly meaningful for assessing the accuracy of LAI
   measurements. The relationships between the measured LAI and the three
   kinds of vegetation indices were also investigated. These comparisons
   found good relationships between the measured LAI and the different
   vegetation indices in most cases. Among them, NDVI seems the most
   promising estimator for extraction of LAI for the alpine meadow. In
   addition, the LAI-2000 seems to perform better for LAI measurement in
   the alpine meadow than the TRAC instrument.}},

Abstract = {{Hexamericring- shaped ATPases of the AAA+ (for ATPases associated with
   various cellular activities) superfamily power cellular processes in
   which macromolecular structures and complexes are dismantled or
   denatured, but the mechanisms used by these machine-like enzymes are
   poorly understood. By covalently linking active and inactive subunits of
   the ATPase ClpX to form hexamers, here we show that diverse geometric
   arrangements can support the enzymatic unfolding of protein substrates
   and translocation of the denatured polypeptide into the ClpP peptidase
   for degradation. These studies indicate that the ClpX power stroke is
   generated by ATP hydrolysis in a single subunit, rule out concerted and
   strict sequential ATP hydrolysis models, and provide evidence for a
   probabilistic sequence of nucleotide hydrolysis. This mechanism would
   allow any ClpX subunit in contact with a translocating polypeptide to
   hydrolyse ATP to drive substrate spooling into ClpP, and would prevent
   stalling if one subunit failed to bind or hydrolyse ATP.
   Energy-dependent machines with highly diverse quaternary architectures
   and molecular functions could operate by similar asymmetric mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{As a first step toward understanding the angular momentum evolution
   history of black holes in merging black hole/neutron star binaries, we
   perform population synthesis calculations to track the distribution of
   accretion histories of compact objects in such binaries. We find that
   there are three distinct processes that can possibly contribute to the
   black hole spin magnitude: a birth spin for the black hole, imparted at
   either (1) the collapse of a massive progenitor star to a black hole or
   (2) the accretion-induced collapse of a neutron star to a black hole,
   and (3) an accretion spin-up when the already formed black hole (via
   processes 1 or 2) goes through an accretion episode (through an
   accretion disk or a common-envelope phase). Our results show that, with
   regard to accretion-induced spin-up in merging BH-NS binaries (method 3
   above), only accretion episodes associated with common- envelope phases
   and hypercritical accretion rates occur in the formation history of
   merging black hole/neutron star binaries. Lacking unambiguous
   experimental information about BH birth spins (i.e., regarding the
   results of processes 1 and 2), we choose two fiducial values for the BH
   birth angular momentum parameter a J/M-2, consistent with observations
   of (1) NS birth spins (a similar or equal to 0) and (2) X- ray binaries
   (a = 0.5). Using these two fiducial values and a conservative upper
   bound on the specific angular momentum of accreted matter, we discuss
   the expected range of black hole spins in the binaries of interest. We
   conclude with comments on the significance of these results for
   ground-based gravitational wave searches of inspiral signals from black
   hole binaries.}},

Abstract = {{We study the feedback between heating and cooling of the intracluster
   medium (ICM) in cooling flow (CF) galaxies and clusters. We adopt the
   popular view that the heating is due to an active galactic nucleus
   (AGN), i.e., a central black hole accreting mass and launching jets
   and/or winds. We propose that the feedback occurs within the entire cool
   inner region (r <= 5-30 kpc), where the nonlinear overdense blobs of gas
   with a density contrast p/p(a) >= 2 cool fast and are removed from the
   ICM before experiencing the next major AGN heating event. We term this
   scenario ``cold feedback.'' Some of these blobs cool and sink toward the
   central black hole, while others might form stars and cold molecular
   clouds. We derive the conditions under which the dense blobs formed by
   perturbations might cool to low temperatures (T < 104 K) and feed the
   black hole. The main conditions are found to be as follows. ( 1) An
   overdense blob must be prevented from reaching an equilibrium position
   in the ICM; therefore, it has to cool fast, and the density profile of
   the ambient gas should be shallow. (2) Nonlinear perturbations are
   required; they might have chiefly formed by previous AGN activity. (3)
   The cooling time of these nonlinear perturbations should be short
   relative to a few times the typical interval between successive AGN
   outbursts. ( 4) In order not to evaporate the blobs, thermal conduction
   around the blobs should be suppressed by a factor <= 10(-3).}},

Abstract = {{Pax6 is a transcription factor with key functional roles in the
   developing brain. Pax6 promotes neuronal differentiation via
   transcriptional regulation of the Neurogenin2 (Ngn2) gene, although Pax6
   expression appears in proliferating neuroepithelial cells before the
   onset of neurogenesis. Here, we identified Fabp7 (BLBP/B-FABP), a member
   of the fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) family, as a downregulated gene
   in the embryonic brain of Pax6 mutant rat (rSey(2)/rSey(2)) by
   microarray analysis. Marked reduction of Fabp7 expression was confirmed
   by quantitative PCR. Spatiotemporal expression patterns of Fabp7 in the
   wild-type rat embryos from embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) to E14.5 were
   similar to those of Pax6, and expression of Fabp7 was undetectable in
   the rSey2/rSey2 cortex. The expression pattern of Fabp7 in the wild-
   type mouse embryo at E10.5 (corresponding to E12.5 rat) was different
   from that in the rat embryo, and no change of expression was observed in
   the Sey/Sey mouse embryo. Overexpression of exogenous Pax6 mainly
   induced ectopic expression of Fabp7, rather than of Ngn2, in the early
   cortical primordium. Interestingly, knocking-down FABP7 function by
   electroporation of Fabp7 small interfering RNA severely curtailed cell
   proliferation but promoted neuronal differentiation. We conclude that
   Fabp7 is a downstream gene of Pax6 transcription factor in the
   developing rat cortex and essential for maintenance of neuroepithelial
   cells during early cortical development.}},

Title = {{Psoriasin, one of several new proteins identified in nasal lavage fluid
   from allergic and non-allergic individuals using 2-dimensional gel
   electrophoresis and mass spectrometry}},
Journal = {{RESPIRATORY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: Extravasation and luminal entry of plasma occurs
   continuously in the nose. This process is markedly facilitated in
   patients with symptomatic allergic rhinitis, resulting in an increased
   secretion of proteins. Identification of these proteins is an important
   step in the understanding of the pathological mechanisms in allergic
   diseases. DNA microarrays have recently made it possible to compare mRNA
   profiles of lavage fluids from healthy and diseased patients, whereas
   information on the protein level is still lacking.
   Methods: Nasal lavage fluid was collected from 11 patients with
   symptomatic allergic rhinitis and 11 healthy volunteers. 2-dimensional
   gel electrophoresis was used to separate proteins in the lavage fluids.
   Protein spots were picked from the gels and identified using mass
   spectrometry and database search. Selected proteins were confirmed with
   western blot.
   Results: 61 spots were identified, of which 21 were separate proteins. 6
   of these proteins (psoriasin, galectin-3, alpha enolase, intersectin-2,
   Wnt-2B and hypothetical protein MGC33648) had not previously been
   described in nasal lavage fluids. The levels of psoriasin were markedly
   down-regulated in allergic individuals. Prolactin-inducible protein was
   also found to be down-regulated, whereas different fragments of albumin
   together with Ig gamma 2 chain c region, transthyretin and splice
   isoform 1 of Wnt-2B were up-regulated among the allergic patients.
   Conclusion: The identification of proteins in nasal lavage fluid with
   2-dimensional gelelectrophoresis in combination with mass spectrometry
   is a novel tool to profile protein expression in allergic rhinitis and
   it might prove useful in the hunt for new therapeutic targets or
   diagnostic markers for allergic diseases. Psoriasin is a potent
   chemotactic factor and its down-regulation during inflammation might be
   of importance for the outcome of the disease.}},

Abstract = {{We installed and have been operating a dense GPS array with low power
   consumption single frequency GPS receivers around Mount
   Hokkaido-Komagatake volcano, southwestern Hokkaido, Japan, since 2000.
   Data were collected continuously and analyzed together with the
   Geographical Survey Institute of Japan's nationwide continuous GPS
   network data. The analysis of daily baseline length changes for two
   years indicate a steady inflation of the volcanic body with 10(-7)/yr
   extensional strain. A pressure source was estimated at 2.4 km depth
   beneath the summit area with a volumetric increase rate of 4.86 x 10(5)
   m(3)/yr. The depth of the pressure source is in good agreement with the
   one expected from petrological study. Integrated magma volume has
   reached up to 2.6 x 10(7) m(3) if the inflation rate is possibly
   extrapolated back to the last magmatic eruption. Our results strongly
   suggest a steady magma accumulation at the reservoir beneath this
   volcano and an increasing potential to the next eruption near future.}},

Abstract = {{Spectrally resolved infrared stimulated vibrational echo measurements
   are used to measure the vibrational dephasing of the CO stretching mode
   of carbonmonoxy-hemoglobin (HbCO), a myoglobin mutant (H64V), and a
   bacterial cytochrome C-552 mutant (Ht-M61A) in aqueous solution and
   trehalose glasses. The vibrational dephasing of the heme-bound CO is
   significantly slower for all three proteins embedded in trehalose
   glasses compared to that of aqueous protein solutions. All three
   proteins exhibit persistent but notably slower spectral diffusion when
   the protein surface is fixed by the glassy solvent. Frequency-frequency
   correlation functions (FFCFs) of the CO are extracted from the
   vibrational echo data to reveal that the structural dynamics, as sensed
   by the CO, of the three proteins in trehalose and aqueous solution are
   dominated by fast (tens of femtoseconds), motionally narrowed
   fluctuations. MD simulations of H64V in dynamic and ``static{''} water
   are presented as models of the aqueous and glassy environments. FFCFs
   are calculated from the H64V simulations and qualitatively reproduce the
   important features of the experimentally extracted FFCFs. The
   suppression of long time scale (picoseconds to tens of picoseconds)
   frequency fluctuations (spectral diffusion) in the glassy solvent is the
   result of a damping of atomic displacements throughout the protein
   structure and is not limited to structural dynamics that occur only at
   the protein surface. The analysis provides evidence that some dynamics
   are coupled to the hydration shell of water, supporting the idea that
   the bioprotection offered by trehalose is due to its ability to
   immobilize the protein surface through a thin, constrained layer of
   water.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of treatment conditions on the magnetic and magnetotransport
   properties of A-site ordered PrBaMn2O6-delta manganites is examined. The
   parent oxygen-stoichiometric A-site ordered PrBaMn2O6 samples were
   prepared from oxygen-stoichiometric A-site disordered Pr0.50Ba0.50MnO3
   ones by using a `two-step' synthesis method. The most significant
   structural feature of the A-site ordered manganites is that the MnO2
   sublattice is sandwiched by two kinds of rock-salt layers, PrOx and BaO.
   The oxygen-stoichiometric A-site ordered PrBaMn2O6 demonstrates a
   ferromagnetic metal to paramagnetic insulator transition with the Curie
   point at about 320 K. These compounds are stable in air up to 1300
   degrees C. The A-site ordered PrBaMn2O6 samples were next reduced in
   flowing argon as well as being treated under high pressure conditions.
   The reduction of the A-site ordered PrBaMn2O6 samples leads to the
   appearance of an antiferromagnetic state with a Neel point of about 140
   K, while the A-site order remains. Upon high pressure treatment the
   degree of A-site order decreases, which reduces T-C to 180 K. The
   magnetotransport properties of A-site ordered manganites treated under
   different conditions are discussed in terms of the manganese valence,
   oxygen content and degree of A-site order.}},

Abstract = {{In many principal brain neurons, the fast, all-or-none Na+ spike
   initiated at the proximal axon is followed by a slow, graded after
   depolarization (ADP). The spike ADP is critically important in
   determining the firing mode of many neurons; large ADPs cause neurons to
   fire bursts of spikes rather than solitary spikes. Nonetheless, not much
   is known about how and where spike ADPs are initiated. We addressed
   these questions in adult CA1 pyramidal cells, which manifest conspicuous
   somatic spike ADPs and an associated propensity for bursting, using
   sharp and patch microelectrode recordings in acutely isolated
   hippocampal slices and single neurons. Voltage-clamp commands mimicking
   spike waveforms evoked transient Na+ spike currents that declined
   quickly after the spike but were followed by substantial sustained Na+
   spike aftercurrents. Drugs that blocked the persistent Na+ current
   (I-NaP), markedly suppressed the sustained Na+ spike aftercurrents, as
   well as spike ADPs and associated bursting. Ca2+ spike aftercurrents
   were much smaller, and reducing them had no noticeable effect on the
   spike ADPs. Truncating the apical dendrites affected neither spike ADPs
   nor the firing modes of these neurons. Application of I-NaP blockers to
   truncated neurons, or their focal application to the somatic region of
   intact neurons, suppressed spike ADPs and associated bursting, whereas
   their focal application to distal dendrites did not. We conclude that
   the somatic spike ADPs are generated predominantly by persistent Na+
   channels located at or near the soma. Through this action, proximal
   I-NaP critically determines the firing mode and spike output of adult
   CA1 pyramidal cells.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES This study evaluated the impact of age on care and outcomes
   for non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE ACS).
   BACKGROUND Recent clinical trials have expanded treatment options for
   NSTE ACS, now reflected in guidelines. Elderly patients are at highest
   risk, yet have previously been shown to receive less care than younger
   patients.
   METHODS In 56,963 patients with NSTE ACS at 443 U.S. hospitals
   participating in the Can Rapid Risk Stratification of Unstable Angina
   Patients Suppress Adverse Outcomes With Early Implementation of the
   American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines
   (CRUSADE) National Quality Improvement Initiative from January 2001 to
   June 2003, we compared use of guidelines-recommended care across four
   age groups: < 65, 65 to 74, 75 to 84, and 2 :85 years. A multivariate
   model tested for age-related differences in treatments and outcomes
   after adjusting for patient, provider, and hospital factors.
   RESULTS Of the study population, 35\% were >= 75 years old, and 11\%
   were >= 85 years old. Use of acute anti-platelet and anti-thrombin
   therapy within the first 24 h decreased with age. Elderly patients were
   also less likely to undergo early catheterization or revascularization.
   Whereas use of many discharge medications was similar in young and old
   patients, clopidogrel and lipid-lowering therapy remained less commonly
   prescribed in elderly patients. In-hospital mortality and complication
   rates increased with advancing age, but those receiving more recommended
   therapies had lower mortality even after adjustment than those who did
   not.
   CONCLUSIONS Age impacts use of guidelines-recommended care for newer
   agents and early in-hospital care. Further improvements in outcomes for
   elderly patients by optimizing the safe and early use of therapies are
   likely.}},

Abstract = {{We have previously shown that an increase in intracellular Ca2+ is both
   necessary and sufficient to commit ectoderm to a neural fate in Xenopus
   embryos. However, the relationship between this Ca2+ increase and the
   expression of early neural genes has yet to be defined. Using a
   subtractive cDNA library between untreated and caffeine-treated animal
   caps, i.e., control ectoderm and ectoderm induced toward a neural fate
   by a release of Ca2+, we have isolated the arginine N-methyltransferase,
   xPRMT1b, a Ca2+-induced target gene, which plays a pivotal role in this
   process. First, we show in embryo and in animal cap that xPRMT1b
   expression is Ca2+- regulated. Second, overexpression of xPRMT1b induces
   the expression of early neural genes such as Zic3. Finally, in the whole
   embryo, antisense approach with morpholino oligonucleotide against
   xPRMT1b impairs neural development and in animal caps blocks the
   expression of neural markers induced by a release of internal Ca2+. Our
   results implicate an instructive role of an enzyme, an arginine
   methyltransferase protein, in the embryonic choice of determination
   between epidermal and neural fate. The results presented provide
   insights by which a Ca2+ increase induces neural fate.}},

Abstract = {{In higher eukaryotes, the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATM
   and Rad3-related (ATR) checkpoint kinases play distinct, but partially
   overlapping, roles in DNA damage response. Yet their interrelated
   function has not been defined for telomere maintenance. We discover in
   Drosophila that the two proteins control partially redundant pathways
   for telomere protection: the loss of ATM leads to the fusion of some
   telomeres, whereas the loss of both ATM and ATR renders all telomeres
   susceptible to fusion. The ATM-controlled pathway includes the Mre11 and
   Nijmegen breakage syndrome complex but not the Chk2 kinase, whereas the
   ATR-regulated pathway includes its partner ATR-interacting protein but
   not the Chk1 kinase. This finding suggests that ATM and ATR regulate
   different molecular events at the telomeres compared with the sites of
   DNA damage. This compensatory relationship between ATM and ATR is
   remarkably similar to that observed in yeast despite the fact that the
   biochemistry of telomere elongation is completely different in the two
   model systems. We provide evidence suggesting that both the loading of
   telomere capping proteins and normal telomeric silencing requires ATM
   and ATR in Drosophila and propose that ATM and ATR protect telomere
   integrity by safeguarding chromatin architecture that favors the loading
   of telomere-elongating, capping, and silencing proteins.}},

Abstract = {{The lateral mobility of individual murine polyoma virus-like particles
   (VLPs) bound to live cells and artificial lipid bilayers was studied by
   single fluorescent particle tracking using total internal reflection
   fluorescence microscopy. The particle trajectories were analyzed in
   terms of diffusion rates and modes of motion as described by the moment
   scaling spectrum. Although VLPs bound to their ganglioside receptor in
   lipid bilayers exhibited only free diffusion, analysis of trajectories
   on live 3T6 mouse fibroblasts revealed three distinct modes of mobility:
   rapid random motion, confined movement in small zones (30-60 nm in
   diameter), and confined movement in zones with a slow drift. After
   binding to the cell surface, particles typically underwent free
   diffusion for 5-10 s, and then they were confined in an actin
   filament-dependent manner without involvement of clathrin-coated pits or
   caveolae. Depletion of cholesterol dramatically reduced mobility of VLPs
   independently of actin, whereas inhibition of tyrosine kinases had no
   effect on confinement. The results suggested that clustering of
   ganglioside molecules by the multivalent VLPs induced transmembrane
   coupling that led to confinement of the virus/receptor complex by
   cortical actin filaments.}},

Abstract = {{We have previously shown that the putative mammalian retromer components
   sorting nexins 1 and 2 (Snx1 and Snx2) result in embryonic lethality
   when simultaneously targeted for deletion in mice, whereas others have
   shown that H beta 58 (also known as mVps26), another retromer component,
   results in similar lethality when targeted for deletion. In the current
   study, we address the genetic interaction of these mammalian retromer
   components in mice. Our findings reveal a functional interaction between
   H beta 58, SNX1, and SNX2 and strongly suggest that SNX2 plays a more
   critical role than SNX1 in retromer activity during embryonic
   development. This genetic evidence supports the existence of mammalian
   retromer complexes containing SNX1 and SNX2 and identifies SNX2 as an
   important mediator of retromer biology. Moreover, we find that mammalian
   retromer complexes containing SNX1 and SNX2 have an essential role in
   embryonic development that is independent of cation-independent mannose
   6-phosphate receptor trafficking.}},

Abstract = {{In the traditional approach to life contingencies only decrements are
   assumed to be stochastic. In this contribution we consider the
   distribution of a life annuity (and a portfolio of life annuities) when
   also the stochastic nature of interest rates is taken into account.
   Although the literature concerning this topic is already quite rich, the
   authors usually restrict themselves to the computation of the first two
   or three moments. However, if one wants to determine, e.g. capital
   requirements using more sophisticated risk measures like Value-at-Risk
   or Tail Value-at-Risk, more detailed knowledge about underlying
   distributions is required. For this purpose, we propose to use the
   theory of comonotonic risks developed in Dhaene et al. {[}Dhaene, J.,
   Denuit, M., Goovaerts, M., Kaas, R., Vyncke, D., 2002a. The concept of

   and finance: applications. Insur. Math. Econ. 31(2), 133-161], which has
   to be slightly adjusted to the case of scalar products. This methodology
   allows to obtain reliable approximations of the underlying distribution
   functions, in particular very accurate estimates of upper quantiles and
   stop-loss premiums. Several numerical illustrations confirm the very
   high accuracy of the methodology. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In-situ attenuated total internal reflection infrared spectroscopy has
   been used to examine initial adsorption and reaction steps in atomic
   layer deposition of HfO2 from tetrakis(diethylamino) hafnium (TDEAHf) on
   SiO2 and hydrogen-terminated Si(100) surfaces. At low deposition
   temperatures (25-250 C), TDEAHf directly reacts with the Si-H surface,
   resulting in partial removal of Si-H bonds and formation of a
   four-membered Si-O-Hf-Si bonding structure that can rapidly oxidize. The
   hydrogen removal process is observed to continue through many cycles of
   TDEAHf/H2O exposure, signifying continued reactivity of the Hf precursor
   with the silicon surface. Density functional theory calculations have
   been performed for various reactions between tetrakis(dimethylamino)
   hafnium and Si-H surfaces, and several possible reaction pathways for
   hydrogen removal have been identified and analyzed. The calculations
   suggest that hydrogen removal proceeds by H abstraction by an amine
   ligand of the Hf precursor and that the abstraction reaction is made
   more facile by the presence of OH on the otherwise H-terminated Si
   surface.}},

Abstract = {{Background - The aim of the study was to evaluate the relation between
   maternal placental Doppler velocimetry, levels of the maternal glucose,
   and clinical signs of vasculopathy in pregnancy complicated by
   pregestational diabetes mellitus.
   Methods and Results - A retrospective study of 155 pregestational
   diabetic women between the 22nd and 40th weeks of pregnancy, categorized
   in White classification as B, 49; C, 40; D, 22; R, 20; F, 5; and RIF,
   19. Cases in classes R, F, and R/F were defined as having vasculopathy.
   Doppler velocimetry of umbilical and uterine arteries was evaluated for
   vascular impedance, both in terms of pulsatility index ( PI) for both
   arteries and a notch in early diastole in the uterine arteries. The last
   examination before delivery was used for analysis. Increased umbilical
   artery PI was seen in 19 and a uterine artery abnormality in 45 cases.
   There was a correlation between levels of HbA(1c) and increased vascular
   impedance in the uterine and umbilical arteries. Signs of increased
   uterine artery vascular impedances were significantly related to
   pregestational vasculopathy. In cases of small-for-gestational-age
   newborn infants, PI was significantly increased in uterine and umbilical
   arteries. Furthermore, PI in macrosomic fetuses was significantly lower
   than in normal infants. Abnormal uterine artery Doppler was also
   strongly related to adverse outcome.
   Conclusions - Abnormal uterine artery Doppler is related to
   pregestational vasculopathy and adverse outcome of pregnancy. The
   results suggest that the uterine arteries are affected in women with
   clinical signs of pregestational vasculopathy. This may influence
   placental perfusion and fetal well-being.}},

Abstract = {{Background: central venous catheter-related infections are a significant
   medical problem. Improved preventive measures are needed.
   Objective: To ascertain 1) effectiveness of a second -generation
   antiseptic-coated catheter in the prevention of microbial colonization
   and infection; 2) safety and tolerability of this device; 3)
   microbiology of infected catheters; and 4) propensity for the
   development of antiseptic resistance.
   Design: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial.
   Setting: 9 university-affiliated medical centers.
   Patients: 780 patients in intensive care units who required central
   venous catheterization.
   Intervention: Patients received either a standard catheter or a catheter
   coated with chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine.
   Measurements: The authors assessed catheter colonization and
   catheter-related infection, characterized microbes by molecular typing,
   and determined their susceptibility to antiseptics. Patient tolerance of
   the catheter was monitored.
   Results: Patients with the 2 types of catheters had similar demographic
   features, clinical interventions, laboratory values, and risk factors
   for infection. Antiseptic catheters were less likely to be colonized at
   the time of removal compared with control catheters (13.3 vs. 24.1
   colonized catheters per 1000 catheter-days; P < 0.01). The
   center-stratified Cox regression hazard ratio for colonization
   controlling for sampling design and potentially confounding variables
   was 0.45 (95\% Cl, 0.25 to 0.78). The rate of definitive
   catheter-related bloodstream infection was 1.24 per 1000 catheter-days
   (Cl, 0.26 to 3.62 per 1000 catheter-days) for the control group versus
   0.42 per 1000 catheter-days (Cl, 0.01 to 2.34 per 1000 catheter-days)
   for the antiseptic catheter group (P = 0.6). Coagulase-negative
   staphylococci and other gram-positive organisms were the most frequent
   microbes to colonize catheters. Noninfectious adverse events were
   similar in both groups. Antiseptic susceptibility was similar for
   microbes recovered from either group.
   Limitations: The antiseptic catheter was not compared with an
   antibiotic-coated catheter, and no conclusion can be made regarding its
   effect on bloodstream infection.
   Conclusions: The second-generation chlorhexicline-silver sulfadiazine
   catheter is well tolerated. Antiseptic coating appears to reduce
   microbial colonization of the catheter compared with an uncoated
   catheter.}},

Abstract = {{The composition of planktonic eukaryotes in the size fraction 3-20 mu m
   of 10 maritime Antarctic lakes was studied by denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis (DGGE). Microscopic observations were also carried out
   to compare the results obtained by this molecular fingerprinting
   technique with morphological data. Six lakes from Hope Bay (Antarctic
   Peninsula) and 4 from the Potter Peninsula (King George Island) were
   sampled during the austral summer of 2003. These lakes were of different
   trophic status and covered a wide range of limnological features.
   Previous studies of the planktonic communities of these lakes revealed
   high nanoflagellate abundance and biomass, but their taxonomic
   identification was usually uncertain due to their similarity in size and
   shape. Here, the application of DGGE allowed both a comparison of the
   structure of the nanoplanktonic communities and an identification of the
   dominant populations through sequencing of the most prominent DGGE
   bands. The most important organisms in these lakes were the
   Chrysophyceae, represented in the DGGE gel by 5 different band positions
   and identified by microscopy in 5 different morphotypes, including
   uniflagellated and biflagellated naked organisms: 1 sequence belonged to
   the Chrysosphaerales, 2 closely related bands (likely 2 species from the
   same genus) belonged probably to the Ochromonadales (unicellular
   biflagellates), while the other 2 bands could not be assigned to any
   defined chrysophyte group. Sequences related to Chlorophyceae,
   Bacillariophyceae and probably Cercozoa were also retrieved. A
   Dictyochophyceae belonging to the order Pedinellales is reported for the
   first time in freshwater Antarctic ecosystems. Microscopic observations
   suggest that this phytoplanktonic organism most likely corresponds to
   Pseudopedinella. Most of the lakes shared several common sequences, such
   as 2 chrysophyte bands, which suggests the existence of well-adapted
   nanoplanktonic species dispersed throughout the Antarctic lakes.
   However, some sequences appeared exclusively in specific lakes, which
   seems to be related to the trophic status of the water bodies and
   probably also to the local conditions of the maritime Antarctic regions
   sampled.}},

Abstract = {{Domoic acid is a potent neuroexcitatory toxin that causes amnesic
   shellfish poisoning in humans through ingestion of contaminated
   shellfish. The variable regions of the heavy chain (V-H) and light chain
   (V-L) of an antibody specific for domoic acid were cloned from a mouse
   hybridoma cell line and used to construct single-chain antibody
   fragments (scFvs) in a variety of formats. V-H-linker-V-L scFvs were
   expressed better in Escherichia coli than the V-L-linker-V-H format,
   while use of the commonly used (GlY(4)Ser)(3) inter-domain linker
   resulted in higher yields than a longer (Gly(4)Ser)(6) linker variant.
   Higher soluble protein yields were achieved in E. coli TOP 10 than in E.
   coli XL I-Blue cells and co-production of the E coli disulfide bond
   isomerase enzyme DsbC allowed higher cell densities to be attained
   during scFv production, leading to increased yields of recombinant

   monoclonal antibody and is being used to develop an immunosensor to

Abstract = {{SnO2 thin films were deposited by radio-frequency inductively coupled

   temperature of the plasma-treated SnO2 thin films decreased by 80
   degrees C, while the gas sensitivity increased eightfold. The enhanced

Abstract = {{We have performed photoluminescence spectroscopy as well as
   capacitance-voltage spectroscopy on an ensemble of self-assembled InAs
   quantum dots that are embedded in a field-effect-transistor structure.
   By investigating the charging spectra as a function of excitation power
   density, we are able to demonstrate a buildup of a transient positive
   charge in the heterostructure that leads to a screening of the electric
   field inside the structure. Moreover, by taking photoluminescence and
   capacitance spectra simultaneously, we can correlate the charging state
   of the dots with the interband transitions of s- and p-shell. We find
   that the observation of photoluminescence from higher orbital states in
   such field-effect-transistor structures is not only a consequence of
   Pauli-blocking but also of the accumulation of holes inside the
   structure. Also, we are able to determine the energy shift between the
   higher-charged excitonic states X2- and X3- to be Delta E=2.6 meV. (C)

Abstract = {{A synthetic hexasaccharide, identical to the terminal hexasaccharide of
   Ogawa LPS, coupled to bovine serum albumin induced protective antibodies
   in mice. To determine if there was it minimum saccharide length required
   for immunogenicity and efficacy, shorter (mono- to pentasaccharide)
   neoglycoconjugates (CHO BSA) were tested in mice. The Ogawa CHO BSA was
   inoculated at either a constant mass but differing moles, or equal moles
   but differing masses. Humoral responses were essentially the same when
   mice received 9 mu g of the carbohydrate (0.007 mM with the
   pentasaccharide) in each of the neoglycoconjugates prepared from mono-
   through the pentasaccharide, or the same molar amount (0.007 mM),
   proportionally less by weight when going from the penta- to the
   monosaccharide. These data show that. within this dose range. the
   responses occurred virtually independently of the amount of immunogen.
   Humoral antibodies induced by these immunogens were generally not
   vibriocidal. Selected antisera induced by CHO-BSA immunogens were
   protective, but the ELISA titers of the sera were not predictive of the
   protective capacity. Purified, Ogawa LPS induced anti-Ogawa LPS IgM
   antibody titers similar to those induced by the Ogawa CHO BSA
   conjugates. The anti-whole LPS sera were strongly vibriocidal. as were
   the previously reported sera induced by hexasaccharide conjugates, This
   suggests either that the shorter oligosaccharides lack a conformational
   epitope provided by the hexasaccharide or that the LPS has additional B
   cell epitopes or selects different B cells in the primary response. (C)

Abstract = {{In this article, the effectiveness of variable string length genetic
   algorithm along with a recently developed fuzzy cluster validity index
   (PBMF) has been demonstrated for clustering a data set into an unknown

   Algorithm (VGA) is utilized in conjunction with the fuzzy indices to
   determine the number of clusters present in a data set as well as a
   good, fuzzy partition of the data for that number of clusters. A
   comparative study has been performed for different validity indices,
   namely, PBMF, XB, PE and PC. The results of the fuzzy VGA algorithm are
   compared with those obtained by the well known FCM algorithm which is
   applicable only when the number of clusters is fixed a priori. Moreover,
   another genetic clustering scheme, that also requires fixing the value
   of the number of clusters, is implemented. The effectiveness of the PBMF
   index as the optimization criterion along with a genetic fuzzy
   partitioning technique is demonstrated on a number of artificial and
   real data sets including a remote sensing image of the city of Kolkata.

Abstract = {{As-received and washed jute fabrics were used as reinforcement for a
   thermoset resin. The mild treatments performed on the jute fabrics did
   not significantly affect their physical and thermal behaviors. The
   washed fibers absorbed less water than the unmodified (as received)
   ones, indicating that the coating used to form the fabrics was
   hygroscopic. Measurements of the fiber mechanical properties showed a
   high dispersion due to fiber irregularities, although the values
   obtained were in agreement with data reported in the literature. These
   results were also analyzed with the Weibull method. To investigate the
   effect of the jute treatments on the interface properties, impact,
   compression, and tensile tests were carried out. The composites made
   from as-received jute had the highest impact energy, which was probably
   associated with weak interfacial adhesion. Composite samples behaved
   more ductilely in compression than in tensile situations due to the
   brittle characteristics of the resin used as matrix. The effect of the
   orientation of the fibers with respect to the direction of the applied
   force in the different mechanical tests was also studied. (c) 2005 Wiley

Abstract = {{Progress in the foundations of mathematics has made it possible to
   formulate all thinkable mathematical concepts, algorithms and proofs in
   one language and in an impeccable way. This is not in spite of, but
   partially based oil the famous results of Godel and Turing. In this way
   statements are about mathematical objects and algorithms, proofs show
   the correctness of statements and computations, and computations are
   dealing with objects and proofs. Interactive computer systems for a full
   integration of defining, computing and proving are based on this. The
   human defines concepts, constructs algorithms and provides proofs, while
   the machine checks that the definitions are well formed and the proofs
   and computations are correct. Results formalized so far demonstrate the
   feasibility of this `computer mathematics'. Also there are very good
   applications. The challenge is to make the systems more
   mathematician-friendly, by building libraries and tools. The eventual
   goal is to help humans to learn, develop, communicate, referee and apply

Abstract = {{The European Myelofibrosis Network (EUM-NET), a European research
   network on myelofibrosis with myelold metaplasia (MMM), has developed a
   definition of response for the disease by using clinicohematologic,
   histologic, and cytogenetic criteria. A core set of 5 clinicohematologic
   criteria was selected out of 9 candidates on the basis of their
   sensitivity to change measured in 196 patients treated either during
   clinical trials or routine clinical practice. A consensus panel of 16
   international experts was convened and asked to score the level of
   response in 104 patient profiles as major, moderate, minor, or no
   response according to changes of the clinicohematologic criteria. Using
   the experts' consensus as the gold standard, the performance of 100
   possible definitions of response was evaluated. Criteria for major or
   moderate clinicohematologic response were determined to be changes in
   hemoglobin (Hb) and spleen size and the presence of constitutional
   symptoms, while changes in platelet count and white blood cell (WBC)
   count served as complementary criteria and were of value for defining
   minor responses. A histologic response was defined by changes in bone
   marrow fibrosis and cellularity grades. The combined use of these
   response definitions should help standardize the design and reporting of
   future clinical studies in MMM.}},

Abstract = {{The removal of chromate anions (CrO42-) from aqueous solutions under
   different experimental conditions using cross-linked
   poly(glycidylmethacrylate-co-methylmethacrylate), poly(GMA-co-MMA),
   adsorbent was investigated in this study. The epoxy group containing
   adsorbent in the beads form was prepared from glycidylmethacrylate and
   methylmethacrylate via suspension polymerization. The epoxy groups of
   the poly (GMA-co-MMA) beads were used for grafting with ethylenediamine
   to prepare specific adsorbent (poly(GMA-co-MMA)-ED) for CrO42- anions
   removal from aqueous solutions. Adsorption equilibrium was achieved in
   approximately 120 min. The removal was favored at low pH, with a maximum
   adsorption at pH 2.0. Isotherm studies showed that CrO42- anions could
   be effectively removed by poly(GMA-co-MMA)-ED beads. The maximum
   adsorption capacities of the poly(GMA-co-MMA) and poly(GMA-co-MMA)-ED
   beads were 0.044 and 0.441 mmol CrO42- anions/g of dry adsorbents,
   respectively. The experimental data of the adsorption equilibrium from
   CrO42- anions aqueous solution correlated well with the
   Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm model. The experimental data were analyzed
   using the first- and the second-order kinetic models. The rate constants
   of adsorption for both kinetics models have been calculated. The
   second-order model provides the best correlation of the data. Desorption
   experiments show that the process of adsorption of CrO42- anions was
   reversible and the adsorbent was easily regenerated with 0.1 M NaOH up
   to 96\% recovery. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Gemcitabine is a deoxycytidine (dCyd) analogue with activity against
   several solid cancers. Gemcitabine is activated by dCyd kinase (dCK) and
   interferes, as its triphosphate dFdCTP, with tumor growth through
   incorporation into DNA. Alternatively, the metabolite gemcitabine
   diphosphate (dFdCDP) can interfere with DNA synthesis and thus tumor
   growth through inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase. Gemcitabine can
   be inactivated by the enzyme dCyd deaminase (dCDA). In most in vitro
   models, resistance to gemcitabine was associated with a decreased dCK
   activity. In all these models, resistance was established using
   continuous exposure to gemcitabine with increasing concentrations;
   however, these in vitro models have limited clinical relevance. To
   develop in vivo resistance to gemcitabine, we treated mice bearing a
   moderately sensitive tumor Colon 26-A (T/C = 0.25) with a clinically
   relevant schedule (120 mg/kg every 3 days). By repeated transplant of
   the most resistant tumor and continuation of gemcitabine treatment for >
   1 year, the completely resistant tumor Colon 26-G (T/C = 0.96) was
   created. Initial studies focused on resistance mechanisms known from in
   vitro studies. In Colon 26-G, dCK activity was 1.7-fold decreased; dCDA
   and DNA polymerase were not changed; and Colon 26-G accumulated 1.5-fold
   less dFdCTP, 6 hours after a gemcitabine injection, than the parental
   tumor. Based on in vitro studies, these relative minor changes were
   considered insufficient to explain the completely resistant phenotype.
   Therefore, an expression microarray was done with Colon 26-A versus
   Colon 26-G. Using independently grown nonresistant and resistant tumors,
   a striking increase in expression of the RRM1 subunit gene was found in
   Colon 26-G. The expression of RRM1 mRNA was 25-fold increased in the
   resistant tumor, as measured by real-time PCR, which was confirmed by
   Western blotting. In contrast, RRM2 mRNA was 2-fold decreased. However,
   ribonucleotide reductase enzyme activity was only moderately increased
   in Colon 26-G. In conclusion, this is the first model with in vivo
   induced resistance to gemcitabine. In contrast to most in vitro studies,
   dCK activity was not the most important determinant of gemcitabine
   resistance. Expression microarray identified RRM1 as the gene with the
   highest increase in expression in the Colon 26-G, which might clarify
   its complete gemcitabine-resistant phenotype. This study is the first in
   vivo evidence for a key role for RRM1 in acquired gemcitabine
   resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Misregulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is a hallmark of
   several forms of cancer. Components of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway are
   expressed in ovarian granulosa cells; nevertheless, its potential
   involvement in granulosa cell tumorigenesis has not been examined. To
   this end, human (n = 6) and equine (n = 18) granulosa cell tumors (GCT)
   were analyzed for beta-catenin expression by immunohistochemistry.
   Unlike granulosa cells of normal ovaries, most (15 of 24) GCT samples
   showed nuclear localization of beta-catenin, suggesting that activation
   of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway plays a role in the etiology of GCT. To
   confirm this hypothesis, Catnb(flox(ex3)/+); Amhr2(crc/+) mice that
   express a dominant stable beta-catenin mutant in their granulosa cells
   were generated. These mice developed follicle-like structures containing
   disorganized, pleiomorphic granulosa by 6 weeks of age. Even in older
   mice, these follicle-like lesions grew no larger than the size of antral
   follicles and contained very few proliferating cells. Similar to corpora
   lutea, the lesions were highly vascularized, although they did not
   express the luteinization marker Cyp11a1. Catnb(flox(ex3)/+);
   Amhr2(cre/+) females were also found to be severely subfertile, and
   fewer corpora lutea were found to form in response to exogenous
   gonadotropin compared with control mice. In older mice, the ovarian
   lesions often evolved into GCT, indicating that they represent a
   pretumoral intermediate stage. The GCT in Catnb(flox(ex3)/+);
   Amhr2(cre/+) mice featured many histopathologic similarities to the
   human disease, and prevalence of tumor development attained 57\% at 7.5
   months of age. Together, these studies show a causal link between
   misregulated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and GCT development and provide
   a novel model system for the study of GCT biology.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigates public perception of the blackening of light
   coloured stone historic buildings in some European countries. It used
   on-site questionnaires to explore the perceived lightness of the facades
   in terms of opinions that the building is dirty or needs cleaning. There
   was a clear relation between opinions about the dirtiness of a building
   and views that it should be cleaned. Visitors to buildings found the
   assignment of colour or a grey scale value to buildings relatively easy
   despite the fact that they are typically made up of many shades. There
   was a strong relationship between the perceived lightness of a building
   and the opinion that it was dirty. This relationship was used to
   establish potential levels of blackening that may be publicly acceptable
   and propose some aesthetic thresholds. Such thresholds suggest
   approaches to setting limit values for elemental carbon in the air, such
   that significant buildings do not become unacceptably discoloured.
   Developments of this kind contribute to the regulation of non health
   aspects of air pollution and aid decision making in the management of
   significant buildings. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V, All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Purpose:The aim of the present study was to optimize and simplify
   photodynamic therapy using a new liposomal formulation of the
   photosensitizer meta- (tetrahydroxyphenyl)chlorin {[}m-THPC (Foscan);
   liposomal m-THPC (Fospeg)] and to reduce systemic reactions to the
   photosensitizer.
   Experimental Design: To examine the pharmacokinetics of liposomal
   m-THPC, we determined tissue and plasma variables in feline patients
   with spontaneous squamous cell carcinoma. In vivo fluorescence intensity
   measurements of tumor and skin were done with a fiber spectrophotometer
   after i.v. injection of m-THPC or liposomal m-THPC in 10 cats. Blood
   samples, drawn at several time points after photosensitizer
   administration, were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography.
   Results: None of the liposomal m-THPC-treated cats showed side effects
   during or after drug injection. Fluorescence intensities, fluorescence
   ratios (tumor fluorescence divided by skin fluorescence), and
   bioavailability in the tumor were 2 to 4 times higher with liposomal
   m-THPC compared with m-THPC. Liposomal m-THPC concentration in the tumor
   increased constantly to reach a maximum at 4 hours after injection.
   Plasma concentration and bioavailability were similar to 3 times higher
   with liposomal m-THPC compared with m-THPC measured at the time points
   of highest plasma concentration. The distribution half-life was shorter
   with liposomal m-THPC, resulting in maximal tumor accumulation up to 5.5
   times earlier. Maximal tumor accumulation and maximal fluorescence ratio
   with liposomal m-THPC occurred at the same time point, indicating
   maximal selectivity. In both groups, all cats responded to therapy.
   Conclusions: Liposomal m-THPC was well tolerated by all cats and seems
   to have superior pharmacokinetic properties compared with m-THPC. The
   efficacy of the drug warrants further study.}},

   nanowires are around 350 nm in width and 20 mu m in length. The
   conducting properties of polypyrrole nanowires were identified by AFM
   with a conducting tip (CT-AFM). The AFM current image shows that the

Abstract = {{The gallium-modified bismuth ferrite-lead titanate compositions of

Number = {{20}},
Pages = {{4833-4848}},

Abstract = {{The process of regulated exocytosis is defined by the Ca2+- triggered
   fusion of two apposed membranes, enabling the release of vesicular
   contents. This fusion step involves a number of energetically complex
   steps and requires both protein and lipid membrane components. The role
   of cholesterol has been investigated using isolated release-ready native
   cortical secretory vesicles to analyze the Ca2+- triggered fusion step
   of exocytosis. Cholesterol is a major component of vesicle membranes and
   we show here that selective removal from membranes, selective
   sequestering within membranes, or enzymatic modification causes a
   significant inhibition of the extent, Ca2+ sensitivity and kinetics of
   fusion. Depending upon the amount incorporated, addition of exogenous
   cholesterol to cholesterol-depleted membranes consistently recovers the
   extent, but not the Ca2+ sensitivity or kinetics of fusion. Membrane
   components of comparable negative curvature selectively recover the
   ability to fuse, but are unable to recover the kinetics and Ca2+
   sensitivity of vesicle fusion. This indicates at least two specific
   positive roles for cholesterol in the process of membrane fusion: as a
   local membrane organizer contributing to the efficiency of fusion, and,
   by virtue of its intrinsic negative curvature, as a specific molecule
   working in concert with protein factors to facilitate the minimal
   molecular machinery for fast Ca2+- triggered fusion.}},

Abstract = {{Eosinophilic airway disease is associated with a variety of chronic
   inflammatory changes in the lower airways and is caused by antigenic
   stimulation that induces release of various mediators produced by
   eosinophils and mast cells in the small airways and the pulmonary
   interstitium.
   Inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, cytokines, prostaglandins,
   and leukotrienes, alter vascular permeability, leading to edema, and
   cause increased mucus production, damage to bronchiolar epithelium, and
   fibrosis, resulting in narrowing of the airways.
   An acute crisis, characterized by severe bronchoconstriction, can occur
   as a result of a type I hypersensitivity response (eg, asthma) or
   mechanical disruption (eg, bronchoscopy).
   Medical management of this disease process typically involves the use of

Abstract = {{One paradigm Of subduction relates the dip of the slab to the buoyancy
   of the downgoing lithosphere along subduction zones, with the negative
   buoyancy proportional to the age of the oceanic lithosphere. We measured
   the dip of the slab down to depths of 250 km along 164 sections crossing
   13 subduction zones and compared it with the age of the subducting
   oceanic lithosphere both at the trench and at depth. We show here that
   this relationship is far more irregular than previously suggested, and
   that it is not possible to simply correlate the increase of the slab dip
   to the increasing age of the downgoing cooler lithosphere. Younger
   oceanic lithosphere may show steeper dip than older segments of slabs
   (e.g., Central America vs. South America), in contrast with predictions
   of models considering only slab Pull. The combination of slab age and
   subduction rate better accounts for slab dip; however the correlation is
   not satisfactory (correlation coefficient equal to 0.450). These results
   suggest that supplemental forces or constraints have to be accounted
   for, such as thickness and shape of the hangingwall plate, absolute
   plate velocity, presence of lateral density variations in the hosting
   upper mantle, effects of accretion/erosion, subduction of oceanic
   plateaus and slab deformation due to the motion of the mantle relative
   to the subducting plate. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine the effects of
   oocyte/embryo density (embryo number:medium volume ratio) on
   developmental competence and relative transcription of developmentally
   important genes in in vitro-produced bovine embryos. Using standard
   procedures, bovine oocytes were matured, fertilized and cultured in
   vitro in groups of 5, 10, 20 or 30 oocytes/embryos per 100 p,L medium
   drop (embryo number/medium volume ratios of 1:20, 1:10, 1:5 and 1:3.3,
   respectively). A semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay was used to determine
   the relative abundance of Hsp 70.1 and Glut-1 transcripts in Day-6
   morulae, and in Day-7 and Day-8 blastocysts and expanded blastocysts.
   Cleavage rates (55.9, 49.1, 47.1 and 34.6\%, respectively) and
   blastocyst developmental rates (24.1, 18.9, 20.4 and 12.6\%,
   respectively) were higher in groups containing 5, 10 and 20 embryos
   versus 30 embryos per drop, but there were no significant differences
   among groups in hatching rates. The relative abundance of Hsp 70.1
   transcripts in Day-7 blastocysts was higher in embryos produced in the
   20-embryo than in the 5-embryo groups. There were no differences among
   embryos from all groups in the amount of Glut-1 mRNA (regardless of
   embryonic stage). However, there were differences in the pattern of Hsp
   70.1 gene expression between distinct stages of embryo development and
   embryo density; these dissimilarities appeared to be associated with
   compromised development at higher embryo densities. In conclusion, the
   increase in embryo density during IVM, IVF, and IVC phases of in vitro
   embryo production might negatively affect embryo development and the
   pattern of gene expression of in vitro-produced bovine embryos. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Study Design. Case report with review of the literature.
   Objectives. To present the first case of a central cord syndrome
   occurring after adequate decompression, and review the mechanics of the
   cervical spinal cord injury and postoperative biomechanical and anatomic
   changes occurring after cervical decompressive laminectomy.
   Summary of Background Data. Cervical spondylosis is a common
   pathoanatomic occurrence in the elderly population and is thought to be
   one of the primary causes for a central cord syndrome. Decompressive
   laminectomy with or without fusion has been a primary treatment for
   spondylotic disease and is thought to be protective against further
   injury. To our knowledge, there are no cases of a central cord syndrome
   occurring after adequate decompression reported in the literature.
   Methods. Case study with extensive review of the literature.
   Results. The patient underwent C3-C7 cervical laminectomy without
   complications. After surgery, the patient's spasticity and gait
   difficulties improved. She was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation
   for further treatment of upper extremity weakness. The patient fell in
   the rehabilitation center, with a central cord syndrome despite adequate
   decompression of her spinal canal. The patient was treated
   conservatively for the central cord and had minimal improvement.
   Conclusions. Decompressive laminectomy provides an immediate
   decompressive effect on the spinal cord as seen by the dorsal migration
   of the cord, however, the biomechanics of the cervical spine after
   decompressive laminectomy remain uncertain. This case supports the
   ongoing research and need for more intensive research on postoperative
   cervical spine biomechanics, including decompressive laminectomies,
   decompressive laminectomy and fusion, and laminoplasty.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To compare the ability of 3 database-derived comorbidity
   scores, the Charlson Score, Elixhauser method, and RxRisk-V, in
   predicting health service use among individuals with osteoarthritis
   (OA).
   Methods. The study population comprised 306 patients who were under care
   for OA in the Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. Comorbidity
   scores were calculated using 1 year of data from VA inpatient and
   outpatient databases (Charlson Score, Elixhauser method), as well as
   pharmacy data (RxRisk-V). Model selection was used to identify the best
   comorbidity index for predicting 3 health service use variables: number
   of physician visits, number of prescriptions used, and hospitalization
   probability. Specifically, Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) was used
   to determine the best model for each health service outcome variable.
   Model fit was also evaluated.
   Results. All 3 comorbidity indices were significant predictors of each
   health service outcome (P < 0.01). However, based on AIC values, models
   using the RxRisk-V and Elixhauser indices as predictor variables were
   better than models using the Charlson Score. The model using the
   RxRisk-V index as a predictor was the best for the outcome of
   prescription medication use, and the model with the Elixhauser index was
   the best for the outcome of physician visits.
   Conclusion. The Rx-Risk-V and Elixhauser are suitable comorbidity
   measures for examining health services use among patients with OA. Both
   indices are derived from administrative databases and can efficiently
   capture comorbidity among large patient populations.}},

Volume = {{67}},

Pages = {{829-835}},

Abstract = {{A simple and reliable method for simultaneous electrochemical
   determination of ascorbic acid (AA) and dopamine (DA) is presented in
   this work. It was based on the use of the cationic surfactant
   cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) that enables the separation of the
   oxidation peaks potential of AA and DA. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) as well
   as pulse differential voltammetry (PDV) were used in order to verify the
   voltammetric behaviour in micellar media. In the cationic surfactant
   CPC, a remarkable electrostatic interaction is established with
   negatively charged AA, as a consequence, the oxidation peak potential
   shifted toward less positive potential and the peak current increased.
   On the other hand, the positively charged DA is repelled from the
   electrode surface and the oxidation peak potential shifts toward more
   positive potential in comparison to the bare electrode. Therefore, the
   common overlapped oxidation peaks of AA and DA can be circumventing by
   using CPC. Parameter that affects the E-pa and I-pa such as CPC
   concentration and pH were studied. Under optimised conditions, the
   method presented a linear response to AA and DA in the concentration
   range from 5 to 75 mu mol L-1 and 10 to 100 mu mol L-1, respectively.
   The proposed method was successfully applied to the simultaneous
   determination of AA and DA in dopamine hydrochloride injection (DHI)
   samples spiked with AA. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   be obtained by tuning process conditions and catalyst formulations. A
   high gasoline fraction (70 wt\%) with an apparent high-quality motor

   extremely clean transportation fuels can be obtained that are

   ideal (the lengths of each PEG and PDMS chain segments, respectively,

   each crosslink site). The synthesis of the conetworks was achieved by
   the use of a novel dual-purpose extender/crosslinker Y (his
   {[}(dimethylsilyl)oxyl-{[}(etoxydimethylsilyl)oxy]phenylsilane,
   (SiPh(SiH)(2)OEt)), in two steps: (1) Synthesis of a new linear random

   PEG and B is the hydrophobic segment, and (2) Crosslinking the
   multiblocks by catalytic condensation of the SiOEt groups in the Y

   functions: First, it extends two incompatible hydrophilic and
   hydrophobic prepolymers (PEG and PDMS) to a random MBC, and,
   subsequently, it crosslinks the multiblocks to the target APCN. The
   synthesis and characterization of the extender/crosslinker is also

Abstract = {{Stainless steel is an important engineering material that is difficult
   to be cut by oxy-fuel methods because of the high melting point and low
   viscosity of the formed oxides. However, it is suitable to be cut by
   laser. This work aims to evaluate the optimum laser cutting parameters
   for 1.2 mm austenitic stainless steel sheets by using pulsed and CW
   Nd:YAG laser beam and nitrogen or oxygen as assistant gases, each one
   separately. It was shown that the laser cutting quality depends mainly
   on the laser power, pulse frequency, cutting speed and focus position.
   The optimum cutting was achieved during pulsed mode at applied power 210
   W, frequency 200-250 Hz, speed 1-1.5 m/min, focus position -0.5 to -1
   mm, nitrogen pressure 9-11 bar and oxygen pressure 2-4 bar. Increasing
   the frequency and cutting speed decreased the kerf width and the
   roughness of cut surface, while increasing the power and gas pressure
   increased the kerf width and roughness. Comparing with oxygen, nitrogen
   produced brighter and smoother cut surface with smaller kerf, although
   it did not prove to be economical. In CW mode, the speed can be
   increased to more than 8 m/min with equivalent power and gas pressure
   (limited by the laser system). Pulsed mode was also not economical,
   especially in limited frequency laser systems, where the pulse overlap
   should be controlled by both frequency and speed. In CW, the speed can
   be increased to the maximum system limit. The results should be included
   in computerized database for the automatic implementation of laser
   process. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The new electrolytic dissolution in batch of aluminum alloys samples as
   grains or turns and the determination of Fe, Cu, Mn, Mg, Cr, Ni, Zn, Pb
   and Ti by ICP OES was investigated. In on-line electrodissolution
   procedures described in the literature, samples were restricted to be in
   the form of solid blocks or plates with one polished flat face. Here,
   the sample was loaded in the barrel of a modified disposable syringe
   (the anodic semi-cell) and pressed with a modified plunger fitted with a
   platinum disk to establish electrical contact with the analyte. This
   arrangement was introduced in a beaker containing the electrolyte (1 mol
   L-1 HNO3) and a platinum wire as the cathode. The resulting solution
   from electrodissolution (0.6 A) was used for the ICP OES determinations.
   The influence of the aluminum concentration increase on the
   determination of the elements was evaluated. Electrodissolution of
   certified reference materials and commercial samples revealed relative
   errors lower than 10\% for the elements Fe, Cu, Mg, Ni, Cr, Zn and Ti
   (when their content is above 0.1 \%). Higher inaccuracies (> 10\%) were
   observed for Mn and for Fe in B.C.S. 268/1 reference material certified.
   The proposed method presented a relative standard deviations (R.S.D.)
   lower or circa 10\% to all of the elements (except Pb). In comparison
   with traditional acid dissolution, the proposed electrodissolution
   method is relatively fast (about 30 min), it is clean (there is no
   projection of solution) and simple (heating and fumes exhaust system
   were not necessaries). (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To compare milk yield among cows classified as nonlame,
   moderately lame, and lame and to examine the relationship between
   severity of lameness and milk yield in cows classified as lame during
   the first 100 days after parturition.
   Design-Longitudinal study.
   Animals-465 Holstein cows.
   Procedure-Cows were examined weekly during the first 100 days after
   parturition and assigned a lameness score by use of a 6-point locomotion
   scoring system (ie, 0 to 5). Milk yield was compared among cows
   classified as nonlame, moderately lame, and lame. Among cows classified
   as lame (locomotion score >= 4), milk yield was compared for cows with
   low, medium, and high cumulative locomotion scores. Cows classified as
   lame were further examined on a tilt table for diagnosis and treatment
   of lameness.
   Results-84 (18\%), 212 (46\%), and 169 (36\%) cows were classified as
   nonlame, moderately lame, and lame, respectively. Among cows in their
   second or later lactations, milk yield in lame cows was significantly
   lower than that in moderately lame and nonlame cows. In addition, among
   cows classified as lame, milk yield was significantly lower in cows with
   high locomotion scores during the first 100 days after parturition,
   compared with cows with low scores. Most (58\%) cows classified as lame
   had laminitis.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results indicate a linear
   relationship between increasing degree of lameness and decreasing milk
   yield among cows in their second or later lactations. The locomotion
   scoring system used in this study may be a useful management tool that
   veterinarians and dairy farmers could adopt for early detection of
   lameness in dairy cows.}},

Abstract = {{With increasing computer power, process-based models that use grids to
   discretize space have become increasingly popular. For such models, the
   simulation results might depend on both grid cell size and, in the case
   of dynamic models, on the time step length used in the model. In this
   study, the dynamic Limburg soil erosion model (LISEM) was applied to a
   small catchment on the Chinese Loess Plateau. To study the effect of
   grid cell size and time step length, simulations were performed for grid
   cell sizes ranging from 5 to 100 m for a single time step length, and
   for time step lengths ranging from 2 to 120 s for a single grid cell
   size. The results show that the LISEM results vary considerably as a
   function of both grid cell size and time step length. For both increase
   in cell size and increasing time step length, the trend was a decrease
   in predicted discharge and predicted soil loss. For discharge, the most
   important causes are likely to be a decrease in slope with increasing
   grid cell size, rainfall averaging for longer time step lengths, and
   numerical dispersion of the kinematic wave solution. For soil loss, the
   cause is less clear, reflecting the complexity of soil loss prediction,
   which depends on available water, transport capacity and sediment
   redistribution, all of which change in time and space. These results
   show that a choice for a certain grid cell size and a certain time step
   length should be made before calibration of the model. Similar erosion
   models are likely to have similar dependencies on grid size and time
   step length. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Men with schizophrenia are at increased risk, as compared to the general
   population, for criminal offending and to have displayed Conduct
   Disorder (CD) before age 15. The present study examined the consequences
   of CD among a sample of 248 men with schizophrenia or schizo-affective
   disorder, aged, on average, 39 years old. Participants were intensively
   assessed at discharge from the hospital and four times during the
   subsequent two-year period. CD was associated with criminality and
   substance misuse among first-degree male relatives and substance misuse
   among female relatives. In childhood and adolescence, CD was associated
   with poor academic performance, substance abuse, and physical abuse. In
   adulthood, the diagnosis of CD and each CD symptom were associated with
   increased non-violent and violent criminal offending, after adjusting
   for lifetime diagnoses of substance misuse disorders. CD was not
   associated with homicide. CD was associated with life-time diagnoses of
   alcohol and drug abuse and/or dependence. During the 24 month follow-up
   period, CD and the number of CD symptoms were associated with aggressive
   behavior, controlling for life-time diagnoses of substance use
   disorders, substance misuse measured objectively and subjectively,
   medication compliance, and obligatory care. CD was associated with an
   earlier age at onset of schizophrenia and at first admission to
   hospital, and with length of time spent in hospital. During the two-year
   follow-up period, neither the diagnosis of CD nor the number of CD
   symptoms was associated with levels of positive and negative symptoms
   assessed five times, compliance with medication, substance use, or
   readmission. The results are interpreted to suggest that CD is a
   distinct co-morbid disorder that runs parallel to the course of
   schizophrenia. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A focus of contemporary cancer therapeutic development is the targeting
   of both the transformed cell and the supporting cellular
   microenvironment. Cell migration is a fundamental cellular behavior
   required for the complex interplay between multiple cell types necessary
   for tumor development. We therefore developed a novel retroviral-based
   screening technology in primary human endothelial cells to discover
   genes that control cell migration. We identified the receptor tyrosine
   kinase Ax1 as a novel regulator of endothelial cell haptotactic
   migration towards the matrix factor vitronectin. Using small interfering
   RNA-mediated silencing and overexpression of wild-type or mutated
   receptor proteins, we show that AA is a key regulator of multiple
   angiogenic behaviors including endothelial cell migration,
   proliferation, and tube formation in vitro. Moreover, using sustained,
   retrovirally delivered short hairpin RNA (shRNA) Ax1 knockdown, we show
   that Ax1 is necessary for in vivo angiogenesis in a mouse model.
   Furthermore, we show that Ax1 is also required for human breast
   carcinoma cells to form a tumor in vivo. These findings indicate that
   Ax1 regulates processes vital for both neovascularization and
   tumorigenesis. Disruption of Ax1 signaling using a small-molecule
   inhibitor will hence simultaneously affect both the tumor and stromal
   cell compartments and thus represents a unique approach for cancer
   therapeutic development.}},

   population. These case-control-family designs (including those involving
   twin pairs), can be regarded as retrospective cohort studies of
   relatives, and can be used for: determining familial risks and genetic
   models; estimating risk (penetrance) for measured genotypes; genetic
   association studies; stratifying risks by family history and known
   mutation status; and studying modifiers of risk in genetically
   susceptible individuals. Follow-up of families allows genetic and
   environmental risks to be studied prospectively. We discuss statistical
   methods, theoretical and practical strengths, limitations, and other
   issues. Given their versatility, population-based family studies could
   become a principal framework in epidemiology, and move genetics from its
   traditional focus on high-risk families to give it a wider clinical and
   population health relevance.}},

   factors associate with CBP/p300. With the exception of the SYT
   oncoprotein, no proteins have been identified that specifically
   associate with p300, but not CBP. In the present study, we isolated a
   novel p300-associated protein for which no interaction with CBP was
   observed by GST (glutathione S-transferase) pull-down assay using Jurkat
   cell lysates metabolically labelled with {[}S-35]methionine. This
   protein bound the KIX (kinase-inducible) domain of p300. Following
   resolution by two-dimensional acrylamide gel electrophoresis, we
   identified the KIX-domain-bound protein by MS analysis as PRS1
   (phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase subunit 1), a protein essential
   for nucleoside biosynthesis. This is the first report to demonstrate the
   existence of a p300 KIX-domain-specific-interacting protein that does

Abstract = {{We have identified a new Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene, HIM1, mapped on
   the right arm of the chromosome IV (ORF YDR317w), mutations in which led
   to an increase in spontaneous mutation rate and elevated the frequencies
   of mutations, induced by UV-light, nitrous acid, ethylmethane sulfonate
   and methylmethane sulfonate. At the same time, him1 mutation did not
   result in the increase of the sensitivity to the lethal action of these
   DNA-damaging agents. We tested the induced mutagenesis in double mutants
   carrying him] mutation and mutations in other repair genes: apn1,
   blocking base excision repair; rad2, rev3, and rad54, blocking three
   principal DNA repair pathways; pms1, blocking mismatch repair; hsm2 and
   hsm3 mutations, which lead to a mutator effect. Epistatic analysis
   showed a synergistic interaction of him] with pms1, apn1, and rad2
   mutations, and epistasis with the rev3, the rad54, the hsm2, and the
   hsm3. To elucidate the role of the HIM1 in control of spontaneous
   mutagenesis, we checked the repair of DNA mispaired bases in the him1
   mutant and discovered that it was not altered in comparison to the
   wild-type strain. In our opinion, our results suggest that HIM1 gene
   participates in the control of processing of mutational intermediates
   appearing during error-prone bypass of DNA damage. (C) 2005 Elsevier

   defined 66 MHC I alleles in Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) of

Abstract = {{Two slow-growth local chicken strains, derived from a common base
   population, were bi-directionally selected over twenty generations for
   carcass traits (B strain) and egg production (L2 strain). The objective
   of the present study was to identify hypothalamic proteins associated
   with high egg production (by taking advantage of the similar genetic
   background of these two strains). Prior to and during egg laying,
   hypothalamic proteins of B and L2 hens were analyzed with
   two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Approximately 430
   well-resolved spots, ranging from 10 to 40 kDa, pH 5-9, were quantified
   by image processing. Eight protein spots differed in quantity between B
   and L2 strains at either stage. Using LC-MS/MS, we identified six of
   eight protein spots, including proteins known for regulating gene
   expression, signal transduction and lipid metabolism. The mRNA
   expression levels of these six proteins were then evaluated by
   quantitative RT-PCR in five strains of hens, including B, L2 and another
   three commercial strains; heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H3
   (HNRPH3) was higher in L2 than in the B strain (consistent with the
   findings in 2-DE). Increased levels of HNRPH3 mRNA were also present in
   the hypothalamus of high-egg-yield White Leghorn layers, but were absent
   in other domestic commercial strains with low egg production rates. In
   conclusion, the expression level of HNRPH3 may be a new molecular marker
   to screen for high egg production in slow-growth local chickens. (c)

Abstract = {{The effect of strain rate on the initiation and propagation of shear
   bands in the Zr41.2Ti13.8Cu12.5Ni10Be22.5 bulk metallic glass under
   shear loading was investigated. The quasi-static (at a strain rate of
   1.5 x 10(-3) s(-1)) and the dynamic shear tests (at a strain rate of 1.4
   x 10(3) s(-1)) were conducted at room temperature using a GATAN
   Microtest-2000 instrument and a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) with
   a specially designed `Plate-shear' specimen, respectively. The complete
   process of shear band initiation, propagation, and shear band unstable
   propagation-induced fracture was revealed. The experimental results
   demonstrated that the macroscopic shear strength is relatively
   insensitive to the strain rate, whereas shear band initiation and
   fracture are significantly dependent on strain rate. A dimensionless
   Deborah number was introduced to characterize the effect of the strain
   rate on the formation of shear bands. Additionally, the observed
   numerous liquid droplets and melted belts on the fracture surface at
   high-strain rates demonstrate that the adiabatic heating exerts a
   significant effect on fracture behavior of the material. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report on highly efficient red-phosphorescent
   light-emitting diodes using a series of osmium complexes 1-3 doped into
   poly(N-vinyl-carbazole) (PVK) matrix as emitters, thermally stable
   1,3,5-tris(4'-fluorobiphenyl-4-yl)benzene (F-TBB) as a hole-blocking
   layer, and Alq(3) as an electron injection layer. The CIE 1931
   chromaticity coordinates of complexes 1-3 are around (0.650, 0.347),
   (0.681, 0.317), and (0.696, 0.302), respectively, and remain almost
   unchanged over a wide range of operation voltages. The maximum luminous
   efficiencies reached 7.0, 3.5, and 1.2 cd/A for devices based on 10
   wt.\% of osmium complexes 1, 2 and 3, respectively, even with air stable
   aluminum as the cathode. We systematically studied the dependence of
   device performance on the osmium doping concentrations. It was found
   that the best device performance was observed at 10 wt.\% doping
   concentration for all three osmium complexes. Both maximum luminance and
   luminous efficiency increased with increasing osmium complex
   concentrations in the beginning and reached maximum at 10 wt.\% doping
   concentration. However, a further increase in the doping level resulted
   in a reduction in both device brightness and efficiency due to
   concentration quenching and triplet-triplet annihilation. This is
   consistent with the absolute photoluminescence quantum yields of PVK
   thin films doped with different concentration of osmium complexes. (C)

Abstract = {{In this contribution we report studies of the nature of solvation and
   resonance energy transfer processes in a reverse micelle (RM) upon
   encapsulation of a digestive enzyme, alpha-chymotrypsin (CHT). We have
   used one donor, Coumarin 500 (C500), and three acceptors Rhodamine 123
   (R 123, cationic), ethidium bromide (EtBr, cationic), and Merocyanine
   540 (MC540, anionic). By selectively exciting the donor at the surface
   of the RM with a proper excitation wavelength we have examined solvation
   dynamics in the microenvironment. The solvation correlation function in
   the RM without CHT exhibits single-exponential decay with time constant
   similar to 660 ps, which is similar to that of the CHT-included RM.
   However, in the case of CHT-included RM (w(0) = 10), the time-resolved
   anisotropy and spectral linewidth analysis of the surface-bound donor
   reveal the existence of an annular aqueous channel of thickness similar
   to 2.5 angstrom between the enzyme surface and the inner surface of the
   RM. The aqueous channel is a potential host for the water-soluble
   substrate and also is involved in maintaining the proper functionality
   of RM encapsulated CHT. The studies use both steady-state and
   time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) techniques
   to measure donor-acceptor distances in the RM and also emphasize the
   danger of using steady-state fluorescence quenching as a method in
   careful estimation of the distances. The local geometrical restriction
   on the donor and acceptor molecules was estimated from time-resolved
   polarization (anisotropy) measurements. The time-resolved anisotropy of
   the donor and acceptor molecules also revealed significant randomization
   of the relative orientation of transition dipoles of the donor and
   acceptor, justifying the use of 2/3 as the value of the orientation
   factor K-2. These studies attempt to elucidate the excellence of the RM
   as a nanohost of biological macromolecules. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) is an early
   event in > 60\% of sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Loss
   of VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase function results in accumulation of the
   alpha-subunit of the hypoxia-inducible heterodimeric transcription
   factor (HIF-alpha) and transcription of an array of genes including
   vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor-alpha,
   and erythropoietin. Studies have shown that HIF-alpha can be
   alternatively activated by reactive oxygen species. Nox4 is an NADP(H)
   oxidase that generates signaling levels of superoxide and is found in
   greatest abundance in the distal renal tubules. To determine if Nox4
   contributes to HIF activity in RCC, we examined the impact of Nox4
   expression on HIF-alpha expression and transactivation. We report here
   that small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) knockdown of Nox4 in 786-0 human renal
   tumor cells expressing empty vector (PRC) or wild-type VHL (WT) results
   in 50\% decrease in intracellular reactive oxygen species as measured by
   a fluorescent 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate assay, and > 85\%
   reduction in HIF2-alpha mRNA and protein levels by quantitative reverse
   transcription-PCR and Western blot analysis. Furthermore, expression of
   the HIF target genes, vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming
   growth factor-alpha, and Glut-1 was abrogated by 93\%, 74\%, and 99\%,
   respectively, after stable transfection with Nox4 siRNA relative to
   nontargeting siRNA, as determined by quantitative reverse
   transcription-PCR. Thus, renal Nox4 expression is essential for full
   HIF2-alpha expression and activity in 786-0 renal tumor cells, even in
   the absence of functional VHL. We propose the use of Nox4 as a target in
   the treatment of clear cell RCC.}},

Abstract = {{Microenvironmental factors affect different aspects of tumor cell
   biology, including cell survival, invasion, and metastasis. Here, we
   report that hepatocyte growth factor and hypoxia may contribute to
   breast carcinoma cell invasiveness by inducing the chemokine receptor
   CXCR4. Hepatocyte growth factor enhanced CXCR4 mRNA and protein
   expression exclusively in MCF-7 (low invasive) carcinoma cells, while in
   response to hypoxia, CXCR4 induction was observed in both MCF-7 and
   MDA-MB 231 (highly invasive) carcinoma cells. The receptor induction had
   a functional role in cancer cells, as demonstrated by the fact that
   hepatocyte growth factor pretreatment promoted MCF-7 cell migration
   toward the CXCR4-specific ligand CXCL12. Extracellular signal-regulated
   protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)
   transduction pathways seemed to be differently implicated in the early
   induction of CXCR4 by hepatocyte growth factor or hypoxia in the two

Abstract = {{Epitaxial thin films of (La0.5Pr0.2)Ba0.3MnO3 were deposited on LaAlO3
   single-crystal substrates using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique
   with different growth parameters. Structural, surface morphological,
   electrical, and magnetotransport measurements on these films revealed
   that unoptimized growth parameters during the deposition using the third
   harmonic of a Q-switched Nd: YAG laser yielded structurally
   inhomogeneous epitaxial films having a columnar morphology, while the
   optimized growth parameters using an excimer laser during the PLD
   resulted in homogeneous epitaxial films with a smooth morphology.
   Interestingly, at a temperature of 5 K, the films with unoptimized
   growth parameters showed a large high-field magnetoresistance (MR) of
   similar to 90\% while the films with optimized growth parameters showed
   a high-field MR of only similar to 15\%. It is contemplated that this
   exceptionally large MR in the unoptimized films might be due to the
   phase separation and coexistence of metallic and insulating phases.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: Differential display (DD) or arbitrarily primed
   fingerprinting serves to identify differentially expressed genes, but
   these techniques cannot determine how many of the theoretically
   available genes have been uncovered. Previous mathematical models are
   unsatisfying as they are not suitable to analyze experimental data.
   Results: In the present study, we provide a statistical model based on
   the redundancy of cDNA fragments amplified during DD experiments. This
   model is applicable to any DD and predicts (1) the total number of genes
   expressed in a sample cell type or tissue, (2) the number of
   differentially expressed genes, (3) the coverage obtained with any given
   number of primer combinations. In a DD experiment comparing two
   developmental stages of the post natal rat inner ear, we estimated the
   total number of differentially expressed genes accessible by DD to be
   445, and the number of primer combinations required to uncover 90\% of
   these to be 127.}},

Abstract = {{Ionizing radiation potentiates the oncolytic activity of attenuated
   herpes simplex viruses in tumors exposed to irradiation at specific time
   intervals by inducing higher virus yields. Cell culture studies have
   shown that an attenuated virus lacking the viral gamma(1)34.5 genes
   underproduces late proteins whose synthesis depends on sustained
   synthesis of viral DNA. Here we report that ionizing radiation enhances
   gene expression from late viral promoters in transduced cells in the
   absence of other viral gene products. Consistent with this result, we
   show that in tumors infected with the attenuated virus, ionizing
   radiation increases 13.6-fold above baseline the gene expression from a
   late viral promoter as early as 2 hours after virus infection, an
   interval too short to account for viral DNA synthesis. The
   radiation-dependent up-regulation of late viral genes is mediated by the
   p38 pathway, inasmuch as the enhancement is abolished by p38 inhibitors
   or a p38 dominant-negative construct. The p38 pathway is not essential
   for wild-type virus gene expression. The results suggest that ionizing
   radiation up-regulates late promoters active in the course of viral DNA
   synthesis and provide a rationale for use of radiation to up-regulate
   cytotoxic genes introduced into tumor cells by viral vectors for
   cytoreductive therapy.}},

Abstract = {{The electrical and dielectrical properties of Bi2O3-Fe2O3-P2O5 glasses
   were measured by impedance spectroscopy in the frequency range from 0.01
   Hz to 4 MHz and over the temperature range from 303 to 473 K. It was
   shown that the dc conductivity strongly depends on the Fe2O3 content and
   Fe(II)/Fe-tot ratio. With increasing Fe(II) ion content from 17\% to
   34\% in the bismuth-free 39.4Fe(2)O(3)-59.6P(2)O(5) and
   9.8Bi(2)O(3)-31.7Fe(2)O(3)-58.5P(2)O(5), glasses, the dc conductivity
   increases. On the other hand, the decrease in dc conductivity for the
   glasses with 18.9 mol\% Bi2O3 is attributed to the decrease in Fe2O3
   content from 31.7 to 23.5 mol\%, which indicates that the conductivity
   for these glasses depends on Fe2O3 content. The conductivity for these
   glasses is independent of the Bi2O3 content and arises mainly from
   polaron hopping between Fe(II) and Fe(III) ions suggesting an electronic
   conduction. The evolution of the complex permittivity as a function of
   frequency and temperature was investigated. At low frequency the
   dispersion was investigated in terms of dielectric loss. The thermal
   activated relaxation mechanism dominates the observed relaxation
   behavior. The relationship between relaxation parameters and electrical
   conductivity indicates the electronic conductivity controlled by polaron
   hopping between iron ions. The Raman spectra show that the addition of
   up to 18.9 mol\% of Bi2O3 does not produce any changes in the glass
   structure which consists predominantly of pyrophosphate units. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Abnormal dendritic cell differentiation and accumulation of
   immunosuppressive myeloid cells in cancer is one of the major factors of
   tumor nonresponsiveness. We have previously shown that hyperactivation
   of the Janus-activated kinase 2/signal transducers and activators of
   transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) induced by tumor-derived factors (TDF) is
   responsible for abnormal dendritic cell differentiation. Here, using a
   novel selective inhibitor of JAK2/STAT3 JSI-124, we investigated the
   possibility of pharmacologic regulation of dendritic cell
   differentiation in cancer. Our experiments in vitro have shown that
   JSI-124 overcomes the differentiation block induced by TDF and promotes
   the differentiation of mature dendritic cells and macrophages. JSI-124
   significantly reduced the presence of immature myeloid cells in vivo and
   promoted accumulation of mature dendritic cells. In addition to a direct
   antitumor effect in several animal models, JSI-124 significantly
   enhanced the effect of cancer immunotherapy. This indicates that
   pharmacologic inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway can he an important
   new therapeutic strategy to enhance antitumor activity of cancer
   immunotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine the effect of unilateral acute
   inflammation of cramofacial deep tissues on the ipsilateral and
   contralateral jaw-opening reflex (JOR). The effects of mustard oil (MO),
   injected into the temporomandibular joint region, were tested on the JOR
   recorded in the digastric muscle and evoked by low-intensity electrical
   stimulation of the ipsilateral and contralateral inferior alveolar nerve
   in anesthetized rats. The MO injection induced a long-lasting
   suppression of the amplitude of both ipsilaterally and contralaterally
   evoked JOR, although the latency and duration of the JOR were
   unaffected. The suppressive effect was more prominent for the
   contralaterally evoked JOR, and observed even when background activity
   in the digastric muscle was increased by the MO injection. The results
   indicate that changes in the, JOR amplitude following MO injection do
   not simply reflect alterations in motoneuronal excitability, and suggest
   that inflammation of deep craniofacial tissues modulates low-threshold
   sensory transmission to the motoneurons. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

   cell proliferation. In contrast, tumorigenesis remained unaffected in
   either compound mutants of K19-C2mE containing Il1r1 or Rag2 mutation,
   indicating that neither interleukin-1 beta signaling nor T cell/B cell
   response was required for the development of hyperplastic tumors.
   Importantly, spasmolytic polypeptide/trefoil factor 2-expressing
   metaplasia (SPEM) in the K19-C2mE stomach was also suppressed in the Tnf
   (-/-) K19-C2mE mice, indicating that TNF-alpha-dependent inflammation is
   responsible for SPEM development. Because gastric metaplasia to the SPEM
   lineage is considered as a preneo-plastic lesion of gastric cancer, it
   is possible that inhibition of TNF-alpha-dependent inflammation,
   together with eradication of Helicobacter, can be an effective
   prevention strategy for gastric cancer.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient extraction and cleanup technique, and an instrumental
   detection method suitable for determination of trace amounts of
   hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) and its
   nitroso-metabolites in animal liver tissue were developed and validated
   in this paper. The method includes the extraction of explosives from
   liver tissue samples using accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) followed
   by cleanup using florisil and styrene-divinyl benzene (SDB) cartridges
   to remove interfering naturally endogenous compounds. The instrumental
   analysis was conducted using a capillary column gas chromatograph
   coupled with an electron capture detector (GC-ECD). High recoveries
   (58.9-106.8\%) of RDX, hexahydro-1-nitroso-3,5-dinitro-1,3,5-triazine
   (NNX), hexahydro-1,3-dinitroso-5-nitro-1,3,5-triazine (DNX), and
   hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitroso-1,3,5-triazine (TNX) were achieved at all
   concentrations studied. RDX, MNX, and TNX gave higher recoveries than
   DNX at all three tested concentrations (50, 250, 1250 ng/g). Overall
   recoveries of RDX, MNX, DNX, and TNX from 1 g beef liver samples
   containing 50, 250, and 1250 ng/g were 80.1, 82.8, 68.9, and 80.4\%,
   respectively. The optimal injection port temperature range was 160-170
   degrees C for analysis of RDX and its nitroso-metabolites. Higher or
   lower temperatures than 160-170 degrees C decreased signal amplitudes.
   RDX was unstable in the liver extraction matrix; as much as 50\% of RDX
   was degraded 10 days after extraction if keeping the liver sample
   extracts at room temperature. Degradation of RDX to MNX, DNX, or TNX was
   not detected during the sample storage, extraction, or instrument
   analysis processes. Other optimized extraction and GC conditions are
   also discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   The properties of the tests are investigated both under the null and

   the method used to obtain residuals largely affects the power behavior
   of the tests. For instance, imposing the null hypothesis in the residual
   estimation step-although it does not affect the behavior of the test if
   the null is true-it leads to a loss of power under the alternative as
   compared to tests based on resampling unrestricted residuals. Residuals
   obtained using a parameter estimator which minimizes their variance
   maximizes the power of the corresponding bootstrap-based tests. In this
   context, studentizing makes the tests more robust to such residual
   effects. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the release of uranium from natural ore deposits, spent
   nuclear fuel repositories, and REDOX permeable reactive barriers (PRB),
   knowledge of the fundamental reaction kinetics associated with the
   dissolution of uranium dioxide is necessary. Dissolution of crystalline
   uranium (IV) dioxide under environmental conditions has been studied for
   four decades but a cardinal gap in the published literature is the
   effect of pH and solution saturation state on UO2(cr) dissolution. To
   resolve inconsistencies, UO2 dissolution experiments have been conducted
   under oxic conditions using the single-pass flow-through system.
   Experiments were conducted as it function of total dissolved carbonate
   ({[}CO3-3](T)) from 0.001 to 0.1 M: pH from 7.5 to 11.1: ratio of
   flow-through rate (q) to specific surface area (S), constant ionic
   strength (I) = 0. 1 M, and temperatures (T) from 23 to 60 degrees C
   utilizing both powder and monolithic specimens. The results show that
   UO2 dissolution varies as a function of the ratio q/S and temperature.
   At values of log(10)q/S > -7,0, UO2 dissolution becomes invariant with
   respect to q/S, which can be interpreted its evidence for dissolution at
   the forward rate of reaction. The data collected in these experiments
   show the rate of UO2 dissolution increased by an order of magnitude with
   a 30 degrees C increase in temperature. The results also show the
   overall dissolution rate increases with an increase in pH and decreases
   as the dissolved uranium concentration approaches saturation with
   respect to secondary reaction products. Thus, as the value of the
   reaction quotient, Q, approaches equilibrium K, (with respect to a
   potential secondary phase) the dissolution rate decreases. This decrease
   in dissolution rate (r) was also observed when comparing measured UO2
   dissolution rates from static tests where r = 1.7 +/- 0.14 x 10 (8) mol
   m (2)s (1) to the rate for flow-through reactors where r = 3.1 +/- 1.2 x
   10(-7) mol m (-2) s(-1) . Thus, using traditional static test methods
   can result in an underestimation of the true forward rate of UO2(cr)
   dissolution. These results illustrate the importance of pH solution
   saturation state, and the concentration of dissolved carbonate on the
   release of uranium from UO2 in the natural environment. Published by

Abstract = {{A chemically modified electrode (CME) was prepared and studied as a

   titration of vanadium(V) with EDTA. The CME was constructed with a paste
   prepared by mixing spectral-grade graphite powder, Nujol oil and
   N-2-naphthoyl-N-p-tolylhydroxamic acid (NTHA). Buffer systems, pH
   effects and the concentration range were studied. Interference ions were
   separated by applying a liquid-liquid extraction procedure.
   The CME did not require any special conditioning before using. The
   electrode was constructed with very inexpensive materials and was easily
   made. It could be continuously used, at least two months without
   removing the paste.
   Automatic potentiometric titration curves were obtained for V(V) within
   5 x 10(-5) to 2 x 10(-3) M with acceptable accuracy and precision. The

   years. {[}C-11] Raclopride (RAC) positron emission tomography (PET) was
   used to assess dopamine (D2) receptor availability. The CANTAB
   neuropsychological test battery was used to assess spatial span, spatial
   working memory (SWM) and planning ability. Age showed significant linear
   correlations with several of the CANTAB performance measures. After
   controlling for age effects, DA (D2) receptor measures in left-sided
   striatal regions (caudate and putamen) were significantly and positively
   correlated with `perfect solution' scores-the measure of performance
   accuracy-on the Tower of London (TOL) test of spatial planning. When
   this relationship was examined in relation to task difficulty, only
   perfect scores for the most `difficult' (4-move) problems were
   significantly correlated with BP measures in all striatal regions, most
   notably the right and left caudate nuclei. Paradoxically, individuals
   with higher DA (D2) receptor measures in the right caudate performed
   less accurately on the SWM task, exhibiting a higher number of errors
   within each search sequence. The relative contribution of striatal DA
   (D2) receptor availability to specific aspects of cognitive performance
   needs to be evaluated in larger mixed-sex samples to facilitate the
   meaningful investigation of the potential therapeutic benefits of DA
   (D2) agonists in later life. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nitric oxide (NO) mediates cell signaling at low (nanomolar)
   concentrations, but can be cytotoxic at higher concentrations. Heme
   oxygenase-1 (HO-1), implicated in a role in NO resistance, might confer
   its protective effect through the direct products biliverdin and CO or
   the secondary product bilirubin. We have therefore tested whether
   biliverdin, bilirubin, or CO can provide resistance to NO toxicity. HeLa
   cells treated with bilirubin or biliverdin (up to 25 mu M) had unchanged
   survival of an NO challenge (1 mM spermine-NONOate or 2 mM DEA-NO),
   although they displayed increased resistance to H2O2 (350 mu M). In
   contrast, prior exposure to CO (up to 100 ppm) increased NO resistance.
   An interval between CO exposure and NO resistance was required for the
   increased NO resistance. Because the CO-activated NO resistance was also
   blocked by the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D, inducible gene
   expression seems critical for the cytoprotection elicited by CO.
   Experiments in the presence of HO and guanylate cyclase inhibitors
   indicated that HO activity and cGMP signaling are not essential for the
   CO-protective effect. Last, inhibition of p38 MAPK activation fully
   blocked the CO-protective effect, indicating the involvement of this
   signaling pathway(s) in the CO response. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{To evaluate the potential role of endogenous zinc in the pathophysiology
   of epilepsy, we injected kainic acid into the medial septum, which
   evokes seizure activity and delayed. hippocampal degeneration. Different
   approaches were used. In the hippocampus, we found a movement of zinc
   from the synaptic compartment to CA1 pyramidal neurons and astrocytes
   after kainate. The same was true in the amygdala. We found that in those
   areas showing intense zinc bleaching there was also a loss of reactive
   astrocytes, which supports the view that release of synaptic zinc
   induces astrocytic cell death. We have also tested whether the
   kainate-induced zinc movement from the synaptic compartment to neuronal
   or glial cells alters the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic
   factor (BDNF) and its high-affinity receptor, trkB. There was a
   prominent loss of expression of trkB mRNA in areas that coincided
   precisely with those displaying astrocyte loss and zinc bleaching. In
   the amygdala, these events were accompanied by a high upregulation of
   BDNF mRNA. To demonstrate further a role of synaptic zinc in hippocampal
   pathology, we used two different approaches. We first injected different
   doses of zinc chloride in the CA1 area. At lower doses (0.1-10 nmol),

   microwave autointerferometry in a surface wave discharge at medium

   from Rayleigh scattering, and electrons, given by double probe
   measurements, have been used to estimate the mean free path and the
   sheath length. Hence, the number of collisions in the sheath has been
   obtained. We have verified that two different phenomena occur in the
   sheath, while the pressure increases. These phenomena are depicted, in
   literature, as two different coefficients used to modify the value of
   the noncollisional current of Laframboise. Coefficients given by various
   authors have been investigated with accuracy knowing the number of
   collisions in the sheath. Very good agreements are obtained between
   Zakrzewski and Kopiczynski theory and autointerferometry measurements

Abstract = {{The diffusivity and solubility of argon, methane, oxygen, and carbon
   dioxide in two EPDM-based polymers, one formulated with 34 wt\% carbon
   black and the other formulated without carbon black, have been measured
   at 20 degrees C and at a range of pressures up to 266.448 x 10(2) Pa
   (2000 Torr). A linear relationship was observed between the amount
   sorbed and pressure for all gases, indicative of Henry's law behavior.
   The uptake kinetic measurements were well represented by a Fickian
   diffusion model and the resulting diffusivity was found to be
   independent of pressure. Analysis of solubility data revealed that the
   carbon black filler appeared to uptake negligible quantities of gas. The
   observed effect of non-porous filler on diffusivity and permeability was
   compared with Maxwell theory prediction and fell within experimental
   error. The experimental results were used to assess the applicability of
   a corresponding-states based correlation for predicting gas diffusivity
   and solubility in polymers. This correlation was found to adequately
   represent an order of magnitude estimate of the data for all gases,
   allowing estimates to be made for other gases not considered in this

Abstract = {{A theory is presented that describes an enhancement in the rate of the
   electrochemical oxidation of methanol. Replacing a fraction of the
   original electrolyte with a more inhibiting one causes the enhanced
   rate. Results from experiments conducted on the electrochemical
   oxidation of methanol at Pt are also presented. In the experiments, a
   fraction of the original supporting electrolyte, perchloric acid, was
   replaced with tetrafluoroboric acid. Although the fluoroborate anion is
   more inhibiting than the perchlorate anion, the replacement caused an
   increase in the rate of the oxidation of methanol. Previous results and
   results presented here provide evidence that surface reorganization,
   basicity, participation of anions in reactions, or a more efficient
   removal of surface bonded CO are highly unlikely to be the fundamental
   cause of the increased rate of methanol oxidation. A mathematical
   description of methanol oxidation coupled to anion adsorption reveals
   that an enhanced rate of oxidation can be achieved if forces between
   unlike surface anions are stronger than the forces between like surface
   anions. A sufficient condition for enhancement is derived, which
   consists of a relation between the anion adsorption coefficients and the
   parameter representing the interactions between unlike surface anions.

   general practitioners, practices) and included morbidity (self-report
   and presented to general practitioners), diagnostic and therapeutic
   interventions, doctor-patient communication, and background
   characteristics. Compared to 1987 (the first National Survey), Dutch
   general practitioners had organized their work more efficiently.
   Patients were less satisfied (78\% satisfied) about the organizational
   aspects of general practice care than about the care actually provided
   (90\% satisfied). Dutch general practitioners provide high-quality care:
   on average, their performance was in 74\% of cases in accordance with
   national guidelines. Communication in general practice had become less
   social and more medically oriented compared to 1987. General practice
   still acts in a gatekeeper role; this is illustrated by 96\% of contacts
   handled solely by the general practitioner.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new spectral index, the Normalized Difference Fraction
   Index (NDFI), for enhanced detection of forest canopy damage caused by
   selective logging activities and associated forest fires. The NDFI
   synthesizes information from several component fraction images derived
   from spectral mixture models. Interpretation of the NDFI data is
   facilitated by 4 contextual classification algorithm (CCA) that enables
   accurate mapping of logging and fire-derived canopy damages. The CCA
   utilizes detected log landings, which are the spatial signature of
   selective logging, as starting locations for searching the NDFI image
   for canopy damage. This process separates canopy changes due to logging
   and associated forest fires from those caused by other natural
   disturbances. These methods were tested in the Sinop region, in the
   Southern Brazilian Amazon. Forest transect inventories, conducted along
   a gradient of degraded forests, were used to evaluated the performance
   of the NDFI. The NDFI was more sensitive to canopy damage than any
   individual fraction and is shown to have the potential for further
   sub-classification of degradation levels in forest environments. Map
   accuracy of forest canopy damage using the CCA classifier, assessed with
   aerial videography images, was 94\%. The proposed NDFI-CCA classifier
   approach can be fully automated and, therefore, holds great promise as a
   forest monitoring tool in tropical forests. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Cure rates for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain low
   despite ever-increasing dose intensity of cytotoxic therapy. In an
   effort to identify novel approaches to AML therapy, we recently reported
   a new method of chemical screening based on the modulation of a gene
   expression signature of interest. We applied this approach to the
   discovery of AML-differentiation-promoting compounds. Among the
   compounds inducing neutrophilic differentiation was DAPH1
   (4,5-dianilinophthalimide), previously reported to inhibit epidermal
   growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase activity. Here we report that the
   Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved EGFR inhibitor gefitinib
   similarly promotes the differentiation of AML cell lines and primary
   patient-derived AML blasts in vitro. Gefitinib induced differentiation
   based on morphologic assessment, nitro-blue tetrazolium reduction,
   cell-surface markers, genome-wide patterns of gene expression, and
   inhibition of proliferation at clinically achievable doses. Importantly,
   EGFR expression was not detected in AML cells, indicating that gefitinib
   functions through a previously unrecognized EGFR-independent mechanism.
   These studies indicate that clinical trials testing the efficacy of
   gefitinib in patients with AML are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{In this era, information technology is revolutionizing almost every
   domain of technology and society, whereas the `complexity revolution' is
   occurring in science at a silent pace. In this paper. we look at the
   impact of the two, in the context of supply-chain networks. With the
   advent of information technology, supply chains have acquired a
   complexity almost equivalent to that of biological systems. However, one
   of the major challenges that we are facing in supply-chain management is
   the deployment of coordination strategies that lead to adaptive,
   flexible and coherent collective behaviour in supply chains. The main
   hurdle has been the lack of the principles that govern how supply chains
   with complex organizational structure and function arise and develop,
   and what organizations and functionality are attainable, given specific
   kinds of lower-level constituent entities. The study of Complex Adaptive
   Systems (CAS), has been a research effort attempting to find common
   characteristics and/or formal distinctions among complex systems arising
   in diverse domains (like biology, social systems, ecology and
   technology) that might lead to a better understanding of how complexity
   occurs, whether it follows any general scientific laws of nature, and
   how it might be related to simplicity. In this paper, we argue that
   supply chains should be treated as a CAS. With this recognition, we
   propose how various concepts, tools and techniques used in the study of
   CAS can be exploited to characterize and model supply-chain networks.
   These tools and techniques are based on the fields of nonlinear
   dynamics, statistical physics and information theory.}},

Abstract = {{This paper assesses the impacts of a GTL plant on the expansion of
   Brazil's oil refining segment. The GTL plant (50,000 bpd) was sized to
   start up operations in 2015, producing diesel and naphtha through the
   indirect route (FT-synthesis). This plant will consume the
   non-associated natural gas production from the recent discoveries at the
   Santos Basin (around 419 Bin 3), and the associated gas production from
   the Campos Basin. Both basins are located in the Southeast of Brazil,
   the most populated, rich and industrialized region of the country. Two
   different criteria for refinery expansion were simulated in order to
   meet oil product demand scenarios. Findings show that depending on the
   refinery expansion criteria considered GTL will play a fundamental hole
   to meet the oil product demand forecast to Brazil in the next 10 years.

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Results from several commonly used approximate methods of evaluating
   electrostatic interactions have been compared to the rigorous,
   nonexpanded electrostatic energies at both uncorrelated and correlated
   levels of theory. We examined a number of energy profiles for both
   hydrogen bonded and stacked configurations of the nucleic acid base
   pairs. We found that the penetration effects play an extremely important
   role and the expanded electrostatic energies are significantly
   underestimated with respect to the ab initio values. Apart from the
   inability to reproduce the magnitudes of the ab initio electrostatic
   energy, there are other problems with the available approximate
   electrostatic models. For example, the distributed multipole analysis,
   one of the most advanced methods, is extremely sensitive to the basis
   set and level of theory used to evaluate the multipole moments. Detailed
   ab initio results are provided that other researchers could use to test
   their approximate models. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{The test-retest reliability of activation patterns elicited by encoding

   predefined medial temporal region of interest (ROI) was investigated.
   Twenty healthy right-handed subjects were studied within two sessions,
   either on the same day or 210-308 days later. Three quantitative
   measures of reliability were calculated for the contrasts encoding and
   recognition versus a control condition within the ROI and also for the
   whole brain: A group correlational analysis between the lateralization
   indices of the first and second session, correlations of the individual
   SPM(t) maps of the first and the second run, and overlap ratios between
   both sessions. For the 1101, correlational analysis of lateralization
   indices during both encoding trials was significant. Eighty percent of
   the individual positive correlation coefficients of SPM(t) maps during
   encoding, and 75\% during recognition reached significance. The mean
   percentage of overlapping voxels was 18\% during encoding and 19\%
   during recognition. The reproducibility measures evaluated for the whole
   brain demonstrated significantly higher values compared to the ROI. For
   the group that stayed inside the scanner, better whole brain test-retest
   reliability was observed, and no influence of the memory process
   (encoding or recognition) on reproducibility was found. (c) 2005

   electrical conductivity by providing a bridging mechanism across the
   cracks formed in the underlying continuous film layers. A simple model
   is used to relate the applied strain to the electrical resistance of the

Abstract = {{T-cell adoptive immunotherapy for stringent murine tumor models, such as
   intracranial, s.c., or advanced pulmonary metastases, routinely uses
   lymphodepletive conditioning regimens before T-cell transfer, like
   recent clinical protocols. In this study, we examined whether host
   lymphodepletion is an obligatory component of curative T-cell therapy;
   we also examined the mechanism by which it augments therapy. Mice
   bearing intracranial, s.c., or 10-day pulmonary metastases of MCA 205
   received total body irradiation conditioning or were nonirradiated
   before i.v. transfer of tumor-reactive T cells. Total body irradiation
   was not required for immunologically specific curative therapy and
   induction of memory provided that a 3- to 12-fold higher T-cell dose was
   administered. The mechanism involved enhanced intratumoral proliferation
   of T-effector cells in total body irradiation-conditioned recipients. In
   this tumor model, intratumoral T-reg cells were not detected;
   consequently, intratumoral T-effector cells produced identical amounts
   of IFN-gamma upon ex vivo antigen stimulation irrespective of total body
   irradiation conditioning. Thus, host lymphodepletion augments T-cell
   immunotherapy through enhanced antigen-driven proliferation of
   T-effector cells, but curative therapy can be achieved in nonconditioned
   hosts by escalation of T-cell dose. These data provide a rationale for
   dose escalation of T-effector cells in situations where single or
   repeated lymphodepletion regimens are contraindicated.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: We consider any collection of microarrays that can be
   ordered to form a progression; for example, as a function of time,
   severity of disease or dose of a stimulant. By plotting the expression
   level of each gene as a function of time, or severity, or dose, we form
   an expression series, or curve, for each gene. While most of these
   curves will exhibit random fluctuations, some will contain a pattern,
   and these are the genes that are most likely associated with the
   quantity used to order them.
   Results: We introduce a method of identifying the pattern and hence
   genes in microarray expression curves without knowing what kind of
   pattern to look for. Key to our approach is the sequence of ups and
   downs formed by pairs of consecutive data points in each curve. As a
   benchmark, we blindly identified genes from yeast cell cycles without
   selecting for periodic or any other anticipated behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Antiplatelet therapies improve endothelial function in atherosclerosis,
   suggesting that platelets regulate vascular nitric oxide (NO)
   bioactivity in vivo. Herein, washed platelets consumed NO on activation
   in an aspirin-sensitive manner, and aspirin enhanced platelet NO
   responses in vitro. To examine whether in vivo aspirin can inhibit
   platelet NO consumption, a double-blind placebo-controlled study was
   conducted. After a 2-week nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug
   (NSAID)-free period, healthy men were randomly assigned and administered
   aspirin (75 mg/d orally) or identical placebo for 14 days, then crossed
   over to the opposite arm. Following in vivo aspirin, NO consumption by
   platelets was inhibited 91\%. Rate of onset and recovery following
   aspirin withdrawal was consistent with cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1)
   inhibition. In a small substudy, NO consumption by platelets from
   postmenopausal women was faster in hypercholesterolemics and less
   sensitive to aspirin (ie, 39\% versus 76\% inhibition for
   hypercholesterolemics or normocholesterolemics, respectively). However,
   150 mg aspirin/day increased inhibition of NO consumption by platelets
   of hypercholesterolemics to 80\%. Comparisons of platelet COX-1 or -2
   expression and urinary 11-dehydro-thromboxane B-2 excretion suggested
   that aspirin was less able to block platelet activation in vivo in
   hypercholesterolemia. In conclusion, aspirin inhibits NO consumption by
   platelets from healthy subjects, but its beneficial effects on NO
   bioactivity may be compromised in some hypercholesterolemic patients.}},

Title = {{p53 codon 72 polymorphism predicts the pathologic response to

Journal = {{CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH}},

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Recent studies have highlighted that the p53 codon 72
   polymorphism plays a crucial role in modulating wild-type p53 apoptotic
   capacity, and as such may influence the response to chemotherapy. Thus,
   the purpose of this study was to investigate whether the p53 codon 72
   polymorphism might influence pathologic response to neoadjuvant
   chemotherapy in primary breast cancer.
   Experimental Design: One hundred and ten operable breast cancer patients
   received anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy and p53 codon 72
   polymorphism status was analyzed by PCR-RFLP.
   Results: The distribution of initial clinical stage, tumor size,
   estrogen receptor or progesterone receptor status, menopausal status, or
   erbB2 expression was not significantly different among the polymorphic
   variants. However, we found that only 13\% (3 of 23) of patients with
   the Pro/ Pro variant had a good pathologic response, defined as a
   complete pathologic response or minimal residual disease. In comparison,
   40\% (22 of 55) or 37.5\% (12 of 32) of patients with the Pro/ Arg or
   Arg/Arg variant had a good pathologic response (P = 0.019). Moreover,
   patients with the Pro/Pro variant were more likely to have a positive
   axillary lymph node status than those with the Pro/Arg orArg/Arg variant
   (P = 0.007). Furthermore, in multivariate analysis, p53 codon 72
   polymorphism was found to be a strong predictor of pathologic response
   (odds ratio 6.7, 95\% confidence interval, 1.4-31.2; P = 0.016).
   Conclusion: Our study indicates that breast cancer patients with the
   Pro/Pro variant may be less sensitive to anthracycline-based treatment
   than those with the Pro/Arg or Arg/Arg variant and suggests that
   analysis of p53 codon 72 polymorphism may provide a simple predictive
   marker for selecting the right breast cancer patients to
   anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in clinical setting.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Purpose:The development of hepatocellular carcinoma is associated with
   the chronic inflammation of the liver caused by various factors such as
   hepatitis B or C virus infection. Previously, we reported DNA binding
   protein A (dbpA) as a candidate molecule that can accelerate
   inflammation-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. DbpA belongs to the Y-box
   binding protein family, and Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1), the
   prototype member of this family, is reported to be a prognostic marker
   of malignant diseases other than hepatocellular carcinoma. The purpose
   of this study is to examine the significance of the expression of dbpA
   or of the T-to-G transversion in the dbpA promoter region, which
   enhances the promoter activity in vitro, for the progression of
   hepatocellular carcinoma.
   Experimental Design: We studied the expression of dbpA (as well as of
   YB-1) in 82 formalin-fixed hepatocellular carcinoma tissues by
   immunohistochemistry and determined the sequence of the dbpA promoter
   region in 42 frozen hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. We examined the
   relationship between these findings and the clinicopathologic factors of
   hepatocellular carcinoma patients.
   Results: DbpA expression was associated with the advanced stages of
   hepatocellular carcinoma, and the cases with the nuclear dbpA expression
   had a poor prognosis. DbpA contributed more significantly to this
   association than YB-1. Furthermore, the T-to-G transversion in the dbpA
   promoter region was related to the nuclear localization of dbpA.
   Conclusion: DbpA was a more significant prognostic marker of
   hepatocellular carcinoma than YB-1. The T-to-G transversion in the dbpA
   promoter region was suggested to be a predisposing factor for the
   progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.}},

   magnitude of these dependencies was relatively lower than the reported
   one for the single crystals and sintered bodies. The longitudinal
   piezoelectric coefficient (d(33,f)) and the transverse coefficient
   (e(31,f)) of 100-120 pm/V and similar to-11.0 C/m(2) were calculated,

Abstract = {{The thermal decomposition of copper(II) acetate monohydrate was studied
   in air using TG-DTG/DTA, DSC, XRD techniques. TG-DTA curves show that
   the decomposition occurs in four steps. TG and XRD data indicate the
   reduction of Cu(II) during the decomposition of CuAc(2)center dot H2O.
   DTG and DSC data imply at least two steps contained in dehydration
   reaction, which is verified by the activation energy values estimated
   with Friedman and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) methods. The dependence of
   activation energy on conversions indicates the dehydration reaction
   contains an additional initial reversible step. The most-probable
   kinetic model has been estimated with multivariate non-linear regression
   method assuming a two-step consecutive reaction. Bna (expanded
   Prout-Tompkins equation) ->. Cn (n order autocatalytic reaction) model
   fits the original data best with a high correlation coefficient of
   0.9998, and the calculated apparent activation energies of the fitted
   models are consistent with those calculated by isoconversional methods
   using original data. The corresponding function f(alpha), activation
   energy E and preexponential factor A of Bna, are (1-alpha)
   (0.7593)alpha(0.2867), 128.5 kJ/mol and 1.6 x 10(15), respectively.
   Those of Cn, are (1-alpha)(1.0534)(1 + 2.712 alpha), 80.5 kJ/mol and 6.9
   x 10(7), respectively. The combination of model free isoconversional
   methods and multivariate non-linear regression can give more reasonable
   and applicable models than commonly used model fitting methods. (C) 2005

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) method is one of the
   generalized-ensemble algorithms which performs random walk in energy
   space and helps a system to escape from local energy traps. In this
   work, we studied the accuracy and efficiency of REMD by examining its
   ability to reproduce the results of multiple extended conventional
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and to enhance conformational
   sampling. Two sets of REMD simulations with different initial
   configurations, one from the fully extended and the other from fully
   helical conformations, were conducted on a fast-folding 21-amino-acid
   peptide with a continuum solvent model. Remarkably, the two REMD
   simulation sets started to converge even within 1.0 ns, despite their
   dramatically different starting conformations. In contrast, the
   conventional MD within the same time and with identical starting
   conformations did not show obvious signs of convergence. Excellent
   convergence between the REMD sets for T > 300 K was observed after 14.0
   ns REMD simulations as measured by the average helicity and free-energy
   profiles. We also conducted a set of 45 MD simulations at nine different
   temperatures with each trajectory simulated to 100.0 and 200.0 ns. An
   excellent agreement between the REMD and the extended MD simulation
   results was observed for T > 300 K, showing that REMD can accurately
   reproduce long-time MD results with high efficiency. The autocorrelation
   times of the calculated helicity demonstrate that REMD can significantly
   enhance the sampling efficiency by 14.3 +/- 6.4, 35.1 +/- 0.2, and 71.5
   +/- 20.4 times at, respectively, similar to 360, similar to 300, and
   similar to 275 K in comparison to the regular MD. Convergence was less
   satisfactory at low temperatures (T < 300 K) and a slow oscillatory
   behavior suggests that longer simulation time was needed to reach
   equilibrium. Other technical issues, including choice of exchange
   frequency, were also examined. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of Ca doping on the Curie temperature, structural,
   dielectric, and elastic properties of Ba0.4Sr0.6-xCaxTiO3 (0 <= x <=

   together with the anomalies in the dielectric constants, Curie

   suggests that a small amount of Ca ions substituted for Ti ions.
   Correlated with the evolution of a with x, T-C increases linearly with
   increasing x from 0 to 0.15; while deviating from linear behavior for x
   > 0.15, T-C increases persistently up to x=0.25 and thereafter shows a
   decrease. These variations of T-C with x have been interpreted in terms
   of Ca-doping-induced A-site cation size variance, a substitution of a
   small amount of Ca ions for Ti ions, and structural phase separation.
   Upon cooling the longitudinal elastic constant C-L shows drastic
   softening near T-C, arising from the electrostrictive coupling between
   the polarization fluctuations and the elastic strains. Moreover, it was
   found that Ca doping induces the hardening of C-L just below T-C, and
   the magnitude of the relative hardening of C-L (i.e., Delta C-L/C-L)
   increases with increasing x, implying that the tetragonal ferroelectric
   phase was increasingly stabilized by Ca doping. (c) 2005 American

Abstract = {{Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human herpesvirus that has infected at
   least 90\% of the world population. This very successful virus causes
   infectious mononucleosis and is associated with many different types of
   cancer. The EBV BZLF1 protein is a transcription factor that has also
   been shown to interact with many host cell proteins and pathways. BZLF1
   (Z) is tagged by the small ubiquitin-related modifier-1 (SUMO-1)
   protein. Here, we present studies of the functional consequences of
   SUMO-1 modification of Z. We found that SUMO-1 modification of Z has no
   apparent effect upon the stability and localization of the Z protein. We
   did find, however, that SUMO-1 modification decreases the
   transactivation activity of Z on specific promoters. In addition, when
   SUMO-1 is supplied to cells when lytic replication is induced, EBV BMRF1
   levels greatly increase, suggesting that SUMO-1 enhances EBV lytic
   replication. Therefore, SUMO-1 modification of proteins appears to have
   an important role in EBV lytic replication. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{{[}1] The impacts of a 40 ha stand of Eucalyptus camaldulensis in the
   Pampas grasslands of Argentina were explored for 2 years using a novel
   combination of sap flow, groundwater data, soil moisture measurements,
   and modeling. Sap flow measurements showed transpiration rates of 2 -
   3.7 mm d(-1), lowering groundwater levels by more than 0.5 m with
   respect to the surrounding grassland. This hydraulic gradient induced
   flow from the grassland areas into the plantation and resulted in a
   rising of the plantation water table at night. Groundwater use estimated
   from diurnal water table fluctuations correlated well with sap flow ( p
   < 0.001, r(2) = 0.78). Differences between daily sap flow and the
   estimates of groundwater use were proportional to changes in surface
   soil moisture content ( p < 0.001, r(2) = 0.75). E. camaldulensis
   therefore used both groundwater and vadose zone moisture sources,
   depending on soil water availability. Model results suggest that
   groundwater sources represented similar to 67\% of total annual water

Abstract = {{Molecular shuttles are on intriguing class of rotaxanes which constitute
   prototypes of mechanical molecular machines and motors. By using
   stopped-flow spectroscopic techniques in acetonitrite solution, we
   investigated the kinetics of the shuttling process of a
   dibenzo{[}24]crown-8 ether (DB24C8) macrocycle between two recognition
   sites or ``stations' -a secondary ammonium (-NH2+-)/amine (-NH-) center
   and a 4,4'-bipyridinium (bipy(2+)) unit-located on the dumbbell
   component in a {[}2]rotaxane. The affinity for DB24C8 decreases in the
   order -NH2+- >bipy(2+) > -NH-. Hence, shuttling of the DB24C8 macrocycle
   can be obtained by deprotonation and reprotonation of the ammonium
   station, reactions which are easily accomplished by addition of base and
   acid to the solution. The rate constants were measured as a function of
   temperature in the range 277-303 K, and activation parameters for the
   shuttling motion in both directions were determined. The effect of
   different counterions on the shuttling rates was examined. The shuttling
   from the -NH2+- to the bipy(2+) station, induced by the deprotonotion of
   the ammonium site, is considerably slower than the shuttling in the
   reverse direction, which is, in turn, activated by reprotonation of the
   amine site. The results show that the dynamics of the shuttling
   processes ore related to the change in the intercomponent interactions
   and structural features of the two mutually interlocked molecular
   components. Our observations also indicate that the counterions of the
   cationic rotaxane constitute an important contribution to the activation

   strategy for the synthesis of these terpenoids involving three stages:
   (a) the selective epoxidation of commercial polyenes, (b)
   titanium(III)-catalyzed cyclization of the epoxypolyprenes thus
   obtained, and (c) Pd-mediated remote functionalization of the equatorial
   methyl group attached at C-4 on ring A of the cyclic terpenoid thus
   formed. This strategy has proved to be useful for the synthesis of the
   natural labdane rostratone (1) and related terpenoids, as well as for
   advanced synthetic approaches toward the pharmacologically active

   heterostructure with an array of submicron normal metal islands. We
   observe the coexistence of strongly interacting multiquanta vortex
   lattice with interstitial Abrikosov vortices. The newly formed composite

   different topological configuration states. The vortex configuration
   states are strongly dependent on the number of flux quanta and the
   nanoscale confinement architecture of the mesoscopic superconductor.
   Here, we present images of vortex phase transitions due to confinement
   effects when the number of magnetic flux quanta in the system changes.
   The vortex dynamics in these systems could serve as a model for behavior
   of confined many-body systems when the number of particles changes.}},

Abstract = {{We study the problem of correspondence between classical and quantum
   statistical models. We show that (contrary to a rather common opinion)
   it is possible to construct a natural pre-quantum classical statistical
   model. The crucial point is that such a pre-quantum classical
   statistical model is not the conventional classical statistical
   mechanics on the phase space R 2,, but its infinite-dimensional
   analogue. Here the phase space Omega = H x H, where H is the (real
   separable) Hilbert space. The classical -> quantum correspondence is
   based on the Taylor expansion of classical physical variables-maps f :
   Omega -> R. The space of classical statistical states consists of
   Gaussian measures on Q having zero mean value and dispersion h. The
   quantum statistical model is obtained as the lim(h -> 0) of the
   classical one. All quantum states including so-called `pure states'
   (wavefunctions) are simply Gaussian fluctuations of the `vacuum field',
   omega = 0 is an element of Omega, having dispersions of the Planck

Abstract = {{Background: A previously reported association between prolonged
   lactation and maternal mortality has generated concern that
   breast-feeding may be detrimental for HIV-positive women.
   Methods: As part of a trial conducted in Lusaka, Zambia, 653
   HIV-positive women were randomly assigned either to a Counseling program
   that encouraged abrupt cessation of breast-feeding at 4 months (group A)
   or to a program that encouraged prolonged breast-feeding for the
   duration of the woman's own informed choice (group B). We examined
   whether mortality up to 2 years post-partum increased with
   breast-feeding for a longer duration.
   Results: There was no difference in mortality 12 months after delivery
   between 326 HIV-positive women randomly assigned to short breast-feeding
   {[}group A: 4.93\%; 95\% confidence interval (0), 2.42-7.46] versus 327
   women assigned to long breast-feeding (group B: 4.89\%; 95\% Cl,
   2.38-7.40). Analysis based on actual practice, rather than random
   assignment, also demonstrated no increased mortality due to
   breast-feeding.
   Conclusions: Although HIV-related mortality was high in this cohort of
   untreated HIV-positive women, prolonged lactation was not associated
   with increased mortality. (c) 2005 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins}},

Abstract = {{The general circulation of the subtropical western North Atlantic is
   described using hydrography and subsurface velocity measured
   simultaneously by 71 profiling floats during the period July 1997 to
   December 2002. Subsurface trajectories of the floats revealed a strong
   topographic influence and depth-dependence of the Gulf Stream, its
   recirculation gyres, and the North Atlantic Current. We discuss
   eddy-like and nonsteady flows in several subregions, especially near the
   major topographic features. The seasonal cycle of volume transport,
   estimated using the absolute geostrophic velocity in the upper 900 m,
   was shown to be a maximum in winter and minimum in summer. The eddy
   kinetic energy and eddy diffusivity, derived from the float data and
   mapped over the subtopical gyre, show seasonal variability in the
   vicinity of the Gulf Stream with a maximum in spring and minimum in
   winter for both quantities.}},

   regimens in 67 HIV-suppressed patients. After a median follow-up of 26
   months (IQR 10.5-40.5),12 (18\%) discontinued the therapy because of
   virological failure. At virological failure `de novo' selected mutations
   were identified in 11 of the 12 failing patients, including the K65R

Abstract = {{Medications targeting the somatostatin type 2 receptor (SSTR2) have been
   employed for pancreatic inflammations and cancers, possibly via the
   regulation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa
   B). Here we demonstrate that in tumoral pancreatic acinar AR42J cells,
   activation of SSTR2 leads to stimulation of the inhibitor kappa B kinase
   (IKK)/ NF kappa B signaling cascade via pertussis toxin-insensitive G
   proteins in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The inability of G(q/11)
   and G(12/13) proteins to activate IKK/NF kappa B by SSTR2 in transfected
   human embryonic kidney 293 cells and the lack of G alpha(16) in AR42J
   cells suggested a possible role of G alpha(14) in mediating
   SSTR2-induced responses. This regulatory role of G alpha(14) was further
   confirmed by the activation of IKK and NF kappa B in human embryonic
   kidney 293 cells expressing SSTR2 and G alpha(14) upon induction. The
   stimulatory effect of G beta(1)gamma(2) and the abrogation by
   overexpressing transducin confirmed the participation of G beta gamma in
   SSTR2-mediated IKK/NF kappa B activation. By the application of specific
   inhibitors and dominant negative mutants, phospholipase C beta, protein
   kinase C, and calmodulin-dependent kinase II were shown to be involved
   in SSTR2-induced responses. Inhibition of c-Src and numerous
   intermediates, including Ras, Raf-1 kinase, MEK1/2, along with the
   extracellular signal-regulated kinase cascade attenuated
   somatostatin-mediated IKK/NF kappa B activation. Although c-Jun
   N-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK) were
   also stimulated by SSTR2, suppression of these two MAPKs was ineffective
   in altering the somatostatin-mediated responses. Similar results were
   also obtained using AR42J cells. These data suggest that activation of
   the IKK/NF kappa B signaling cascade by SSTR2 requires a complicated
   network consisting of G alpha(14) and multiple intermediates.}},

Abstract = {{AIM: Clinical and experimental data suggest that gut-derived endotoxins
   are an important pathogenic factors for progression of chronic liver
   disease. Recently, a C-T (-159) polymorphism in the promoter region of
   the CD14 gene was detected and found to confer increased CD14 expression
   and to be associated with advanced alcoholic liver damage. Here, we
   investigated this polymorphism in patients with less advanced alcoholic
   liver disease (ALD) and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.
   METHODS: CD14 genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP analysis in (a) 121
   HCV patients, (b) 62 patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis
   (Alc-Ci), (c) 118 individuals with heavy alcohol abuse without evidence
   of advanced liver damage (Alc-w/o Ci), and (d) 247 healthy controls.
   Furthermore, serum levels of soluble CD14 (sCD14) and transaminases were
   determined.
   RESULTS: The TT genotype was significantly more frequent in Alc-Ci
   compared to Alc-w/o Ci or controls (40.3\% vs 23.7\% or 24.0\%,
   respectively). In Alc-w/o Ci, serum levels of transaminases did not
   differ significantly between patients with different CD14 genotypes. In
   HCV patients, TT-homozygotes had significantly higher sCD14 levels and
   sCD14 serum levels were significantly higher in patients with advanced
   fibrosis or cirrhosis. However, no association was found between CD14
   genotypes and histological staging or grading.
   CONCLUSION: Considering serum transaminases as surrogate markers for
   alcoholic liver damage, the CD14 polymorphism seems to exhibit different
   effects during the course of ALD. Differences in genotype distribution
   between cirrhotic HCV patients and alcoholics and the known functional
   impact of this polymorphism on CD14 expression levels further indicate
   differences in the pathophysiological role of CD14 and CD14-mediated
   lipopolysaccharides signal transduction with regard to the stage as well
   as the type of the underlying liver disease. (C) 2005 The WJG Press and

   migration from plastic laminates and black nylon cooking utensils were
   determined with the method, and high levels of 4,4'-methylenedianiline

Abstract = {{We analyze differences in ICESat elevation estimates at orbital
   crossover locations to determine short-term rates of elevation change
   for small regions within the Ross Embayment of the West Antarctic Ice
   sheet. A linear regression of crossover elevation difference against
   time difference gives an estimate of the mean elevation-change rate
   during the ICESat mission to date. We observe prevalent elevation change
   in the south, with uplift in the upstream end of Kamb Ice Stream at 0.24
   - 0.30 m a(-1), and thinning in the parts of Whillans Ice Stream, Mercer
   Ice Stream, and the adjacent Conway and Engelhardt ice ridges at 0.05 -
   0.18 m a(-1). These rates of elevation change are too large to be
   explained by the 0.02 - 0.03 m a(-1) formal regression error, by
   seasonal height variations, or by accumulation- or densification-rate
   variability, suggesting that they reflect real variations stemming from
   ice dynamics of the region.}},

Abstract = {{Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are oligomers that perform a
   protective function by binding denatured proteins. Although ubiquitous,
   they are of variable sequence except for a C-terminal similar to
   90-residue ``alpha-crystallin domain{''}. Unlike larger stress response
   chaperones, sHsps are ATP-independent and generally form polydisperse
   assemblies. One proposed mechanism of action involves these assemblies
   breaking into smaller subunits in response to stress, before binding
   unfolding substrate and reforming into larger complexes. Two previously
   solved non-metazoan sHsp multimers are built from dimers formed by
   domain swapping between the alpha-crystallin domains,. adding to
   evidence that the smaller subunits are dimers. Here, the 2.5 angstrom
   resolution structure of an sHsp from the parasitic flatworm Taenia
   saginata Tsp36, the first metazoan crystal structure, shows a new mode
   of dimerization involving N-terminal regions, which differs from that
   seen for non-metazoan sHsps. Sequence differences in the a-crystallin
   domains between metazoans and nonmetazoans are critical to the different
   mechanism of dimerization, suggesting that some structural features seen
   for Tsp36 may be generalized to other metazoan sHsps. The structure also
   indicates scope for flexible assembly of subunits, supporting the
   proposed process of oligomer breakdown, substrate binding and reassembly
   as the chaperone mechanism. It further shows how sHsps can bind coil and
   secondary structural elements by wrapping them around the
   alpha-crystallin domain. The structure also illustrates possible roles
   for conserved residues associated with disease, and suggests a mechanism
   for the sHsp-related pathogenicity of some flatworm infections. Tsp36,
   like other flatworm sHsps, possesses two divergent sHsp repeats per
   monomer. Together with the two previously solved structures, a total of
   four alpha-crystallin domain structures are now available, giving a
   better definition of domain boundaries for sHsps. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The difference of Ca2+ mobilization induced by muscarinic receptor
   activation between parotid acinar and duct cells was examined.
   Oxotremorine, a muscarinic-cholinergic agonist, induced intracellular
   Ca2+ release and extracellular Ca2+ entry through store-operated Ca2+
   entry (SOC) and non-SOC channels in acinar cells, but it activated only
   Ca2+ entry from non-SOC channels in duct cells. RT-PCR experiments
   showed that both types of cells expressed the same muscarinic receptor,
   M3. Given that ATP activated the intracellular Ca2+ stores, the
   machinery for intracellular Ca2+ release was intact in the duct cells.
   By immunocytochemical experiments, IP(3)R2 colocalized with M3 receptors
   in the plasma membrane area of acinar cells; in duct cells, IP(3)R2
   resided in the region on the opposite side of the M3 receptors. On the
   other hand, purinergic P2Y2 receptors were found in the apical area of
   duct cells where they colocalized with IP(3)R2. These results suggest
   that the expression of the IP(3)Rs near G-protein-coupled receptors is
   necessary for the activation of intracellular Ca2+ stores. Therefore,
   the microenvironment probably affects intracellular Ca2+ release and
   Ca2+ entry. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Improving rates of pneumococcal vaccination on discharge from a tertiary
   center medical teaching unit: A prospective intervention}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Pneumococcal disease causes significant morbidity and
   mortality in at-risk individuals, and is complicated by emerging
   antibiotic resistance. An effective, safe and cost-effective vaccine is
   available, but despite this many patients who would benefit from
   pneumococcal vaccination remain unvaccinated. The purpose of this study
   was to determine the rates of missed opportunities to provide
   pneumococcal vaccination to patients being discharged from a tertiary
   center medical teaching unit and to determine if a nurse
   coordinator-based intervention would increase rates of pneumococcal
   vaccination prior to discharge home.
   Methods: We conducted a prospective, controlled study in the setting of
   a Medical Teaching Unit at a tertiary care centre to assess the impact
   of a nurse coordinator based intervention on the rates of vaccination of
   eligible patients on discharge home. The rates of vaccination during an
   eight-week usual-care period ( February 20 to April 16, 2002) and an
   eight-week intervention period ( April 22 to June 16, 2002) were
   compared.
   Results: Prior to the intervention none of thirty-eight eligible
   patients were vaccinated prior to discharge home from the Medical
   Teaching Unit. After the intervention 27 (54\%) of fifty eligible
   patients were vaccinated prior to discharge.
   Conclusion: There are significant missed opportunities to provide
   pneumococcal vaccination to inpatients who are discharged home from a
   medical unit. Using a patient care coordinator we were able to
   significantly improve the rates of vaccination on discharge.}},

Abstract = {{We present a model for the kinetics of spontaneous membrane domain

   power of the domain lifetime when the line tension at the domain edges

   average domain radius is in the tens of nm range, consistent with
   observations. This represents one possible link between signaling

   evidence that suggests that the average raft size may be the same for
   all scale-free recycling schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the impact of the human multidrug resistance gene
   (MDRI) G1199A polymorphism (amino acid change Ser400Asn) on
   P-glycoprotein, (P-gp)-dependent transepithelial permeability and uptake
   kinetics of HIV protease inhibitors (PI), by using recombinant
   epithelial cells expressing wild-type MDR1 (MDR1(wt)) or the G1199A
   variant (MDR1(1199A)).
   Methods: Using a recombinant expression system developed previously, the
   transepithelial permeability and uptake kinetic parameters of five PI,
   amprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir were
   estimated across polarized epithelial cells.
   Results: For all PI, the transepithelial permeability ratio
   (basolateral-to-apical transport divided by apical-to-basolateral
   transport) was significantly greater in MDR1(1199A) cells than MDR1(wt)
   cells: amprenavir (1.7-fold), indinavir (1.8-fold), lopinavir
   (1.5-fold), ritonavir (2.8-fold), and saquinavir (2.1-fold). However,
   the impact of G1199A on P-gp activity appeared to primarily influence
   drug permeability in the apical-to-basolateral direction. Kinetic
   analysis of ritonavir and saquinavir uptake by MDR1(wt)- and
   MDR1(1199A)-expressing cells showed that V-max was similar, while uptake
   Km was significantly higher in cells expressing the G1199A variant
   suggesting that alterations in P-gp-dependent efflux mediated by G1199A
   were due to changes in transporter affinity.
   Conclusions: Alterations in transepithelial permeability of HIV PI due
   to the G1199A polymorphism may impact oral bioavailability of PI and
   penetration into cells and tissues of the lymphoid and central nervous
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{The quasi-equilibrium electrochemomechanical behavior of relatively
   thick polyaniline films in sulfuric acid is investigated through
   experimental measurements and theoretical modeling. The leucoemeraldine
   (LE)-emeraldine (EM) conversion, or redox switching, is studied. The
   dependence of film volume and electrochemical charge is determined as a
   function of applied potential. It is observed that the film volume
   follows the charge, showing an expansion during the second half of the
   LE-EM oxidation. The model postulates the existence of a stable
   intermediate, protoemeraldine (PE), with a formal potential distribution
   for the PE-EM reaction. The volume change is modeled statistically
   considering contributions from mixing, polymer deformation, and
   electrostatic charge. The model shows very good agreement with the
   experiments, indicating that, in the conditions studied, the deformation
   contribution dominates the volume changes as a result of the
   conformational modifications undergone by the polymer in the PE-EM

Title = {{Better prediction of protein contact number using a support vector
   regression analysis of amino acid sequence}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Protein tertiary structure can be partly characterized via
   each amino acid's contact number measuring how residues are spatially
   arranged. The contact number of a residue in a folded protein is a
   measure of its exposure to the local environment, and is defined as the
   number of C-beta atoms in other residues within a sphere around the
   C-beta atom of the residue of interest. Contact number is partly
   conserved between protein folds and thus is useful for protein fold and
   structure prediction. In turn, each residue's contact number can be
   partially predicted from primary amino acid sequence, assisting tertiary
   fold analysis from sequence data. In this study, we provide a more
   accurate contact number prediction method from protein primary sequence.
   Results: We predict contact number from protein sequence using a novel
   support vector regression algorithm. Using protein local sequences with
   multiple sequence alignments (PSI-BLAST profiles), we demonstrate a
   correlation coefficient between predicted and observed contact numbers
   of 0.70, which outperforms previously achieved accuracies. Including
   additional information about sequence weight and amino acid composition
   further improves prediction accuracies significantly with the
   correlation coefficient reaching 0.73. If residues are classified as
   being either ``contacted{''} or ``non-contacted{''}, the prediction
   accuracies are all greater than 77\%, regardless of the choice of
   classification thresholds.
   Conclusion: The successful application of support vector regression to
   the prediction of protein contact number reported here, together with
   previous applications of this approach to the prediction of protein
   accessible surface area and B-factor profile, suggests that a support
   vector regression approach may be very useful for determining the
   structure-function relation between primary sequence and higher order
   consecutive protein structural and functional properties.}},

Abstract = {{Isotope effects in the reaction of hydroxyl radical with methane are
   investigated in a crossed-beam experiment. By exploiting different
   combinations of CH/OD + CH4/CD4/CHD3, a total of eight isotopically
   variant reactions are examined to decipher the dynamical consequence of
   both primary and secondary isotope effects. The most prominent
   observation is from isotopic substitution of the transferred atom
   (primary isotope effect), which yields more stretch-excited water
   product for the D atom case than H atom. The opposite is found, however,
   for excitations in bending and combination modes. The secondary isotope
   effects, from either substituted hydroxyl radical or the three H atoms
   that are not being abstracted, are relatively minor and manifest
   themselves in spreading the vibrational distribution of the water

   overall second-order reaction, first order with respect to each reagent.
   These data, in combination with a normal, primary kinetic isotope effect
   of 2.2(1) for H-2 versus D-2 addition, establish the first H-2 addition
   as the rate-determining step in N-2 hydrogenation. Kinetic isotope
   effects of similar direction and magnitude have also been measured for
   hydrogenation (deuteration) of the two other zirconocene dinitrogen

   consistent with an ordered four-centered transition structure, where H-2
   undergoes formal 1,2-addition to a zirconium-nitrogen bond with
   considerable multiple bond character. Support for this hypothesis stems
   from the observation of N-2 functionalization by C-H activation of a

Abstract = {{Cross-linked polystyrene particles have applications in many fields such
   as ion exchange columns, fuel cell membranes, and catalysis, to name a
   few. Synthesis of these particles in smaller sizes offers various
   advantages due to the increased specific surface area. Polystyrene
   nanoparticles having volume-equivalent diameters in the range of 40-60
   nm were synthesized using emulsion polymerization. Emulsifier-free
   synthesis was also employed, yielding particles in the size range of
   80-90 nm. Sodium styrene sulfonate (NaSS) was used an emulsifying
   comonomer, and divinyl benzene (DVB) was used as a cross-linking agent.
   The average particle diameter increased with increasing DVB
   concentration in the feed. By increasing the NaSS content in the feed
   from 4 to 28 wt \%, the ion exchange capacity of the cross-linked
   polystyrene particles increased from 0.05 to 2.2 meq/g. The presence Of
   SO3Na groups in the cross-linked polystyrene particles was also
   confirmed by using FT-IR, and the intensity of the peaks at 1040 and
   1182 cm(-1) increased with increasing NaSS concentration in the feed.}},

Abstract = {{Mutant R406W human tau was originally identified in frontotemporal
   dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) and causes a
   hereditary tauopathy that clinically resembles Alzheimer's disease (AD).
   In the current study, we examined the performance of R406W transgenic
   (Tg) mice in the forced swimming test, a test with high predictivity of
   antidepressant efficacy in human depression, and found an enhancement of
   the immobility time. In contrast, the motor function and anxiety-related
   emotional response of R406W Tg mice were normal. Furthermore, a
   selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSR1), fluvoxamine (100 mg/ka,
   p.o.), significantly reduced this enhancement of the immobility time,
   whereas a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, desipramine, had no effect.
   In an in vivo microdialysis study, R406W Tg mice exhibited a
   significantly decreased extracellular 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid
   (5-HIAA) level in the frontal cortex and also exhibited a tendency
   toward a decreased extracellular 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) level.
   Moreover, fluvoxamine, which reduced the enhancement of the immobility
   time, significantly increased the extracellular 5-HT level in R406W Tg
   mice. These results suggest that R406W Tg mice exhibit changes in
   depress ion-related behavior involving serotonergic neurons and provide
   an animal model for investigating AD with depression. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A series of dendritic phenylazomethines (DPA), which have a
   meso-substituted zinc porphyrin core (DPAGX-ZnP, X = 1-4), were
   synthesized. Structural studies of these dendrimers were carried out
   using Tri-SEC (triple detection after size exclusion chromatography),
   intrinsic viscosity analysis, TEM (tunneling electron microscopy), and
   molecular modeling calculations by AM1. As a result, a sphere-like
   structure within a single-nanometer scale (R-h = 22 angstrom for
   DPAG4-ZnP) was observed. In addition, encapsulating effects by the DPA
   shell in the larger dendrimers were confirmed as fundamental properties,
   based on the UV-vis abosorption spectra, cyclic voltammograms, and H-1
   NMR spin-lattice relaxation times (T-1). The DPAGX-ZnP acts as a
   multi-metal ion reservoir for SnCl2 and FeCl3. The generation-4
   dendrimer (DPAG4-ZnP) can take up to 60 molar amounts of metal complexes
   around the porphyrin core. A quantitative study of the metal assembling
   reaction by UV-vis titration revealed stepwise layer-by-layer
   complexations from the inner imines nearest to the core to the surface.
   The redox behavior and fluorescence of the zinc porphyrin in these
   metal-assembled clendrimers also support the stepwise complexation of
   the metal ion. These analyses suggest that the finely assembled metal
   complexes in a dendrimer architecture strongly affect the electronic
   status of the porphyrin core. Results from transient absorption
   measurements strongly indicate a very fast electron transfer on a
   subpicosecond time scale between the core and assembled metal complexes.}},

Abstract = {{A new method for the synthesis of hydrated aluminum phosphate,

   sulfate-based solutions with AI(III):P(V) molar ratio of 1 and at 95
   degrees C. Homogeneous precipitation tests led to the definition of the

   supersaturation-controlled seeded test. XRD, TGA, and chemical analysis
   confirmed the product to be AlPO(4)(.)1.5H(2)O, SEM and particle size

Abstract = {{We have adapted two models previously proposed as respiratory pattern
   generators (RPGs) into a neurochemical feed back control model of
   ventilation. The RPG models, non-dimensional as originally presented,
   consisted of oscillating circuits of either two or five interconnected
   neurons {[}Matsugu, M., Duffin, J., Poon, C.-S., 1998. Entrainment,
   instability, quasi-periodicity, and chaos in a compound neural
   oscillator. J. Comput. Neurosci. 5, 35-51; Botros, S.M., Bruce, E.N.,
   1990. Neural network implementation of a three-phase model of
   respiratory rhythm generation. Biol. Cybern. 63, 143-153]. The
   neurochemical model into which they were integrated {[}Longobardo, G.,
   Evangelisti, CT, Cherniack, N.S., 2002. Effects of neural drives on
   breathing in the awake state in humans. Respir. Physiol. 129, 317-333]
   included the effects of cerebral blood flow variation with CO2, vagal
   stretch receptors input and a multicompartment model of carbon dioxide
   stores. The methodology is described whereby these neuronal oscillator
   networks were quantified, a necessary step for their inclusion as RPGs
   in broader models of the overall control of respiration. Subsequent
   simulations of the ventilation response to carbon dioxide with either
   respiratory pattern generator model exhibited only a limited range in
   which tidal volume and frequency increased with increasing respiratory
   drive. With both models, frequency peaked and then declined, as did
   ventilation when P-CO2 was greater than normal. The range of the models
   was extended if the respiratory pattern generators were considered to be
   composed of multiple neuronal oscillators or a single oscillator in
   which there was increasing phasic input that was gated or pacemaker
   driven. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   behavior and energy expenditure. The central administration of C75, a
   potent inhibitor of the fatty acid synthase (FAS), increases malonyl-CoA
   concentration in the hypothalamus and suppresses food intake while
   activating fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle. Closely correlated
   with the increase in muscle fatty acid oxidation is the
   phosphorylation/inactivation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which leads to
   reduced malonyl-CoA concentration. Lowering muscle malonyl-CoA, a potent
   inhibitor of carnitine/ palmitoyl-CoA transferase 1 (CPT1), releases
   CPT1 from inhibitory constraint, facilitating the entry of fatty acids
   into mitochondria for 13 oxidation. Also correlated with these events
   are C75-induced increases in the expression of skeletal muscle
   peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha), a
   transcriptional activator of fatty acid oxidizing enzymes, and
   uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3), a thermogenic mitochondrial uncoupling
   protein. Phentolamine, an a-adrenergic blocking agent, prevents the
   C75-induced increases of skeletal muscle UCP3 and whole body fatty acid
   oxidation and C75-induced decrease of skeletal muscle malonyl-CoA. Thus,
   the sympathetic nervous system is implicated in the transmission of the
   ``malonyl-CoA signal{''} from brain to skeletal muscle. Consistent with
   the up-regulation of UCP3 and PPARa is the concomitant increase in the
   expression of PGC1 alpha, transcriptional coactivator of the UCP3 and
   PPAR alpha-activated genes. These findings clarify the mechanism by
   which the hypothalamic malonyl-CoA signal is communicated to metabolic
   systems in skeletal muscle that regulate fatty acid oxidation and energy
   expenditure.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Connexin 46 (Cx46) is crucial in the maintenance of lens
   homeostasis and it is known to be expressed mainly in the terminally
   differentiated lens fiber cells. The present study aimed to identify the
   spectrum of mutations in Connexin 46 in the Indian population.
   Methods: PCR based Single Stranded Conformational Polymorphism (SSCP)
   analysis was used to screen sixty probands with nonsyndromic congenital
   cataract for mutations in the Cx46 gene (GJA3), followed by direct
   sequencing of samples that showed an electrophoretic shift. Mutation
   predicted to affect the coding sequence were subsequently analyzed in
   the entire pedigree.
   Results: Two novel missense mutations were identified in Cx46. The
   mutation in Family 1 was characterized as R76G with a total cataract
   phenotype. A V28M missense mutation was identified in family 2, the
   cataract phenotype varied in its severity and the age of onset. The
   mutation was also identified in 2 unaffected individuals of the family
   and the intrafamilial variation of the disease suggests the possibility
   of a modifier gene(s) or the effects of environmental factors being
   involved. The mutation was identified in all the affected members in the
   family and found to be absent in 400 ethnically matched control
   chromosomes analyzed.
   Conclusions: We conclude that connexin 46 mutations might account for as
   much as 3.3\% of the hereditary congenital cataract in the Indian
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Physical separation of short-lived isotopes produced in
   heavy-ion-induced fusion reactions is a powerful and well-known method
   and often applied in investigations of the heaviest elements, called the
   transactinides (Z >= 104). By extracting these isotopes from a recoil
   separator, they can be made available for transport to setups located
   outside the heavily shielded irradiation position such as chemistry
   setups. This physical preseparation technique overcomes many limitations
   currently faced in the chemical investigation of transactinides. Here we
   describe the basic principle using relatively short-lived isotopes of
   the lighter group 4 elements zirconium (Zr) and hafnium (Hf) used as
   analogs of the lightest transactinide element, rutherfordium (Rf,
   element 104). The Zr and Hf isotopes were produced at the LBNL 88-Inch
   Cyclotron using a cocktail of O-18 and Ti-50 beams and the appropriate
   targets. Subsequently, the isotopes were physically separated in the
   Berkeley Gas-filled Separator (BGS) and guided to a Recoil Transfer
   Chamber (RTC) to transfer them to chemistry setups. The magnetic
   rigidities of the reaction products in low-pressure helium gas were
   measured and their identities determined with gamma-spectroscopy.
   Using preseparated isotopes has the advantages of low background and
   beam plasma free environment for chemistry experiments. The new
   possibilities that open up for chemical investigations of transactinide
   elements are described.
   The method can readily be applied to homologous elements within other
   groups in the periodic table. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Background - Myeloid differentiation factor (MyD)-88 is a key adaptor
   protein that plays a major role in the innate immune pathway. How MyD88
   may regulate host response in inflammatory heart disease is unknown.
   Methods and Results - We found that the cardiac protein level of MyD88
   was significantly increased in the hearts of wild-type mice after
   exposure to Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). MyD88(-/-) mice showed a dramatic
   higher survival rate (86\%) in contrast to the low survival (35\%) in
   the MyD88(-/-) mice after CVB3 infection (P < 0.0001). Pathological
   examination showed a significant decrease of cardiac and pancreatic
   inflammation in the MyD88(-/-) mice. Viral concentrations in the hearts
   were significantly decreased in the MyD88(-/-) mice. Cardiac mRNA levels
   for interleukin (IL)-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha,
   interferon (IFN)-gamma, and IL-18 were significantly decreased in the
   MyD88(-/-) mice. Similarly, serum levels of T-helper 1 cytokines were
   significantly decreased in the MyD88(-/-) mice. In contrast, cardiac
   protein levels of the activated interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 and
   IFN-beta were significantly increased in the MyD88(-/-) mice but not
   other usual upstream signals to IRF-3. The cardiac expression of
   coxsackie-adenoviral receptor and p56(lck) were also significantly
   decreased.
   Conclusions - MyD88 appears to be a key contributor to cardiac
   inflammation, mediating cytokine production and T-helper-1/2 cytokine
   balance, increasing coxsackie-adenoviral receptor and p56(lck)
   expression and viral titers after CVB3 exposure. Absence of MyD88
   confers host protection possibly through novel direct activation of
   IRF-3 and IFN-beta.}},

Abstract = {{A wide range thermal neutron detector was developed based on the
   Scintillator with Optical Fiber (SOF) detector which has been previously
   used for thermal neutron monitoring during boron neutron capture therapy
   irradiation. With this new detector system we intended to address the
   issues of real-time thermal neutron flux measurement and the
   simultaneous measurement of a wide range of thermal neutron flux in a
   BNCT irradiation field which were difficult to implement with the gold
   wire activation method.
   The dynamic range of linearity of the SOF detector was expanded by using
   a plastic scintillator with a rapid decay time. On the other hand, the
   contribution of gamma rays and fast neutrons in the measured signals
   were compensated from those obtained by a pair of SOF detectors, one
   with a (LiF)-Li-6 neutron converter and the other without. The
   discrimination level for the measured signals was also optimized to
   further reduce the contribution of gamma rays and fast neutrons signals.
   A non-paralyzable system model was applied to correct for the dead-time
   in the detector system.
   A good agreement between the thermal neutron flux measured by the gold
   wire activation method and the paired SOF detector system was observed.
   However, measurements which would normally take a few days to perform
   with the gold wire activation method were obtained in just about 15 min
   using the SOF detector system. We also confirmed the dynamic range of
   linearity for the SOF detector system to be in the order of magnitude of
   10(4). (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Oxidation of guanine or 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine can produce
   spiroiminodihydantoin (Sp) R and S stereoisomers. Both in vitro and in
   vivo experiments have shown that the Sp stereoisomers are highly
   mutagenic, causing G -> C and G -> T transversion mutations. Therefore,
   they are of interest as potential endogenous cancer causing lesions.
   However, their structural properties in DNA duplexes remain to be
   elucidated. We have employed computational methods to study the Sp
   lesions in 11 -mer DNA duplexes with A, C, G, and T partners. Molecular
   dynamics simulations have been carried out to obtain ensembles of
   structures, and the trajectories were employed to analyze the structures
   and compute free energies. The structural and thermodynamic analyses
   reveal that the Sp stereoisomers energetically favor positioning in the
   B-DNA major groove, with minor groove conformers also low energy in some
   cases, depending on the partner base. The R and S stereoisomers adopt
   opposite orientations with respect to the 5' to 3' direction of the
   modified strand. Both syn and anti glycosidic bond conformations are
   energetically feasible, with partner base and stereochemistry
   determining the preference. The lesions adversely impact base stacking
   and Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding interactions in the duplex, and cause
   groove widening. The chemical nature of the partner base determines
   specific hydrogen bonding and stacking properties of the damaged
   duplexes. The structural characteristics may relate to observed
   mutagenic properties of the Sp stereoisomers, including possible
   stereoisomer-dependent differences.}},

Abstract = {{A generic-level phylogenetic analysis of the tribe Torneutini Thomson,
   1860 is presented based on 72 morphological characters for 39 terminal
   taxa of which, 31 are representatives of the Torneutini genera. The
   outgroup includes eight representatives from other tribes. A hypothesis
   of monophyly for supertribe Trachyderoinia Dupont, 1836 (sensu Fragoso,
   Monne and Seabra 1987) is presented for the first time. Torneutini, as
   currently recognized, was shown to be paraphyletic. In order to
   eliminate this condition, Bothriospilina Lane, 1950 is raised herein to
   tribe level. Torneutini, as herein defined, comprises the following
   genera in parenthetic notation: (Macellidiopygus (Psygmatocerus
   (Gigantotrichoderes (Spathopygus + Coccoderus) (Gnathopraxithea +
   Praxithea) (Torneutopsis (Torneucerus + Diploschema) (Torneutes
   (Dragomiris + Dragoneutes) (Thaumasus + Xenambyx)))))). The maintenance
   of Macellidiopygus in Torneutini needs further investigating.
   Bothriospilini Lane, 1950, new status, includes in parenthetic notation:
   ((Ranqueles + Scapanopygus) (Taygayba (Delemodacrys (Bothriospila +
   Timbaraba))) (Gnaphalodes (Knulliana + Chlorida)))). The position of
   Chrotoma is still no certain, and it is tentatively included in
   Bothriospilini. The results indicate that Bothriospilini is closely
   related to Trachyderini, Pyrestini and Basipterini. A phylogenetic
   classification of Trachyderoinia at tribe level, and of Torneutini and
   Bothriospilini at genus level, is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{The initial analysis of the recently sequenced genome of Acanthamoeba
   polyphaga Mimivirus, the largest known double-stranded DNA virus,
   predicted a proteome of size and complexity more akin to small parasitic
   bacteria than to other nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses and
   identified numerous functions never before described in a virus. It has
   been proposed that the Mimivirus lineage could have emerged before the
   individualization of cellular organisms from the three domains of life.
   An exhaustive in silica, analysis of the noncoding moiety of all known
   viral genomes now uncovers the unprecedented perfect conservation of an
   AAAATTGA motif in close to 50\% of the Mimivirus genes. This motif
   preferentially occurs in genes transcribed from the predicted leading
   strand and is associated with functions required early in the viral
   infectious cycle, such as transcription and protein translation. A
   comparison with the known promoter of unicellular eukaryotes, amoebal
   protists in particular, strongly suggests that the AAAATTGA motif is the
   structural equivalent of the TATA box core promoter element. This
   element is specific to the Mimivirus lineage and may correspond to an
   ancestral promoter structure predating the radiation of the eukaryotic
   kingdoms. This unprecedented conservation of core promoter regions is
   another exceptional feature of Mimivirus that again raises the question
   of its evolutionary origin.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the properties of specific non-reflecting birefringent

   concept of a conventional perfect lens realized at epsilon =mu = - 1 (
   where epsilon is the dielectric permittivity and mu is the magnetic
   permeability), the birefringent left-handed slab possesses the property
   of negative refraction either for TE- or TM-polarized waves or for both
   of them simultaneously. This allows selective focusing and a spatial
   separation of the images created at different polarizations. We discuss
   several applications of the birefringent left-handed lenses such as the
   beam splitting and near-field diagnostics at the sub-wavelength scale.}},

Abstract = {{Cycloaddition reactions of cationic \{HC(CHNX)(2)\}Al(R)(+) aluminum
   beta-diketiminate complexes (X = variable substituent) with alkenes and
   alkynes to form bicyclic diimine species,
   \{kappa(3)-N,N,C-HC(CH=NX)(2)(CR2CR2)\}Al(R)(+) and
   \{kappa(3)-N,N,C-HC(CH=NX)(2)(CR=CR)\}Al(R)(+), respectively, were
   studied by density functional theory. Alkenes and alkynes form
   \{HC(CHNMe)(2)\}Al(Me)(substrate)(+) adducts with binding energies
   ranging from 11.4 (ethylene) to 19.4 (2-butyne) kcal/mol. Alkene and
   alkyne coordination is stronger than CH2Cl2 coordination to
   \{HC(CHNMe)(2)\}Al(Me)+ by 0.4 (ethylene) to 8.4 (2-butyne) kcal/mol.
   Alkynes bind more strongly than sterically similar alkenes, and alkyl
   substituents on the alkenes and alkynes enhance binding.
   Electron-withdrawing groups on the diketiminate nitrogens (X) enhance
   alkene and alkyne coordination. These trends reflect the fact that the
   Al-substrate binding is dominated by substrate-to-Al sigma-donation.
   Cycloaddition of \{HC(CHNX)(2)\}Al(Me)(alkene)(+) species proceeds by a
   concerted asynchronous process through an unsymmetrical transition state
   in which the new Al-C bond is almost fully formed, the C=C bond is
   lengthened ca. halfway between the reactant and product distances, the
   Al-N and C-C distances within the diketiminate ring are lengthened but
   the C-N bonds are shortened, and the new C-C distance is long. Alkyl
   substituents on the alkene and electron-withdrawing substituents on the
   diketiminate nitrogens disfavor cycloaddition of
   \{HC(CHNX)(2)\}Al(Me)(alkene)(+). These substituents enhance the
   interaction between the alkene HOMO and the
   \{HC(CHNX)(2)\}Al(Me)(alkene)(+) LUMO+1 (Al 3p(z)), which stabilizes the
   \{HC(CHNX)(2)\}Al(Me)(alkene)(+) species, and decrease the interaction
   between the \{HC(CHNX)(2)\}Al(Me)(+) HOMO and the alkene LUMO, which
   destabilizes the cycloadduct. Cycloaddition of
   \{HC(CHNX)(2)\}Al(Me)(alkyne)(+) species is more exothermic than
   cycloaddition of analogous alkene adducts because the newly formed C-C
   and Al-C bonds in the \{kappa(3)-N,N,C-HC(CH=NX)(2)(CR=CR)\}Al(R)(+)
   alkyne cycloadducts involve sp(2)-hybridized carbons and are stronger
   than those in the alkene cycloadducts, which involve sp(3)-hybridized
   carbons.}},

Abstract = {{The spruce beetle, Dendroctonus rufipennis (Kirby), causes landscape
   level mortality to mature spruce (Picea spp.) throughout western and
   northern North America. As with other bark beetles, this beetle is
   associated with a variety of fungi, whose ecological functions are
   largely unknown. It has been proposed that the relative frequencies of
   specific fungi associated with bark beetles may vary with ecological
   factors such as host species, climate, or beetle population phase. We
   collected approximate to,1000 adult spruce beetles in south-central
   Alaska from 1999 to 2001. We employed a variety of insect collection and
   microbial isolation techniques during year 1 to devise optimal
   conditions. In the latter 2 years, we sampled live adults excavated from
   overwintering galleries, and isolated fungi by dragging beetles across
   malt agar amended with gentamicin. We obtained 10 fungal species. We
   used a multilevel generalized linear mixed model to (a) develop
   estimates of the prevalence of each isolated fungal species in the
   beetle population; (b) explore factors that might explain the
   frequencies of association of specific fungi with adult spruce beetles,
   such as insect population phase or positive or negative associations
   with other fungi, and (c) partition the relative sources of variation in
   beetle-fungal associations between the hierarchical, random effect
   variables (i.e., nested individual insect, collecting vessel, tree, and
   site variables). We implemented this model using three procedures with
   different computational algorithms within the commonly used software
   packages R and SAS, and compared the results. The most prevalent fungus
   was Leptographium abietinum, which was recovered from approximately 80\%
   of beetles. The frequency of association of both L abietinum and a
   Pesotum species varied with insect population phase in 2001. The
   presence of Pesotunt spp. on spruce beetles was negatively associated
   with the presence of L. abietinum. The variance components models
   indicated that there was significant variation among beetle-fungal
   associations within trees and trees within sites. Site was generally the
   smallest source of variation, but estimates were not very precise. We
   demonstrate how these estimates of variation can be used to design
   practical sampling protocols to test other hypotheses. This analysis
   also highlights how attention must be given to understanding
   experimental design and analysis, and how conflicting conclusions can
   emerge from hypothesis testing of ecological factors. Our model can be
   extended as a general analytical approach for future hypothesis testing
   of bark beetle-fungal associations. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Plant expression systems offer a valuable alternative to traditional
   systems for the production of recombinant biopharmaceuticals. A highly
   efficient polyethyleneglycol (PEG)-mediated transient expression system
   for secreted recombinant proteins in plants has been developed. The
   human vascular endothelial growth factor 121 (rhVEGF) has been
   successfully expressed and efficiently secreted into the culture medium
   by transiently transformed moss, protoplasts, In order to obtain
   secretion efficiency data, different expressed signal peptides were
   analysed and time Course Studies were performed with expression
   constructs containing different promoters. The transformation procedure
   was optimised for high level expression (up to 10 mu g/ml) and
   successfully performed even with a transgenic glyco-engineered strain
   lacking plant-specific immunogenic sugar residues in N-glycans. The
   amount of rhVEGF was produced in such quantity that it allowed for the
   analysis of biological activity, silver-staining and Western blotting,
   revealing the correct formation and processing of the homodimer. This
   fast and flexible transient expression system enables feasibility
   studies and construct optimisation to be concluded within it few day,;,
   thus avoiding the time consuming step of having to generate stably
   transformed lines. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The mobility of a water droplet under the influence of the oxidant fluid
   in a channel of a PEM fuel cell is studied computationally. The
   performance of a PEM fuel cell is highly dependent on the oxygen
   transport rate, which in turn is strongly affected by the presence of
   liquid water. Excessive liquid water in the cathode causes cathode
   flooding which is generally known to be the primary reason for low cell
   performance. The exerted forces by the oxidant flow help to remove most
   of the liquid water that is entrapped in the porous electrode, hence
   minimizing electrode flooding. In this study the effects of liquid water
   and surrounding fluid properties on the mobility of the water droplets
   is addressed. The numerical solution is based on solving Navier-Stokes
   equations for Newtonian liquids. The study includes the effect of
   interfacial forces with constant surface tension. The volume-of-fluid
   method is used to keep track of the deformation of free surfaces. A
   comprehensive set of simulations is conducted covering a wide range of
   density ratios, viscosity ratios, Capillary numbers, Ca, and Reynolds
   numbers, Re. Deformation of water droplets and their motion is
   characterized based on the maximum distance between the droplet surface
   and the channel wall. This characteristic length has been used to
   compare systems with different droplet and surrounding fluid properties.
   Among the parameters affecting the mobility of water droplets in a PEM
   fuel cell, the surface tension is found to have the most important
   effect. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   suitable for the grayscale image encryption, and the shuffled image is
   encrypted by the preprocessed signal pixel by pixel. The experimental

Abstract = {{Gains and losses of chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8 are nonrandom chromosomal
   aberrations in uveal melanoma. Monosomy 3 is the most frequent
   abnormality and is associated with poor prognosis. To identify regions
   of allelic loss on the short arm of chromosome 1 and to investigate if
   these alterations contribute to uveal melanoma progression, we performed
   microsatellite analysis of 10 loci in 70 uveal melanomas. A total of 51
   tumors were obtained from patients with clinical follow-up data, 19
   tumors were from recent patients without follow-up. Loss of
   heterozygosity (LOH) of at least 1 marker was more frequent in tumors
   with monosomy 3 (40\%) than in tumors with disomy 3 (10\%). In
   particular, loss of the entire short arm of chromosome 1 was only
   observed in tumors with monosomy 3 (p=0.0001). By comparing the extent
   of 1p LOH in all tumors with monosomy 3, we were able to define a
   smallest region of overlap (SRO) of approximately 55 Mb, which is
   flanked by markers D1S507 and D1S198. On the basis of our data and
   published cytogenetic data,. we propose that 1p31 harbors genes involved
   in the progression of uveal melanoma with monosomy 3. (C) 2005

Abstract = {{We have recently established that highly regioselective Heck arylation
   of electron-rich olefins can be accomplished with aryl halides without
   using any halide scavengers in imidazolium ionic liquid solvents. The
   results presented in this paper show that the benchmark electron-rich
   olefins vinyl ethers can be readily arylated by aryl bromides in a
   molecular solvent-ionic liquid cocktail with no compromise on
   regioselectivity. By introducing a small amount of
   1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ({[}bmim]{[}BF4]) to DMSO,
   the arylation reactions of the vinyl ethers 1a-d by the bromides 2a-j
   took place to afford essentially only the alpha arylated products. The
   enamide 1e underwent similar regioselective arylation in the solvent
   cocktail. In the absence of the ionic liquid, lower regioselectivities
   were observed. In comparison with the chemistry we have reported so far,
   the current method reduces considerably the reliance on the volume of
   ionic liquids used, providing a simpler and more practical synthetic
   pathway for preparing arylated vinyl ethers and aryl methyl ketones. (c)

Abstract = {{The present study investigates the interaction of the second generation
   photosensitizer Foscan (R) with plasma albumin and lipoproteins.
   Spectroscopic studies indicated the presence of monomeric and aggregated
   Foscan (c) species upon addition to plasma protein solutions. Kinetics
   of Foscan (R) disaggregation in albumin-enriched solutions were very
   sensitive to the protein concentration and incubation temperature.
   Kinetic analysis demonstrated that two types of Foscan (R) aggregated
   species could be involved in disaggregation: dimers with a rate constant
   of k(1) =(2.30 +/- 0.15) x 10(-3) s(-1) and higher aggregates with rate
   constants varying from (0.55 +/- 0.04) x 10(-3) s(-1) for the lowest to
   the (0.17 +/- 0.02) x 10(-3) s(-1) for the highest albumin
   concentration. Disaggregation considerably increased with the
   temperature rise from 15 degrees C to 37 degrees C. Compared to albumin,
   Foscan (R) disaggregation kinetics in the presence of lipoproteins
   displayed poorer dependency on lipoprotein concentrations and smaller
   variations in disaggregation rate constants. Gel-filtration
   chromatography analysis of Foscan (R) in albumin solutions demonstrated
   the presence of aggregated fraction of free, non-bound to protein Foscan
   (R) and monomeric Foscan (R), bound to protein. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
