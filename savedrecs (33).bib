Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this study was to identify the most
   cost-effective statin or combination of statins, from the perspective of
   a managed care payer.
   Methods: A decision-analytic model compared the cost-effectiveness of
   titration to goal with atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin,
   pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin in patients with elevated
   low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Effectiveness measures
   included the percentage change from baseline LDL-C and high-density
   lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and the percentage of patients
   achieving National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Second Adult
   Treatment Panel (ATP II) LDL-C goals. Direct medical costs were
   calculated based on drug, physician, and laboratory resource use,
   multiplied by wholesale acquisition costs for drugs and the 2005
   Medicare reimbursement rates for services. A Monte Carlo simulation
   tested the sensitivity of results to model efficacy inputs.
   Results: In the base-case analysis, rosuvastatin dominated atorvastatin,
   pravastatin, and simvastatin. Generic lovastatin dominated fluvastatin.
   The incremental (absolute) reduction in LDL-C, increase in HDL-C, and
   increase in patients to goal with rosuvastatin compared with lovastatin
   were 16\%, 3\%, and 27\%, respectively. Incremental costs per additional
   1\% reduction in LDL-C, 1\% increase in HDL-C, and patient to goal with
   rosuvastatin versus lovastatin were \$8, \$41, and \$436, respectively.
   A wide variety of assumptions were assessed and Monte Carlo sensitivity
   analyses were conducted. Findings were most sensitive to the cost of
   lovastatin.
   Conclusion: Rosuvastatin dominates atorvastatin, pravastatin, and
   simvastatin because it is more effective and less costly, and it may be
   considered cost-effective compared with generic lovastatin. The most
   cost-effective two-statin formulary contained lovastatin and
   rosuvastatin.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of extended
   suprathreshold vibratory stimulation on the sensitivity of slowly
   adapting type 1 (SA1), rapidly adapting ( RA), and Pacinian (PC)
   afferents. To that end, an algorithm was developed to track afferent
   absolute (I-0) and entrainment (I-1) thresholds as they change over
   time. We recorded afferent responses to periliminal vibratory test
   stimuli, which were interleaved with intense vibratory conditioning
   stimuli during the adaptation period of each experimental run. From
   these measurements, the algorithm allowed us to infer changes in the
   afferents' sensitivity. We investigated the stimulus parameters that
   affect adaptation by assessing the degree to which adaptation depends on
   the amplitude and frequency of the adapting stimulus. For all three
   afferent types, I-0 and I-1 increased with increasing adaptation
   frequency and amplitude. The degree of adaptation seems to be
   independent of the firing rate evoked in the afferent by the
   conditioning stimulus. In the analysis, we distinguished between
   additive adaptation ( in which I-0 and I-1 shift equally) and
   multiplicative effects ( in which the ratio I-1/I-0 remains constant).
   RA threshold shifts are almost perfectly additive. SA1 threshold shifts
   are close to additive and far from multiplicative (I-1 threshold shifts
   are twice the I-0 shifts). PC shifts are more difficult to classify. We
   used an integrate-and-fire model to study the possible neural
   mechanisms. A change in transducer gain predicts a multiplicative change
   in I-0 and I-1 and is thus ruled out as a mechanism underlying SA1 and
   RA adaptation. A change in the resting action potential threshold
   predicts equal, additive change in I-0 and I-1 and thus accounts well
   for RA adaptation. A change in the degree of refractoriness during the
   relative refractory period predicts an additional change in I-1 such as
   that observed for SA1 fibers. We infer that adaptation is caused by an
   increase in spiking thresholds produced by ion flow through transducer
   channels in the receptor membrane. In a companion paper, we describe the
   time-course of vibratory adaptation and recovery for SA1, RA, and PC
   fibers.}},

Abstract = {{In cooperative breeders, between-group dispersal of helpers is expected
   to occur if it increases their fitness. Genetic data suggest that
   helpers in the cooperatively breeding Lake Tanganyika cichlid
   Ncolamprologus pulcher occasionally migrate into nearby groups where
   they again become helpers. We studied in the field how and why helpers
   migrate between groups by recording their ranging and social behaviours.
   We found that helpers spent 5.3\% of their time visiting other groups,
   where they received similar low levels of aggression as within their
   home group. Large helpers visited other groups more often than small
   helpers and helpers visited other groups more frequently when the queue
   in their home group was large, suggesting that helpers with low chances
   to inherit the territory search for alternatives. Our data show that
   helpers may use other groups' territories as a refuge, as helpers
   actively Sought shelter within territories of neighbouring groups when
   we experimentally increased the perceived risk of staying in their home
   territory. We observed two attempted and one successful case of
   `voluntary' (i.e., strategic) between-group dispersal, and
   experimentally induced three helpers to disperse into other groups. By
   regular visits, helpers appear to establish familiarity and social
   relationships with nearby groups, which serve as `extended safe havens'
   to hide from predators. In the long run frequent visiting behaviour may
   facilitate between group dispersal.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{There is a current tendency in the European Union member countries to
   cut down on meat consumption. This tendency is not due as much to the
   traditional income-price factor, but to other attributes whose influence
   is gaining relative importance. Some of them are: quality, image,
   health, food safety and changes in people's taste. In addition, the
   relative importance of different attributes valued by the consumer must
   be weighed in order to develop marketing strategies which increase lamb
   meat consumption. In order to determine these preferences, 400 consumers
   were asked to evaluate different attributes (price, certification,
   origin, and commercial type) of lamb meat. Results obtained by means of
   conjoint analysis techniques show that regular consumers as well as
   occasional ones show a preference for lamb meat type. In this sense, a
   market share simulation of preferred (suckling and ``ternasco{''}) types
   proved that regular consumers generally prefer suckling lamb to
   ``ternasco{''} lamb when both are from Castilla-La Mancha. (C) 2005

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Language barriers are significant impediments to providing
   quality healthcare, and increased stress levels among nurses and
   physicians are associated with these barriers. However little evidence
   supports the usefulness of a translation tool specific to healthcare.
   OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effectiveness of a novel English-Spanish
   translator designed specifically for nurses and physicians. The
   hypothesis was that the translator would be useful and that use of the
   translator would decrease stress levels among nurses and physicians
   caring for Spanish-speaking patients.
   METHODS Novel English-Spanish translators were developed entirely on the
   basis of input from critical care nurses and physicians. After 7 months
   of use, users completed surveys. Usefulness of the translator and stress
   levels among users were reported.
   RESULTS A total of 60\% of nurses (n = 32) and 71\% (h = 25) of
   physicians responded to the survey. A total of 96\% of Physicians and
   97\% of nurses considered the language barrier an impediment to
   delivering quality care. Nurses reported significantly more stress
   reduction than did physicians (P =. 01). Most nurses and physicians had
   used the translator during the survey period. Overall, 91\% of nurses
   and 72\% of physicians,found that the translator met their needs at the
   bedside some, most, or all of the time. All nurses thought that they
   most likely would use the translator in the future.
   CONCLUSIONS The translator was useful for most critical care nurses and
   physicians surveyed. Healthcare providers, especially nurses,
   experienced decreased stress levels when they used the translator.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the biochemical properties of a 51.5 kDa metalloprotease
   (arazyme, 3.4.24.40) secreted into the culture medium by Aranicola
   proteolyticus, a symbiotic bacterium of the spider Nephila clavata. The
   enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity by ion exchange
   chromatography in a Resource Q column (FPLC system). The substrate
   specificity requirements of purified arazyme were examined using
   fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) peptides derived from the
   lead sequence Abz-KLRFSKQ-EDDnp (Abz = ortho-aminobenzoic acid;
   EDDnp=ethylenediaminedinitrophenyl). Three series of peptides were
   assayed to map the S-2, S-1 and S'(1) subsites: Abz-KXRFSKQ-EDDnp,
   Abz-KLXFSKQ-EDDnp and Abz-KLRXSKQ-EDDnp (X are natural amino acids). The
   results indicated that S-1 subsite has a broad specificity, being Gly
   the preferred amino acid for this subsite followed by positively charged
   residues (Arg and His). The S-2 and S'(1) subsites accommodated better
   hydrophobic residues with aliphatic or aromatic side chains (Leu, Phe).
   The pH effect on hydrolysis of Abz-KLFFSKQ-EDDnp indicated that optimal
   hydrolysis occurred at pH 8.0 or higher. The effect of NaCl on the
   arazyme activity depends on the substrate, but in general the activity
   was reduced with this salt. The temperature did not affect the enzyme
   from 10 to 45 degrees C, after which activity decreased sharply. Arazyme
   presented high hydrolytic activity on substance P and peptides related
   to bradykinin. In addition, arazyme activity was resistant to the
   treatment by pepsin, trypsin and chymotrypsin. In conclusion, arazyme
   has a broad hydrolytic profile and works in very aggressive conditions,
   which justify its potential use in therapeutics and biotechnological
   applications. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Buried circular collapse structures above a tabular evaporitic body are
   recorded by recently acquired 3D seismic data on the Levant Basin and
   continental margin, offshore Israel (Eastern Mediterranean). The
   structures formed during the Pliocene as buried Messinian (late Miocene)
   evaporites underwent extensive dissolution in a submarine, deep-water
   setting. Three-dimensional seismic analysis is used to describe the
   detailed morphology of the structures and the associated overburden,
   allowing the reconstruction of their origin and development. It is
   proposed that evaporite dissolution led to the collapse of the weakly
   lithified overburden, and this deformed with a series of concentric
   extensional faults. From the structural analysis of the overburden, the
   estimated maximum duration of the dissolution event is 0.75-1 Ma. The
   mechanism proposed for the creation of the circular collapse structures
   is subjacent dissolution of the more soluble evaporites in the Messinian
   evaporites, as a result of focused vertical fluid flow at the base of
   the evaporitic series. Rapid release of overpressured fluids, as, for
   example, during an earthquake, is thought to have initiated the focused
   fluid flow, which impinged on the evaporitic seal to the point where
   dissolution occurred, creating the localized circular collapse
   structures in the overburden.}},

Abstract = {{The sharpshooter Homalodisca coagulata Say (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) is
   a polyphagous insect that feeds primarily from the xylem vessels of host
   plants. This insect is an efficient vector of the xylem-limited,

   agent of several important diseases in ornamental and agricultural
   crops. In wild populations, H. coagulata have been observed to almost
   exclusively orient with their anterior facing toward the roots (AFR),
   regardless of branch position. The orientation of H. coagulata seemed to
   be chosen before stylet insertion. Neither masking plant chemical and
   morphological surface cues nor placing test plants in the absence of
   light affected body posture. The introduction of 1.5-V direct current
   electricity to the plants resulted in altered body positioning. Removal
   of both front tarsi influenced body position; however, removal of only
   the right or left front tarsi had no effect on H. coagulata body
   position. Removal or masking of right, left, or both antennae resulted
   in altered body position.}},

Abstract = {{Ultra-wideband is an emerging standard for short-range high data-rate
   wireless communication. In a production test environment, ultra-wideband
   devices are tested for bit error rate (BER) in the presence of an
   external interferer. As the target BER values are small at low
   interference levels, it requires a long test sequence for measuring BER,
   incurring a long test time. This paper describes a novel production test
   technique for BER testing of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing
   transceivers. By adjusting the phase values of the baseband signal , the
   proposed manufacturing test methodology reduces the overall test time
   considerably (up to 20 x), while keeping the error vector magnitude and
   peak-to-average ratio of the transmitted signal unchanged. This method
   can be extended to any phase modulation scheme to reduce the test time
   for BER.}},

   examination of the brain revealed malignant lymphomatous cell
   infiltration of both cranial nerve III, diffuse leptomeningeal disease

   assayed for their ability to neutralize digestive and hemostatic effects
   of venom from three rattlesnake species. In Douglas ground squirrels (S.

   general proteolysis were not different. Douglas ground squirrels also
   reduced the metalloprotease activity of venom from sympatric northern
   Pacific rattlesnakes (Crotalus oreganus oreganus) more than the activity
   of venom from allopatric western diamondback rattlesnakes (C. atrox),
   but enhanced fibrinolysis of sympatric venom almost 1.8 times above
   baseline levels. Two Beechey ground squirrel (S. b. beecheyi)
   populations had similar inhibition of venoms from northern and southern
   Pacific rattlesnakes (C. o. helleri), despite differences between the
   populations in the locally prevalent predator. However, the venom toxins
   inhibited by Beechey squirrels did vary among venom from Pacific
   rattlesnake subspecies, and between these venoms and venom from
   allopatric western diamondback rattlesnakes. Blood plasma from Beechey
   squirrels showed highest inhibition of metalloprotease activity of
   northern Pacific rattlesnake venom, general proteolytic activity and
   hemolysis of southern Pacific rattlesnake venom, and hemolysis by
   allopatric western diamondback venom. These results reveal previously
   cryptic variation in venom activity against resistant prey that suggests
   reciprocal adaptation at the molecular level.}},

Abstract = {{On ITER, the LH system aims at supplying 20 MW CW for controlling the
   q-profiles in partially and fully non-inductive steady-state operation
   (9 MA). The designed LH system relies on a transmitter made of 24 5 GHz
   I MW klystrons linked to one antenna based on the passive active
   multijunction (PAM) concept, via a 60 m long oversized circular
   transmission line. Through a common European effort including several
   associations (CEA, ENEA, UKAEA, IST, TEKES and IPP-CZ) many outstanding
   problems have been solved: coupling has been achieved on JET in a
   physics scenario similar to ITER, a PAM has been tested with success on
   the FTU plasma. The reliability of LH for long pulse operation has been
   ascertained on Tore Supra. In order to routinely realise long pulse
   operation (1000 s), the Tore Supra LH system is being refurbished within
   the CIMES project framework where the transmitter is to be equipped with
   16 klystrons 700 kW 1000 s at a frequency of 3.7 GHz. A new LH launcher
   based upon the PAM concept has been studied, designed and is actually
   under realisation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Patients with hemochromatosis are instructed to avoid taking
   supplemental iron. Whether supplemental iron intakes lead to higher iron
   status among healthy persons remains less clear.
   Objective: The objective was to ascertain whether supplemental iron
   intakes are associated with increases in iron transport (transferrin
   saturation) and stores (serum ferritin) among US adults aged >= 19 y.
   Design: We analyzed data for 5948 adults from whom a fasting serum
   sample was collected during the third National Health and Nutrition
   Examination Survey. We used multivariable linear regression and analysis
   of variance to assess the association of supplemental iron intake with
   iron transport and stores among men (aged 19-30 y or > 30 y) and women
   (nonpregnant premenopausal or postmenopausal); multiple comparison tests
   were also performed.
   Results: Healthy adults who took supplements containing average daily
   amounts of iron at :5 3 times the recommended dietary allowance (RDA)
   did not have significantly higher iron transport or stores than did
   those who did not take supplements. In younger men, the intake of > 32
   mg Fe/d (> 4x RDA) was associated with mean transport iron
   concentrations that were significantly higher than those in persons who
   took 0 to <= 24 mg Fe/d. In older men, the intake of > 32 mg Fe/d (> 4x
   RDA) was associated with mean iron stores that were significantly higher
   than those in persons who took 0 to <= 24 mg Fe/d; a similar result was
   observed in postmenopausal women, but it was of borderline statistical
   significance.
   Conclusion: Supplement users should be made aware of the amount of iron
   necessary to satisfy dietary requirements and informed of the possible
   influence that excess iron intake can have on body iron stores and
   health.}},

   based on prior primary care specialty investigations. Multivariate
   regression evaluated the impact of various factors on resident
   satisfaction.
   Results: Seventy-seven percent (44 of 57) and 100\% (35 of 35) of
   faculty and residents, respectively, completed the survey. Relevant
   training, collegiality, adequate resources, workload, care continuity,
   supportive coworkers, learning environment, autonomy, role ambiguity,
   and Supportive Faculty were significantly associated with resident
   satisfaction. Care continuity role ambiguity, and learning environment
   were the areas of largest faculty/resident disagreement.
   Conclusion: Relevant training and collegiality were most strongly linked
   to resident satisfaction. Three areas of dissatisfaction were
   identified, and we will seek to remedy these areas. (C) 2005 Mosby, Inc.

Abstract = {{Background Well known risk factors for upper extremity deep venous
   thrombosis are the presence of a central Venous catheter (CVC) and
   malignancy, but other potential risk factors, such as Surgery, injury
   and hormone replacement therapy (HRT), have not yet been explored.
   Methods: We performed a population-based case-control Study including
   179 consecutive patients, aged 18-70 years with upper extremity deep
   venous thrombosis and 2399 control Subjects. Participants reported oil
   acquired risk factors in I questionnaire and factor V Leiden and
   prothrombin 20210A Mutation were ascertained. Information on CVC was
   obtained from discharge letters. Results: Forty-two patients (23\%) and
   one control subject (0.04\%) had a CVC (ORadj: 1136, 95\% CI: 153-8448,
   adjusted for age and sex). Cancer patients Without a CVC had all
   eightfold increased risk of venous thrombosis of the arm (ORcrude: 7.7,
   95\%, CI: 4.6-13.0). Other evident risk factors were prothrombotic
   Mutations, Surgery, immobilization of the arm (plaster cast), oral
   contraceptive use and family history, with odds ratios varying from 2.0
   up to 13.1. The risk ill the presence of injury and during puerperium
   was two fold or more increased, although not significantly. In contrast
   HRT, unusual exercise travel and obesity did not increase the risk.
   Hormone users ha an increased risk in the presence of prothrornbotic
   mutations or Surgery. Obese persons (BMI > 30 kg m(-2)) undergoing
   surgery had a 23-fold increased risk of arm thrombosis compared with
   non-obese persons not undergoing Surgery. Conclusion: A CVC is a very
   strong risk factor for arm thrombosis. Most risk factors For thrombosis
   in the leg are also risk factors for arm thrombosis.}},

Abstract = {{Transmission line- type electromagnetic ( EM) methods for estimating
   soil volumetric water content (theta(v)) have advanced significantly in
   recent years, with many sensing systems now available. To estimate
   theta(v), EM systems make use of the dependence of soil dielectric
   permittivity on theta(v). However, a standard method for characterizing
   and comparing EM system measurement capability has not been established.
   Our objective was to evaluate the permittivity measurement ability of
   seven EM sensing systems using readily available media. Sensing system
   outputs were converted to real permittivity (epsilon') values and
   compared with reference epsilon' values in lossless and lossy dielectric
   liquids under four different test conditions: nonrelaxing and
   nonconducting ( NR- NC), relaxing and nonconducting ( R- NC),
   nonrelaxing and electrically, conducting ( NR- C), and temperature
   variation in NR- NC. The higher frequency broadband sensing systems,
   consisting of two time domain reflectometry ( TDR) systems and one time
   domain transmissometry ( TDT) system, deviated from a network analyzer
   by less than +/- 2.94 epsilon' units across a epsilon' range of 12.7 to
   78.5 in NR- NC media. Two lower frequency impedance sensing systems
   deviated from the network analyzer by less than +/- 3.94 epsilon' units
   across a epsilon' range of 12.7 to 36.5 in the same media. Measurement
   of epsilon' using higher frequency broadband sensing systems was
   impacted more by bulk electrical conductivity (sigma b) and temperature
   ( T) than by dielectric relaxation. Imaginary permittivity values ( due
   only to relaxation, epsilon{''}(rel)) of up to 14.5 in R- NC media
   resulted in epsilon' errors of +/- 0.511, whereas sigma(b) values
   ranging from 0 to 2 dS m(-1) in NR- C media resulted in epsilon' errors
   of +/- 2.69 and T values ranging from 5 to 40 degrees C resulted in
   epsilon' errors of +/- 4.89. Determination of epsilon' using lower
   frequency sensing systems - including one transmission line oscillator,
   two impedance probes, and one capacitance probe - was impacted more by
   sigma(b) than by T and epsilon{''}(rel). For the lower frequency sensors
   ( and the same ranges of sigma(b), T, and epsilon(rel)), sigma(b)
   resulted in epsilon' errors of +/- 111, T resulted in epsilon' errors of
   +/- 6.59, and e{''}(rel) resulted in epsilon' errors of +/- 3.28. The
   effects of epsilon{''}(rel), sigma(b), and T on permittivity measurement
   accuracy is to a large extent dependent on measurement frequency, with
   higher frequency broadband sensing systems generally yielding better
   measurements.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with contrasting the impact of globalization
   pressures on industrial development in particular localities, with
   specific reference to the relative performance of regional clusters. A
   multiple case Study approach is adopted in order to examine the decline
   of volume yacht manufacturing in a long-established English cluster and
   to compare its responses to globalization with those of major
   competitors located in other parts of Europe. The case study opens with
   an analysis of three sector-specific drivers of globalization that have
   exercised a decisive impact on the sector over the last three decades.
   In the main analytical section, two alternative approaches to the
   analysis Of Clusters (Porter 1990, 2000, Best 200 1) are applied to the
   empirical material. The application of Porter's `diamond' framework
   suggests some distinctive performance-related characteristics, while
   Best's `cluster dynamics' model provides a more sophisticated
   explanation of the differential responses and outcomes identified in the
   English case. The implications for policy are that cluster-level
   outcomes may be predicated on the internal dynamics of their respective
   `entrepreneurial firms', and that regional 0 development initiatives
   would benefit from conceptual and empirical studies that can better
   address the historical and spatial complexity of the underlying
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{The molecular characterization of balanced chromosomal rearrangements
   has often been a powerful toot for the positional identification of
   genes associated with specific diseases. In some instances, these
   rearrangements may be associated with a variety of different phenotypes,
   and thus establishing a genotype-phenotype correlation may be a complex
   process. However, molecular characterization of the rearrangement
   remains a useful tool for diagnoses or prognoses, or for identifying new
   genes and establishing a gene-to-function relationship. In this work we
   describe the characterization of a de novo balanced translocation
   t(2;6)(q24.3;q22.31) found in a patient with a complex phenotype. The
   major clinical finding was a severe neurological involvement. Thanks to
   the molecular characterization of this translocation we found that the
   rearrangement led to the truncation of the TCBA1 gene on chromosome 6q.
   We found that the gene is transcribed in different splice variants and
   is highly specific for the central nervous system. TCBA1 does not show
   any similarity with other known genes, and no information is available
   about its function. However, the gene appears to be well conserved among
   species, and we were able to infer the sequence of a putative mouse
   homolog of TCBA1. This allowed us to perform a more detailed expression
   study in mice, thus confirming its specificity for the nervous system.
   This finding is of particular interest because it suggests that TCBA1
   may be correlated with the neurological phenotype of our patient, and
   possibly mutated in genetic diseases with a neurological phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Previous research shows that marriage leads to reductions in
   alcohol use, especially for women. Because marriage prior to age 20
   (early marriage) is a marker for deviance, the protective effects of
   marriage may not extend to those who marry in adolescence. We compared
   the effects of marriage in adolescence versus young adulthood on alcohol
   consumption, negative alcohol-related consequences and heavy episodic
   drinking at age 29. Method: We analyzed data from 1,138 women in a
   longitudinal cohort followed from ages 18 to 29. The original sample was
   recruited from 30 California and Oregon middle schools and first
   surveyed at age 13. Results: Women who had not married, had married
   early or had married between ages 20 and 29 did not differ on alcohol
   use at age 18. Women who married as young adults were less likely than
   singles to engage in any alcohol use, heavy episodic drinking or
   experience negative consequences and reported less alcohol use at age
   29. Women who married in adolescence reported fewer negative
   consequences at age 29 than did singles and (if they had not divorced)
   were less likely to engage in heavy episodic drinking or experience any
   negative consequences, reported fewer consequences and consumed less
   alcohol. The protective effects of marriage in young adulthood were
   observed whether or not women divorced. Parenthood and college
   attendance before age 23 did not explain the marriage effect.
   Conclusions: Results support role theory, which posits that individuals
   who marry are socialized into conventional adult roles that discourage
   deviant behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Approximations of thermometric characteristics of germanium film
   temperature microsensors are presented using a mathematical approach
   based on their expansion with orthonormal polynomials. A weighted
   orthonormal polynomial expansion method (OPEM) is applied, involving the
   experimental errors of calibration test data at every point. The
   thermometric functions R(T) and T(R) of resistance and temperature are
   described in the whole temperature range (1.7-300 K) and in three
   subintervals (1.7-20, 20-150, and 150-300 K). The absolute, relative,
   and specific sensitivities of the sensor, as well as the main
   approximation characteristics, are discussed. The OPEM is extended to
   obtain a mathematical description of R(T) and T(R) functions by usual
   polynomial coefficients calculated by orthonormal ones. A comparison
   between maximal relative deviations of R(T) and T(R) three-interval
   approximations, correspondingly, by usual and orthonormal polynomials,
   is presented. Numerical results of the approximation parameters of these
   type of temperature sensors are shown in the figures and tables. (c)

Abstract = {{Based on the weakest-link concept a method is developed., from which the
   endurance probability of every surface and volume element of a
   case-hardened part, which is loaded near the endurance limit, can be
   calculated. A prerequisite for the calculation is knowledge of the
   hardness and residual stress distribution, the surface roughness and the
   surface oxidation depth. By multiplication of the endurance
   probabilities of neighboured elements the endurance probability of a
   limited region or of the whole part can be calculated, which includes an
   endurance limit determination. It is shown, that this model can be
   applied successfully to specimens of a carburized steel. The necessary
   model parameters can be gained from a set of reference specimens.
   Because of the possibility to formulate an endurance probability for
   every volume and surface element, there are no geometrical restrictions
   on the parts to be assessed.}},

Abstract = {{We obtained high resolution ELODIE and CORALIE spectra for both
   components of 20 wide visual binaries composed of an F-, G- or K-dwarf
   primary and an M-dwarf secondary. We analyse the well-understood spectra
   of the primaries to determine metallicities ({[}Fe/H]) for these 20
   systems, and hence for their M dwarf components. We pool these
   metallicities with determinations from the literature to obtain a
   precise ( +/- 0.2 dex) photometric calibration of M dwarf metallicities.
   This calibration represents a breakthrough in a field where discussions
   have had to remain largely qualitative, and it helps us demonstrate that
   metallicity explains most of the large dispersion in the empirical
   V-band massluminosity relation. We examine the metallicity of the two
   known M-\textbackslash{}dwarf planet-host stars, Gl 876 (+ 0.02 dex) and
   Gl 436 (- 0.03 dex), in the context of preferential planet formation
   around metal- rich stars. We finally determine the metallicity of the 47

Abstract = {{Although the relationships between trophic conditions and viral dynamics
   have been widely explored in different pelagic environments, there have
   been few attempts at independent estimates of both viral production and
   decay. In this study, we investigated factors controlling the balance
   between viral production and decay along a trophic gradient in the north
   Adriatic basin, providing independent estimates of these variables and
   determining the relative importance of nanoflagellate grazing and viral
   life strategies. Increasing trophic conditions induced an increase of
   bacterioplankton growth rates and of the burst sizes. As a result,
   eutrophic waters displayed highest rates of viral production, which
   considerably exceeded observed rates of viral decay (up to 2.9 X 10(9)
   VLP liter(-1) h(-1)). Viral decay was also higher in eutrophic waters,
   where it accounted for ca. 40\% of viral production, and dropped
   significantly to 1.3 to 10.7\% in oligotrophic waters. These results
   suggest that viral production and decay rates may not necessarily be
   balanced in the short term, resulting in a net increase of viruses in
   the system. In eutrophic waters nanoflagellate grazing,
   dissolved-colloidal substances, and lysogenic infection were responsible
   together for the removal of ca. 66\% of viral production versus 17\% in
   oligotrophic waters. Our results suggest that different causative agents
   are primarily responsible for the removal of viruses from the water
   column in different trophic conditions. Factors other than those
   considered in the past might shed light on processes responsible for the
   removal and/or decay of viral particles from the water column.}},

Abstract = {{Terpenoids are important compounds for the fragrance industry, and
   recently, biocatalytic methods have been developed to produce them from
   cheap monoterpenes, such as alpha-pinene oxide. The biotransformation of
   alpha-pinene oxide using resting cells of Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB
   11671 produces isonovalal (cis-2-methyl-5-isopropylhexa-2,5-dienal),
   which is a fragrance. However, this biotransformation has technical
   problems including the following: alpha-pinene oxide undergoes
   autoxidation in water and light; it is hydrophobic and relatively toxic
   to the biocatalyst; and it suffers from product inhibition. Therefore,
   removal of isonovalal as it is formed should reduce its toxicity and
   increase volumetric productivity and production yield. Aqueous-organic
   two-phase (AOTP) systems can be used in the biotransformation of
   hydrophobic substrates and can protect biocatalysts from toxic
   substrates and products. However, the formation of stable emulsions
   makes further downstream processing and continuous operation difficult.
   One solution to these problems is to use a solid-phase membrane between
   the aqueous and organic phases in a Membrane Bioreactor for
   Biotransformation (MBB). Since there are no data in the literature on
   the behavior of terpenes and terpenoids with solid-phase membranes, or
   their mass transfer behavior, the objective of this work was to measure
   these parameters for a wide range of compounds so as to be able to
   design an MBB, and to gain a greater understanding of their behavior in
   these types of systems. Organic/aqueous (P-aq(org)) and membrane/aqueous
   (P-aq(mem)) partition coefficients were measured first, and subsequently
   used to quantify the overall mass transfer coefficients (k(ov)). The
   overall mass transfer coefficient (k(ov)) of alpha-pinene oxide through
   the membrane was found to be 2.5 x 10(-5) m(.)s(-1) using thicknesses of
   both 250 and 1000 mu m. Extraction kinetics were successfully described
   using a resistance-in-series model and were controlled by the aqueous
   boundary layer and/or membrane resistance (k(mem)), while organic film
   resistance played an insignificant role. Aqueous film resistance (k(aq))
   was found to be the limiting step for mono- and diterpenes, and the
   effect of the hydrodynamics on k(ov) was successfully predicted using a
   Wilson plot. However, the extraction kinetics of larger terpenes, such
   as steroids, were influenced solely by the kmem, suggesting that
   membrane diffusivity also depended on the size of the permeating
   molecule. Finally, the influence of other terpene byproducts on the flux
   of alpha-pinene oxide was investigated and found to decrease the flux
   into the organic phase by up to 10\%.}},

   numerical simulation was carried out by solving the complete
   two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and averaged Reynolds equations
   using the q-omega turbulence model. The laminar boundary layer became
   turbulent inside the separation zone induced by the shock. It is shown
   that the plate bluntness significantly reduces the heat exchange
   intensity in the interference zone, this effect intensifying with
   increase in the Mach number.}},

Abstract = {{The goeochemistry of ore-forming fluids from typical tin-bearing
   ore-magmatic systems of Sikhote Alin has been studied. Fluid inclusions
   and stable isotopes (O, H, and S) were analyzed in minerals of different
   megastages at the Arsen'evsk, Vysokogorsk, and Solnechnoe deposits,
   which formed in different geodynamic settings. Tin deposits of the
   Sikhote Alin accretionary fold system are related to continental
   paleomargins, where superposition of subduction and transform settings
   led to the spatial juxtaposition of magmatism and ores of different
   types and age. Two megastages of mineral formation, molybdenum and tin,
   were distinguished at the deposits studied. Fluid inclusions in quartz
   and fluorite of different generations; in tourmaline and apatite of the
   molybdenum megastage; and in quartz, cassiterite, and calcite of the tin
   megastage, are described in detail. The homogenization temperatures,
   composition, and salinity of solutions and the gas phase of fluid
   inclusions were determined by microthermometry, Raman spectroscopy, and
   gas chromatography. It was established that molybdenum mineralization
   formed at 540-160 degrees C from essentially aqueous Mg/Ca/Na(K)
   chloride fluids in the presence of CH4, N-2, CO, and CO2. At
   temperatures more than 480 degrees C, minerals formed from a
   heterogeneous system consisting of high-density (65-50 wt \% NaCl
   equiv.) aqueous-salt and gas fluids; at lower temperatures, minerals
   formed from homogeneous fluids with a salinity from 40 to 5 wt \% NaCl
   equiv. Mineral assemblages of the tin megastage precipitated at 390-180
   degrees C mainly from aqueous Na chloride fluids with a salinity of
   16-0.7 wt \% NaCl equiv. and variable amounts of CO2, CH4, N-2, CO, and
   H2S in a pulsation regime. A gas fluid with subordinate
   Mg-Ca-Na-chloride brines similar to those of the molybdenum megastage
   participated in the mineral formation. Stable isotope compositions (O,
   H, and S) were studied in minerals of different megastages from the
   Arsen'evsk, Vysokogorsk, and Solnechnoe deposits. It was shown that
   fluids of the molybdenum megastage were magmatic in origin since
   calculated delta O-18 and delta D of fluid water vary from +6.8 to +10.1
   parts per thousand and from -102 to -46.4 parts per thousand,
   respectively, and delta S-34-H2S vary from -1.3 to +1.5 parts per
   thousand. Most values of delta O-18(H2O) obtained for the tin stage of
   the Solnechnoe, Vysoko-orsk, and Arsen'evsk deposits occur in the field
   of magmatic waters (delta O-18 from +3 to +9.5 parts per thousand).
   However, light oxygen isotope signatures in some samples (delta O-18
   from -1.3 to +1.5 parts per thousand) suggest involvement of heated
   meteoric waters. Sulfur isotope values of H2S in the mineral-forming
   fluid fall into two intervals: from -3.7 to +1.5 parts per thousand
   (magmatic sulfur) and from +43 to +8.2 parts per thousand (sulfate S).
   Our investigations showed the following: (1) ore-forming fluids related
   to different settings (trans-, form margin and suprasubduction zone)
   differ in composition, physicochemical parameters, and sources and (2)
   the studied deposits formed from fluids of different composition,
   properties, and origin.}},

Abstract = {{Strategies promoting initiation and successful continuation of
   breastfeeding are important in facilitating the breastfeeding
   experience. However, unique difficulties with breastfeeding may occur
   that necessitate specific interventions, to prevent early weaning and
   promote satisfaction with the breastfeeding experience. Special devices
   have been recommended and used to help women overcome various
   breastfeeding problems. A supplemental feeding tube device (SFTD) is a
   device that permits supplemental nourishment for infants while still
   preserving the breastfeeding goals of the mother. The purpose of this
   naturalistic study was to describe the experiences of breastfeeding
   mothers who used SFTDs to establish, reestablish, or supplement infant
   feeding at the breast. From the findings, 3 groups of themes emerged:
   seeking a solution, managing the challenges, and forming opinions. The
   underlying theme identified by all of the participants in the study was
   ``finding an alternative.{''} Wornen found the SFTD to be an acceptable
   alternative that facilitated their breastfeeding experience.}},

Abstract = {{The thymus plays a pivotal role in the development of the adaptive
   immune system, an important factor that separates higher vertebrates
   from the rest of the animal phyla. The development of functional T-cells
   from thymocytes is a crucial step in the development of a functional
   vertebrate immune system and whilst recent advances in molecular and
   developmental biology have advanced our understanding of T-cell
   development, they have also provided potential model species across the
   vertebrate phyla including the zebrafish (Danio rerio). However, this
   species is one of more than 20,000 species of fish that could assist in
   elucidating the development of the vertebrate thymus and, consequently,
   the evolution of the vertebrate immune response. In this paper we review
   the knowledge of the teleost thymus through the organogenesis and
   development studies in teleosts together with advances in molecular and
   functional approaches. Where necessary we will combine this knowledge
   with that obtained in higher vertebrates. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Objective To analyze linear growth of very low birth weight (VLBW),

   Study design VLBW SGA preterm infants (n = 46) with primarily symmetric
   intrauterine growth restriction from the Bonn Longitudinal Study were
   compared with 62 appropriate for gestational age (AGA) VLBW preterm and
   73 term infants and with their parents.
   Results Forty-six percent of VLBW SGA (21 of 46) had complete height
   catch-up by adult age, and most became taller than target height (TH)
   (15 of 21; 71\%). The others did not catch up; most of them remained
   shorter than TH (18 of 25; 72\%) after initial catch-up followed by
   catch-down growth. Mean adult height z-score was lower than that for
   birth length. Mean body mass index was similar in the catch-up and no
   catch-up groups (21.8 and 21.3, respectively) and lower than in the
   controls (23.2). Approximately 1/2 of the head circumference (HC)
   catch-up children achieved height catch-up as well.
   Conclusions Height catch-up extended beyond age 6 years, independent of
   HC growth. We could not predict height catch-down or successful
   catch-up.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of need for cognition on interpersonal influence. The Need
   for Cognition (NC) refers to the tendency to engage in and enjoy
   effortful thought (Cacioppo and Petty, 1982). Since individuals with
   high NC tend to base their attitudes on extensive thinking, their
   attitudes also tend to be relatively resistant to change. The present
   research examined the impact of NC on interpersonal influence processes.
   In one study, we predicted and found that, relative to participants with

Abstract = {{Primary cultures of rat hepatocytes were studied in serum-free medium.
   Ultradian protein synthesis rhythm was used as a marker of overall cell
   synchronization and cooperation amongst the population. The level of
   synchronization was determined by amplitudes of the rhythm. Low
   synchronization of old rat hepatocytes can be enhanced by addition of
   either gangliosides or phenylephrine to the medium. Incubation of
   cultures with gangliosides lasted for 2.5 h, while action of
   phenylephrine was only for 2 min. The amplitude of protein synthesis
   rhythm was increased 1.5 - 2 times. In Cultures transferred to a fresh
   normal medium, this increased amplitude was observed for at least 2 - 3
   days. Thus, both gangliosides and phenyleprine are triggers, which, as
   shown earlier, initiated calcium-dependent processes in the cytoplasm.
   The results are discussed in the light of concept of the cell
   self-organization by a direct cell-cell communication. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Background: Patients with rectal prolapse have abnormal hindgut
   motility. This study examined the effect of rectal prolapse surgery on
   colonic motility.
   Methods: Twelve patients undergoing sutured rectopexy were studied
   before and 6 months after surgery by colonic manometry, colonic transit
   study and clinical assessment of bowel function. The results were
   compared with those from seven control subjects.
   Results: Before surgery colonic pressure was greater in patients than
   controls (P < 0.050). Controls responded to a meal stimulus by
   increasing colonic pressure; this increase was absent in patients. After
   rectopexy, colonic pressure reduced towards control values and patients'
   colonic pressure response to a meal returned. High-amplitude propagated
   contractions (HAPCs) were seen in all controls but in only three
   patients before and two patients after surgery. Three patients had
   prolonged colonic transit before and eight after rectopexy.
   Conclusion: Patients with rectal prolapse have abnormal colonic motility
   associated with reduced HAPC activity. Rectopexy reduces colonic
   pressure but fails to restore HAPCs, reduce constipation or improve
   colonic transit. These observations help explain the pathophysiology of
   constipation associated with rectal prolapse.}},

   first is for welder safety during welding, since there is a risk of the
   welding arc causing the pipe wall to be penetrated allowing the contents
   to escape. The second concern is for the integrity of the pipeline
   following welding, since welds made in-service cool at an accelerated
   rate because the flowing contents remove heat from the pipe wall. These
   welds, therefore, are likely to have hard heat-affected zones (HAZ) and
   a subsequents susceptibility to hydrogen cracking.}},

Abstract = {{The 29 June 1992 Richter local magnitude (M-L) 5.6 Little Skull Mountain
   earthquake, 20 km southeast of Yucca Mountain, caused rockfalls on steep
   slopes of Little Skull Mountain, while some semi-precarious rocks
   remained in place. The observation that ground motion was sufficient to
   cause rockfalls and yet leave semi-precarious rocks untoppled offers
   both upper- and lower-bound estimates of the history of ground motion at
   Little Skull Mountain. A ground-motion synthesis code, used in Yucca
   Mountain probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA), was applied to
   assess the spatial distribution of peak ground acceleration around
   Little Skull Mountain with respect to the surface attenuation and
   evidence for ground shaking during the earthquake. Instrumental records
   for the earthquake, rockfalls, remaining precarious rocks, intensity
   values estimated from damage to local facilities, and scaling of ground
   motions based on a recent M-L 4.4 Little Skull Mountain aftershock were
   compared with model predictions. Predicted peak accelerations based on a
   kappa value of similar to 20 ms (used in the Yucca Mountain PSHA) are
   too high to be consistent with this evidence of ground shaking. This
   suggests some ground-motion predictions conducted for the Yucca Mountain
   PSHA may need to be re-examined, and may be too conservative.}},

Abstract = {{E-Cadherin and beta-catenin are known for their role in tumor invasion,
   but both proteins also exert an influence on tumor proliferation. This
   study, performed on canine mammary tumors, aimed to analyze the
   influence of E-cadherin (E-cad) and beta-catenin (beta-cat),
   immunohistochemically assessed singly and in combination
   (E-cad/beta-cat), on survival and their relationship with several
   proliferation indices (AgNOR index, MIB1 index, mitotic index).
   Immunohistochemistry was carried out on 60 formalin-fixed, paraffin
   wax-embedded specimens of canine mammary malignancies. The labeling was
   defined as preserved when prevalent on cell membranes of more than 75\%
   of cells and reduced in other forms of expression (i.e., membranous less
   than 75\%, cytoplasmic, and negative). E-cad, beta-cat, and
   E-cad/beta-cat were preserved respectively in 22, 12, and 11 out of 60
   cases. Immunohistochemical expression of the two proteins in the same
   tumors was significantly correlated (P = 0.0001; R = 0.57). Survival
   analysis revealed no difference in outcoine comparing the preserved
   versus reduced cases (E-cad, P = 0.31; beta-cat, P = 0.29;
   E-ead/beta-cat P = 0.36). Grouping cases for histologic invasiveness,
   the expression of E-cad or beta-cat and E-cad/beta-cat showed a
   progressive reduction that paralleled an increase in invasiveness from
   noninfiltrating to stage-II tumors (E-cad, P < 0.001; beta-cat, P <
   0.05: E-cad/beta-cat, P < 0.05). No significant difference was obtained
   comparing mitotic index, MIB 1 index, and AgNOR index by analysis of
   variance between the cases grouped for preserved or reduced E-cad,
   beta-cat, and Ecad/beta-cat variables. In conclusion, reduced expression
   of E-cad, beta-cat, or E-cad/beta-cat was significantly associated with
   the progression from noninfiltrating to highly infiltrating tumors but
   not with proliferation or survival.}},

Abstract = {{Background and purpose: The spatial heterogeneity in oxygen tension
   (pO(2)) in tumor tissue has been studied extensively, whereas, the
   information about the temporal heterogeneity is sparse. The purpose of
   the present study was to search for pO(2) fluctuations in untreated and
   irradiated spontaneous canine tumors, and to investigate whether there
   is a relationship between overall tumor oxygenation status and pO(2)
   fluctuation pattern.
   Patients and methods: Six dogs scheduled for radiation therapy of head
   and neck cancer were included in the study. The primary tumors were
   irradiated with 18 fractions of 3 Gy. Eppendorf polarographic electrodes
   and OxyLite fluorescence probes were used to measure overall oxygenation
   status and pO(2) fluctuation pattern, respectively. Tissue pO(2) was
   recorded at three subsequent days prior to treatment, and immediately
   before radiation fraction 4, 7, and 10.
   Results: Overall oxygenation status differed substantially among the
   tumors. Radiation therapy had no consistent effect on overall
   oxygenation status. Fluctuations in pO(2) were detected in untreated as
   well as irradiated tumors, and independent of whether the tumors were
   poorly or well oxygenated.
   Conclusions: Fluctuations in pO(2) can occur in untreated and irradiated
   spontaneous canine tumors. There is no correlation between pO(2)
   fluctuation pattern and overall tumor oxygenation status. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Objective: To describe the site and severity of cardiogenic motion
   artifacts on 16-slice multidetector computed tomography (CT) angiograms
   of the pulmonary circulation and to determine the impact of the gantry
   rotation time on image quality.
   Methods: Sixty-nine patients undervent nonelectrocardiographically gated
   16-slice multidetector CT angiography of the pulmonary circulation with
   a rotation time of 0.5 second (group 1, n = 37) or 0.375 second (group
   2, n = 32). All scans were prospectively analyzed for the presence of
   cardiogenic motion artifacts in the pulmonary arteries, defined as a
   blurring of the edges of the pulmonary arteries on lung window settings
   with or without an artifactual loss of enhancement in the arterial lumen
   oil soft tissue windows ({''}pseudofilling defect{''}). In addition, the
   severity of pulmonary arterial blurring, was recorded using a 4-point
   scale.
   Results: Fifty-six patients (81\%) had at least I pulmonary artery
   affected by cardiogenic motion artifacts. At the level of the central
   pulmonary arteries, movement artifacts responsible for a blurring of the
   arterial wall were present in 35 patients (51\%), mainly observed at the
   level of the pulmonary trunk (n = 28, 41\% of patients) and right main
   pulmonary artery (n = 23, 33\% of patients); in 2 patients, motion
   artifact was responsible for a pseudoflap appearance within the arterial
   lumen (n = 14\% of patients). Motion artifacts at the level of lobar
   pulmonary arteries were noted only in the lower divisions of the lingula
   (n = 1: 1.5\% of patients) and in the left lower lobe (n = 2, 3\% of
   patients). At the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries, motion
   artifacts were most frequently found in the lower divisions of the left
   upper lobe (lingula) (n = 19, 27.5\% of patients) and left lower lobe (n
   = 29: 42\% of patients). At the subsegmental level, motion artifacts
   were most common in the lower divisions of the left upper lobe (lingula)
   (n = 30: 43.5\% of patients) and left lower lobe (n = 35, 51\% of
   patients). Pseudofilling defects were depicted at the segmental and
   subsegmental levels in 28 patients (41\% of the study group), almost
   exclusively located in the lingula and left lower lobe. Cardiogenic
   motion artifacts were observed with a significantly lower frequency in

Abstract = {{Sphingosine kinase (SphK) is a conserved lipid kinase that catalyzes
   formation of important regulators of inter- and intracellular signaling,
   sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P), and dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate
   (dhS1P). In this study, we investigated the role of SphK1 in the
   regulation of expression of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) in dermal
   fibroblasts, a key event in regulation of extra cellular matrix. We show
   that overexpression of SphK1 up-regulated MMP1 protein, MMP1 mRNA, and
   MMP1 promoter activity, and this action of SphK1 required activation of
   the ERK1/2-Ets1 and NF-kB pathways. Furthermore, experiments using SphK1
   specific siRNA demonstrated that SphK1 is required for the TNF-alpha
   stimulation of MMP1. Additional data revealed a specific role of dhS1P,
   and not S1P, as a mediator of SphK1-dependent activation of ERK1/2 and
   up-regulation of MMP1. The stimulatory effect of dhS1P was sensitive to
   pertussis toxin, suggesting a possible involvement of a
   G-protein-coupled receptor. In contrast, S1P, but not dhS1P, stimulated
   the induction of COX-2, which demonstrated selective actions of these
   two closely related bioactive lipids. In conclusion, this study
   describes a novel mode of SphK1 signaling through generation of dhS1P
   with a key role in mediating transcriptional responses to TNF-alpha.
   This is the first report of selective function of dhS1P as compared with
   the better studied S1P.}},

   these differences, studies show that women report comparable levels of
   job satisfaction. Crosby (1982) referred to this as the paradox of the
   contented female worker. Previous work has investigated the paradox in
   predominantly male settings. A random sample of 359 employees at a
   predominantly female organization is examined. Results confirm a gender
   paradox of job satisfaction. Surprisingly, pay is positively associated
   with job satisfaction for women, but not for men. Also contributing to
   the paradox is a weaker negative association of workload and
   satisfaction for women. Findings also suggest women referring to other
   women are more satisfied. Context is presented as a tool for assessing
   existing theoretical perspectives.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of carvone on the locomotion activity (LA) of mice depends
   on the chirality of this terpene ketone and the circadian rhythm of
   mice, the latter assessed by using a light-barrier cage upon
   administration of analeptics and sedative drugs. (-)-Carvone, the
   so-called `spearmint carvone', showed more sedative and relaxing
   effects, whereas (+)-carvone, the `caraway carvone', demonstrated both
   sedation and activation effects on the LA of mice, e.g. (-)-carvone
   showed only in amphetamine pre-treated `morning mice' a relaxant effect,
   while with other analeptics pre-treated mice nearly no alteration of the
   LA could be observed. (+)-Cavone slightly counteracted the stimulating
   effect of LA with metamphetamine, phenobarbital and cathine pre-treated
   `morning mice', but decreased the LA when the mice were pre-treated with
   other analeptics, especially amphetamine. Mice in the resting phase
   showed a similar reaction upon sniffing (-)-carvone as before; only
   pre-treatment with caffeine led to a stimulation. In the late morning a
   moderate reduction of the animal's LA upon sniffing (+)-carvone vapour
   was observed after pre-treatment with most of the analeptics, except
   with amphetamine, where strong over-agitation could be counteracted
   entirely. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. To evaluate whether control of risk factors associated with
   worse results has improved graft survival, with respect of renal
   function quality and other factors influencing graft survival: recipient
   age, immunosuppressive therapy, cold ischemia time, acute tubular
   necrosis (ATN), acute rejection episodes (ARE) and 1-month creatinine
   levels.
   Materials and methods. Retrospective review of 147 patients who
   underwent kidney transplant between 1995 and 2001. Inclusion criteria
   were donor and recipient age older than 60 years, first renal
   transplant, follow-up period longer than 12 months, donor creatinine
   clearance higher than 75 mL/min, and less than 20\% glomerulosclerosis
   observed in donor renal biopsy.
   Results. Graft survivals were 87\%, 83\%, 78\%, and 70\% at first,
   second, third, and fifth year after transplantation, respectively. Mean
   serum creatinine levels were 2.3 mg/dL and mean follow-up time, 46
   months. Multivariate analysis using a Cox regression model identified
   donor age, ARE, and serum creatinine levels 1 month after surgery as
   independent variables affecting graft survival. Recipient age,
   immunosuppressive therapy, and serum creatinine levels at 1 month after
   surgery were predictive variables of recipient survival.
   Discussion. Renal transplantation is an accepted therapeutic option in
   elderly patients with chronic renal insufficiency, if both donor and
   recipient are carefully selected.}},

Abstract = {{Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) with pure carbon dioxide was used
   to obtain desorption curves of PAHs from four contaminated industrial
   soils. Total PAH concentrations ranged from 1495 to 2439 mg/kg. The
   desorption curves were fitted with a simple two-site model to determine
   the rapidly released fraction (F) representing bioavailability of PAHs.
   The F data obtained under various SFE pressures were compared with
   degradation results of a composting method applied on the soils. After
   composting and consequent long-term maturation, the residual PAH
   contaminations ranged from 4 to 36\% of the original values. A possible
   explanation of the result variations is the different bioavailability of
   the pollutants. The best correlations between degradation results and F
   fraction were obtained applying 50 degrees C and 300 bar. The F values
   gave very good agreement with degradation efficiencies and the total
   regression coefficients (r(2)) ranged from 0.81 to 0.99. The degradation
   results together with bioavailable fractions appeared to be consistent
   with organic carbon contents in the soils and with volatile fractions of
   organics. The results indicate that SFE could be a rapid test to predict
   bioremediation results of composting of PAH-contaminated soils.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To evaluate the biocompatibility of mineral trioxide aggregate and
   accelerated Portland cement and their eluants by assessing cell
   metabolic function and proliferation.
   Methodology The chemical constitution of grey and white Portland cement,
   grey and white mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and accelerated Portland
   cement produced by excluding gypsum from the manufacturing process
   (Aalborg White) was determined using both energy dispersive analysis
   with X-ray and X-ray diffraction analysis. Biocompatibility of the
   materials was assessed using a direct test method where cell
   proliferation was measured quantitatively using Alamar Blue(TM) dye and
   an indirect test method where cells were grown on material elutions and
   cell proliferation was assessed using methyltetrazolium assay as
   recommended by the International standard guidelines, ISO 10993-Part 5
   for in vitro testing.
   Results The chemical constitution of all the materials tested was
   similar. Indirect studies of the eluants showed an increase in cell
   activity after 24 h compared with the control in culture medium (P <
   0.05). Direct cell contact with the cements resulted in a fall in cell
   viability for all time points studied (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions Biocompatibility testing of the cement eluants showed the
   presence of no toxic leachables from the grey or white MTA, and that the
   addition of bismuth oxide to the accelerated Portland cement did not
   interfere with biocompatibility. The new accelerated Portland cement
   showed similar results. Cell growth was poor when seeded in direct
   contact with the test cements. However, the elution made up of calcium
   hydroxide produced during the hydration reaction was shown to induce
   cell proliferation.}},

Abstract = {{The intestinal fatty-acid binding protein-2 (FABP2) gene codes a protein
   responsible for the absorption of long-chain fatty acids. To test
   whether FABP2 is a candidate gene for renal disease in patients with
   type 2 diabetes, a functional A54T polymorphism was genotyped in 1,042
   Brazilians with type 2 diabetes. Patients were classified as having
   normoalbuminuria (urinary albumin excretion {[}UAE] < 20 mu g/min; n =
   529), microalbuminuria (UAE 20-199 mu g/min; n = 217), or proteinuria
   (UAE > 199 mu g/min min; n = 160). Patients with end-stage renal disease
   (ESRD) (n = 136) were also included. The prevalence of the TT genotype
   was higher in patients with renal involvement compared with those with
   normoalbuminuria (odds ratio {[}95\% CI] 2.4 {[}1.1-5.4]) following
   adjustment for type 2 diabetes duration, BMI, hypertension, A1C, and
   cholesterol levels. The risk was similar considering different stages of
   renal involvement. In a second independent patient sample (483 type 2
   diabetic Caucasians residing in Massachusetts), a significant
   association was also observed between the TT genotype and proteinuria or
   ESRD (2.7 {[}1.0-7.3]; P = 0.048). This study thus provides evidence
   that FABP2 confers susceptibility to renal disease in type 2 diabetic

Abstract = {{Background. Bacteremia and septic shock remain important causes of
   morbidity and mortality after solid-organ transplantation. The aim of
   this study was to assess the characteristics and risk factors for
   mortality among patients with bloodstream infections and shock.
   Methods. From January 1991 to December 2000, all episodes of bloodstream
   infection were prospectively examined, considering bacteremia or
   fungemia as significant according to the CDC criteria. Septic shock was
   diagnosed in a patient with systemic inflammatory response syndrome and
   persistent dysfunction of at least one organ caused by hypoperfusion
   despite hemodynamic support.
   Results. There were 466 episodes of bacteremia in 382 patients, with 66
   of them developing septic shock. Risk factors for developing shock were
   age > 50 (P =.006), liver transplant (P =.029), nosocomial infection (P
   =.034), pulmonary focus (P =.0001), P. aeruginosa infection (P =.001),
   and polymicrobial etiology (P =.039). On multivariate analysis, only
   age, nosocomial infection, and pulmonary source were significant. Among
   66 shock patients, bacteremia was due to gram-negative bacteria in 53\%,
   gram-positive bacteria in 24\%, fungal in 7.5\%, and polymicrobial in
   12\% of patients. The most frequent source was the lung (26\%). Empiric
   antimicrobial therapy was correctly chosen in 79\%; however, 36 patients
   died (54\%), including 27 despite correct therapy. Urinary tract
   infections had less mortality than other foci.
   Conclusions. Risk factors for developing septic shock in bacteremia were
   age more than 50 years, nosocomial acquisition, and pulmonary focus.
   Despite adequate empiric antibiotic therapy, the mortality remained
   high.}},

Abstract = {{Weeds are an important plant resource for insects, although feeding by
   insects on weeds can have both positive and negative effects on crop
   productivity. Weeds also indirectly affect crops via their influence on
   beneficial insects, and by harboring plant and insect diseases. Weeds
   may affect the ability of dispersing insects to locate crop plants. The
   host relationship between insects and plants is highly variable, ranging
   from very specialized to generalized feeding behaviors. Despite the
   myriad interactions of weeds and insects, many aspects of the
   relationship are predictable. Most insects, including crop pests, are
   specialists, and preadapted to feed only on some plants, often within a
   single plant family. Even polyphagous insects often have a distinct
   preference hierarchy, feeding more widely only when preferred hosts are
   unavailable. Use of plants by insects is a dynamic interaction, with
   characteristics of the insect (e.g., mandible structure) and the plant
   (e.g., allelochemicals) affecting feeding behavior. Thus, weeds that are
   closely related to crops are particularly important in harboring insects
   that attack those crops. Crop production practices should seek to sever
   the taxonomic association between the crop and the weeds found within
   the crop, and nearby, by eliminating weeds related to the crop. This
   will make it less likely that insects will move easily from weed to crop
   plants, that damaging population densities of insects will develop in
   the field, and that insect vectors that harbor plant diseases will be
   harbored in the field. Particularly important integrated pest management
   practices include crop rotation, reduced use of chemical herbicides, and
   management of weeds in noncultivated areas.}},

   flumequine can be measured directly in the solid phase, at lambda(exc) =
   358 nm and X, m = 459 nm. The variables that influence the construction
   of the membrane have been studied, along with the experimental variables
   related to the fixation process of the analyte in the membrane. The
   calibration graph was linear over the range 0.1 - 2.0 mg/L with a
   detection limit of 0.03 mg/L and a precision of 0.5\%. The method was

Abstract = {{Most patients attending urban STD clinics can benefit from workshops
   designed to promote sexual health and reduce sexual risk behaviors.
   However, many patients do not attend such workshops when invited. The
   purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of providing a
   financial incentive on attendance at a sexual risk reduction workshop
   tailored to patients at an urban STD clinic. A quasi-experimental design
   with two conditions (incentive vs no incentive) was implemented
   sequentially with 107 STD clinic patients (58 men, 49 women; 69\%
   African American; mean age = 27 years) reporting risky sexual behavior.
   Attendance at a subsequent sexual risk reduction workshop served as the
   key outcome. Results indicated that participants who were provided with
   a \$30 cash incentive were more likely to attend the risk reduction
   workshop (38\%) than participants who were not offered an incentive
   (9\%), chi(2) (1, N = 107) = 12.88, p <.001. Additional analyses
   confirmed that incentive (AOR = 7.59, p <.001) predicted attendance even
   after controlling for other significant predictors, namely, employment
   status (AOR = 3.04, p <.05) and age (AOR = 1.07, p <.05). We conclude
   that financial incentives are an effective way to increase attendance at
   sexual risk reduction workshops for at-risk urban populations.}},

Abstract = {{Health disparities are an enormous challenge to American society.
   Addressing these disparities is a priority for U.S. society and
   especially for institutions of higher learning, with their threefold
   mission of education, service, and research. Collaboration across
   multiple intellectual disciplines will be critical as universities
   address health disparities. In addition, universities must collaborate
   with communities, with state partners, and with each other. Development
   of these collaborations must be sensitive to the history and unique
   characteristics of each academic institution and population. The authors
   describe the challenges of all three types of collaboration, but
   primarily focus on collaboration between research-intensive universities
   and historically black colleges and universities.
   The authors describe a four-year collaboration between Shaw University
   and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH). These
   universities strategically developed multiple research initiatives to
   address health disparities, building on modest early success and
   personal relationships. These activities included participation by Shaw
   faculty in faculty development activities, multiple collaborative pilot
   studies, and joint participation in securing grants from the Agency for
   Health care Research and Quality of the federal Department of Health and
   Human Services and the National Institutes of Health, including a P-60
   Project EXPORT center grant. These multiple activities were sometimes
   led by UNC-CH, sometimes by Shaw University. Open discussion of problems
   as they arose, realistic expectations, and mutual recognition of the
   strengths of each institution and its faculty have been critical in

Abstract = {{Fibrates, such as ciprofibrate, fenofibrate, and clofibrate, are
   peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR alpha) agonists
   that have been in clinical use for many decades for treatment of
   dyslipidemia. When mice and rats are given PPAR alpha agonists, these
   drugs cause hepatic peroxisome proliferation, hypertrophy, hyperplasia,
   and eventually hepatocarcinogenesis. Importantly, primates are
   relatively refractory to these effects; however, the mechanisms for the
   species differences are not clearly understood. Cynomolgus monkeys were
   exposed to ciprofibrate at various dose levels for either 4 or 15 days,
   and the liver transcriptional profiles were examined using Affymetrix
   human GeneChips. Strong upregulation of many genes relating to fatty
   acid metabolism and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation was
   observed; this reflects the known pharmacology and activity of the
   fibrates. In addition, (1) many genes related to ribosome and proteasome
   biosynthesis were upregulated, (2) a large number of genes downregulated
   were in the complement and coagulation cascades, (3) a number of key
   regulatory genes, including members of the JUN, MYC, and NF kappa B
   families were downregulated, which appears to be in contrast to the
   rodent, where JUN and MYC are reported to upregulated after PPAR alpha
   agonist treatment, (4) no transcriptional signal for DNA damage or
   oxidative stress was observed, and (5) transcriptional signals
   consistent with an anti-proliferative and a pro-apoptotic effect were
   seen. We also compared the primate data to literature reports of hepatic
   transcriptional profiling in PPAR alpha-treated rodents, which showed
   that the magnitude of induction in beta-oxidation pathways was
   substantially greater in the rodent than the primate.}},

Abstract = {{Ferritin is a major intracellular iron storage protein and also
   functions as a cytoprotectant by sequestering iron to minimize the
   formation of reactive oxygen species. Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the
   causative agent of human granulocytic anaplasmosis, is an obligate
   intracellular bacterium that colonizes neutrophils. We have previously
   reported that human promyelocytic HL-60 cells infected with A.
   phagoeytophilum demonstrate increased transcription of ferritin heavy
   chain and also that the bacterium stimulates neutrophil NADPH oxidase
   assembly and degranulation during the initial hours of infection (J. A.
   Carlyon, W. T. Chan, J. Galan, D. Roos, and E. Fikrig, J. Immunol.
   169:7009-7018, 2002, and J. A. Carlyon, D. Abdel-Latif, M. Pypaert, P.
   Lacy, and E. Fikrig, Infect. Immun. 72:4772-4783, 2004). In this study,
   we assessed ferritin mRNA and protein levels during A. phagocytophilum
   infection in vitro using HL-60 cells and neutrophils and in vivo using
   neutrophils from infected mice. The addition of A. phagocytophilum, as
   well as Escherichia coli and serum-opsonized zymosan, to neutrophils
   results in a pronounced increase in ferritin light-chain transcription
   and a concomitant rise in ferritin protein levels. Neutrophils from A.
   phagocytophilum -infected mice demonstrate elevated ferritin heavy-chain
   mRNA expression, a phenomenon consistent with infections by
   intracellular pathogens. Notably, ferritin protein levels of infected
   HL-60 cells were markedly diminished in a dose- and time-dependent
   manner. These studies provide insight into the effects A.
   phagocytophilum has on the ferritin levels of its host cell.}},

Abstract = {{The few previous studies of hypospadias and smoking have suggested
   either no association or a reduced risk. This study, which uses data
   from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, a multi-state,
   population-based case-control study, includes data on males born with
   severe hypospadias (i.e. the urethra opens at the penile shaft, scrotum
   or perineum) from 1997 to 2000. Non-malformed, liveborn male controls
   were selected randomly from birth certificates or from birth hospitals.
   Maternal interviews were completed by telephone with 453 case mothers
   and 1267 control mothers. Maternal smoking was not associated with
   hypospadias risk. For example, during the third month of pregnancy,
   smoking < 0.5 pack/day had an odds ratio (OR) of 1.1 {[}95\% CI 0.6,
   1.9]; 0.5 pack/day, 0.6 {[}0.4, 1.1]; and >= 1 pack/day, 0.8 {[}0.4,
   1.6]. Exposure to any secondhand smoke at home during the third month of
   pregnancy showed an OR of 0.6 {[}95\% CI 0.4, 1.0], and exposure at work
   or school, an OR of 0.7 {[}0.5, 1.1]. Similar risks were observed for
   other months during the periconceptional period, and adjustment for
   several potential confounders did not substantially alter results. This
   analysis does not confirm a recent report suggesting that maternal
   smoking is associated with a reduced risk of having offspring with
   hypospadias.}},

Abstract = {{The need for structural rehabilitation of concrete structures all over
   the world is well known, and a great amount of research is going on in
   this field. The use of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) plate
   bonding has been shown to be a competitive method with regard to both
   structural performance and economic factors. This method consists of
   bonding it thin carbon-fiber laminate or sheet to the surface of the
   structure to act as an outer reinforcement layer. However, most research
   in this area has been undertaken to study flexural behavior. This paper
   deals with shear strengthening of reinforced concrete members by use of
   CFRP. Tests on rectangular beams 3.5 to 4.5 m long have been undertaken
   to study different parameters. such as fatigue. anchorage, and others.
   The strain field in shear spans of beams simultaneously subjected to
   shear and bending is also studied. The tests presented also contribute
   to the existing literature on tests of concrete members strengthened for
   increased shear capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Chlamydophila pneumoniae is an important human intracellular pathogen:
   however, the pathogenesis of C. pneumoniae infection is poorly
   understood and the immune control mechanism versus host cells is not
   completely known. The role of the nitric oxide (NO) synthase pathway in
   inhibiting the ability of C. pneumoniae to infect macrophage J774 cells
   and the ability of NO to damage isolated C. pneumoniae were
   investigated. Exposure of infected cultures to recombinant murine gamma
   interferon (MurIFN-gamma) resulted in increased production of NO and
   reduced viability. Addition of 2-(N,N-diethylamino)-diazenolase-2-oxide
   before infection of J774 cells or during chlamydial cultivation released
   NO, both resulting in a reduction in the viability of C pneumoniae in a
   dose-dependent way. These results indicate that immune control of
   chlamydial growth in murine macrophage cells may trigger a mechanism
   that includes NO release with effects on the multiplication of the
   microorganism, thus suggesting that NO may play a role in preventing the
   systemic spread of Chlamydia.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss the polarization of V atoms on Co(001) substrates within
   density functional calculations. For sub-monolayer coverage the coupling
   between V and Co is clearly of antiferromagnetic type whereas it changes
   to ferromagnetic coupling in the case of a full V monolayer on Co(001).
   The results obtained in the case of a sub-monolayer coverage are in
   agreement with recent X-ray magnetic circular dichroism by Huttel et al.
   {[}Phys. Rev. B 68, 174405 (2003)]. The transition from
   antiferromagnetic coupling (in the case of sub-monolayer coverage) to
   ferromagnetic coupling (for a full monolayer coverage) is discussed in
   terms of local coordination numbers and V-Co hybridization. Comparison
   with Cr and Mn coverages on Co(001) complicates the problem: i)
   submonolayer Cr coverage stabilizes the antiferromagnetic coupling
   between Cr and Co atoms (like for V on Co(001) whereas a Cr monolayer on
   Co presents in-plane antiferromagnetic coupling; ii) submonolayer Mn
   coverage stabilizes now the ferromagnetic coupling between Mn and Co
   whereas a Mn monolayer on Co(001) presents an in-plane antiferromagnetic
   coupling. Competition between Co induced magnetism and surface induced
   magnetism at V sites is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{IGF2, insulin-like growth factor 2, is implicated in myogenesis and lean
   meat content. A mutation in a single base (A for G substitution) of the
   gene for IGF2 (position 3072 in intron 3) has been recently described as
   the cause of a major QTL effect on muscle growth in pigs {[}Van Laere,
   A. S, Nguyen, M., Braunschweig, M., Nezer, C., Collete, C., \& Moreau,
   L. et al. (2003). Nature, 425, 832836]. We describe here a rapid assay
   based on real time PCR (RT-PCR) to detect this mutation. We have
   evaluated the incidence of the mutation in commercial pig crosses, in
   three populations of purebred Iberian or Iberian x Duroc crosses, and in
   cured meat products and wild boars. The incidence of the mutation varies
   among these groups. Penetrance of the A mutation is about 80\% in the
   commercial population. Purebred Iberian pigs were all homozygous G/G
   whereas crosses of Iberian pigs were heterozygous (90\%) or homozygous
   A/A (10\%). The implications of this gene for the selection of Iberian

Abstract = {{The development of less invasive methods for myocardial
   revascularization such as ``off-pump{''} cardiac surgery, and new
   methods of anesthesia and postoperative care protocols such as
   ``fast-track recovery{''} (FTRC), have contributed to a significant
   reduction in postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length
   of stay after cardiac surgical procedures. The objectives of this study
   were to identify perioperative risk factors of prolonged hospital stay,
   hospital mortality, and readmission rates in off-pump coronary artery
   bypass surgery (CABG) patients undergoing the FTRC protocol. Eighty
   consecutive patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery
   with FTRC protocol were included in the study. For the first purpose of
   this protocol, early extubation is defined as removal of the
   endotracheal tube within 6h of arrival at the surgical ICU. The second
   purpose was to obtain a minimal length of stay in the ICU (< 24h) and
   hospital discharge within 5 days. We analyzed the influence of the
   preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables on prolonged
   hospital stay, hospital mortality, and hospital readmission. Three
   patients died during hospitalization, giving a hospital mortality rate
   of 3.75\%. The causes of hospital death were massive stroke and sepsis.
   Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, hypertension (P =
   0.0185), postoperative stroke (P = 0.0001), and sternal infection (P =
   0.0007) were identified as independent predictors of hospital mortality.
   Mean hospital length of stay was 4.23 +/- 0.75 days. Univariate and
   multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that postoperative
   blood use (P = 0.0095) was the major independent predictor of prolonged
   hospital stay. During the 30-day observation period, seven patients were
   readmitted. One of these patients died on postoperative day 45 from
   mediastinitis and sepsis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis
   identified age (P = 0.0033) and hypertension (P = 0.045) as independent
   predictors of hospital readmission. FTRC protocols can be performed
   safely in patients with off-pump CABG, and the mortality and readmission
   rates following this protocol were found to be within acceptable ranges.}},

Abstract = {{C-kit is a proto-oncogene involved in normal growth and development and
   neoplastic processes, and its product, CD117, is a highly specific
   immunohistochemical diagnostic marker for gastrointestinal stromal
   tumors (GISTs). Because GISTs that express
   immunohistochemically-detectable CD117 respond dramatically to treatment
   with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, identification of central nervous
   system tumors that express CD117 might open new therapeutic approaches
   for treatment of brain tumors. Specimens from 52 glial tumors of various
   histologic types and grades were assayed for CD117 immunoreactivity, and
   about 75\% of the tumors were positive for CD117 expression; all except
   a few exhibited strong cytoplasmic and membranous staining. The
   proportion of high grade tumors of all tumor types with detectable CD117
   immunoreactivity was statistically significantly greater than low grade
   tumors, and glioblastoma and anaplastic oligodendroglioma showed the
   highest staining grade. These findings support further investigation
   into the possibility that CD117 has an important role in growth of glial
   tumors and that patients with brain tumors expressing CD117 might
   benefit from treatment with receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a multiband vector quantization (VQ) technique
   based on inner product for wideband speech coding at 16 kb/s. Our
   approach consists of splitting the input speech into two separate bands
   and then applying an independent coding scheme for each band. A code
   excited linear prediction (CELP) coder is used in the lower band while a
   transform based coding strategy is applied in the higher band. The
   spectral components in the higher frequency band are represented by a
   set of modulated lapped transform (MLT) coefficients. The higher
   frequency band is divided into three subbands, and the MLT coefficients
   construct a vector for each subband. Specifically, for the VQ of these
   vectors, an inner product-based distance measure is proposed as a new
   strategy. The proposed 16kb/s coder with the inner-product based
   distortion measure achieves better performance than the 48 kb/s ITU-T

Abstract = {{This study is focused on the modulation response of resonant-cavity
   light-emitting diodes (RCLEDs). Platinum (Pt) atoms are diffused into
   the 660 nm RCLED epitaxial layers to increase the concentration of
   recombination centers and to improve the modulation speed. The RCLED has
   an AlInGaP multi-quantum-well active layer which was embedded into
   AlGaAs-distributed Bragg reflectors to form a one-wavelength (1-lambda)
   optical resonator. Afterwards, the deep-level Pt impurity was diffused
   into the RCLED and an improved average rise time, from 18.07 to 12.21
   ns, was obtained. The corresponding modulation frequency can be
   increased from 19.54 to 30.21 MHz. (c) 2005 American Institute of

Abstract = {{A resistor mesh model (RMM) has been validated with reference to the

   cortex. The application of the RMM to scalp potential interpolation was
   detailed in Part 1. Using the RMM and the same four dipoles, the
   different methods of cortical mapping were compared and have shown the
   potentiality of this RMM for obtaining current and potential cortical
   distributions. The lead-field matrices are well-adapted tools, but the
   use of a square matrix of high dimension does not permit the inverse
   solution to be improved in the presence of noise, as a regularisation
   technique is necessary with noisy data. With the RMM, the transfer
   matrix and the cortical imaging technique proved to be easy to
   implement. Further development of the RMM will include application to
   more realistic head models with more accurate conductivities.}},

Abstract = {{This is the first full scope study of wastewater reclamation and reuse
   on public WWTP in Taiwan, A 50 m(3)/day pilot plant with membrane
   and,biological systems of wastewater reclamation has been deployed and
   operated in the WWTP of Hsinchu Industrial Park, northern Taiwan. The
   reclaimed water has been transported to five factories and been used as
   the fresh water supply as well as the makeup water of cooling tower. The
   future construction of a 10,000 m(3)/day wastewater reclamation plant
   has been proposed and finiancially investigated. The business plan of
   BTO is proposed for future development, The 50 m(3)/day pilot plant
   consists of a membrane UF/RO system followed by the systems of high
   efficient biological oxidation systems BioNET and/or BAC. The
   bench-scale-membrane scaling/fouling test and magnetic anti-scaling
   system are also introduced to verify the mechanisms of membrane scaling
   and fouling. The result of the pilot study shows that the reclaimed
   water can conform the drinking water standard and can be used as the
   make-up water of cooling tower as well as the manufacturing water of
   many industrial. applications. The concentrate of RO process can fit the
   effluent standard and can be discharged directly to the river nearby.,
   There are 88.6\% of the factories in the industrial park express their
   willingness of using reclaimed water and 4600 m(3)/day is requested
   after the preliminary poll. The cost of reclaimed water is around
   US\$0.54/m(3) (including construction, O \& M and transportation) which
   is higher than the tariff of tap water (US\$0.27/m(3)) but lower than
   the cost of seawater desalination as well as that of reservoir
   construction. Under BTO business plan, a wastewater reclamation plant of
   minimum 10,000 m(3)/day is proposed in order to make profit for future
   operation.}},

   a diagnostic tool for assessment of cardiac mechanical dyssynchrony}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background. A count-based method using technetium-99m sestamibi
   electrocardiographygated myocardial perfusion single photon emission
   computed tomography imaging has been developed to extract the left
   ventricular (LV) regional phase of contraction (onset of mechanical
   contraction {[}OMC]) throughout the cardiac cycle. This study was
   performed to develop ONIC normal databases and dynamic ONIC displays for
   assessment of cardiac mechanic dyssynchrony.
   Methods and Results. LV regional phases were extracted from 90 enrolled
   normal subjects (45 men and 45 women) by use of the Emory Cardiac
   Toolbox and then submitted to statistical analysis to generate the
   normal databases. The LV ONIC wave was dynamically propagated over the
   perfusion polar map by blackening either sequential phase bins or all
   past phases. The developed ONIC normal databases consisted of peak phase
   (134.5 degrees +/- 14.3 degrees for men and 140.2 degrees +/- 14.9
   degrees for women), phase SD (14.2 degrees +/- 5.1 degrees for men and
   11.8 degrees +/- 5.2 degrees for women), and phase histogram bandwidth
   (38.7 degrees +/- 11.8 degrees for men and 30.6 degrees +/- 9.6 degrees
   for women), skewness (4.19 +/- 0.68 for men and 4.60 +/- 0.72 for
   women), and kurtosis (19.72 +/- 7.68 for men and 23.21 +/- 8.16 for
   women). Both statistical analysis and dynamic ONIC displays were
   incorporated into a user interface as a diagnostic tool.
   Conclusion. The ONIC normal databases and dynamic ONIC displays should
   help clinicians evaluate cardiac mechanic dyssynchrony. Prospective
   clinical trials are needed to validate whether this tool can be used to
   select patients with severe heart failure symptoms who might benefit
   from cardiac resynchronization therapy.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of potassium permanganate as preoxidant for algae-laden
   source water and the mechanism that it causes algae cells aggregation
   was investigated. Synthetic algae suspensions, prepared from
   lab-cultured Chodatella sp., were used for batch preoxidation and
   settling tests. In order to study the effect of water hardness on the
   function of permanganate, some algae suspensions were spiked with CaCl2
   solution. Experiments with preformed MnO2 to look into its effect on
   algae cell aggregation were also conducted. The results show that
   preoxidation with potassium permanganate would promote the aggregation
   of algae cells, and this phenomenon was even more significant with the
   existence of hardness causing ion, calcium. In addition to incorporating
   its reducing product, MnO2, into algae floc, and increased its specific
   gravity, and therefore its settling velocity, permanganate may also
   induce the release of extracellular organic matters (EOM) from algae
   cell. Based on SEM observation, EOM probably enhanced the incorporation
   of MnO2 into algae floc. The role played by calcium ion in promoting the
   function of permanganate can be explained by charge neutralization and
   also bridging between negatively charged surfaces. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Leslie matrix models are discrete models for the development of
   age-structured populations. It is known that eigenvalues of a Leslie
   matrix are important in describing the asymptotic behavior of the
   corresponding population model. It is also known that the ratio of the
   spectral radius and the second largest (subdominant) eigenvalue in
   modulus of a non-periodic Leslie matrix determines the rate of
   convergence of the corresponding population distributions to a stable
   age distribution. In this paper, we further study the spectral
   properties of a row-stochastic Leslie matrix A with a near-periodic
   fecundity pattern of type (k, d, s) based on Kirkland's results in 1993.
   Intervals containing arguments of eigenvalues of A on the upper-half
   plane are given. Sufficient conditions are derived for the argument of
   the subdominant eigenvalue of A to be in the interval {[}2 pi/d, 2
   pi/d-s] for the cases where k = 1. A computational scheme is suggested
   to approximate the subdominant eigenvalue when its argument is in {[} 2
   pi/d, 2 pi/d-s ] (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{I-Tiao-Gung, Glycine tomentella, has been used extensively as a
   traditional herbal medicine to relieve physical pain, but its
   bioactivity has not been studied systematically. Ninety-five percent
   ethanol extracts of G. tomentella (GT-E) showed antioxidant activity in
   human plasma by prolonging the lag phase (+T-lag) of Cu2+-induced LDL
   oxidation and were dose dependent. The +T-lag of LDL combined with 3.2
   mu g/mL GT-E was similar to that with mu M (ca. 0.5 mu g/mL) Trolox. A
   similar inhibitory effect was found toward tilapia plasma LDL. In
   addition, GT-E inhibited tilapia thrombocyte (nucleated platelet) 5-,
   12-, and 15-lipoxygenase (LOX). The IC50 values were 0.43, 0.72, and
   0.42 mu g/mL, respectively, whereas the IC50 values for
   nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) on 5-, 12-, and 15-LOX were 2.3, 1.6,
   and 1.7 mu g/mL, respectively. The IC50 value for cyclooxygenase-2
   (COX-2) inhibition by GT-E was 42.0 mu g/mL, whereas the IC50 value by
   indomethacin as a positive control was 0.61 mu g/mL. The prevention of
   LDL oxidation and the dual inhibition of LOX and COX-2 are indicative of
   the possible roles of I-Tiao-Gung in antiatherosclerosis and

Abstract = {{Based on the institutional vs the individual view of culture and the

   systems were in place. We also predicted that Chinese would be less
   cooperative with foreigners than with fellow Chinese when they were in a
   foreign territory, whereas Australians would be equally cooperative with
   members of both groups. Data from two cross-national experiments
   provided general support for these predictions. Moreover, the results of

Volume = {{131}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Contemporary high-rise buildings with complex geometric profiles and
   three-dimensional (3D) coupled mode shapes often complicate the use of
   high frequency force balance (HFFB) technique customarily used in wind
   tunnel testing for uncoupled buildings. In this study, a comprehensive
   framework for the coupled building response analysis and the modeling of
   the associated equivalent static wind loads using the HFFB measurement
   is presented. This includes modeling of building structural systems
   whose mass centers at different floors may not be located on a single
   vertical axis. The building response is separated into the mean,
   background, and resonant components, which are quantified by modal
   analysis involving three fundamental modes in two translational and
   torsional directions. The equivalent static wind load is described in
   terms of the modal inertial loads. The proposed framework takes into
   account the cross correlation of wind loads acting in different primary
   directions and the intermodal coupling of modal responses with closely
   spaced frequencies. Wind load combination is revisited in the context of
   modeling of the equivalent static wind loads. A representative tall
   building with 3D coupled modes and closely spaced frequencies is
   utilized to demonstrate the proposed framework and to highlight the
   significance of cross correlation of wind loads and the intermodal
   coupling of modal responses on the accurate prediction of coupled
   building response. Additionally, delineation of the proper role of the
   correlation between integrated loads, modal response, and respective
   building response components in the evaluation of wind effects on
   coupled buildings is underscored.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To investigate the sensory functions of the peripheral to central
   pathways in infants with Down syndrome (DS) by sensory evoked
   potentials. Methods: Fifty-five infants, 30 DS infants and 25 controls,
   were examined by multimodal evoked potentials, including brainstem
   auditory evoked potentials (BAEP), visual evoked potentials (VEP) and
   short-latency somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP). Results: No
   obvious difference was found in the peak latencies between the two
   groups for BAEP. Nine children with DS showed abnormal BAEP; six had
   hearing loss and three had prolonged wave I latencies. For VEP, the peak
   latencies of P-2 and N-2 were significantly longer and the amplitudes
   were smaller in the DS group than in the control group. Of the 30
   infants with DS, five had significantly prolonged P-2 latencies and two
   had lower amplitudes. In SSEP, the mean latencies of N-20 and the
   interpeak latencies of N-13-N-20 of the infants with DS showed apparent
   prolongation compared to the controls. Seven of 30 (23.3\%) DS patients
   had prolonged N-20 latencies.
   Conclusion: Our results indicate that various sensory deficits occur in
   patients with DS during the first year of life.}},

Abstract = {{A shear mode PZT actuator for the microdroplet ejecting system is
   proposed. The plate-shaped actuator poled with remnant polarization
   perpendicular to the actuating field induces a piezoelectric shear
   effect. Two poling designs for the shear mode piezoelectric actuator are
   compared by both analysis and experiment. The two poling designs are the
   single-surface poling design and the dual-surface poling design. The
   single-surface poling design arranges the poling electrodes on only one
   surface, while the dual-surface poling design arranges the poling
   electrodes on opposite surfaces. Although the single-surface poling
   design is convenient for the poling process, its requirement for a
   higher poling voltage to achieve a coercive field induces specimen
   failure by surface cracking. So, the dual-surface poling design is
   preferred because a higher yield and better electromechanical coupling
   characteristic can be obtained. In both the poling designs, the relation
   of the shear piezoelectric coefficient, d(15), and the actuating
   electric field are obtained with three kinds of sample thickness.}},

Abstract = {{Intrinsically disordered regions in proteins are relatively frequent and
   important for our understanding of molecular recognition and assembly,
   and protein structure and function. From an algorithmic standpoint,
   flagging large disordered regions is also important for ab initio
   protein structure prediction methods. Here we first extract a curated,
   non-redundant, data set of protein disordered regions from the Protein
   Data Bank and compute relevant statistics on the length and location of
   these regions. We then develop an ab initio predictor of disordered
   regions called DISpro which uses evolutionary information in the form of
   profiles, predicted secondary structure and relative solvent
   accessibility, and ensembles of 1D-recursive neural networks. DISpro is
   trained and cross validated using the curated data set. The experimental
   results show that DISpro achieves an accuracy of 92.8\% with a false
   positive rate of 5\%. DISpro is a member of the SCRATCH suite of protein
   data mining tools available through

Pages = {{1671-1683}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{The shrinkage geometry factor connects the changes of subsidence and the
   total crack volume at the shrinkage of a soil layer matrix. An available
   approach for estimating the factor does not account for the crack volume
   in samples, the stretching of a shrinking soil layer, and a possible
   change of the factor with water content. A recent new approach for
   estimation of the factor enables one to account for the factor's
   dependence on water content and the impact of cracks in a sample. The
   present work also accounts for the stretching of a shrinking soil layer.
   Corrected value of the factor is described in terms of the shrinkage
   curves of: a layer including unconnected solid cubes from the available
   approach, a stretched layer with cracks, a sample with cracks, and the
   soil matrix without cracks. This correction leads to changes in the soil
   subsidence and total crack volume compared with those obtained from the
   available approach. Two known physical conditions are used: the specific
   soil matrix volume without cracks is the same for the sample and the
   layer; and, the matrix deformations of an unlimited shrinking soil layer
   are longitudinal those of a thin quasi-elastic plate. Two available
   experimental examples are considered. The former relates to clay paste
   samples. The latter relates to an aggregated clay soil in situ and in
   samples. The geometry factor from the available approach, and that
   obtained after correction, differ significantly. The corrected factor
   also shows the appreciable change with water content.}},

Abstract = {{Right ventricular myocardial (RVM) motion is poorly documented. The
   objective of this study was to determine the variability of RVM
   velocities by tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) in healthy dogs (study 1), to
   analyze RVM motion in a large healthy canine population (study 2), and
   to compare the results with those obtained for the left ventricular free
   wall. Six healthy Beagle Dogs were monitored in study 1, and 64 healthy
   dogs of 14 different breeds were monitored in study 2. Velocities were
   recorded in 2 segments (basal and apical) of the right and left
   myocardial walls. In study 1, 36 TDI examinations were performed for 4
   days, whereas a single TDI examination was performed on each dog in
   study 2. All velocity profiles included 1 positive systolic wave and 2
   negative diastolic waves. The lowest intraday and interday coefficient
   of variation values of the right TDI variables were observed at the base
   (3.5-16.1\%). The variability of the right apical velocities was much
   higher, with most coefficient of variation values >15\%. RVM velocities
   were higher in the basal than in the apical segments (P < .001) and were
   higher than the left velocities of the corresponding segment (P < .01).
   Body weight and breed had an effect on only a few right and left TDI
   variables. TDI provides a repeatable and reproducible method for
   evaluating basal RV function in the dog. These data also demonstrate the
   heterogeneity of the myocardial velocities between the left and the
   right ventricles and between the base and the apex.}},

Pages = {{802-809}},

Abstract = {{Aim To investigate the mode of failure of a brand of nickel-titanium
   instruments separated during clinical use, by detailed examination of
   the fracture surface.
   Methodology A total of 122 ProTaper S1 instruments were discarded from
   an endodontic clinic at a stomatological school in China over a period
   of 17 months; 28 had fractured. These fractured instruments were
   ultrasonically cleaned, autoclaved and then examined under a scanning
   electron microscope. From the lateral view the fracture was classified
   into `torsional' or `flexural'. The specimens were then re-mounted and
   the presence of characteristics of shear failure and fatigue striations
   was recorded under high-power view of the fracture surface. The
   difference in the mean lengths of fractured segment between the shear
   and fatigue groups was compared using Student's t-test.
   Results Twenty-seven separated instruments were available for analysis.
   Under low-power magnification, only two fell into the category of
   `torsional' failure when examined laterally; the others appeared to be
   `flexural'. Close examination of the fracture surface revealed the
   presence of fatigue striations in 18 specimens. Nine instruments
   (including the two putative `torsional' failures above) fell into the
   shear fracture group, in which fatigue striations were absent or
   characteristics of shear failure of the material were found. The mean
   length of fractured segments resulting from fatigue failure (4.3 +/- 1.9
   mm) was significantly greater than that for shear failure (2.5 +/- 0.8
   mm) (P < 0.001, two-sample t-test).
   Conclusions Examination of the fracture surface at high magnification is
   essential to reveal features that may indicate the possible origin of
   cracks and the mode of material failure. Macroscopic or lateral
   examination of separated instruments would fail to reveal the true
   mechanism of failure. Fatigue seems to be an important reason for the
   separation of rotary instruments during clinical use.}},

Abstract = {{The possibility of producing a fermented beverage from donkey's milk
   using the probiotic bacterial strains Lactobacillus rhamnosus AT 194,
   CLT 2/2, and Lactobacillus casei LC 88, isolated from Parmigiano
   Reggiano cheese was investigated. The chemical-physical and
   microbiological properties of the raw milk demonstrated that it has a
   low microbiological load and an elevated content of lysozyme. The
   bacterial strains employed for fermentation had a good growth capacity
   in donkey's milk only after an initial adaptation phase. An extremely
   high percentage of viable bacteria were found in the final beverage,
   even after a 30-day shelf life. Likewise, the activity of lysozyme was
   virtually unchanged with respect to initial values. Sensorial analysis
   permitted the individuation of differences between the three bacterial
   strains used for fermentation in terms of descriptors relative to
   aromatic-olfactory qualities. Based on the above results, technology can
   be proposed for production of a fermented beverage from donkey's milk
   that can be utilized by small producers. This would allow the production
   of a beverage that would be well accepted by consumers interested in a
   product with favorable therapeutic properties integrated with probiotic

Abstract = {{We analyze a method that uses fixed, minimal physical resources to
   achieve generation and nested purification of quantum entanglement for
   quantum communication over arbitrarily long distances and discuss its
   implementation using realistic photon emitters and photonic channels. In
   this method, we use single-photon emitters with two internal degrees of
   freedom formed by an electron spin and a nuclear spin to build
   intermediate nodes in a quantum channel. State-selective fluorescence is
   used for probablistic entanglement generation between electron spins in
   adjacent nodes. We analyze in detail several approaches which are
   applicable to realistic, homogeneously broadened single-photon emitters.
   Furthermore, the coupled electron and nuclear spins can be used to
   efficiently implement entanglement swapping and purification. We show
   that these techniques can be combined to generate high-fidelity
   entanglement over arbitrarily long distances. We present a specific
   protocol that functions in polynomial time and tolerates percent-level
   errors in entanglement fidelity and local operations. The scheme has the
   lowest requirements on physical resources of any current scheme for

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to examine possible links between different

   were conducted in a representative sample of 324 adults (18-65), all
   residents of Crete. Aberrant driver's behaviour was assessed by the
   `driver behaviour questionnaire' (DBQ). Also to measure different
   dimensions of lifestyle, first, a 26-items questionnaire was used, and
   second, three questions measuring `driving without destination', related
   in previous findings with road accident risk. Four lifestyle patterns:
   `religion/tradition', `driving aimlessly', `sports' and `culture' are
   significant predictors of ordinary violations. `Driving without
   destination' has a significant effect all three DBQ factors (b
   positive). `Religion/tradition' was related only to ordinary violations
   (b negative) and `sports' has a positive impact on ordinary violations
   and a negative impact on `errors'. Two lifestyle factors are related to
   more dangerous driving: `Driving without destination' and/or pursuing a
   more `athletic way of living'. Road safety campaigns must teach the
   first group to use other hobbles and activities to vent their feelings
   and the second, not to overestimate their abilities, while driving. (c)

Abstract = {{Object. Anterior surgical approaches to the lumbosacral disc spaces are
   being undertaken with increasing frequency. This increase and the use of
   minimally invasive techniques themselves have the potential to raise the
   incidence of major vessel injuries. The purpose of this study was to
   determine the variability of the vascular anatomy anterior to the
   lumbosacral spine and to draw conclusions regarding surgical
   accessibility of the L5-S1 disc space.
   Methods. Thirty-five cadavers (age range at the time of death 31-87
   years) were obtained to evaluate the anatomical features of iliac
   vessels with respect to the anterior approach to the lumbosacral spine.
   Direct measurement and morphological classification regarding the
   relations of these great vessels to the four arbitrary reference points
   of the lumbosacral disc space were performed. The mean width and height
   of the L5-S1 disc were 56.4 mm (range 41.6-65.4 mm) and 18.8 mm (range
   10-24 mm), repectively. According to the authors' morphological
   classification, nine specimens (26\%) were found to be Type A
   (standard), 12 (34\%) Type B (narrow), two (6\%) Type C (ajar), and 12
   (34\%) Type D (obstacle).
   Conclusions. The authors have noted quite a variation in the venous
   vascular anatomy anterior to the lumbosacral disc. During surgical
   planning for the anterior approach to the lumbosacral spine when using
   any technique, it is vital to assess carefully radiographic and
   neuroimaging studies to minimize potentially disastrous vascular
   complications.}},

Abstract = {{In order to evaluate the reliability of Sn-8 mass\%Zn-3 mass\%Bi
   (hereafter, Sn-8Zn-3Bi) solder, thermal shock tests (temperature range:
   from 233 to 353 K) and high temperature humidity tests (test condition:
   353 K, 85\% relative humidity) were conducted. The PCB (Printed Circuit
   Board) pads were finished by OSP (Organic Solderability Preservative),
   So and Ni/Au. The electric part for test was QFP (Quad Flat Package),
   and the lead was plated by Sn-3 mass\%Bi. The joint strength was
   estimated by pull testing, and Zn-phase behavior in solder joint was
   examined.
   The pull strengths of Sn-8Zn-3fli joints in the as-soldered state were
   measured to be about 16N, irrespective of the PCB pad coatings. After
   thermal shock testing (hereafter, TS test) up to 1000 cycles, the pull
   strengths decreased to around 14N. Meanwhile, after high temperature
   humidity testing (hereafter, HTH test) up to 1000h, the pull strengths
   deceased to around 6N, irrespective of the PCB pad coatings. The reason
   for the drastic decrease of pull strength after the HTH test was proven
   to be a crack that was observed along the zinc oxide-phase. The Zn-phase
   in the Sn-8Zn-3Bi solder changed from a separate acicular shape to a
   lined-up branched arrangement after HTH tests of 1000 h.}},

Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{51-55}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The Manor Spearfish Field, located in Southeast Saskatchewan, was
   originally discovered in 1987, with the drilling of several vertical
   wells that encountered remnant Spearfish sands on top of the Alida
   carbonates. A few vertical wells were produced at low rates. In 1992,
   several companies aggressively developed the pool entirely through
   horizontal drilling. Production peaked at 1,100 m(3)/d, then declined to
   just over I 10 m(3)/d.
   The pool has been the target of recent horizontal infill drilling.
   Several successful wells have been drilled, and Spearfish production
   from Crescent Point Energy operated wells has doubled from under 100
   m(3)/d to almost 200 m(3)/d. Additional infill locations remain, both
   with new stand-alone horizontal wells and with horizontal re-entry
   wells.
   This paper reviews the predicted and actual results of five horizontal
   infill wells drilled in 2002. The methodology used in prioritizing the
   infill locations is also intended to illustrate the basic principles of
   reservoir engineering, and bow they can be applied through simple
   analytical methods to yield favourable results. The paper, as such,
   provides a review of the basic engineering steps needed in a successful
   infill well development project.}},

Abstract = {{A parametric study of automotive diesel combustion in a low-temperature,
   late-injection combustion regime is described. Injection pressure was
   varied from 600-1200 bar, swirl ratio from 1.44-7.12, and intake
   temperature from 30-110 degrees C. In-cylinder pressure records, heat
   release analysis, spatially-integrated soot luminosity, and images of
   the spatial distribution of combustion luminosity are employed to study
   the influence of these parameters on the combustion and soot
   formation/oxidation processes. Load points of 3 and 6 bar gross IMEP at
   1500 RPM and an O-2 concentration of 0.15 are considered. Increased
   injection pressure is found to enhance the early mixture formation
   process, resulting in increased peak apparent heat release, generally
   decreased soot luminosity, and modestly increased light-load soot
   oxidation rates. At lower injection pressures, more soot luminosity is
   observed from the squish volume. In contrast, variation of flow swirl
   impacts the latter half of the combustion process, and affects the
   initial combustion only slightly. An optimum Ricardo swirl ratio of
   roughly 3 is found for best moderate-load efficiency and soot oxidation.
   A marked reduction in early heat release rates and peak soot luminosity
   is observed with decreased intake temperature. Nevertheless, significant
   in-cylinder soot luminosity is observed even at the lowest intake
   temperatures, indicating that complete suppression of in-cylinder soot
   formation is difficult with the fuel injection and combustion system
   characteristics employed.}},

Abstract = {{A newly developed ionization gauge using carbon nanotube(CNT) field
   emission effect has been designed and manufactured. The fabricated
   ionization gauge is of a triode type, consisting of a cathode (carbon
   nanotube field emitter arrays), a grid and a collector. The principle
   involved here is that for a constant number of electrons available for
   ionization emitted from carbon nanotube arrays by the grid potential, a
   constant fraction of gas will be ionized and the number of ions
   collected in the collector will be proportional to the number of gas
   molecules in the chamber traversed by the electrons. Due to the
   excellent field emission characteristics of CNT, it is possible to make
   a cost effective cold cathode ionization gauge. A screen-printing method
   has been used to make the CNT cathode. The glass grid with Cr deposited
   by E-beam has been put on the cathode with a gap of 200 mu m between the
   two electrodes. Using the voltage applied to the grid, the electrons
   emitted from the carbon nanotube ionize gas molecules in the chamber and
   the ionized molecules are gathered in the collector. At this time, the
   collector voltage is maintained at a lower level than that of the grid
   voltage to obtain a large ionization ratio. The current detected in the
   collector is proportional to the pressure in the chamber. The ionization
   characteristics are dependent on the gas and the voltage applied to the
   grid and collector. In this paper we have shown the various metrological
   characteristics of the simple pressure sensor utilizing carbon nanotube.}},

Abstract = {{The regulation of MHC class II expression by the class II transactivator
   (CIITA) is complex and differs in various cell types depending on the
   relative activity of three CIITA promoters. Here we show that, in plasma
   cell tumors, the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) elicits
   PIII-CIITA but does not activate the IFN-gamma-inducible PIV-CIITA
   promoter. In trophoblast cells, all CIITA promoter types are
   constitutively silent and not induced by IFN-gamma or TSA treatment. TSA
   induction of PI-CIITA was restricted to macrophage and dendritic cell
   lines. In the Colon 26 tumor IFN-gamma induced endogenous PIV-CIITA but
   not PIII-CIITA while TSA activated class II in the apparent absence of
   CIITA. Reporter assays in Colon 26 showed that TSA induced PIII-CIITA
   but not PIV-CIITA. Transfection of a dominant negative CIITA plasmid in
   Colon 26 inhibited induction of class II by IFN-gamma but not TSA. Thus,
   the potential for both CIITA-dependent and -independent pathways of MHC
   induction exists within a single cell. Further evidence of
   CIITA-independent class II expression elicited by TSA was obtained using
   knockout mice with defects in CIITA, STAT-1 alpha and IRF-1 expression.
   TSA treatment can also activate class II expression in mutant cell lines
   with deficiencies in signaling molecules, transcription factors and the
   BRG-1 cofactor that are required for IFN-gamma-induced CIITA expression.
   Importantly, after epigenetic activation by the deacetylase inhibitor,
   MHC class II is transported and displayed on the cell surface of a
   plasma cell tumor and it is converted to an efficient antigen presenting
   cell for protein and class II-peptide presentation.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of shallow
   ablations in phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) in patients with
   recurrent corneal erosions.
   Setting: Department of Ophthalmology, Tuen Mun Hospital, Hong Kong,
   China.
   Methods: A retrospective analysis of 13 consecutive eyes with recurrent
   corneal erosions treated by PTK from 1997 to 1999 was performed. All
   eyes failed to respond to conventional treatments, and all eyes had
   corneal erosions involving the visual axis. Outcome measures included
   number of recurrences, change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and
   spherical equivalent (SE), and complications arising from the laser
   treatment.
   Results: Indications for PTK were recurrent corneal erosions secondary
   to minor abrasive trauma (9 eyes) and map-dot-fingerprint corneal
   dystrophy (4 eyes). The mean ablation depth was 4.6 mu m (range 3.4 to
   5.8 mu m). Mean postoperative follow-up was 49.5 months (range 24 to 68
   months). The overall success rate after only 1 treatment was 84.6\%.
   Eleven of 13 eyes had a preserved or improved BCVA, while 2 eyes showed
   deterioration of 1 line on Snellen testing. Seven of 13 patients had no
   change in SE; the rest had a change of less than +/- 0.50 diopters.
   There were no major complications.
   Conclusions: The comparable success rate after a single treatment
   suggests that PTK may still be effective at a shallower depth than
   previously considered. Shallow ablations may have lower chances of
   complications associated with deeper ablations. Further studies
   involving a larger number of subjects are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Clinical outcomes among patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD)
   might not be linked to medical factors alone. We studied the clinical
   impact of various social factors among patients on PD.
   Methods. In a cohort of 102 consecutive patients who started PD in a
   single centre between 2003 and 2004, we evaluated the effects of social
   factors on the development of peritonitis and risk of hospitalization
   after initiation of PD.
   Results. Of 102 incident PD patients, 35 subjects (34.3\%) were referred
   to nephrologists more than 3 months before dialysis initiation. During
   85.7 patient-years of observation (median follow-up, 10.7 months), four
   subjects died and six underwent kidney transplantation. Patients
   receiving social security assistance and those younger than 40 years
   fared worse than others in terms of their risk of peritonitis. Mean
   peritonitis-free time for subjects who were on social security
   assistance was 2.7 months, and for those who were not, 16.4 months (P =
   0.045). In the Cox proportional hazards analysis, need for social
   security assistance and illiteracy were the only statistically
   significant factors associated with the time to a first peritonitis,
   after adjustment for social characteristics and relevant coexisting
   medical factors. Dependence on social security assistance prior to PD
   was associated with a > 2-fold increased likelihood of peritonitis, with
   an adjusted risk ratio of 2.69 (95\% confidence interval, 1.10 to 6.54;
   P = 0.029). The total number of hospitalization days was similar between
   those who received social security assistance and those who did not:
   17.4 +/- 14.6 days (range, 4-50 days) vs 17.9 +/- 14.0 days (range, 0-60
   days) (P = 0.89).
   Conclusions. Our results con. rm that socioeconomic status is closely
   associated with the rate of peritonitis among PD patients. The long-term
   reliability of these social predictors remains to be validated.}},

Abstract = {{Tuberculosis is a public health problem in Mexico. From 1999 to 2002, we
   assessed retrospectively the epidemiological, clinical, and treatment
   characteristics of pulmonary tuberculosis in the hospitals of the
   Mexican Institute of Public Health in the state of Colima (Mexico). We
   included 184 cases diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis. A database
   containing demographic, epidemiological, and clinical information was
   constructed and analyzed. We estimate a median patient delay of 83 d and
   a mean treatment delay of 2.3 d. Of 14 cases suspected for
   multiresistance and microbiologically assayed, 5 were found to carry a
   multi-drug-resistant strain. We also found a significant association
   between a short patient delay and the presence of hemoptysis (p = 0.002)
   or dyspnea (p < 0.001). 86 patients (46.8\%) were sputum smear
   microscopy negative at the end of treatment and 40 (21.7\%) completed
   treatment giving an overall success rate of 68.5\%, which compares
   unfavorably with the World Health Organization target success rate of
   85\%. Five (2.7\%) patients failed treatment, 10 (5.4\%) died, 39
   (21.2\%) interrupted treatment, and 4 (2.2\%) transferred to another
   reporting unit. A 2002 strategic change in drug distribution seemed to

Title = {{Control of bleeding in children with Dengue hemorrhagic fever using
   recombinant activated factor VII: a randomized, double-blind,
   placebo-controlled study}},

Abstract = {{Objectives We evaluated the efficacy and safety of recombinant activated
   factor VII (rFVIIa) in children aged < 18 years old with grade 11 or
   grade III Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) who required blood component
   therapy for controlling bleeding episodes.
   Study design Patients were randomized to the rFVIIa group or placebo
   group in a ratio of 2 : 1. rFVIIa or placebo (100 mu g/kg body weight)
   was given by intravenous bolus injection. When bleeding was not
   effectively controlled, a second dose of rFVIIa or placebo (1100 mu
   g/kg) was given 30 min after the first dose.
   Results Nine and 16 patients received placebo and rFVIIa, respectively.
   The demographics, bleeding manifestations and grade of DHF were similar
   for the rFVIIa and placebo groups. Apart from petechiae and ecchymosis,
   one to four additional bleeding sites were found in each patient,
   including hematemesis (n = 15), epistaxis (n = 14), gum bleeding (n =
   12), melena (n = 7), hypermenorrhea (n = 4), hematochezia (n = 2) and
   hematuria (n = 2). The mean total dose of rFVIIa (138.4 +/- 50.9 mu
   g/kg) and placebo (145.4 +/- 53.7 mu g/kg) were comparable. The efficacy
   of bleeding control at 2 h after the first dose was completely ceased
   (rFVIIa 75.0\% versus placebo 44.4\%), decreased (rFVIIa 18.7\% versus
   placebo 11.2\%), and unchanged or worsened (rFVIIa 6.3\% versus placebo
   44.4\%). Some patients with active bleeding received platelet
   concentrates 3-12 h after the first dose of rFVIIa or placebo. The
   subsequent efficacy of bleeding control at 6, 12 and 24 h was comparable
   between the two groups. The cumulative use of red blood cells (rFVIIa
   31.3\% versus placebo 33.3\%) and plasma (rFVIIa 25\% versus placebo
   22\%) during the 24-h period was not significantly different between the
   two groups. In contrast, platelet concentrate requirement in the rFVlla
   group (6.3\%) was lower than the placebo (33.3\%). No clinical evidence
   of thromboembolic complications or mortality as a result of bleeding was
   observed.
   Conclusion rFVIIa appears to be a useful adjunctive treatment to blood
   component transfusion for controlling active bleeding in children with
   DHF especially when platelet concentrate is not readily available.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of initial oocyte diameter on ovulation time, quantity and

   according to their oocyte size: 650-700, 700-750, and 750-800 mu m, and
   injected with HCG (500 IU/kg BW). Ovulation was induced in All the fish
   of the three groups, and the relationship between elapsed time until
   ovulation (T, hr) and oocyte diameter (D,,um) was represented as
   follows: T = - 0.082D + 105.99 (R-2 = 0.51). 530 thousand eggs per fish
   could be obtained from fish with oocyte diameter over 700,um, while only
   half the number of eggs could be collected from fish with oocyte
   diameter of 650-700 mu m. High fertilization rates of over 90\% could be
   obtained from all three groups regardless of the initial oocyte diameter
   when the artificial insemination had been performed just after
   ovulation. However, the hatching rates rose with the increase of initial
   oocyte diameter. Thus, measuring the initial oocyte diameter before the
   HCG injection enables estimation of the ovulation time, number and
   quality of ovulated eggs in yellowtail.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel approach to an online trajectory planning of
   robot arms for the interception of a fast-maneuvering object under
   torque and velocity constraints. A body axis is newly introduced as a
   trajectory-planning coordinate in order to meet the position and the
   velocity matching conditions or a smooth grasp of the fast-maneuvering
   object. Using the position of the object and the end-effector in the
   inertia axis, the acceleration commands are generated in the X-, Y-, and
   Z-directions of the body axis and the acceleration commands are modified
   considering the torque and the velocity constraints. The trajectory
   planning in the X-direction becomes the speed planning to achieve the
   maximum speed, whereas the trajectory planning in the Y- and
   Z-directions becomes the direction planning where a missile-guidance
   algorithm is employed to intercept the maneuvering object. Finally, the
   acceleration commands in the body axis are transformed into the angle
   commands of the end-effector in the joint axis, which is used as the
   actual trajectory commands in robot arms.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the spatial structure of noise in optical recordings made
   with two commonly used voltage-sensitive dyes (RH795 and RH1691) in
   mouse barrel cortex in vivo, and determined that the signal-to-noise
   ratio of the two dyes was comparable when averaging over barrel-sized
   areas, or at single pixels distant from large blood vessels. We examined
   the spatiotemporal development of whisker- and electrically-evoked
   optical responses by quantifying the area of activated cortical surface
   as a function of time. Whisker and electrical stimuli activated cortical
   areas between 0.2-2.0 mm(2) depending on intensity. More importantly,
   both types of activation recruited cortical area at similar rates and
   showed a linear relationship between the maximal activated area and the
   peak rate of increase of the activated area. We propose a general rule
   of supragranular cortical activation in which the initial spreading
   speed of the response determines the total activated area, independent
   of the type of activation. Finally, despite comparable single-response
   kinetics, we observed greater paired-pulse depression of whisker-evoked
   responses relative to electrically-evoked responses.}},

   Right-eyed males. but not females, showed relatively stronger
   preferences for the primary imprinting object than left-eyed males;
   however, the assymetry was modulated by a spontaneous preference for the
   sphere. In Experiment 2, a more traditional imprinting paradigm was
   used: chicks were exposed to the same object for the first 2 days, and
   on Day 3 underwent a free-choice test between the imprinting object
   (sphere/cylinder) and a novel one (cylinder/sphere). Results showed that
   no assymetries in the use of eyes were apparent, only a general
   preference for the sphere. In Experiment 3 chicks were expoised, as in
   Experiment 1, to a primary (Day 1) and a secondary (Day 2) imprinting
   object; on Day 3 they were exposed to both objects simultaneously; they
   were also tested for preferences for the two stimuli on Day 4. Left- and

Abstract = {{We study the cosmological and weak-field properties of theories of
   gravity derived by extending general relativity by means of a Lagrangian
   proportional to R1+delta. This scale-free extension reduces to general
   relativity when delta -> 0. In order to constrain generalizations of
   general relativity of this power class, we analyze the behavior of the
   perfect-fluid Friedmann universes and isolate the physically relevant
   models of zero curvature. A stable matter-dominated period of evolution
   requires delta > 0 or delta <-1/4. The stable attractors of the
   evolution are found. By considering the synthesis of light elements
   (helium-4, deuterium and lithium-7) we obtain the bound -0.017 <delta <
   0.0012. We evaluate the effect on the power spectrum of clustering via
   the shift in the epoch of matter-radiation equality. The horizon size at
   matter-radiation equality will be shifted by similar to 1\% for a value
   of delta similar to 0.0005. We study the stable extensions of the
   Schwarzschild solution in these theories and calculate the timelike and
   null geodesics. No significant bounds arise from null geodesic effects
   but the perihelion precession observations lead to the strong bound
   delta=2.7 +/- 4.5x10(-19) assuming that Mercury follows a timelike
   geodesic. The combination of these observational constraints leads to
   the overall bound 0 <=delta < 7.2x10(-19) on theories of this type.}},

Abstract = {{The removal of iron is necessary during the purification of leachates
   from zinc bearing ores prior to electrowinning due to its negative
   impact on both product quality and current efficiency. Whilst
   precipitation down to acceptable levels is readily achieved, the
   challenge lies in producing an easily filterable precipitate which is
   relatively pure (for resale and/or reuse). Crystalline hematite is an
   iron precipitate which potentially fulfils these requirements. Some work
   has been presented in literature on precipitation of hematite from
   sulphate solutions and dilute chloride solutions, however no work has
   been found on the selective precipitation of hematite from concentrated
   halide solutions. This technical note presents some preliminary
   observations on the selective formation of hematite from a leachate
   which originated from the zinc recovery process developed by Intec Ltd.
   The process is novel in the use of a mixed halide leachant over the
   traditional sulphide leachant, with the advantages of operation at low
   temperatures and atmospheric pressure, and that the leachant may be

Abstract = {{Purpose: To estimate the frequency and type of disabilities preventing
   work among those experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) compared
   with those never experiencing IPV.
   Methods: We used a large cross-sectional survey of women, ages 18-65,
   attending family practice clinics from 1997 through 1998. Participation
   included a 5-10-minute in-clinic survey assessing IPV experience and a
   longer telephone survey assessing health status and chronic disabilities
   that prevented work outside the home or housework.
   Results: Of 1,152 eligible women surveyed, 54\% experienced some type of
   IPV, and 24\% were currently in a violent relationship. Women who had
   ever experienced IPV were more than twice as likely to report a
   disability (adjusted odds ratio {[}aOR] = 2.2, 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI] 1.6, 3.0). The most commonly reported disabilities were those
   associated with heart or circulatory disease (4.9\%), followed by back
   problems (3.5\%), chronic pain (3.4\%), arthritis (3.0\%), nerve system
   damage (2.4\%), asthma or another respiratory problem including
   emphysema (1.7\%), and either depression (1.6\%) or another mental
   illness (1.0\%). Women ever experiencing IPV were more likely to report
   a disability due to generalized chronic pain (aOR = 2.5, 95\% CI 1.5,
   4.3) and mental illness (aOR = 4.5, 95\% CI 1.5, 13.1). IPV-related
   injuries were associated in a dose-dependent manner with having any
   disability and with disability from chronic pain, asthma and other
   respiratory diseases, mental illness, and chronic diseases.
   Conclusions: Primary care-based efforts to screen for IPV and
   effectively intervene to reduce the impact of IPV on women's lives must
   be a public health priority to reduce the short-term and long-term
   health effects, including disabilities.}},

Abstract = {{The adaptive landscape is one of the most widely used metaphors in
   evolutionary biology. It is created by plotting fitness against
   phenotypes or genotypes in a given environment. The shape of the
   landscape is crucial in predicting the outcome of evolution: whether
   evolution will result in populations reaching predictable end points, or
   whether multiple evolutionary outcomes are more likely. In a more
   applied sense, the landscape will determine whether organisms will
   evolve to lose `costly' resistance to antibiotics, herbicides or
   pesticides when the use of the control agent is stopped. Laboratory
   populations of microbes allow evolution to be observed in real time and,
   as such, provide key insights into the topology of adaptive landscapes.

Abstract = {{The dependence of the microscopic and macroscopic mechanical response of

   Macroscopic compression tests revealed that the fracture strength and
   Young's modulus increase with increasing annealing time, and therefore,
   with increasing crystalline volume fraction. However, embrittlement of
   the material is also found for longer annealing treatments. A perfect
   solute mixture model of defect-free nanoparticles embedded in an
   amorphous matrix was used to account for the strengthening effect.
   Nanomechanical tests have contributed to the understanding of the
   mechanical behaviour of the heat-treated BMG states under investigation.

Abstract = {{Recent urban development along the US coasts has negatively impacted the
   local environment, and these impacts will only increase thanks to rapid
   regional population growth. Empirical spatially disaggregate land-use
   models provide a way to explore future conditions and environmental
   impacts before irreversible changes occur. An assumption of many models
   is that access to urban-employment centers is the major factor locating
   urban uses within a region, the opposite of the pattern seen in most
   natural amenity rich areas. As a result, it is unclear whether models
   focusing on center accessibility can be used to predict future land-use
   patterns in urbanizing coastal regions. In this paper the relationship
   between accessibility and the location of urban development was examined
   for coastal New Jersey, USA. Two questions were addressed through the
   analysis: (1) Is accessibility to urban or employment centers correlated
   with the location of urban conversions? (2) If accessibility is
   correlated with the location of urban conversion, does the inclusion of
   such variables into a land-use-change model improve the ability of the
   model to locate future urban development? Results from the analysis
   indicate that traditional accessibility relationships can be used to
   explain the location of urban conversions in New Jersey's coastal
   region, but inclusion of accessibility and other locating factors does
   not necessarily improve the predictive ability of a model. The
   accessibility relationship is contrary to findings in many other
   high-amenity areas, because, in part, of the importance of access to the
   region's transportation network.}},

Abstract = {{Handling taconite pellets produces dust. As the pellets are transported,
   they abrade and produce a fine material that represents a concern for
   airborne dust. Pellet-breakdown studies revealed that as much as 43\%
   (by weight) of the fine particles were 10 pm in diameter and smaller
   (material regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency). This
   is a significant amount of material that represents a concern for dust
   emissions; therefore, a dust suppressant is needed, Water is the most
   common dust suppressant used to prevent fines from becoming airborne. To
   effectively suppress dust, the material must wet well and must remain
   wet. Surfactants, hygroscopic materials and binders are additives that
   address at least one of these concerns. Evaluating the wetting behavior
   of the iron ore revealed that the pellets were highly hydrophilic
   (contact angles less than 30 degrees). The wetting kinetics of fine
   particles were increased 99\% using acetyletic glycol surfactants, which
   demonstrated that these surfactants greatly improved wettability.
   However, in dust-suppression studies using a drop tower that simulated
   dust generation in a plant, surfactants did not reduce airborne dust.
   This indicated that ease of wetting was not the primary problem in
   suppressing taconite dust. In contrast, hygroscopic materials (that
   prevent moisture from evaporating) and tall oil pitch (a nonhygroscopic
   binder) reduced airborne dust by as much as 58\%.}},

Abstract = {{Major burns still continue to pose problems of inadequate auto skin
   closure. Patients suffering severe burns lack adequate skin graft donor
   site. We present the results of 17 major adult and pediatric burns that
   we applied close relative intermingled skin allograft and autograft in
   the course of treatment. The extent of burn injury ranged from 40\%-70\%
   total body surface are (TBSA). Seven patients survived and 10 patients
   died. Mean percent TBSA of the dead and surviving patients were 55.5 +/-
   11.16 (range, 40-70) and 55.0 +/- 4.08 (range, 50-60) respectively. Mean
   age of the dead and surviving patients were 16.1 +/- 13.77 (range, 2-42)
   and 11.1 +/- 6.74 (range, 2-21), respectively. We present a safe and
   satisfactory means of effective alternative treatment to resurface major
   burns in case of limited auto skin graft donor site without exposure to
   bacteria, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis virus when
   keratinocyte culture facilities and skin banks are not available.}},

Abstract = {{The processes controlling the abundances of species across multiple

   the relative importance of local environmental and regional spatial

   I showed that approximately 50\% of the variation in community
   composition is explained by both environmental and spatial variables.
   The majority of the data sets were structured by species-sorting
   dynamics (SS), followed by a combination of SS and mass-effect dynamics.
   While neutral processes were the only structuring process in 8\% of the
   collected natural communities, disregarding neutral dispersal processes
   would result in missing important patterns in 37\% of the studied
   communities. Moreover, metacommunity characteristics such as dispersal
   type, habitat type and spatial scale predicted part of the detected
   variation in metacommunity structure.}},

Abstract = {{The metabotropic glutamate 5 receptor (mGlu5) receptor has been
   implicated as having a role in pain modulation, anxiety, and depression,
   as well as drug-seeking behavior. In the present study, we examined the
   effect of the selective mGlu5 receptor antagonist
   3-{[}(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]-pyridine (MTEP) on operant
   ethanol self-administration by two strains of rats, the Fawn-Hooded (FH)
   rat and the inbred alcohol-preferring (iP) rat. MTEP (2 mg/kg i.p.)
   caused a significant reduction in responding for ethanol by both strains
   of rats; however, in the iP rats, MTEP also induced apparent sedation at
   this dose, although still reduced alcohol responding at lower doses.
   Chronic MTEP (2 mg/kg/day) caused a significant reduction in ethanol
   consumption by FH rats in a two-bottle preference test; however, chronic
   treatment with this dose had no effect on anxiety-like behavior or
   depressive-like behavior in FH rats, suggesting the dose used was
   subthreshold for anxiolytic or antidepressive-like effects. Finally,
   repeated dosing with MTEP (2 mg/kg i.p.) caused significant reductions
   in expression of the mRNA encoding the NR1 subunit of the N-methyl-D-
   aspartate receptor and the GluR2 subunit of the
   alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate receptor in the
   cingulate cortex. A significant decrease in NR1 expression also occurred
   in the piriform cortex. Chronic MTEP also caused a significant decrease
   in mGlu5 gene expression and a significant increase in dopamine
   transporter and dopamine D-2-like receptor binding within the olfactory
   tubercle. Collectively, these data suggest that MTEP can reduce
   alcohol-seeking behavior in different rodent models of alcoholism, and
   this effect is associated with regulation of cortical glutamate systems,
   particularly those in olfactory-related regions.}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{To illustrate his theory of coronal heating, Parker initially considers
   the problem of disturbing a homogeneous vertical magnetic field that is
   line-tied across two infinite horizontal surfaces. It is argued that, in
   the absence of resistive effects, any perturbed equilibrium must be
   independent of z. As a result random footpoint perturbations give rise
   to magnetic singularities, which generate strong Ohmic heating in the
   case of resistive plasmas. More recently these ideas have been
   formalized in terms of a magneto-static theorem but no formal proof has
   been provided. In this paper we investigate the Parker hypothesis by
   formulating the problem in terms of the fluid displacement. We find
   that, contrary to Parker's assertion, well-defined solutions for
   arbitrary compressibility can be constructed which possess non-trivial
   z-dependence. In particular, an analytic treatment shows that
   small-amplitude Fourier disturbances violate the symmetry partial
   derivative(z) = 0 for both compact and non-compact regions of the (x, y)
   plane. Magnetic relaxation experiments at various levels of gas pressure
   confirm the existence and stability of the Fourier mode solutions. More
   general footpoint displacements that include appreciable shear and twist
   are also shown to relax to well-defined non-singular equilibria. The
   implications for Parker's theory of coronal heating are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Completion of Tropheryma whipplei genome sequencing may provide insights
   into the evolution of the molecular mechanisms underlying the
   pathogenicity of this microorganism. The first postgenomic application
   was the successful design of a comprehensive culture medium that allows
   axenic growth of this bacterium, which is particularly recalcitrant to
   cultivation. This achievement in turn permitted analysis of T. whipplei
   RNA without contaminating eukaryotic nucleic acids. To obtain
   high-quality RNA, several extraction methods were compared, but under
   all conditions tested an atypical profile was observed. By using a
   Northern blot assay we demonstrated that an insertion sequence
   previously described in T. whipplei 23S rRNA is in fact an intervening
   sequence excised during maturation. This cleavage could involve an RNase
   III identified in the genome of this microorganism. Among the bacteria
   with a 23S rRNA insertion sequence, T. whipplei is the only
   gram-positive microorganism. We present phylogenetic evidence that this
   mobile genetic element was acquired by lateral gene transfer from
   another enteric bacterium.}},

Abstract = {{In Sicily, the increasing scarcity of quality water is leading to
   irrigation with saline water in soils having a considerable
   susceptibility to cracking. Irrigation systems involving high
   application rates are used in these irrigated areas, and bypass flow
   during irrigation is thus prevalent. Adoption of management practices
   accounting for cracking is therefore necessary to prevent salinization
   and land degradation. In this paper, water flow and solute transport in
   a Sicilian cracking soil irrigated with saline water was simulated by
   using the soil-water-atmosphere-plant environment (SWAP) model, and the
   simulated results compared with measured values of soil moisture and
   salinity. The soil hydraulic parameters were obtained by inverse method
   based on multi-step outflow experiments, adopting two different sets of
   hydraulic parameters/functions, that is, (i) the van Genuchten-Mualem,
   (VGM model) and (ii) the Brutsaert retention equation coupled with the
   hydraulic conductivity model proposed by Gardner (B-G model). The
   results obtained using field measurements from four soil profiles of a
   cracking clay soil showed that SWAP provided accurate predictions of
   water content, 0, when the soil hydraulic properties were expressed
   according to the B-G model. Using the B-G hydraulic
   parameters/functions, the model was calibrated with reference to the
   dispersivity (L-dis). A calibration value of about 20 cm was found for
   the four different profiles. In the conditions occurring in the Sicilian
   area where we are focusing our attention, the predictive errors
   associated with the simulated ECsat, can be considered acceptable if the
   purpose of application is to predict the influence of salinity on crop
   yield.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted the current study to evaluate the cases of fever of unknown
   origin (FUO) admitted in our institution during the 10 years between
   1991 and 2001 and to compare the patients diagnosed as having
   adult-onset Still disease (AOSD) with the patients with FUO due to other
   diagnoses. We performed a case-control study and analyzed 26 patients
   with AOSD and 135 patients with FUO due to other diseases. Controls were
   classified into I of 4 groups: 1. Infections diseases; 2. Malignant
   conditions; 3. Autoimmune diseases; 4. No diagnosis. Differences between
   groups were evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Odds ratios (OR)
   were calculated by multiple logistic regression analyses.
   Patients with AOSD were younger than controls. Arthritis (OR, 8.6; 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI], 1.5-49.1; p = 0.014), pharyngitis (OR, 6.9;
   95\% CI, 1.5-30.2; p = 0.010), splenomegaly (OR, 5.4; 95\% CI, 1.1-26.7;
   p = 0.039), and neutrophilic leukocytosis (OR, 18.1; 95\% CI, 3.5-93.6;
   p = 0.001) were significantly more common in patients with AOSD than in
   the control groups. A clinical scale that identifies patients with AOSD
   was designed. It proved to be highly specific (approximate to 98\%),
   with predictive values greater than 90\%.
   AOSD is a defined clinical entity. In most cases, it is clinically
   distinguishable from other causes of FUO. We propose a clinical scale as
   a tool to identify patients whose disease can be diagnosed based on
   clinical grounds without the need of long, costly diagnostic procedures.}},

Abstract = {{Iron-deficiency remains a concern among low-income toddlers in the U.S.
   This formative study describes how primary care providers serving
   high-risk 1- to 3-year-old children in an urban ambulatory care setting
   approach anemia. Data collection included a retrospective review of
   randomly selected medical records (n=264) and semi-structured interviews
   with clinicians (n=41). Thirty-eight percent of the children presented
   with anemia (Hgb < 11.0 g/dl) at least once between 12 and 36 months of
   age. just under half of these children were treated for anemia.
   Follow-up laboratories for iron-treated children were completed within
   35 days in 16\% of cases (median: 3 months). Interviews identified four
   key themes (iron-deficiency, communication, poverty, system) running
   through the two major categories of prevention and treatment. Treatment
   cut-points were variable. While providers felt clinically comfortable
   with anemia, they felt burdened and challenged by follow-up.
   Communication and system barriers weighed most heavily on perceived
   treatment outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Since the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, Americans
   have been faced difficult choices about how to balance concerns over
   safety and security with issues of human rights and international
   cooperation during the War on Terror. We hypothesized that two
   individual difference factors, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and
   social dominance orientation (SDO), would be significantly related to
   attitudes toward human rights, support for going to war with Iraq,
   desire for the United States to leave the United Nations, and
   endorsement of George W. Bush as President. Results of our study largely
   supported these and other predicted associations. Multiple regression
   analyses revealed that while RWA significantly predicted each of the
   aforementioned attitudes, SDO only accounted for additional variance in
   the prediction of human rights attitudes. Our findings suggest that
   although RWA and SDO are related psychological phenomena, they represent
   unique influences on socio-political attitudes. Them two factors
   together may be useful in the study of Americans' reactions to national
   tragedy. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Based on the short-term results of the AIDS Clinical Trials
   Group (ACTG) A5095 trial, zidovudine (ZDV)/lamivudine (3TC)/abacavir
   (ABC) is no longer recommended as a first-line antiretroviral regimen.
   Data on the efficacy of this triple nucleoside reverse transcriptase
   inhibitor (NRTI) combination compared with the gold-standard
   nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) regimen could
   provide important information.
   Methods Patients were selected from three prospective cohorts of
   patients who received first-line therapy with ZDV/3TC plus an NNRTI or
   ABC, started after January 1998. Immunovirological changes and the
   proportion of treatment discontinuations were compared between groups.
   Results Of the 380 patients, 190 started on ABC {[}the triple-NRTI group
   (3N)] and 190 on NNRTI. At baseline, there was no statistical difference
   between the NNRTI and 3N groups for age (mean = 38 years), sex (66\%
   male) or CD4 cell count (mean = 305 cells/mu L). Mean baseline plasma
   HIV-1 viral load (pVL) was higher in the 3N group (4.6 vs. 4.3 log(10)
   HIV-1 RNA copies/mL: P < 0.01). Lower and higher estimates of median pVL
   decrease at month 24 were 2.05 and 4.76 log(10) copies/mL in the 3N
   group, and 1.73 and 4.31 log(10) copies/mL in the NNRTI group (not
   significant). CD4 cell count evolution did not differ between groups.
   Treatment discontinuation occurred in 45\% vs. 44\% of patients in the
   NNRTI and 3N groups, respectively, after median durations of 9 and 4
   months, respectively (P = 0.02).
   Conclusions In this prospective cohort, 3N and NNRTI regimens as
   first-line therapy produced similar immunovirological responses.}},

Abstract = {{In the ant Pachycondyla villosa, new colonies are usually started
   cooperatively by two or more young queens who establish a dominance
   order with a division of labour. Co-founding can lead to primary
   polygyny, where queens stay together after workers have emerged. Here we
   show that two queens associations are the most common (47\%) and also
   the most stable in the field. When offered additional nest sites in the
   laboratory, two-queen associations did not split, whereas larger
   associations did so. We also show that solitary foundresses always
   accepted experimentally introduced alien queens, while these were
   attacked and sometimes killed in queen associations. The removal of
   dominant alpha queens from three-queen associations resulted in beta
   queens obtaining the dominant role and sometimes the destruction of the
   existing eggs. It appears that two queens suffice for a successful
   association and that pleometrosis is favoured by ecological constrains,
   such as nest-site limitation.}},

Abstract = {{Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis is a fulminant infection of the
   human central nervous system caused by Naegleria fowleri, a free-living
   amoeba that thrives in artificially or naturally heated water. The
   infection usually is acquired while bathing or swimming in such waters.
   The portal of entry is the olfactory neuroepithelium. This report
   describes fatal meningoencephalitis caused by N. fowleri in Holstein
   cattle that consumed untreated surface water in an area of California
   where summer temperatures at times exceed 42 degrees C. In the summers
   of 1998 and 1999, severe multifocal necrosuppurative hemorrhagic
   meningoencephalitis was observed in brain samples from nine
   10-20-month-old heifers with clinical histories of acute central nervous
   system disease. Olfactory lobes and cerebella were most severely
   affected. Lesions were also evident in periventricular and submeningeal
   neuropil as well as olfactory nerves. Naegleria fowleri was demonstrated
   by immunohistochemistry in brain and olfactory nerve lesions and was
   isolated from one brain. Even though cultures of drinking water did not
   yield N. fowleri, drinking water was the likely Source of the amoeba.
   The disease in cattle closely resembles primary amoebic
   meningoencephatitis in humans. Naegleria meningoencephalitis should be
   included among differential diagnoses of central nervous system disease
   in cattle during the summer season in areas with high ambient
   temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, the effect of maximal ratio combining (MRC)-based
   macrodiversity on the reverse-link and forward-link capacity in code
   division multiple access (CDMA)-distributed antenna systems is analyzed.
   The concept of virtual cell is illustrated, and the analytical outage
   probability expressions are derived. The present investigation shows
   that on the reverse link, the interference can be suppressed greatly
   with macrodiversity, which leads to a significant increase in capacity.
   However, on the forward-link, it is proven that if simulcasting is used
   in CDMA-distributed antenna systems, the forward-link capacity cannot
   increase with macrodiversity whatever power allocation scheme is
   adopted. Based on the analysis of the cause of capacity loss, a new
   transmission scheme is further presented and the optimal power
   allocation scheme is derived. If is shown that, in this case, the
   forward-link capacity increases rapidly with the number of involved
   distributed antennas.}},

Abstract = {{beta-Catenin is a component of the E-cadherin-catenin cell adhesion
   complex. It plays all important role in the Wnt/wg pathway, which
   conveys critical signals for cell proliferation and transformation. The
   beta-catenin mutation is all important event in the progression of a
   number of malignancies. In this study, we evaluated the
   immunohistochemical (IHC) pattern of beta-catenin in a spectrum of
   mesothelial lesions. Sixty-five formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks
   from 54 serious effusions and 11 pleural biopsies were examined. These
   cases consisted of 33 invasive mesotheliomas, 9 early mesotheliomas
   (with negative radiologic finding), so-called mesotheliomas in situ, and
   23 reactive mesothelial proliftrations. A distinct membranous and/or
   submembranous staining pattern was seen in 23 cases with normal and
   reactive mesothelium. In contrast, reduced membranous and/or
   submembranous antibody staining and markedly increased ectopic
   cytoplasmic and nuclear staining was seen in 26 cases of 33
   mesotheliomas. Seven of 9 early mesotheliomas showed increased ectopic
   Cytoplasmic and/or nuclear stain. Oil the basis of our findings,
   identification of beta-catenin staining pattern offers a usefal marker
   in the diagnosis of mesothelial lesions and may help identify neoplastic

Abstract = {{Milk samples were acidified with different amounts of
   glucono-delta-lactone (GDL) and samples of permeates were collected
   rapidly by ultrafiltration at intervals during acidification. Calcium
   contents of these sera were measured to define the extent and rate of
   dissociation of micellar calcium phosphate. In parallel samples,
   measurements were made of the ultrasonic velocity and the ultrasonic
   attenuation of milks and permeates. This allowed the establishment of a
   complete profile of the changing mineral distribution of milk and
   changes in ultrasonic properties, as functions of pH. The results showed
   that changes in both of ultrasonic parameters depended almost completely
   on changes in composition of milk serum, and that states of casein
   micelles made little contribution. This makes ultrasound an excellent
   method for following the release of calcium and the progress of
   acidification in milks. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Staphylococcal gamma-hemolysins are bicomponent toxins forming a protein
   family with leucocidins and Cc-toxin. Two active toxins (AB and CB) can
   be formed combining one of the class-S components, HI-A or HlgC, with
   the class-F component HlgB. These two gamma-hemolysins form pores with
   marked similarities to a-toxin in terms of conductance, nonlinearity of
   the current-voltage curve, and channel stability in the open state. AB
   and CB pores, however, are cation-selective, whereas a-toxin is
   anion-selective. gamma-Hemolysins' pores are hetero-oligomers formed by
   three or four copies of each component (indicated as 3A3B and 3C3B or
   4A4B and 4C4B). Point mutants located on a P-strand of the class-S
   component that forms part of the protomer-protomer contact region can
   prevent oligomer assembly. Interestingly, these Mutants inhibit growth
   of pores formed not only by their natural components but also by
   nonstandard components. This lead to the hypothesis that mixed ABC pores
   could also be formed. By studying the conductance of pores, assembled in
   the presence of all three components (in different ratios), it was
   observed that the magnitudes expected for mixed pores were, indeed,
   present. We conclude that the gamma-hemolysin/leucocidin bicomponent
   toxin family may form a larger than expected number of active toxins by
   cross-combining various S and F components.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{291-299}},

Abstract = {{Aims: The purpose of this paper is to report the findings of an
   exploratory study designed to test a portion of the Theory of
   Collaborative Decision-Making in Nursing Practice for Triads by
   examining the relation between types of decisions and formation of
   coalitions during triadic interactions among older home healthcare
   clients, their caregivers and home healthcare nurses during seven
   admission visits for home health care.
   Background: Although home healthcare nurses include clients and family
   members in decision-making about care, few publications address the
   nature of interactions among triads of clients, caregivers and nurses in
   home health care and the association between decision-making and those
   interactions.
   Method: The data presented in this paper are a secondary analysis of
   data originally collected in 1994. The sample included 157
   decision-making situations identified from interactions of seven triads
   of older home healthcare clients, their caregivers and nurses.
   Qualitative data were collected by participant observation and
   audio-recording of admission visit interactions among clients,
   caregivers and nurses. Content analysis, augmented by Ethnograph
   software, was used to analyse the data.
   Findings: Coalitions were evident in just eight of the 157
   decision-making situations. All of the theoretically possible types of
   nursing care decisions (programme, operational control, agenda) were
   observed. Each coalition involved one nursing care decision; two
   coalitions formed in one triad. Seven coalitions formed between nurse
   and caregiver against client during two programme and five operational
   control decisions. One coalition formed between client and caregiver
   against nurse during an agenda decision. No coalitions formed between
   client and nurse against caregiver.
   Conclusion: Although the study sample was small, the findings expand
   understanding of the relation between types of decisions and formation
   of coalitions during triadic interactions in home health care, and
   provided empirical support for a portion of the Theory of Collaborative
   Decision-Making in Nursing Practice for Triads.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine age-specific upper limit of normal (ULN) values
   of the ASO and ADB titres in children aged 4-14 years in urban
   Melbourne. Serology is often used to diagnose a preceding Streptococcus
   pyogenes infection, particularly in potential cases of rheumatic fever
   and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. The most commonly used
   antigens are antistreptolysin O (ASO) and antideoxyribonuclease B (ADB).
   Reference ranges used in Australia for these serological markers are
   usually based on data in adults from other countries. There are no
   age-specific reference values for Australian children.
   Methods: Sixty-six sera from children with no history of recent
   streptococcal infection were obtained in May-June 2002. The children
   were divided into three age groups for analysis: 4-5 (n = 20), 6-9 (n =
   19) and 10-14 (n = 25) years. The geometric mean titre and ULN (defined
   as the 80th percentile) for the ASO and ADB titres for each age group
   were determined in both international and log units.
   Results: The ULN for ASO titres in each age group was 120 (2.08 log
   units), 480 (2.68) and 320 (2.51). The ULN for ADB titres in each age
   group was 100 (2.00 log units), 400 (2.60) and 380 (2.58).
   Conclusion: The ASO and ADB ULN values in school-aged children are
   higher than the current reference ranges suggest.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this report was to describe our experience with creating an
   interatrial communication by stenting the interatrial septum. In many
   forms of congenital heart disease, the presence of an appropriate
   interatrial shunt is critical. After the first several weeks of life,
   balloon atrial septostomy is not effective, and success with other
   methods is limited. Clinical records, echocardiograms, and
   catheterization data in patients who had an atrial septal stent placed
   between 2001 and 2004 at UCLA were reviewed. Changes in atrial pressures
   and systemic saturations were analyzed. Follow-up data and explant
   pathology were reviewed as available. Thirteen patients had stenting of
   the atrial septum (four restrictive, nine nonrestrictive). In patients
   with elevated right and left atrial pressures, there was a mean
   reduction of 2.4 and 7.4 mm Hg in right atria{[} and left atrial
   pressures, respectively. In patients with transposition physiology,
   there was a mean increase in oxygen saturation of 11.3\%. Follow-up
   echocardiograms revealed patent stents with excellent position relative
   to the atrial septum. In six cases, the stents were removed during
   subsequent surgery and appeared endothelialized and patent. Stenting of
   the atrial septum is safe and effective in selected cases, allowing for
   a reliable, long-lasting, restrictive or nonrestrictive interatrial
   communication. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This paper compares, in a polluting oligopoly, an emission tax and a
   form of environmental policy called voluntary agreement (VA). Here there
   are two ways of reducing pollution: output contraction and end-of-pipe
   abatement. Given the imperfect competition, firms' reaction to the tax
   is sub-optimal. They reduce output excessively in order to raise the
   price and do not abate enough. The VA is a take-it-or-leave-it contract
   on abatement effort, offered to the firms with the threat of a tax. It
   has a limited effect on output and always allows higher abatement than
   the tax. We find that this kind of VA may be more efficient than the tax
   in a concentrated industry, when pollution is not too harmful and when
   the abatement technology is rather efficient and cheadp.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Recent experimental evidence suggests that the neointimal
   proliferation seen in cardiac allograft vasculopathy may in part derive
   from recipient progenitor cells. The effect of cyclosporine on these
   circulating progenitors in the setting of cardiac transplantation is
   currently unknown.
   Methods: Three surgical series were performed: sham operation alone,
   sham operation with immunosuppression, and heterotopic porcine cardiac
   transplantation with immunosuppression. The sham operation involved
   laparotomy and consecutive clamping of the abdominal aorta and inferior
   vena cava. Post-operative immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine at
   therapeutic levels (100 -300 ng/ml) and 0.5 mg/kg methylprednisolone.
   Endothelial outgrowth colony numbers (EOCCFU) and smooth muscle
   outgrowth colony numbers (SOCCFU) were quantified weekly for 4 weeks
   post-operatively. A series of in vitro experiments were performed to
   determine the effect of cyclosporine on the differentiation, migration,
   and proliferation of EOCs and SOCs.
   Results: In the sham alone series there were no changes to either EOCCFU
   or SOCCFU. In the sham with immunosuppression and the transplant series,
   both EOCCFU and SOCCFU fell in the first 2 weeks (p < 0.05) compared
   with baseline (EOCCFU, 3.4 +/- 0.6; SOCCFU, 11.1 +/- 2.8). EOCCFU
   recovered at 4 weeks to above baseline levels in the sham
   immunosuppression group only (15.2 +/- 3.9; p = 0.01). SOCCFU showed no
   recovery in the immunosupprcssion groups. Cyclosporine, even at a low
   dose, prevented differentiation, inhibited proliferation, and attenuated
   migration of both EOCs and SOCs.
   Conclusion: Immunosuppression in the setting of cardiac transplantation
   causes a profound reduction in circulating progenitor cells capable of
   differentiating into endothelial and smooth muscle cells. This effect
   can in part be explained by the inhibitory effects of cyclosporine on
   progenitor growth and differentiation seen in this study. J Heart Lung

Abstract = {{A prospective screening program, including CT, autofluorescent
   bronchoscopy, biopsies and bronchial lavage (BL) collection, was
   initiated with the specific goal of identifying biomarkers for the early
   detection of non-small cell lung cancer. We report and discuss the
   results of p16, DAPK, MGMT, FHIT and APC methytation analysis in the 126
   first patients: 77 at high risk of cancer and 49 followed up after
   primary cancer resection.
   Positive results were found in 49\% of BLs, 53\% in current smokers and
   43\% in former smokers. In presence of peripheral tumours, only 38\% of
   BLs were abnormal versus 73\% in presence of central tumours, 50\% in
   presence of preneoplasic lesions and 47\% in absence of lesions. FHIT
   methytation was an early event, observed in one-third of the BLs from
   patients with or without lesions as well as in tumours. APC methylation
   was a late event observed in 33\% of tumours but rarely in BLs. p16 was
   methylated in 17\% of BLs but in 48\% of tumours; DAPK in 15\% of BL and
   22\% of tumours. MGMT methylation was rare. Among patients followed up
   after, cancer surgery, 14 were in remission with normalised BL, whereas
   three had positive BLs. and relapsed with a central tumour.
   Thus, gene methylation in BL might help to detect central tumors but a
   CT is crucial for peripheral cancer detection. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland

   There is a dorsoventral asymmetry, with dorsal cells being larger than
   ventral cells at equal distances from the streak. The peak value for
   cell density of 281 +/- 28 cells/mm(2) occurs in the center of the
   visual streak, decreasing toward the dorsal and ventral retinal
   periphery, paralleling the increase in dendritic-field size. Along the
   visual streak, the decline in cell density is less pronounced, remaining
   between 100-200 cells/mm(2) in the temporal and nasal periphery.
   Displaced horizontal cells are rare and occur in the retinal periphery.
   They tend to be smaller than normally placed horizontal cells in the
   ventral region, whilst no systematic difference was observed between the
   two cell groups in the dorsal region. Mosaic regularity was studied
   using nearest-neighbor analysis and the Ripley function. When mosaic
   regularity was determined removing the displaced horizontal cells, there
   was a slight increase in the conformity ratio, but the bivariate Ripley
   function indicated some repulsive dependence between the two mosaics.
   Both results were near the level of significance. A similar analysis
   performed in the capybara retina, a closely related hystricomorph rodent
   bearing a higher density of displaced horizontal cells than found in the
   agouti, suggested spatial independence between the two mosaics, normally
   placed versus displaced horizontal cells.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The value of exercise-induced ST-segment depression for the
   prognostic evaluation of patients with I mm of ST depression or greater
   on the resting electrocardiogram is controversial.
   Methods and Results. Patients who underwent exercise myocardial
   perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (MPS) and had
   resting ST depression of I mm or greater with a nondiagnostic exercise
   electrocardiographic response (n = 1122) were followed up for 3.4 +/-
   2.3 years. Those with paced rhythm, pre-excitation, left bundle branch
   block, or myocardial revascularization within the first 60 days after
   MPS were excluded. Additional exercise-induced ST-segment depression was
   considered significant if >= 2 mm MPS was scored semiquantitatively by
   use of a 20-segment model of the left ventricle; the percentage of
   myocardium involved with stress defects (\% myo) was derived by
   normalizing to the maximal possible score of 80. Hard events were
   defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiac death. A Cox
   analysis was used to determine independent predictors of hard events
   among clinical, exercise, and nuclear variables. Hard event rates
   increased as a function of \% myo for either patients with
   exercise-induced ST depression (1.4\%/y for normal MPS vs 4.1\%/y for \%
   myo > 10\%, P < .03) or those without it (0.7\%/y for normal MPS vs
   3.0\%/y for \% myo > 10\%, P = .0001). Age, diabetes mellitus, shortness
   of breath as the presenting symptom, and \% myo were independent
   predictors of hard events. Exercise-induced ST depression was predictive
   of hard events only when it was 3 mm or greater. The presence and extent
   of perfusion defects, reflected in the \% myo, had incremental
   prognostic value over clinical variables and also over all degrees of
   exercise-induced ST depression.
   Conclusions. Although MPS effectively risk-stratifies patients with
   resting ST depression of I mm or greater, the prognostic value of
   exercise-induced ST depression is limited in these patients, with a
   small added risk when severe (>= 3 mm).}},

Abstract = {{Like various other diurnal birds of prey, the world's largest eagle, the
   Harpy (Harpia harpyja), presents an atypical bird karyotype with 2n=58
   chromosomes. There is little knowledge about the dramatic changes in the
   genomic reorganization of these species compared to other birds. Since
   recently, the chicken provides a ``default map{''} for various birds
   including the first genomic DNA sequence of a bird species. Obviously,
   the gross division of the chicken genome into relatively gene-poor
   macrochromosomes and predominantly gene-rich microchromosomes has been
   conserved for more than 150 million years in most bird species. Here, we
   present classical features of the Harpy eagle karyotype but also
   chromosomal homologies between H. harpyja and the chicken by chromosome
   painting and comparison to the chicken genome map. We used two different
   sets of painting probes: (1) chicken chromosomes were divided into three
   size categories: (a) macrochromosomes 1-5 and Z, (b) medium-sized
   chromosomes 6-10, and (c) 19 microchromosomes; (2) combinatorially
   labeled chicken chromosome paints 1-6 and Z. Both probe sets were
   visualized on H. harpyja chromosomes by multicolor fluorescence in situ
   hybridization (FISH). Our data show how the organization into micro- and
   macrochromosomes has been lost in the Harpy eagle, seemingly without any
   preference or constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: To compare the efficacy of acamprosate (ACP) and disulfiram (DSF)
   for preventing alcoholic relapse in routine clinical practice. Methods:
   One hundred alcoholic men with family members who would encourage
   medication compliance and accompany them for follow-up were randomly
   allocated to 8 months of treatment with DSF or ACP. Weekly group
   psychotherapy was also available. The psychiatrist, patient, and family
   member were aware of the treatment prescribed. Alcohol consumption,
   craving, and adverse events were recorded weekly for 3 months and then
   fortnightly. Serum gamma glutamyl transferase was measured at the start
   and the end of the study. Results: At the end of the trial, 93 patients
   were still in contact. Relapse (the consumption of > 5 drinks/40 g of
   alcohol) occurred at a mean of 123 days with DSF compared to 71 days
   with ACP (P = 0.0001). Eighty-eight per cent of patients on DSF remained
   abstinent compared to 46\% with ACP (P = 0.0002). However, patients
   allocated to ACP had lower craving than those on DSF (P = 0.002).
   Conclusion: DSF is superior to ACP for preventing relapse in
   alcohol-dependent men with good family support. Further comparisons
   between these two drugs in different treatment settings and populations
   are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma is a distinctive vascular neoplasm
   affecting predominantly children and neonates. In neonates it needs to
   be differentiated from common infantile hemangioma and other vascular
   lesions of infancy. Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma immunoreacts with
   vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3, and partial lymphothelial
   differentiation of this lesion has been suggested. D2-40 has been
   recently proposed as a selective marker of lymphatic endothelium. We
   performed immunohistochemical analysis with the D2-40 antibody on 24
   kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and 48 other pediatric vascular lesions
   including common infantile hemangioma ( n = 10), rapidly involuting
   congenital hemangioma ( n = 10), noninvoluting congenital hemangioma ( n
   = 9), verrucous hemangioma ( n = 9), and pyogenic granuloma ( n = 10) to
   define whether this marker can be applied in the diagnosis of vascular
   lesions of infancy. In all, 23 of 24 (96\%) kaposiform
   hemangioendotheliomas exhibited a distinct staining, while none of the
   other lesions immunoreacted with D2-40. D2-40 stained the neoplastic
   spindled cells and lymphatic channels adjacent to vascular lobules of
   kaposiform hemangioendothelioma. These findings support D2-40 as a new
   determinate marker for kaposiform hemangioendothelioma, useful in
   differentiating it from other vascular lesions of infancy and suggest
   lymphothelial differentiation of the neoplastic component of kaposiform
   hemangioendothelioma. Further studies are necessary to define the
   identity of the D2-40 antigen and to elucidate the biologic significance
   of its selective lymphothelial reactivity.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To study whether conservative correction in a leg-length
   discrepancy (LLD) of 10mm or less in patients with chronic low back pain
   (CLBP) can relieve pain.
   Design: Randomized, controlled intervention study, with a mean follow-up
   duration of 10 weeks.
   Setting: Physical therapy clinic of the national health services.
   Participants: Thirty-three patients with CLBP were screened for an LLD
   of 10mm or less, which was measured with ultrasound. Patients were
   randomly divided into intervention and control groups.
   Intervention: In 22 patients, LLD was corrected by applying individually
   fitted shoe inserts. In 11 patients, LLD was not corrected.
   Main Outcome Measures: Chronic pain intensity (visual analog scale) and
   disability score (Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire).
   Results: Shoe inserts significantly reduced both pain intensity (P<001)
   and disability (P<.05). A moderate positive correlation was found
   between LLD and the degree of pain relief after wearing shoe inserts
   (r=.47).
   Conclusions: Shoe inserts appear to reduce CLBP and functional
   disability in patients with LLDs of 10mm or less. Shoe inserts are
   simple, noninvasive, and inexpensive therapeutic means that can be added
   to the treatment of CLBP.}},

Abstract = {{A novel artificial neural network (SYNTHESIS-ANN) is presented, which
   has been designed for computationally intensive problems and applied to
   the optimization of antennas and microwave devices. The antenna example
   presented is optimized with respect to voltage standing-wave ratio,
   bandwidth, and frequency of operation. A simple microstrip transmission
   line problem is used to further describe the ANN effectiveness, in which
   microstrip line width is optimized with respect to line impedance. The
   ANNs exploit a unique number representation of input and output data in
   conjunction with a more standard neural network architecture. An ANN
   consisting of a heteroassociative memory provided a very efficient
   method of computing necessary geometrical values for the antenna when
   used in conjunction with a new randomization process. The number
   representation used provides significant insight into this new method of
   fault-tolerant computing. Further work is needed to evaluate the
   potential of this new paradigm.}},

Abstract = {{The island of Gran Canaria was inhabited in pre-Hispanic times by people
   of North African origin who arrived on the island towards the second
   half of the first millennium BC. In previous studies, we reported that
   there are some differences between the coastal inhabitants from Gran
   Canaria, mainly buried in tumuli, and those from the central mountains,
   mainly buried in caves. For example, the prevalence of auricular
   exostoses is higher among the population interred in coastal tumuli when
   compared with the inland population. This finding may be explained by
   the practice of marine activities, as supported by chroniclers' reports,
   by archaeological data, and by bone trace-element analysis, which point
   to a more intense consumption of marine products by the inhabitants of
   the coastal regions. Dental caries epidemiology is one of the most
   important ways in which the diet of past populations can be
   reconstructed. The purpose of this study is to assess the prevalence and
   intensity among the pre-Hispanic population of Gran Canaria, in order to
   increase our knowledge about the dietary habits of these people, and to
   search for differences among the population buried in caves and that
   buried in tumuli. We studied a total of 791 individuals. Sex was
   estimated in 561 cases, and age at death, following Brothwell's
   criteria, in 549. We found that 66.95\% of individuals buried in caves
   and 58.91\% of those buried in tumuli showed at least one carious
   lesion. The proportion of carious teeth was significantlty higher among
   the population buried in caves (median = 15.71\%, interquartile range
   (IR) = 0-33.33\%) than among the population buried in tumuli (median =
   6.25\%, IR = 0-20\%, P = 0.001). Type of burial is the main factor
   associated with the proportion of carious teeth. These data suggest that
   the population buried in caves had a different dietary pattern from that
   of those buried in tumuli.}},

Abstract = {{Although subject protection is the cornerstone of medical ethics, when
   considered in the context of research using emergency exception from
   informed consent, its success is debatable. The participants of a
   breakout session at the 2005 Academic Emergency Medicine Consensus
   Conference discussed the issues surrounding subject protection and
   advanced the following recommendations. 1) There are no outcome measures
   that define ``protection{''}; therefore, it is not currently known
   whether or not subjects are protected under the current rules. 2) Care
   must be taken to protect not only the individual from harm during
   research but also to protect society from unregulated research in other
   countries and an inability to appropriately advance medical knowledge.
   3) Some surrogate markers/methods of protection whose efficacies are
   debatable include data safety monitoring board activity, the community
   consultation and public notification (CC/PN) process, and institutional
   review board approval. 4) Minimal-risk studies should be held to
   different standards of protection than those that involve more
   significant risk to the subject. 5) A handful of studies have been
   published regarding community consultation and notification, and the
   majority are case studies. Those that are specifically designed to
   discover the most successful methods are hindered by a lack of formal
   outcomes measures and tend to have negative results. 6) Followup data
   from the CC/PN process should be disclosed to the Food and Drug
   Administration and incorporated into study designs. 7) Focus groups
   and/or random-digit dialing have been suggested as promising methods for
   fulfilling the CC/PN requirements. 8) Studies need to be funded and
   performed that formally investigate the best means of CC ON. 9) More
   funding for this research should be a priority in the emergency medicine
   and critical care communities. More data regarding terminated studies
   should be made available to the research community. 10) Quantifiable
   markers of success for CC/PN must be validated so that research may
   determine the most successful methods. 11) Data regarding subjects' and
   family members' experiences with exception from informed consent studies
   need to be obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Schisandraceae are traditionally subdivided in two genera, Schisandra
   and Kadsura, based on differences in the organisation of the floral
   receptacle, the carpels, and the presence or absence of a
   ``pseudostigma''. Recently, phylogenetic analyses utilizing ITS sequence
   data and morphological data resulted in incongruent tree topologies,
   with the morphological trees suggesting monophyly of the two genera,
   whereas ITS trees did not resolve Schisandra and Kadsura as monophyletic
   clades. In the present paper we study seed morphology and leaf epidermal
   features of 22 species of Schisandraceae in order to provide additional
   data for a morphological data matrix. Seed morphological characters are
   highly homoplastic and do not yield further evidence for monophyly of
   the two genera. Instead, a number of characters appear to support sister
   group relationships between taxa within the genera, such as, for
   instance, for K. coccinea and K. scandens, both of which have large
   seeds along with a multi-layered mesotesta. Considering leaf epidermal
   characteristics, species of Kadsura were found to be consistently
   amphistomatic, whereas species of Schisandra are always hypostomatic.
   Phylogenetic analysis using the extended data matrix resulted in weakly
   supported Kadsura and Schisandra clades with five and four
   synapomorphies indicating monophyly of Kadsura and Schisandra,
   respectively. Fossils ascribed to Schisandraceae date back to the Late
   Cretaceous. These are tri-and hexacolpate pollen types displaying a
   combination of features found in modern Schisandraceae and partly also
   in Illiciaceae. Leaf remains from this period are poorly preserved and
   difficult to ascribe to Schisandraceae because of the lack of
   synapomorphies for the family. In the Early Cainozoic, leaf and seed
   remains from North America and Europe unambiguously belong to the
   family. Seeds from the Eocene of North America show some similarities to
   the modern Schisandra glabra from North America, while fossils from
   Europe show more similarities to modern Asian species.}},

Abstract = {{We sought to compare perioperative and short-term outcomes of
   laparoscopic partial nephrectomy versus laparoscopic cryoablation in
   patients with peripheral small renal tumors. Prospectively accrued data
   of patients with a small renal tumor (<= 3 cm) undergoing laparoscopic
   partial nephrectomy (group 1, n = 153) or laparoscopic cryoablation
   (group 2, n = 78) were compared retrospectively. Patients undergoing
   laparoscopic partial nephrectomy were younger (mean age, 60.6 vs 65.6
   years; P = 0.005), healthier (American Society of Anesthesiologists
   class 3/4 present in 46\% vs 75\%; P = 0.001), had a lower baseline
   serum creatinine (90.1 vs 106.0 mu mol/L {[}1.02 vs 1.2 mg/dL]; P =
   0.01), a larger tumor size (2.3 vs 2.1 cm; P = 0.02), and fewer cases of
   solitary kidneys (5\% vs 23\%; P = 0.000). Laparoscopic partial
   nephrectomy was associated with greater blood loss (211 vs 101 mL; P =
   0.000) and a higher incidence of delayed complications after hospital
   discharge (16.3\% vs 2.2\%; P = 0.01) compared with cryoablation. Both
   groups were comparable with regard to operative time (P = 0.77),
   intraoperative complications (P = 0.1), postoperative complications (P =
   0.55), hospital stay (P = 0.13), convalescence (P = 0.96), and
   postoperative serum creatinine (112.2 vs 123.7 mu mol/L {[}1.27 vs 1.4
   mg/dL]; P = 0.31). Local recurrence was detected over a mean follow-up
   time of 5.8 months in group 1 (0.6\%) and 24.6 months in group 2 (3\%).
   Although the technical simplicity, decreased blood loss, and somewhat
   lower complication rate are attractive features of renal cryotherapy,
   this must be balanced against the current lack of long-term follow-up
   data that are needed to confirm the oncologic adequacy of this
   developmental procedure. Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, albeit a
   technically advanced procedure, duplicates established open principles
   and has therefore evolved to become our current minimally invasive
   nephron-sparing procedure of choice in the majority of patients with a
   small renal tumor.}},

Abstract = {{The one-dimensional shock response of sandwich plates is investigated
   for the case of identical face sheets separated by a compressible foam
   core. The dynamic response of the sandwich plates is analysed for front
   face impulsive loading, and the effect of strain hardening of the core
   material is determined. For realistic ratios of core mass to face sheet
   mass, it is found that the strain hardening capacity of the core has a
   negligible effect upon the average through-thickness compressive strain
   developed within the core. Consequently, it suffices to model the core
   as an ideally plastic-locking solid. The one-dimensional response of
   sandwich plates subjected to an underwater pressure pulse is
   investigated by both a lumped parameter model and a finite element (FE)
   model. Unlike the monolithic plate case, cavitation does not occur at
   the fluid-structure interface, and the sandwich plates remain loaded by
   fluid until the end of the core compression phase. The momentum
   transmitted to the sandwich plate increases with increasing core
   strength, suggesting that weak sandwich cores may enhance the underwater
   shock resistance of sandwich plates. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Nearly 5,000 historical and contemporary specimen records of stoneflies
   (Plecoptera) from Illinois demonstrated that this fauna is highly
   imperiled, boding poorly for aquatic insect communities in North America

   extirpations of 77 total species, a rate of loss that is higher than for
   either mussels or fish in Illinois. Another 19 species (24.7\%) were
   designated as critically imperiled, being known from five or fewer
   locations. Two families, Perlidae and Perlodidae, experienced the
   greatest number of losses. Species lost were mostly those with longer
   life cycles and direct egg hatch. Three historically hyperdiverse
   regions were identified and losses in all 14 natural divisions were
   documented. Large river habitats and historically prairie regions have
   experienced the greatest proportional losses of species. This scenario
   probably follows for Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, and Odonata in the
   Midwest and in other areas with similar glacial and cultural histories.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The SOMIT trial randomized patients with idiopathic venous
   thromboembolism (IVTE) and without signs of cancer at routine medical
   examination, to extensive screening for cancer plus 2 years of follow-up
   or to just 2-year follow-up. Methods: The data of the SOMIT-trial were
   used to perform a decision analysis. The screening tests were divided in
   several possible strategies. The number of detected cancer patients and
   the number of patients investigated further for an eventually benign
   condition were calculated for each strategy. The total costs for the
   screening strategy and for each detected cancer patient were determined.
   Based on the tumor type, stage, age and gender of the individual cancer
   patient, the difference in live years gained (LYG) was calculated
   between the two study groups. Results: Computed tomography (CT) of the
   abdomen combined with sputum cytology and mammography detected 12 of the
   14 patients with cancer and had one false-positive result. In general,
   screening strategies including abdominal/pelvic ultrasonography (US) or
   tumor markers yielded a higher number of patients needed to screen in
   comparison with those using abdominal/pelvic CT. Furthermore, the
   strategies which included colonoscopy, tumor markers, and
   abdominal/pelvic US were significantly more costly, had inferior LYG and
   higher costs per LYG, when compared with strategies using
   abdominal/pelvic CT. Conclusions: Despite the limitations of this
   analysis, the screening for cancer with a strategy including
   abdominal/pelvic CT with or without mammography and/or sputum cytology
   appears potentially useful for cancer screening in patients with IVTE.
   The cost-effectiveness analysis of this strategy needs confirmation in a
   large trial.}},

Abstract = {{Potentiometric dyes are Useful tools for studying membrane potential
   changes from compartments inaccessible to direct electrical recordings.
   In the past, we have combined electrophysiological and optical
   techniques to investigate, by using absorbance and fluorescence
   potentiometric dyes.. the electrical properties of the transverse
   tubular system in amphibian skeletal muscle fibers. In this paper we
   expand on recent observations using the fluorescent potentiometric
   indicator di-8-ANEPPS to investigate structural and functional
   properties of the transverse tubular system in mammalian skeletal muscle
   fibers. Two-photon laser scanning confocal fluorescence images of live
   Muscle fibers suggest that the distance between consecutive rows of
   transverse tubules flanking the Z-lines remains relatively constant in
   Muscle fibers stretched to attain sarcomere lengths of up to 3.5 mu m.
   Furthermore, the combined use of two-microelectrode electrophysiological
   techniques with microscopic fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging
   allowed us to compare the spectral properties of di-8-ANEPPS
   fluorescence in fibers at rest, with those of fluorescence transients
   recorded in stimulated fibers. We found that although the indicator has
   excitation and emission peaks at 470 and 588 nm, respectively,
   fluorescence transients display optimal fractional changes (13\%/100 mV)
   when using filters to select excitation wavelengths in the 530-550 mn
   band and emissions beyond 590 nm. Under these conditions, results from
   tetanically stimulated fibers and from voltage-clamp experiments Suggest
   strongly that, although the kinetics of di-8-ANEPPS transients in
   mammalian fibers are very rapid and approximate those of the surface
   membrane electrical recordings, they arise from the transverse tubular
   system membranes.}},

Abstract = {{The critical time of transition to the convective mode of the
   unsteady-state evaporation of a horizontal layer of a binary solution
   into a stagnant gas is theoretically and experimentally determined. It
   is shown that the slow diffusion mode of evaporation can be destabilized
   and replaced by the convective mode if the molecular weight of one of
   the liquid components is higher than the molecular weight of the gas and
   the molecular weight of the other liquid components is lower than the
   molecular weight of the gas. The neutral stability curve of the
   diffusion mode is determined using the Navier-Stokes equation in the
   Boussinesq approximation, the continuity equation, and the convective
   diffusion equations of the evaporating components. The transition
   between the modes is faster than the molecular diffusion; therefore, the
   depth of penetration of the vapor of the light component into the gas in
   the diffusion mode can be taken as the linear scale of the phenomenon
   considered. By the Galerkin method, the neutral stability curve of the
   diffusion mode of evaporation is determined and the critical time of
   bifurcation of the mode is found as a function of the composition of an
   aqueous butanol solution. The theoretical and experimental data are in
   good agreement.}},

Title = {{Protective effects of N-acetylcysteine on the peroxidative changes of

Abstract = {{Objective: Long-term inhalation of thinners may cause damage, both to
   the lungs and to other organ systems. It causes cellular damage via
   formation of reactive oxygen species. The lung is protected from
   oxidative stress by the glutathione (GSH) antioxidant system which can
   be augmented by the thiol drug, N-acetylcysteine (NAC). This study
   investigated the protective effect of NAC on peroxidative changes in rat
   lungs exposed to inhalation of thinners for 8 weeks.
   Methodology: Seventy-two male Wistar albino rats were used and divided
   into two groups: one group inhaled only thinners (TI), while the other
   inhaled TI plus NAC. Rats in the TI and TI + NAC groups were divided
   into four subgroups (each consisting of eight rats) according to the
   duration of exposure to TI: 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks. A control group (n = 7)
   of rats inhaled neither TI nor NAC. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and GSH
   levels, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were determined in the
   lung tissues. Histopathological findings were evaluated as acute and
   chronic changes in the alveoli and interstitium in the TI and TI + NAC
   groups and compared with those in the control group.
   Results: While tissue MDA levels in the groups inhaling TI for 4, 6 and
   8 weeks were significantly higher than those in the control groups (P<
   0.01, P< 0.01, P< 0.0001, respectively), GSH levels were significantly
   lower (P< 0.05, P< 0.01, P< 0.01, respectively). Tissue SOD activities
   in the groups inhaling TI for 6 and 8 weeks were significantly lower
   than those in the control group (P< 0.05, P< 0.01, respectively). In the
   TI group, MDA levels were significantly increased (P < 0.01) with
   increasing duration of inhalation (from the second week through to the
   eighth week), while GSH levels and SOD activities were significantly
   decreased (P < 0.01, P < 0.01). Tissue MDA levels were significantly
   lower in the TI + NAC groups across all inhalation periods, when
   compared with the TI groups (P < 0.01, P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, P <
   0.0001, respectively). Tissue GSH levels in the TI + NAC groups were
   significantly higher than those of the TI groups (respective values:
   P<0.05, P<0.01, P<0.01, P< 0.0001). Tissue SOD activities in the TI +
   NAC groups were significantly higher than those of the TI groups
   (respective values: P< 0.05, P< 0.0001, P< 0.05, P< 0.0001).
   Pathological examinations with light microscopy did not show any
   beneficial effect of NAC application in terms of deferring or
   alleviating the negative effects of TI
   Conclusions: Thinners are agents that cause imbalance between oxidants
   and antioxidants produced by aerobic cellular systems. This imbalance
   between oxidant and antioxidant systems is decreased by the effect of
   NAC. However, ultrastructural studies may be needed to substantiate this
   evidence morphologically, as light microscopy was inconclusive.}},

Abstract = {{A single-stage single-switch power factor correction AC/DC converter is
   proposed in which the power factor correction (PFC) inductor is
   connedted to a tap on the primary winding of the DC/DC flyback converter
   stage; there is direct energy transfer of a part of the input energy to
   the output and theDC-bus voltage feedback. The additional discharge path
   in the PFC inductor and DC-bus voltage feedback effectively suppresses
   the DC-bus voltage and increases the overall efficiency. Experimental
   results for a 60 W converter at a constant switching frequency of 70 kHz
   are obtained to show the performance of the proposed converter. It is
   shown that the voltage across the DC-bus capacitor can be held below 405
   V even though the converter operates in a wide range of input voltages
   (90 similar to 265 V AC) and the measured input current harmonics
   satisfy the IEC 61000-3-2 Class D requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the role of the National Mental Health Strategy
   in the deinstitutionalization of patients in psychiatric hospitals in
   Queensland.
   Method: Regression analysis (using the maximum likelihood method) has
   been applied to relevant time-series datasets on public psychiatric
   institutions in Queensland. In particular, data on both patients and
   admissions per 10 000 population are analysed in detail from 1953-54 to
   the present, although data are presented from 1883-84.
   Results: These Queensland data indicate that deinstitutionalization was
   a continuing process from the 1950s to the present. However, it is clear
   that the experience varied from period to period. For example, the
   fastest change (in both patients and admissions) took place in the
   period 1953-54 to 1973-74, followed by the period 1974-75 to 1984-85.
   Conclusions: In large part, the two policies associated with
   deinstitutionalization, namely a discharge policy ('opening the back
   door') and an admission policy ('closing the front door') had been
   implemented before the advent of the National Mental Health Strategy in
   January 1993. Deinstitutionalization was most rapid in the 30-year
   period to the early 1980s: the process continued in the 1990s, but at a
   much slower rate. Deinstitutionalization was, in large part, over before
   the Strategy was developed and implemented.}},

Abstract = {{Verification and application results are presented for a new
   saturated-unsaturated 3D groundwater flow model (SU3D) developing in
   Dogan and Motz, which can be used to calculate the pressure distribution
   over the entire groundwater flow domain in response to rainfall and
   evapotranspiration. SU3D solves the nonlinear 3D, modified mixed form of
   the Richards equation continuously throughout the groundwater flow
   domain, including both the unsaturated and saturated zones. The
   block-centered finite-difference method, a modified Picard iteration
   scheme, and the preconditioned conjugate gradient method are used to
   solve the governing partial differential equations in the new model.
   SU3D can simulate evaporation from land surface and transpiration from
   the root zone. Potential evapotranspiration is partitioned into
   potential evaporation and potential transpiration as a function of the
   leaf area index; actual evaporation and actual transpiration are then
   calculated individually. As shown in this paper, SU3D has been verified
   by reproducing the results of five analytical and numerical studies and
   a 3D unconfined-aquifer pumping test from the published literature.}},

   Pliocene. The piezometric level to the east of Hafik has lowered at
   least 200 m since the Early Pliocene and 90-100 m since the Early
   Pleistocene. There is a youthful karst (doline karst) on the Higher
   Plateau (1520-1600 m) and a mature karst on Lower Plateau (1315-1420 m).
   The mature karst evolved in two stages, first stage where excessively

   Methods: Subjects underwent corneal sensitivity measurements, Schirmer
   test, tear film break-up time (BUT) assay, and fluorescein and rose
   Bengal staining of the ocular surface. Conjunctival impression cytology
   and brush cytology were also conducted. Impression cytology samples

   function and ocular surface examination parameters among patients with
   and without corneal ulceration and healthy control subjects were
   studied.
   Results: Mean corneal sensitivity and BUT values were significantly
   lower in atopic patients with corneal ulcers compared with patients
   without ulcers and controls (P < 0.001). Brush cytology specimens from
   patients with corneal ulcers revealed significantly higher expression of

Abstract = {{Objective-Myocardin is a coactivator of serum response factor (SRF)
   required for vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation. HERP1
   is a transcriptional repressor, which is abundantly expressed in
   vascular system and is known to function as a target gene of Notch.
   However, the role of HERP1 in the pathogenesis of vascular lesions
   remains unknown. The present study characterizes the expression of HERP1
   in normal and diseased vessels, and tests the hypothesis that HERP1
   inhibits SRF/myocardin-dependent SMC gene expression.
   Methods and Results-Immunohistochemistry revealed that HERP1 and
   myocardin expression was localized to SMC in the neointima of
   balloon-injured rat aorta and in human coronary atherosclerotic lesions.
   Expression of both HERP1 and myocardin was elevated in cultured VSMCs
   compared with medial SMC. Overexpressed HERP1 inhibited the
   myocardin-induced SMC marker gene expression in 10T1/2 cells. HERP1
   protein interfered with the SRF/CArG-box interaction in vivo and in
   vitro. Immunoprecipitation assays showed that HERP1 physically interacts
   with SRF.
   Conclusions-HERP1 expression was associated with the SMC proliferation
   and dedifferentiation in vitro and in vivo. HERP1 may play a role in
   promoting the phenotypic modulation of VSMCs during vascular injury and
   atherosclerotic process by interfering with SRF binding to CArG-box
   through physical association between HERP1 and SRF.}},

Abstract = {{Recently extensive work has been done towards developing methods for
   effective desynchronization of globally coupled phase oscillators (the
   Kuramoto model), by means of short stimulation pulses, or sequences of
   pulses. This is of great importance for the treatment of neurological
   disorders like Parkinson's disease and essential tremor. As a
   progressive step towards the goal of being able to apply these
   desynchronization and phase-resetting techniques medically as a form of
   treatment, we demonstrate here how these ideas can be generalized and
   applied to a network of two-dimensional phase oscillators with inertia.
   This model has been previously presented as a simplification of a neuron
   with an axon and dendrite, and can be used to account for intrinsic
   transient behavior often seen experimentally. The stimulation techniques
   originally developed for the Kuramoto model work on a network of
   globally coupled inertial phase oscillators in a qualitatively similar
   way. In both cases desynchronization can be achieved when the
   stimulation causes nearby trajectories to diverge from each other.
   However, the mechanism by which this divergence of trajectories is
   achieved, is substantially different for the network of inertial
   oscillators. In particular, the addition of inertia results in a broad
   range of transient dynamics not present in the Kuramoto model.
   Nevertheless, the basic principles of phase resetting and
   desynchronization still apply. This suggests a robustness of these
   techniques which is of extreme importance to the medical applications.

   The T-c values calculated using this equation were 566 (+/- 6) and 571
   (+/- 6) degrees C for the two crystals. Analysis of the kinetic data was
   performed according to Mueller's model, which allowed retrieval of the
   disordering rate constants C0Kdis+ for all four temperatures. The
   Arrhenius relation: In K-dis(+) = ln K-0 - Q/(RT) = 20.45(+/- 1.91)
   -25191 (+/- 1900)/T(K); (R-2 = 0.989)
   yielded an activation energy of 50.03 (+/- 3) kcal/mol for the Fe-Mg
   exchange process. Cooling time constants, calculated at the QMF buffer
   conditions of the host rock were, for the two crystals, eta = 0.94 x
   10(-1) K-1 year(-1) and eta = 1.10 x 10(-1) K-1 year(-1), and gave
   cooling rates on the order of 10 degrees C/h consistent with very fast
   lava cooling.}},

Abstract = {{Many fish populations have variable annual recruitment, which challenges
   both population model development and conventional management
   strategies. Here, we develop a stock-yield model to assess the
   sustainability of the commercial catch of goldeye Hiodon alosoides from
   western Lake Athabasca of northeastern Alberta, Canada. Goldeyes have
   highly irregular annual recruitment; many year-classes are poor and
   dominant year-classes appear an average of only 1.7 times per decade. In
   the late 1990s, the mean annual commercial catch from this population
   was about 11,500 goldeyes-primarily fish front the 1982 and 1989
   year-classes. A best-fit stock-yield model developed for this population
   incorporated (1) the restrictions of the catch from a historic fishery
   that depleted this Population during the 1950s and early 1960s; (2) the
   restrictions of the known total stock size in the early 1970s, obtained
   from mark-recapture studies; (3) long-term annual estimates and patterns
   for stock recruitment (1972-2008); (4) a natural annual mortality rate
   of 20\%; and (5) stock estimates for 1994 obtained from the catchability
   coefficient (catch per unit effort divided by the magnitude of
   commercial stock estimated from mark-recapture data for 1972 and 1973).
   The model Suggested that an annual commercial catch of 10,000 goldeyes
   was sustainable over all years and conditions (1947-2004). This small
   modeled catch, about 2\% of the long-term mean stock number of 540,000
   goldeyes, ensured that at least a few thousand mature.oldeyes would
   survive to spawn through periods of poor stock recruitment lasting more
   than a decade. These results suggest that fish populations with
   irregular annual recruitment can sustain only a low exploitation rate to
   prevent stock extinction during long periods of low recruitment.}},

Abstract = {{The systematics of topshells (family Trochidae) is currently unresolved:
   at present even the generic boundaries within this group are poorly
   defined. In this study, we used sequence data of two mitochondrial genes
   (16S and cytochrome oxidase 1, COI) and one nuclear gene (actin) to
   resolve the phylogeny of a closely related subgroup of the Trochidae, 30
   species of largely Southern Hemisphere monodontine topshells. The
   phylogenies constructed revealed five well-supported generic clades: a
   South African clade (genus Oxystele Philippi, 1847), which lay basally
   to four internal Pacific clades (genera Chlorodiloma Pilsbry, 1889;
   Monodonta Lamarck, 1799; Austrocochlea Fischer, 1885; and Diloma
   Philippi, 1845). The molecular phylogenies constructed in this study
   shed light on previously unresolved relationships between different
   groups of topshells, allowing for the first time assignation (based on
   DNA sequence) of clearly defined, well-supported taxonomic and
   nomenclatural classification of monodontine topshells species.
   Austrocochlea crinita (Philippi, 1849), A. odontis (Wood, 1828), A.
   adelaidae (Philippi, 1849), and A. millelineata (Bonnet, 1864) are
   placed in the genus Chlorodiloma, which we resurrect from synonymy with
   Austrocochlea. The Japanese M. confusa Tapparone-Canefri, 1874 is
   treated as a separate species from M. labio (Linne, 1758). Melagraphia
   Gray, 1847 is synonymised with Diloma and its sole member, M. aethiops
   (Gmelin, 1791), along with A. concamerata (Wood, 1828), is transferred
   to that genus. The Juan Fernandez endemic D. crusoeana (Pilsbry, 1889)
   (Pilsbry, 1889) is synonymised with D. nigerrima (Gmelin, 1791). We find
   that morphologically cryptic species are not necessarily close
   genetically. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Polylactides (PLA) have been known for several decades and are recently
   of considerable commercial significance. However, the literature on
   basic chain properties and solution characterization is divided and
   inconsistent. In this study, a comprehensive and well-controlled set of
   experiments is combined with rigorous quantitative analysis to resolve
   existing apparent contradictions. Homopolymers and copolymers spanning
   wide ranges of molecular weight and stereoisomer proportions were
   prepared by ring-opening polymerizations Of L- and D-lactides using
   stannous octanoate as the catalyst. Samples were characterized by means
   of. (1) dilute-solution viscometry in three different solvents; (2) size
   exclusion chromatography in tetrahydrofuran (THF) with light scattering
   detection; (3) static multiangle light scattering in a mixed
   acetonitrile-dichloromethane solvent; (4) variable-angle spectroscopic
   ellipsometry; and (5) melt rheology. The data imply that PLA are typical
   linear flexible polymers; unperturbed PLA chain dimensions are
   describable in terms of a characteristic ratio of 6.5 +/- 0.9,
   regardless of stereoisomer content. The Schulz-Blaschke and Mark-Houwink
   constants for dilute PLA solutions in chloroform and in THF are
   determined. For chloroform at 30 degrees C, the correct values are k(SB)
   = 0.302, K = 0.0131 (mL/g), and a = 0.759, while for THF at 30 degrees

Abstract = {{Most recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have found that
   hemodialysis graft surveillance combined with preemptive correction of
   stenosis does not prolong graft survival. Nevertheless, such programs
   may be justified if they reduce other adverse outcomes or decrease the
   cost of care. This study tested this hypothesis by applying a secondary
   analysis to our original RCT. This study of 101 patients evaluated
   correction of stenosis based upon blood flow (Q) and stenosis
   surveillance. Patients were randomly assigned to control, flow, or
   stenosis groups, and were followed for up to 28 months. Q was measured
   monthly by ultrasound dilution; stenosis was measured quarterly by
   duplex ultrasound. Stenosis of 50\% was corrected by percutaneous
   transluminal angioplasty (PTA) after referral for angiography. Referral
   criteria were: control group, clinical criteria; flow group, Q < 600
   ml/min or clinical criteria; stenosis group, stenosis > 50\% or clinical
   criteria. We compared access-related hospitalizations and cost of care,
   and use of central venous dialysis catheters (CVCs), among the three
   groups. Hospitalization rates were higher in the control and flow groups
   than in the stenosis group (0.50, 0.57, 0.18/patient-year, respectively
   {[}p < 0.01]), and hospitalization costs were lowest in the stenosis
   group (p = 0.026). The stenosis group had a trend toward lowest CVC
   rates (0.44, 0.32, 0.20/patient-year, respectively {[}p = 0.20]). The
   costs of care were higher in the control and flow groups than in the
   stenosis group (\$3727, \$4839, \$3306/patient-year, respectively {[}p =
   0.015]). The costs of stenosis (\$142/patient-year) and Q
   (\$279/patient-year) measurements were minimal compared to the total
   cost of access-related care. In conclusion, stenosis surveillance by
   duplex ultrasound combined with preemptive correction yielded reduced
   hospitalization rates and costs, reduced total cost of access-related
   care, and a trend of reduced CVC rates. In contrast, flow surveillance
   did not yield a significant benefit. Stenosis surveillance provides
   important benefits that may justify application of such programs.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of historical gullying and long-term processes of interactions
   between land use and gullying is still rather limited. Here, I review
   results from case studies in Germany and neighbouring countries and
   exmine the complex development of a gully system in northern Bavaria,
   integrating land-use changes and their interactions within a conceptual
   model. Reconstructions of gully development were made by identifying and
   dating sediment layers, artificial modifications and soil horizons at
   high spatial and temporal resolution, combined with analyses of
   historical documents. The case study in northern Bavaria shows that more
   than 150 colluvial layers found in a gully system revealed the detailed
   history of gully development during the last 1300 years. The first
   gullying took place in early Mediaeval times during several heavy
   rainfall events but the main phases of gullying took place between the
   fourteenth and the mid-eighteenth centuries. Occurrence of gullying was
   strongly linked to phases of high land-use intensity, which later
   changed the runoff pattern and enlarged the catchment area by 50\%.
   Subsequently, overflowing field furrows led to the development of two
   gullies, up to 6 in deep, in late Mediaeval and early modern times. From
   the middle of the nineteenth century until today, only a little soil
   erosion has taken place and most of the catchment area has become
   grassland or forest. During the 1050 years from AD 800 to 1850, a soil
   volume of about 6430 m(3) was eroded by gullying, destroying 15\% of the
   arable land. The results provide a basis for modelling long-term
   human-induced landscape evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Lamina I is a sensory relay region containing projection cells and local
   interneurons involved in thermal and nociceptive signaling. These
   neurons differ in morphology, sensory response modality, and firing
   characteristics. We examined intrinsic properties of mouse lamina I
   GABAergic neurons expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP).
   GABAergic neuron identity was confirmed by a high correspondence between
   GABA immunolabeling and EGFP fluorescence. Morphologies of these
   EGFP(+)/GABA(+) cells were multipolar (65\%), fusiform (31\%), and
   pyramidal (4\%). In whole cell recordings, cells fired a single spike
   (44\%), tonically (35\%), or an initial burst (21\%) in response to
   current steps, representing a subset of reported lamina I firing
   properties. Membrane properties of tonic and initial burst cells were
   indistinguishable and these neurons may represent one functional
   population because, in individual neurons, their firing patterns could
   interconvert. Single spike cells were less excitable with lower membrane
   resistivity and higher rheobase. Most fusiform cells (64\%) fired
   tonically while most multipolar cells (56\%) fired single spikes. In
   summary, lamina I inhibitory interneurons are functionally divisible
   into at least two major groups both of which presumably function to
   limit excitatory transmission.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study examined the effect of insulin on sex cord stromal
   tumors in the rat. Methods: Sex cord stromal tumors were induced by
   transplantation of ovaries under the splenic capsule of ovariectomized
   rats (Lewis-inbred). These tumors were then transplanted into new inbred
   rats. Hyperglycemic conditions were induced by treatment with
   streptozotocin (STZ, which selectively destroyed pancreatic islet cells)
   and hypoglycemic conditions by treatment with a subcutaneously implanted
   insulin pump (Alzet). The animals were killed 28, 56, and 84 days later.
   Tumor growth, animal weight, food and water consumption, and serum
   concentrations of glucose, FSH, LH, and estradiol were measured.
   Results: Treatment with STZ and insulin with osmotic Alzet pumps induced
   continuous hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic conditions, respectively. No
   significant influence of the hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic status on
   tumor growth was measured during the first 28 and 56 days. Eighty-four
   days after transplantation and substitution of 1 or 2 IU/100 g body
   weight/d insulin, there was a significant stimulation of tumor growth
   (2.2-fold and 2.7-fold, respectively). In hyperglycemic animals (treated
   with STZ), no influence on tumor growth was found in comparison with the
   controls. Conclusion: This study confirms that hyperinsulinemic
   conditions contribute to the progression of tumors.}},

Abstract = {{The combined removal of chlorinated ethenes and heavy metals from a
   simulated groundwater matrix by zerovalent iron (ZVI) was investigated.
   In batch, Ni (5-100 mg L-1) enhanced trichloroethene (TCE, 10 mg L-1)
   reduction by ZVI (100 g L-1) due to catalytic hydrodechlorination by
   bimetallic Fe-0/Ni-0. Cr(VI) or Zn (5-100 mg L-1) lowered TCE
   degradation rates by a factor of 2 to 13. Cr(VI) (100 mg L-1) in
   combination with Zn or Ni (50-100 mg L-1) inhibited TCE degradation.
   Addition of 20\% H-2(g) in the headspace, or of Zn (50-100 mg L-1),
   enhanced TCE removal in the presence of Ni and Cr(VI). Sorption of Zn to
   ZVI alleviated the Cr(VI) induced inhibition of bimetallic Fe-0/ Ni-0
   apparently due to release of protons necessary for TCE
   hydrodechlorination. In continuous ZVI columns treating
   tetrachloroethene (PCE, 1-2 mg L-1) and TCE (10 mg L-1), and a mixture
   of the metals Cr(VI), Zn(II), and Ni(II) (5 mg L-1), the PCE removal
   efficiency decreased from 100\% to 90\% in columns operated without
   heavy metals. The PCE degradation efficiency remained above 99\% in
   columns receiving heavy metals as long as Ni was present. The findings
   of this study indicate the feasibility and limitations of the combined
   treatment of mixtures of organic and inorganic pollutants by ZVI.}},

Abstract = {{We constrain the extent of lithospheric and asthenospheric deformation
   beneath New Zealand by coupling measurements of shear wave splitting of
   teleseismic waves and petrophysical analysis of mantle xenoliths. SKS
   splitting for the central South Island and the eastern part of the North
   Island confirms earlier observations. The fast S-wave polarization
   directions are roughly NE/SW, which is parallel to the Alpine Fault in
   the South Island and to the strike of the Hikurangi subduction zone in
   the North Island. This suggests that flow parallel to the plate boundary
   extends up to 160 km away from the boundary. Departures from this
   pattern are restricted to the southernmost station and the two
   northernmost stations and indicate changes in the mantle flow or a more
   complex anisotropic pattern, such as a dipping axis of symmetry or
   heterogeneous anisotropy. Analysis of mantle xenoliths from the Raglan
   (North Island), Dunedin (South Island) and Chatham Island regions allows
   us to constrain the lithospheric contribution to the observed seismic
   anisotropy. The intrinsic S-wave anisotropy is 1.5 per cent higher for
   the South Island samples (similar to 5.0 per cent versus similar to 3.5
   per cent for the North Island), indicating a strong lithospheric
   deformation that could explain the major part of the observed splitting.
   In the North Island, the intrinsic lithospheric anisotropy is too low to
   explain the SKS splitting times. This indicates that asthenospheric
   deformation probably plays a major role there. For the Chatham Island,
   the anisotropy pattern remains unresolved as the xenolith suggests
   strong lithospheric anisotropy but no present splitting is measured.}},

Abstract = {{RNA editing affecting chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes has been
   identified in all major clades of land plants. The frequency of edited
   sites varies greatly between lineages but hornworts represent an extreme
   in propensity for editing in both their chloroplast and mitochondrial
   genomes. cDNA sequences from seven taxonomically diverse hornwort rbcL
   sequences combined with a survey of 13 additional DNA sequences for
   potential edited sites demonstrate the presence of 62 edited sites and
   predict a minimum of 10 additional sites. These 72 total edited sites
   represent 43 C-to-U and 28 U-to-C nucleotide conversions, with 1 site
   exhibiting editing in both directions. With one exception, all taxa are
   heavily edited, with each having from 20 to 34 edited sites. However, a
   single sample, Leiosporoceros, is shown to lack edited sites.
   Phylogenetic reconstruction of hornworts results in ambiguous resolution
   of Leiosporoceros depending on whether edited sites are maintained or
   eliminated from the analyses. Depending on the inferred relationship of
   Leiosporoceros to the hornworts, at least two explanations for the
   origin and maintenance of pervasive editing in hornworts are possible.
   The absence of edited sites in Leiosporoceros could represent either the
   absence or a low level of editing ability in the common ancestor of
   hornworts, as represented by Leiosporoceros, or the loss of editing
   sites in this lineage after the primary diversification events in the
   group.}},

Abstract = {{We study numerically the instability of a confined rotating gas flow
   subject to periodic strain along the axis of rotation, under the low

   Galerkin-type code is used to investigate the viscous basic flow and its

   the growth of inertial modes coupled by the oscillating strain. The
   marginal stability curve compares well with earlier experimental and
   (asymptotic) analytical results in the case of the axisymmetric inertial
   mode (1,1,0). The resulting flow is dominated by a time-oscillating
   toroidal vortex and differs very little from the theoretical mode. Two
   different nonlinear regimes are found, one with saturation to a constant
   modal amplitude, the other with weak periodic modulation. We also show
   evidence of the presence of an azimuthal circulation, apparently

Abstract = {{Thixotropic systems are usually characterized by measuring the stress
   transients resulting from sudden changes in shear rate. By using a
   procedure that takes into account the transfer function of the
   transducer on a strain-controlled rheometer, the initial part of the
   transients could be accessed. In this manner complete transient stress
   curves and accurate constant- structure curves could be recorded on a
   model system consisting of fumed silica particles dispersed in a
   Newtonian medium. In agreement with previously obtained stress jump data
   {[}Dullaert and Mewis (2005b)], an initial viscoelastic response is
   detected that precedes the structural time effects in either build-up or
   breakdown experiments. The effect of flow history on the characteristic
   times and on the shape of the transient curves is investigated. It is
   shown that common assumptions in thixotropic models, such as a structure
   that can be characterized by a single parameter or the existence of
   exponential stress transients, do not generally hold. Although the
   material response is quite complex, the time constants of the stress
   transients obey a simple scaling law. The present data set is very
   suitable for model evaluation. Here, two representative models, those of
   Houska and of Coussot, have been tested. The initial parts of the curves
   are not well described. The time constants for the thixotiopic structure
   build-up are reasonably well predicted, although shear history effects
   are not properly modeled. For the breakdown curves larger errors are
   recorded. (9) 2005 The Society of Rheology.}},

Abstract = {{bThe physical properties of liquid crystal phases (mesophases) depend in
   a very sensitive manner on the structure of the constituent liquid
   crystal-forming molecules (mesogens). Thus a small change in molecular
   structure can result in a dramatic change in the corresponding liquid
   crystal properties. The dielectric responses of materials reflect the
   electric properties of molecules, and so analysis of dielectric
   measurements on liquid crystals in terms of molecular properties should
   lead to the development of structure/property relationships for such
   mesophases. This paper explores the problems of determining molecular
   parameters from dielectric measurements on nematic liquid crystals.
   Specifically, the difficulties in defining the internal electric field
   and knowing the value of the order parameter are addressed. Experimental
   results on a range of liquid crystals show that short range correlations
   are important in determining both the dielectric and optical response of
   nematic liquid crystals. It is concluded therefore that more
   sophisticated molecular theories, which take account of molecular shape
   and volume, need to be developed before reliable structure/property
   relationships can be established for liquid crystals.}},

   stunting (-2 SD of height-for-age), underweight (-2 SD of
   weight-for-age), and wasting (-2 SD of BMI-for-age) were 14.3, 2.6, and
   0.2, respectively. These values suggest that malnutrition is not a
   common problem among adolescent laborers living in Ankara; but laboring
   is an important cause of faltering in growth, particularly in linear
   growth, in less or underdeveloped economic environments.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical
   activity of imatinib mesylate in patients with recurrent and refractory
   c-kit-expressing small-cell lung cancer.
   Patients and methods: Patients with c-kit-expressing SCLC (>= 1+ by
   immunohistochemistry) were enrolled in two groups. Arm A included
   patients with disease progression < 3 months and arm B included patients
   with disease progression >= 3 months after previous treatment. Imatinib
   was administered at a dose of 400 mg b.i.d. continuously, with a cycle
   length of 28 days. A single stage Simon design with a planned interim
   analysis was used to evaluate the 16-week progression free rate in each
   arm.
   Results: A total of 29 evaluable patients were entered into the study
   (seven in arm A, median age 68; 22 in arm B, median age 64.5). Median
   number of treatment cycles was one in both arms. Grade 3+
   non-hematologic adverse events were seen in 15 (52\%) patients, with
   nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, fatigue, anorexia and dehydration each
   occurring in at least 10\% of patients. Median survival was 3.9 and 5.3
   months and median time to progression was 1 and 1.1 months for arms A
   and B, respectively. Enrollment to arm A was temporarily suspended prior
   to reaching interim analysis due to striking early disease progression
   (29\%), early deaths (29\%) and patient refusal (42\%). No objective
   responses and no confirmed stable disease >= 6 weeks were seen in either
   arm. Accrual was permanently terminated to both arms as only one patient
   was progression-free at 16 weeks.
   Conclusion: Imatinib failed to demonstrate any clinical activity in
   spite of patient selection for c-kit-expressing SCLC. Our results
   strengthen the collective evidence that prediction of efficacy of novel
   therapeutic agents based on target expression, rather than pathway
   activation (for example, through activating mutations), may not be a
   valid paradigm for drug development.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: We compared the effects of high-intensity interval (HIT) and
   moderate-intensity continuous (MIT) training (matched for total work) on
   changes in repeated-sprint ability (RSA) and muscle metabolism. Methods:
   Pre- and posttraining, VO2peak, lactate threshold (LT), and RSA (5 x 6-s
   sprints, every 30 s) were assessed in 20 females. Before and immediately
   after the RSA test, muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus
   lateralis. Subjects were matched on RSA, randomly placed into the HIT (N
   = 10) or MIT (N = 10) group and performed 5 wk (3 d(.)wk(-1)) of cycle
   training; performing either HIT (6-10,2-min intervals at 120-140\% LT)
   or MIT (continuous, 20-30 min at 80-95\% LT). Results: Both groups had
   significant improvements in VO2peak (10-12\%; P < 0.05) and LT (8-10\%;
   P < 0.05), with no significant differences between them. Both groups
   also had significant increases in RSA total work (kJ) (P < 0.05), with a
   significantly greater increase following HIT than MIT (13 vs 8.5\%,
   respectively; P < 0.05). There was a significant decrease in resting
   {[}ATP] and an increase in postexercise {[}La-](b) for both groups, but
   no significant differences between them. There were no significant
   changes in resting or postexercise {[}PCr], {[}Cr], muscle {[}La-], or
   {[}H+] after the training period. Conclusions: When total work is
   matched, HIT results in greater improvements in RSA than MIT. This
   results from an improved ability to maintain performance during
   consecutive sprints, which is not explained by differences in work done
   during the first sprint, aerobic fitness or metabolite accumulation at
   the end of the sprints.}},

   structure and known FPR ligands, respectively) for in silico screening
   of similar to 480,000 drug-like small molecules. A subset of 4324

   with the HyperCyt flow cytometry platform in high-throughput, no-wash
   assays that directly measure human FPR binding, with samples (each
   similar to 2500 cells in 2 mu l) analyzed at 40/min. From 52 confirmed
   hits (1.2\% hit rate), we identified 30 potential lead compounds (
   inhibition constant, K-i = 1 - 32 mu M) representing nine distinct
   chemical families. Four compounds in one family were weak partial
   agonists. All others were antagonists. This virtual screening approach
   improved the physical screening hit rate by 12-fold ( versus 0.1\%

Abstract = {{Study objective: To quantify the increase in mailed questionnaire
   response attributable to a monetary incentive.
   Design: A systematic search for randomised controlled trials of monetary
   incentives and mailed questionnaire response was conducted. For each
   trial identified, logistic regression was used to estimate the odds
   ratio for response per \$0.01 incentive increase. Odds ratios were
   pooled in a series of random effect meta-analyses stratified by the
   minimum and maximum amounts offered. Piecewise logistic regression was
   used to estimate the odds ratio for response per \$0.01 increase given
   in each of five incentive ranges.
   Setting: Populations in several developed countries, predominantly the
   USA.
   Participants: 85 671 randomised participants from 88 trials.
   Main results: The pooled odds ratios for response per \$0.01 incentive
   decreased monotonically as the maximum amount of incentive offered
   increased. The piecewise logistic regression model estimated that for
   incentive amounts up to \$0.50, each additional \$0.01 increased the
   odds of response by about 1\% ( pooled OR = 1.012, 95\% CI 1.007 to
   1.016). The effects on response above \$0.50 were smaller and decreased
   monotonically in the ranges: \$0.50 - 0.99, \$ 1 - 1.99, \$ 2 - 4.99, \$
   5.00 and over, but remained statistically significant up to \$5.
   Conclusions: This meta-analysis of the best available evidence shows
   that monetary incentives increase mailed questionnaire response.
   Researchers should include small amounts of money with mailed
   questionnaires rather than give no incentive at all.}},

Abstract = {{To identify ultraviolet (UV) and middle- (M) wavelength-sensitive cone
   and rod signals in murine retinal ganglion cells, single ganglion cell
   responses were studied in anesthetized, light-adapted C57/BL6 mice with
   tungsten microelectrodes driven through the sclera and vitreous to the
   neural retina. One hundred fifty-four ganglion cells were examined in 43
   retinas of 34 mice. The retina was stimulated with diffuse flashes
   and/or pulses of ultraviolet (360 nm) or green (520 nm) light in the
   presence and absence of a strong steady orange adapting light. Twelve
   ganglion cells were studied in the dark-adapted retina in order to
   identify the signals of rods. Three functionally different types of
   ganglion cells were found: (1) phasic responding cells (31\%) with no
   spontaneous activity and large impulse amplitudes; (2) tonic responding
   cells (60\%) with irregular, low frequency (5-10 Hz) spontaneous
   activity and smaller impulse amplitudes; and (3) metronome-like cells
   (9\%) with regular, relatively high-frequency (20-40 Hz) spontaneous
   activity. A few cells (1\%) had habituating responses. Every cell
   encountered was affected by diffuse stimulation. The more common two
   types were excited at either the ON or OFF or at both the ON and OFF
   phases of stimulation. Type III cells had weaker responses, sometimes
   only inhibited by turning off a light. In the light-adapted state, most
   cells received signals of the same polarity from UV- and M-cones but
   UV-cone inputs were usually more dominant, especially in ventral retina.
   A fraction of cells received signals from only UV- (18\%) or only M-
   (3\%) cones. In rare cases (2\%) these cone inputs had an opposite
   polarity on the same cell. In the dark-adapted state, all cells were at
   least four or five logarithmic units more sensitive and more to green
   than ultraviolet light. The results indicate that co-expression of both
   UV-and M-cone opsins cannot be ubiquitous in murine retina. Some cones,
   especially UV cones, exist without the presence of any functional M-cone
   opsin. This must be the case to explain the presence of ganglion cells
   that receive inputs only from UV-cones and others that receive inputs of
   opposite polarity from UV- and M-cones. The results support the
   hypothesis that murine retina has the physiological capacity to relay
   signals to the brain that allow the sensing of chromatic contrast and

Abstract = {{We study a new coloring concept which generalizes the classical vertex
   coloring problem in a graph by extending the notion of stable sets to
   split graphs. First of all, we propose the packing problem of finding
   the split graph of maximum size where a split graph is a graph G = (V,E)
   in which the vertex set V can be partitioned into a clique K and a
   stable set S. No condition is imposed on the edges linking vertices in S
   to the vertices in K. This maximum split graph problem gives rise to an
   associated partitioning problem that we call the split-coloring problem.
   Given a graph, the objective is to cover all his vertices by a least
   number of split graphs. Definitions related to this new problem are
   introduced. We mention some polynomially solvable cases and describe
   open questions on this area.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Brucellosis is prevalent in Saudi Arabia and Brucella
   melitensis is a leading cause of zoonosis worldwide. Therefore, accurate
   diagnosis of brucellosis is a key to its treatment and control.
   Material/Methods: Twenty patients presented with symptoms of brucellosis
   were examined before and after antibiotic treatment for the diagnosis of
   brucellosis. Sequential blood samples collected monthly from each
   patient were tested for the diagnosis of brucellosis by serum plate
   agglutination test (SPA), standard tube agglutination test (STA),
   culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
   Results: While most of the samples were positive by the agglutination
   tests, only 40\% and 70\% were positive by culture and PCR,
   respectively. After the course of antibiotic treatment, the culture rate
   and PCR results were positive in 10\% of the samples. In contrast,
   anti-brucella antibodies of the treated patients were positive in 20\%
   and 45\% by STA and SPA tests, respectively. Furthermore, agglutinating
   antibodies in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol were positive in 60\% of
   the enrolled patients and negative in all patients after the antibiotic
   treatment.
   Conclusions: The present study revealed that the expression of
   anti-brucella antibodies does not correlate with the status of the
   disease condition. Further, completion of antibiotic therapy hampered
   the appearance of brucella-specific IgM antibodies, but did not
   eliminate the appearance of residual IgG antibodies in the treated
   patients. Therefore, for effective therapy, detection of the Brucella
   organisms by PCR or culture is an important attribute in the evaluation
   of the treatment regimen against brucellosis.}},

   of surgical patients. All patients (n = 25) underwent TPT x AS at the
   Department of Surgery, Donostia Hospital from January 2002 to October
   2004. The primary outcome measures were kinetics of serum levels of iPTH
   during surgery and prediction time of the of descent of PTH levels
   (measured in the clinic on the day of admission and intraoperatively
   during induction of anesthesia, every 5 and 10 minutes after removal of
   the adenoma, and again 24 hours thereafter). iPTH levels returned to
   normal in all 25 patients, decreasing from pathological levels at the
   beginning of the operation (1302.24 + 424.9 pg/ml) to half (50\%) values
   at the third intraoperative determination, minute 10 (614.8 +/- 196.62),
   becoming undetectable at 24 hours. Frozen sections were conclusive for
   parathyroid tissue (20.56 + 10.3 minutes after removal). Intraoperative

Abstract = {{Sputum induction is used in the early identification of tuberculosis
   (TB) and pneumocystis infections of the lung. Although manual
   physiotherapy techniques to clear the airways are often incorporated in

   This randomised, crossover trial enrolled adults referred for sputum
   induction for suspected TB and pneumocystis infections of the lung. All
   participants underwent two sputum induction procedures, inhaling 3\%
   saline via ultrasonic nebuliser. During one randomly allocated
   procedure, airway clearance techniques (chest wall percussion,
   vibration, huffing) were incorporated.
   In total, 59 participants completed the trial. The airway clearance
   techniques had no significant effect on how the test was tolerated, the
   volume expectorated or the quality of the sample obtained (assessed by
   the presence of alveolar macrophages). The techniques did not
   significantly affect how often the test identified a suspected organism,
   nor the sensitivity or specificity of sputum induction.
   In conclusion, the study was unable to demonstrate any effect of airway
   clearance techniques on the sputum induction procedure. The results
   provide some justification for not including airway clearance techniques

Abstract = {{Uniform poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (poly(GMA)) particles with different
   size and surface properties were obtained by dispersion polymerization
   formulations including different initiator and stabilizer types. The
   particle size was correlated with the half-life of the initiator. The
   use of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) as a novel steric stabilizer in the
   dispersion polymerization of GMA resulted in the synthesis of smaller
   particles with higher surface charge density with respect to those in
   the literature. As a new initiator-stabilizer system for GMA,
   4,4'-azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid)-poly(acrylic acid) provided the
   synthesis of bifunctional uniform latex particles carrying epoxide and
   carboxyl groups.
   The reactive character of poly(GMA) particles allowed the preparation of
   their primary amine carrying form. The fluorescent form of the amine
   carrying poly(GMA) based latex particles was first obtained by labeling
   with FITC and characterized by confocal laser scanning microscopy
   (CLSM). A CLSM method was developed to determine the amine group
   distribution in the particles based on the fluorescent intensity
   profile. A core part with low primary amine content was observed in the
   particle interior while the amine group concentration was high on the
   shell part located on the particle surface. The photobleaching time of
   poly(GMA) based particles was found to be two-fold longer than the
   highest value reported for the uniform particles. Low photobleaching
   rate is extremely important for the CLSM applications of uniform
   particles particularly in microfluidics and biomedical area. (c) 2005

Title = {{Phylogenetic relationships of Sarcocystis neurona of horses and opossums

Abstract = {{Phylogenetic analyses based on sequences of the nuclear-encoded small
   subunit rRNA (ssurRNA) gene were performed to examine the origin,
   phylogeny, and biogeographic relationships of Sarcocystis neurona
   isolates from opossums and horses from the State of Michigan, USA, in
   relation to other cyst-forming coccidia. A total of 31 taxa representing
   all recognized subfamilies and genera of Sarcocystidae were included in
   the analyses with clonal isolates of two opossum and two horse S.
   neurona. Phylogenies obtained by the four tree-building methods were
   consistent with the classical taxonomy based on morphological criteria.
   The ``isosporid{''} coccidia Neospora, Toxoplasma, Besnoitia, Isospora
   lacking stieda bodies, and Hyaloklossia formed a sister group to the
   Sarcocystis spp. Sarcocystis species were divided into three main
   lineages; S. neurona isolates were located in the second lineage and
   clustered with S. mucosa, S. dispersa, S. lacertae, S. rodentifelis, S.
   muris, and Frenkelia spp. Alignment of S. neurona SSU rRNA gene
   sequences of Michigan opossum isolates (MIOP5, MIOP20) and a S. neurona
   Michigan horse isolate (MIH8) showed 100\% identity. These Michigan
   isolates differed in 2/1085 bp (0.2\%) from a Kentucky S. neurona horse
   isolate (SN5). Additionally, S. neurona isolates from horses and
   opossums were identical based on the ultrastructural features and
   PCR-RFLP analyses thus forming a phylogenetically indistinct group in
   these regions. These findings revealed the concordance between the
   morphological and molecular data and confirmed that S. neurona from
   opossums and horses originated from the same phylogenetic origin.}},

Abstract = {{Antigen uptake and presentation capacities enable DC to prime and
   activate T cells. Recently, several studies demonstrated a diminished DC
   function in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected patients showing impaired
   abilities to stimulate allogenic T cells and to produce IFN-gamma in HCV
   infected patients. Moreover, DC of patients who have resolved HCV
   infection behave like DC from healthy donors responding to maturation
   stimuli, decrease antigen uptake, up-regulate expression of appropriate
   surface marker, and are potent stimulators of allogenic T cells. A
   number of studies have demonstrated in tumour models and models of
   infectious diseases strong induction of immune responses after DC
   vaccination. Because DC are essential for T-cell activation and since
   viral clearance in HCV infected patients is associated with a vigorous
   T-cell response, we propose a new type of HCV vaccine based on ex vivo
   stimulated and matured DC loaded with HCV specific antigens. This
   vaccine circumvents the impaired DC maturation and the down regulated DC
   function of HCV infected patients in vivo by giving the necessary
   maturation stimuli and the HCV antigens in a different setting and
   location ex vivo. Strong humoral and cellular immune responses were
   detected after HCV core DC vaccination. Furthermore, DC vaccination
   shows partial protection in a therapeutic and prophylactic model of HCV
   infection. In conclusion, mice immunized with HCV core pulsed DC
   generated a specific antiviral response in a mouse HCV challenge model.
   Our results indicate that HCV core pulsed DC may serve as a new modality
   for immunotherapy of HCV especially in chronically infected patients.}},

Abstract = {{Despite growing attention to the issue of children's exposure to adult
   domestic violence (DV) there is little systematic information available
   on the level of DV in the child protective caseload or on the pathways
   of such cases through these systems. This paper reports an examination
   of one state's child maltreatment reports during a 1-year period. A
   random sample of 2000 of cases is used to project the state's experience
   with cases in which DV was indicated-from initial report to case
   disposition-shedding a more accurate light on the child protection
   response. Pathways and outcomes for DV indicated cases in comparison to
   those in which no DV was indicated are then presented. Finally, factors
   that predict re-referral and placement out of home within 1 year of the
   target referral are compared for DV and non-DV indicated cases.
   The results of this study reveal that DV was indicated as present in one
   in five cases referred to child protective services, but in 38\% of
   cases accepted for any level of investigation, and fully 47\% of those
   assigned a moderate to high risk and a high level of investigation. Over
   half of the DV indicated cases (56\%) that were assessed as a moderate
   to high risk at intake and fully investigated had their cases opened for
   services, and of these more than four out of five (81\%) had at least
   one child removed from parental custody. Among moderate to high risk
   cases, those with an indication of DV were significantly more likely to
   have their cases opened for services and to have at least one child in
   the family placed in out-of-home care. The factors predicting
   re-referral to child protective services or placement in out-of-home
   care within a year after referral differed greatly for cases in which
   there was or was not an indication of DV Implications of the results for
   child welfare practice are discussed. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier

   non-radiative processes. The ground and the excited state pK(a) values
   for the monocation-neutral equilibrium of 2ADPS in beta-CDx are found to

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To evaluate the effect of posterior sub-tenon triamcinolone
   acetonide (TA) injection on clinical, angiographic, and optical
   coherence tomographic (OCT) parameters in refractory diabetic macular
   edema (DME).
   METHODS. In a double-masked placebo-controlled clinical trial, 64 eyes
   were randomly assigned to two groups. The treatment group (32 eyes)
   received 40 mg posterior sub-tenon injection of TA and the placebo group
   (32 eyes) received subconjunctival injection of a placebo. The
   injections were repeated after 2 months in both groups. Complete
   ophthalmologic examination, fluorescein angiography, and OCT were
   performed before intervention and after 4 months. Quantitative
   measurement of angiographic variables such as the amount of hard
   exudates (HE), size of foveal avascular zone (FAZ), and leakage severity
   was performed by computer, using Photoshop software.
   RESULTS. Initial best-corrected visual acuity (VA) was 0.93 +/- 0.39
   logMAR in the placebo group and 0.75 +/- 0.38 logMAR in the treatment
   group. At 4 months, corrected VA was 0.88 +/- 0.48 logMAR in the
   controls versus 0.71 +/- 0.42 logMAR in the cases. Mean central macular
   thickness measured by OCT before and 4 months after injection was 392
   and 377 microns in the treatment group and 388 and 357 microns in the
   placebo group, respectively. No statistically significant difference was
   detected between the two groups. The difference was also not significant
   in HE, FAZ and leakage in the angiograms.
   CONCLUSIONS. Two injections of posterior sub-tenon TA had no therapeutic
   effect on refractory DME.}},

Abstract = {{Measured cross sections for the fusion of Ni-64 with Ni-64, Ge-74, and

   the Ni-64 target above 0.1 mb are reproduced by including couplings to
   the low-lying 2(+) and 3(-) states and the mutual and two-phonon
   excitations of these states. The calculations become more challenging as
   the fusing nuclei become softer and heavier, and excitations to
   multi-phonon states start to play an increasingly important role. Thus
   it is necessary to include up to four-phonon excitations to reproduce
   the data for the Ni-64+Ge-74 system. Similar calculations for
   Ni-64+Mo-100, and also for the symmetric Ge-74+Ge-74 system, show large

Abstract = {{This report describes a new valvuloplasty procedure for the treatment of
   pulmonary valve stenosis (PVS) and large pulmonary valve annulus (PVA)
   diameters using a triple-balloon valvuloplasty (TBV) technique. We
   sought to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of this new technique.
   Percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty (BPV) is the preferred
   treatment for PVS. BPV in older patients with large PVA remains a
   challenge, even when the double-balloon valvuloplasty technique is
   performed. The technique was first attempted in a case where a large
   single balloon was unsuccessful and double-balloon valvuloplasty met
   with technical difficulties. Three subsequent patients underwent the
   procedure safely and successfully. An algorithm is presented to
   determine balloon size for TBV. The median PVA diameter was 23.9 mm.
   Balloon diameters ranged from 12 to 18 mm. The median peak right
   ventricular-to-pulmonary artery systolic pressure gradient was 43.5 mm
   Hg before valvuloplasty and was reduced to 12 mm Hg following
   intervention. No major complications were encountered. Percutaneous
   valvuloplasty using TBV can be performed safely and provides excellent
   clinical results. This technique offers advantages over single-balloon
   and double-balloon valvuloplasty techniques, especially in treatment of
   PVS in large pediatric or adult patients. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the effect of peritoneal fluid (PF) on preimplantation mouse

   to the blastocyst stage in human tubal fluid medium alone (control) or

   embyro was determined by Hoechst 33258 staining. Allocation of inner
   cell mass and trophectoderm in blastocysts, and incidence of apoptosis
   were determined using confocal microscopy. The blastocyst development
   rate was significantly lower in the presence of 10\% PI (P < 0.01).
   Total cell number and trophectoderm in blastocysts cultured in culture
   media alone was significantly higher than in the presence of PF (P =
   0.034 and P = 0.01 respectively). A higher incidence of apoptosis was
   seen in blastocysts cultured in culture media alone compared with those
   cultured in the presence of PF (P = 0.004). PPF decreases the
   development of early mouse embryos to the blastocyst stage, as well as
   the incidence of apoptosis in the resulting mouse blastocysts. No
   difference was seen in the effect of PF from women with and without
   endometriosis on mouse embyro development and apoptosis.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of maternal
   cytomegalovirus (CMV) antibody status in pregnancy on the risk of fetal
   death and of low birth weight.
   Methods. The study of fetal death risk was a nested case-control study.
   Cases were all women within a cohort of 35 940 pregnant women in Norway
   1992-94, who experienced fetal death after 16th week of gestation (n =
   281). Controls were 957 randomly selected women with live born children.
   Both groups were identified through linkage to the Norwegian Medical
   Birth Registry. The risk of low birth weight was studied in the live
   born children
   Results. Seventy-two percent (203/281) of the cases and 69\% (662/957)
   of the controls had CMV immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in the first
   trimester (P = 0.3). 0.4\% (1/281) of the cases and 0.7\% (7/957) had
   CMV IgM antibodies in the first trimester (P = 0.7). Among 322 initially
   CMV antibody-negative women, 11\% (6/55) of the cases and 9\% (24/267)
   of the controls had occurrence of CMV IgG and/or IgM antibodies (P =
   0.7) during pregnancy. Also, after control for maternal age, parity, and
   follow-up time, no association between CMV antibodies and fetal death
   was found. CMV antibody status was not associated with low birth weight.
   Conclusions. This study does not support a causal relation between CMV
   infection in pregnancy and fetal death or low birth weight.}},

Abstract = {{The androgen receptor (AR) has been proposed as a candidate gene for
   several cancers (breast, prostate, uterine endometrium, colon, and
   esophagus). Ethnicity is considered an associated risk factor for some
   of these cancers. Several case-control genetic studies have been focused
   in samples of the main ethnic groups, but little is known about the
   distribution of risk polymorphisms in current populations with accurate
   ethnic and/or geographic origins. The A allele of the G1733A
   polymorphism of the AR gene has been associated with increased risk of
   prostate cancer. We provide data from this marker in 12 samples from 7
   Mediterranean countries such as Spain, Italy (Sardinia), Greece, Turkey,
   Morocco, Algeria, and Egypt. A sample from Ivory Coast has also been
   analyzed. The A allele distribution shows a frequency in the Ivory Coast
   population (65.17\%) that contrasts with the low values found in
   Northern Mediterraneans (mean average value of 13.98\%). North African
   populations present two-times higher frequencies (average value of
   27.19\%) than Europeans. The wide population variation range found for
   the A allele strengthens the potential interest of further screening as
   a baseline to the design of future preventive and population health
   programs.}},

Title = {{Grazer species effects on epilithon nutrient composition}},
Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1853-1863}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{1. Field and laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the
   excretion stoichiometry of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) of two
   benthic macroinvertebrate grazers, the crayfish Orconectes propinquus
   and the snail Elimia livescens, that differ in body stoichiometry (mean
   body molar N : P 18 and 28, respectively). Crayfish excretion had a
   significantly higher ammonium : soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) ratio
   in the laboratory and in three natural streams than did snails, as
   predicted by ecological stoichiometry theory.
   2. In greenhouse recirculating artificial streams, treatments consisting
   of crayfish, snails, or no grazers were used to examine responses in
   dissolved nutrient concentrations and epilithon nutrient composition and
   limitation. SRP concentrations depended upon the grazer species, with
   the snail treatment having a higher SRP concentration than other
   treatments (P < 0.05). Dissolved inorganic N was not affected by
   grazers, but appeared to be rapidly incorporated in epilithon.
   3. Epilithon N content was dependent upon the grazer species present,
   with the crayfish treatment having a significantly higher N content than
   other treatments (P = 0.001). No grazer species effects on epilithon P
   content were found. However, both grazer treatments had significantly
   lower epilithon P content than the no-grazer treatment.
   4. Traditionally, studies have focused on how grazer-induced structural
   changes to epilithon can alter epilithon nutrient dynamics, but this
   structural mechanism could not solely explain differences in epilithon
   nutrient contents and ratios in the present study. Our results rather
   suggest that benthic grazers can alter epilithon nutrient composition
   and limitation via nutrient excretion. Consequently, macroinvertebrate
   grazers may serve as `nutrient pumps' that partly regulate the
   availability of nutrients to algae in stream ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Hypertension is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but
   its aetiology has not been fully elucidated. Recently, attention has
   been focused on the direct relations of plasma homocysteine (Hcy) to
   blood pressure (BP). The purpose of this study was to determine the
   relationship of Hcy with BP and other cardiovascular disease risk
   factors. This population-based study was a part of the Cardiovascular
   Risk Factors Survey and has been designed and conducted based on the
   methodology of the MONICA/WHO Project. A total of 1214 people aged 25-64
   years were recruited using cluster sampling and assessed regarding
   standardized methods. BP was measured in seated position after a 10-min
   rest period. Blood samples were gathered and analysed according to
   standard methods. Variables were assessed in 1191 participants (416 men;
   775 women). Mean age was higher in hypertensives compared to
   normotensives (P<0.001). Mean Hcy was higher in hypertensives, but
   significant only in men (P<0.031). Concurrent effects of Hcy, folate and
   vitamin B-12 on hypertension indicated that Hcy acts as a risk factor
   and folate and vitamin B-12 as protective factors; however, after
   adjustment, just vitamin B-12 remained as a protective factor. Although
   we detected a simple correlation of Hcy with BP in Iranian adults, this
   relationship was no longer significant after applying an adjustment. In
   light of our observations, it is likely that the increased Hcy levels
   reported in hypertensive persons are concomitant rather than a precursor
   of hypertension.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the row winter wheat was selected as the example to study
   the component temperature inversion method of land surface target in
   detail. The result showed that the structural pattern of row crop can
   affect the inversion precision of component temperature evidently.
   Choosing appropriate structural pattern of row crop can improve the
   inversion precision significantly. The iterative method combining
   inverse matrix was a stable method that was fit for inversing component
   temperature of land surface target. The result of simulation and field
   experiment showed that the integrative method could remarkably improve
   the inversion accuracy of the lighted soil surface temperature and the
   top layer canopy temperature, and enhance inversion stability of
   components temperature. Just two parameters were sufficient for accurate
   atmospheric correction of multi-angle and multi-spectral thermal
   infrared data: atmospheric transmittance and the atmospheric upwelling
   radiance. If the atmospheric parameters and component temperature can be
   inversed synchronously, the really and truly accurate atmospheric
   correction can be achieved. The validation using ATSRII data showed that
   the method was useful.}},

Abstract = {{Aims/hypothesis: Insulin resistance is concomitant with metabolic
   syndrome, oxidative stress and cardiac contractile dysfunction. However,
   the causal relationship between oxidative stress and cardiac dysfunction
   is unknown. This study was designed to determine the impact of
   overexpression of the cardiac antioxidant metallothionein on cardiac
   dysfunction induced by insulin resistance in mice. Methods: Whole-body
   insulin resistance was generated in wild-type FVB and metallothionein
   transgenic mice by feeding them with sucrose for 12 weeks. Contractile
   and intracellular Ca-90(90)90(2+ properties were evaluated in
   ventricular myocytes using an IonOptix system. The contractile indices
   analysed included: peak shortening (PS), time to 90\% PS (TPS)), time to
   90\% relengthening (TR(), half-width duration, maximal velocity of
   shortening (+dL/dt) and relengthening (-dL/dt), fura-fluorescence
   intensity change (DFFI) and decay rate (t). Results: The sucrose-fed
   mice displayed glucose intolerance, enhanced oxidative stress,
   hyperinsulinaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia and normal body weight.
   Compared with myocytes in starch-fed mice, those from sucrose-fed mice
   exhibited depressed PS, +dL/dt, -dL/dt, prolonged TR) (and decay rate,
   and reduced DFFI associated with normal TPS)(90) and half-width
   duration. Western blot analysis revealed enhanced basal, but blunted
   insulin (15 mU/g)-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. It also showed
   elevated expression of insulin receptor b, insulin receptor tyrosine
   phosphorylation, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g, protein
   tyrosine phosphatase 1B and phosphorylation of the transcription factor
   c-Jun, associated with a reduced fold increase of insulin-stimulated
   insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in sucrose-fed mice. All
   western blot findings may be attenuated or ablated by metallothionein.
   Conclusions/interpretation: These data indicate that oxidative stress
   may play an important role in cardiac contractile dysfunction associated
   with glucose intolerance and possibly related to alteration in insulin
   signalling at the receptor and post-receptor levels.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To evaluate the efficacy of laser in situ keratomileusis
   (LASIK) for discarding spectacles and simultaneously correcting ocular
   alignment in patients with refractive accommodative esotropia.
   METHODS. LASIK was performed on 20 eyes of 10 patients (mean age, 24.3
   years; range, 11 to 43 years) using a Technolas 217C excimer laser. The
   target refraction was emmetropia. Visual acuity (uncorrected and
   best-corrected), refractive error, and ocular alignment were recorded
   before and after LASIK. Minimum follow-up was 12 months.
   RESULTS. The mean preoperative uncorrected and corrected angle of
   deviation was 37.1 prism diopters (PD) (range, 17 to 80; standard
   deviation (SD), 19.8) and 14.74 PD (range, 0 to 50; SD, 12.9) of
   esotropia, respectively, which changed to 7.2 PD (range, 0 to 50; SD,
   15.78) without correction postoperatively (p=0. 005). Of 20 eyes, 15\%
   lost one line of best-corrected visual acuity, 10\% gained two lines,

   CONCLUSIONS. LASIK could be considered an alternative treatment for
   patients with refractive accommodative esotropia with intolerance to

Abstract = {{Objective: To describe the morphology of the frontal bones and metopic
   suture at 9 - 34 weeks of gestation using three-dimensional (3D)
   ultrasonograpby.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of the frontal bones and
   metopic suture in 16 fetuses at 9 - 34 weeks of gestation. 3D
   ultrasonograpby was used to obtain volumes of the whole fetal skull in
   the mid-sagittal plane. The volumes were analyzed using the rendering
   mode and transparent maximum mode in order to achieve a clear view of
   the frontal bones and the metopic suture.
   Results: At 9 weeks, a small ossification center was visible in the
   middle of each supraorbital part of the frontal bones and by 11 weeks
   the frontal bones appeared as `thick eyebrows'. In the second trimester
   there was progressive radial bone expansion and delineation of the
   metopic suture and in the third trimester there was closure of the
   metopic suture, starting from the glabella and moving upwards towards
   the anterior fontanelle.
   Conclusions: This study provides 3D ultrasound images that illustrate

Abstract = {{Purpose: Volatile anesthetics may cause local hyperalgesia and/or
   analgesia. This double-blind randomized study investigated the effect of
   these medications when applied locally on the response to a mechanical
   stimulus.
   Methods: In experiment I, standard commercial preparations of halothane
   ( mL, isoflurane 1.5 mL and sevoflurane 2.7 mL were randomly applied on
   the forearm of 30 volunteers for 30 min, after which the response to a
   mechanical stimulus was recorded. The other forearm received water as
   control. The next day, the experiment for each anesthetic was repeated
   in a reverse fashion. Thirty minutes after the application, the response
   to a standardized mechanical stimulus was recorded. In experiments 2 and
   3, the response to the same mechanical stimulus was tested after local
   applications of 2, 4, and 6 mL of halothane or after a local application
   of 5 mL sevoflurane respectively.
   Results: Low doses of the three anesthetics did not alter the response
   to the mechanical stimulus (F = 3.055, df = 1,174, P = 0.082). Two, 4,
   and 6 mL of halothane attenuated the response to the mechanical stimulus
   by 36\%, 27\% and 29\% respectively (F = 9.586, df = 1, 114, P = 0.002).
   Five millilitres of sevoflurane attenuated the response to the
   mechanical stimulus by 36\% (F = 5.111, df = 19, P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Low liquid volumes of volatile anesthetics, when applied
   locally to the skin, did not influence the response to a mechanical
   stimulus, but higher volumes attenuated this response.}},

Abstract = {{There is scant information pertaining to airborne ammonia exposures from
   either spills or common household uses of ammonia-containing floor and
   tile cleaners or from spray-on glass cleaners. We assessed instantaneous
   and event-specifc time-weighted average (TWA) exposures to airborne
   ammonia during spills and use (per label directions) of a household
   floor and tile cleaner and two spray-on window cleaners. Airborne
   ammonia levels measured at breathing zone height (BZH) above the spilled
   floor and tile cleaner product reached 500 p.p.m. within 5 min, while
   levels for spilled window cleaner were below 8 p.p.m. TWA exposures were
   assessed while tile walls and floors were cleaned in three different
   bathrooms of a residence, and during use of a spray-on glass cleaner
   while washing several large windows in an office setting. NIOSH Method
   6015 was utilized with concurrent field measurements every 60 s using a
   Drager PAC III monitor with an electrochemical cell detector. Peak
   ammonia levels ranged from 16 to 28 p.p.m. and short-term TWA
   concentrations ranged from 9.4 to 13 p.p.m. during mixing (0.1\%
   ammonia) and cleaning tiles in the three bathrooms. Ammonia exposures
   while using spray- on window cleaner were over 10-fold lower (TWA 0.65
   p.p.m.). Use of the floor and tile cleaner mixed at 0.2\% ammonia led to
   peak airborne ammonia levels within 3-5 min at 36-90 p.p.m., and use of
   full strength cleaner (3\% ammonia) led to peak ammonia levels of 125 to
   4200 p.p.m. within 2-3 min. Spillage or intentional use of the full
   strength floor and tile cleaner led to airborne ammonia concentrations
   that exceed occupational short- term exposure limits, while spillage or
   use of the spray-on window cleaner did not approach potentially
   hazardous airborne ammonia levels and likely represents a minimal
   inhalation health hazard. We conclude that routine household uses of
   ammonia are unlikely to produce significant exposures when using
   standard cleaning solutions (0.1 - 0.2\%), but spillage or use of
   concentrated ammonia solutions (e. g., 3\%) in poorly ventilated areas
   can lead to potentially hazardous airborne ammonia exposures.}},

Abstract = {{We present characteristics of a low-frequency (LF) inductively coupled
   discharge where, instead of using an inductorlike rf antenna, we used a
   ferromagnetic core with a primary winding ({''}ferroinductor{''}). A
   dense (> 10(12) cm(-3)), highly ionized (30\%-40\%) plasma was obtained
   in this ferroinductor at gas pressures as low as 10(-4) Torr. In a wide
   range of comparatively low frequencies the core and winding losses were
   found to be small compared with the LF driving power delivered to the
   plasma. The driving frequency could be very low compared with typical
   inductively coupled discharges. The input impedance was found to be
   almost purely active (cos phi approximate to 0.9), and it was possible
   to achieve various input resistances (e.g., 50 Omega) in the whole
   investigated range of frequencies, powers, and pressures, which made
   unnecessary any matching box between the LF driver and the
   ferroinductor-coupled plasma device. Such a combination of properties
   makes this kind of discharge attractive for many applications. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{The ability to achieve high strength and toughness by heat treatment is
   a primary advantage of steel alloys. However, the development of
   internal stress and geometric distortion accompanies these hardening
   processes. Simulation of heat treatment processes must include the
   evolution of microstructural phases in order to calculate the mechanical
   behavior of the composite microstructure as the alloy changes phase.
   This paper discusses an optimization method to derive the phase
   transformation kinetics parameters from dilatometry experiments. A
   discussion of a method based on the lattice parameters of individual
   phases and a method based on a lever rule for building the bridge
   between phase transformations and dilatometry strains is offered. The
   determination of kinetics parameters using an optimization algorithm was
   implemented into a commercial heat treatment simulation software
   package, DANTE (R). Using Pyrowear 53 steel as an example, the kinetics
   parameters were fit for various carbon contents. The heat treatment
   process steps for a 3-D test bar model with a notch on the top surface
   were simulated, with steps including furnace heat up, carburization, air
   transfer from the furnace to quench tank, quenching in heated oil,
   cryogenic treatment, and tempering. Because of a high amount of retained
   austenite after oil quenching, a cryogenic treatment is used to complete
   the martensite transformation in the high carbon case of the test bar.
   After the deep freeze, the test bar was tempered. The predicted
   distortion and residual stresses were verified by the experimental
   testing. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a one-dimensional model for the evolution of the damage of
   an elastic material caused by tension is considered. The model consists
   of a coupled set of differential inclusions for the elastic displacement
   and the damage fields. The model decouples, and once the damage is
   found, the elastic deformations are obtained by quadrature. The
   existence of a unique solution was proved in Fremond et al. Here, we
   deal with the numerical analysis of this problem. Using the finite
   element method to approximate the spatial variable and the backward
   Euler scheme to discretize the time derivatives, a numerical algorithm
   is proposed. Error estimates are derived and, under suitable regularity
   hypotheses, the linear convergence of the numerical scheme deduced. We
   conclude with some numerical simulations. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{3,4-Epoxycyclohexylmethyl 3,4-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate (ECH) was
   cured with different proportions of
   1,6-dioxaspiro{[}4,4]nonane-2,7-dione (s(gamma-BL)) using lanthanum
   triflate as a catalyst. DSC was used to obtain kinetic data associated
   to the curing process by means of series of non-isothermal experiments.
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflection
   mode (FT-IR/ATR) was used to study the evolution of the epoxide group in
   order to compare experimental isothermal data with simulated isothermal
   data. The complexity of the process itself enabled us to compare
   different procedures for obtaining isoconversional data and to determine
   the kinetic model that best describes the curing process.
   An increase in the proportion of s(gamma-BL) increases the speed of the
   curing process. By means of applying isoconversional methods to dynamic
   experimental data, we observed that an increase in the proportion of
   s(gamma-BL) leads to an overall decrease in the activation energy for
   the different formulations. Kinetic parameters that were determined
   using both differential and integral isoconversional procedures were
   compared. This allowed us to analyze and to discuss the usefulness of
   different methods in order to obtain a suitable kinetic triplet at each
   step of the curing of the ECH/s(gamma-BL) system using lanthanum
   triflate as a catalyst. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This report describes a high-throughput assay to identify substances
   that reduce the frequency of conjugation in Gram-negative bacteria.
   Bacterial conjugation is largely responsible for the spread of multiple
   antibiotic resistances in human pathogens. Conjugation inhibitors may
   provide a means to control the spread of antibiotic resistance. An
   automated conjugation assay was developed that used plasmid R388 and a
   laboratory strain of Escherichia coli as a model system, and
   bioluminescence as a reporter for conjugation activity, Frequencies of
   conjugation could be measured continuously in real time by the amount of
   light produced, and thus the effects of inhibitory compounds could be
   determined quantitatively. A control assay, run in parallel, allowed
   elimination of compounds affecting cell growth, plasmid stability or
   gene expression. The automated conjugation assay was used to screen a
   database of more than 12 000 microbial extracts known to contain a wide
   variety of bioactive compounds (the NatChem library). The initial hit
   rate was 1.4\%. From these, 48 extracts containing active compounds and
   representing a variety of organisms and extraction conditions were
   subjected to fractionation (24 fractions per extract). The 52 most
   active fractions were subjected to a secondary analysis to determine the
   range of plasmid inhibition. Plasmids R388, R1 and RP4 were used as
   representatives of a variety of plasmid transfer systems. Only one
   fraction (of complex composition) affected transfer of all three
   plasmids, while four other fractions were active against two of them.
   Two separate compounds were identified from these fractions: linoleic
   acid and dehydrocrepenynic; acid. Downstream analysis showed that the
   chemical class of unsaturated fatty acids act as true inhibitors of
   conjugation.}},

Abstract = {{We report a series of 26 heart transplant recipients with renal
   impairment in which sirolimus was used as the basic immunosuppresive
   drug (without associated calcineurin inhibitors) to avoid further
   nephrotoxicity. Sirolimus (trough levels 10 to 12 ng/mL, average daily
   dose 3 mg) was used in two settings: de novo in 7 patients with
   significant preexistent renal impairment and as a chronic conversion in
   19 stable patients with established renal failure (creatinine level > 2
   mg/dL).
   In all de novo patients (n = 7), the renal function significantly
   improved. Creatinine fell from 2.95 +/- 0.9 mg/dL to 1.41 +/- 0.4 mg/dL
   at follow-up (P =.0017). One patient died suddenly of a massive
   pulmonary embolism. Only one patient experienced histologic but
   reversible rejection. In one patient, anemia and diarrhea prompted
   sirolimus withdrawal. Five patients had infectious episodes: three
   bacterial pneumonias, one mediastinitis, and two CMV infections.
   In the chronic conversion group (n = 19), the improvement was mostly
   limited to patients with moderate renal failure (creatinine <= 2.5
   mg/dL) in which creatinine fell from 2.24 +/- 0.2 to 1.9 +/- 0.27 mg/dL,
   P =.009). When basal creatinine was over 2.5 mg/dL, only one third of
   the patients improved after conversion. Two patients died: terminal
   renal failure and cerebrovascular accident. There were no clinical
   episodes of rejection. Secondary effects prompted the discontinuation of
   sirolimus in five patients: two definite and one possible interstitial
   pneumonitis and two cases of anemia). The symptoms resolved after
   sirolimus withdrawal. Six patients had infection: four pneumonias, one
   sepsis, and one cutaneous abscess.
   Sirolimus is an interesting alternative to calcineurin inhibitors in
   selected patients with renal impairment. It prevents renal failure in de
   novo recipients at high risk of catastrophic renal damage and
   ameliorates renal dysfunction in chronic patients with moderate renal
   dysfunction. Given the high incidence of secondary effects, the adequate
   dosage and the secondary effects profile needs further study.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic
   accuracy of transvaginal sonographic examination of small adnexal masses
   by simple descriptive sonographic scoring. Methods. In a prospective
   multicenter study, 4 teaching hospitals and 2 regional hospitals with
   homogeneous standard sonographic equipment and operator experience
   recruited 677 consecutive patients with small adnexal masses of less
   than 5 cm. Morphologic scoring was obtained for each mass and recorded.
   The management of the mass was based on local protocols. The minimal
   requirement was that surgery had to be performed for complex masses
   scoring 8 or higher, and follow-up of at least 12 months had to be
   performed and recorded for patients not admitted to surgery. Sonographic
   results were compared with pathologic reports and follow-up findings.
   Results. Fifty-two malignant tumors (19 borderline, 15 stage I-II, 15
   stage III-IV, 2 tubal carcinomas, and 1 ovarian lymphoma), 243 benign
   tumors at pathologic examination, and 382 masses defined as benign
   according to follow-up findings were observed. Malignant tumors had a
   significantly higher mean +/- SD morphologic score (11.2 +/- 2.7) than
   benign masses (6.2 +/- 2.5) (P =.001). No difference was observed in the
   scoring assignment of malignant masses in different centers (P =.56).
   With a score of 8 or higher, the likelihood ratio was 3.61 (95\%
   confidence interval, 3.09-4.21); sensitivity, 92\%; specificity, 76.9\%;
   and positive predictive value, 25.6\%. Conclusions. Our results provide
   evidence that descriptive morphologic scoring may overcome the
   subjectivity of interpretation of morphologic characteristics in small
   masses, and, at the same time, it can incorporate criteria to avoid
   simplistic description of a complex mass.}},

   the cornea, fibrotic repair presents special challenges affecting both
   clarity and shape of the cornea. With the increasing popularity of
   surgical techniques that alter corneal refractive errors, understanding
   of cornea repair mechanisms has acquired new significance. The cornea
   has unique anatomic, cellular, molecular, and functional features that
   lead to important mechanistic differences in the process of repair in
   comparison with what occurs in skin and other organs. Moreover, corneal
   function calls for special outcomes. This review addresses these

Abstract = {{To examine in as naturalistic a setting as possible whether having an
   alcohol-induced `hangover' impairs psychomotor and cognitive
   performance.
   The sample consisted of 71 male and female social drinkers who were
   tested twice, once at baseline and once after exposure to the study
   condition. They were randomized into a control group who returned for
   testing on a prearranged date (n = 33), and a group who were instructed
   to make arrangements to return the day after a self-determined heavy
   drinking session (n = 38). Of the `hangover' group, 13 participants
   still had a blood alcohol concentration of > 1 mg/100 ml at the time of
   testing and these were analysed separately. All participants were
   students.
   Psychomotor performance was assessed by means of a battery of
   psychomotor tasks, rate of information processing was tested by the
   Speed and Capacity of Language Processing Test (SCOLP) and subjective
   state was assessed by questionnaire measures.
   All participants in the `hangover' group reported subjective and
   physical symptoms of hangover on the second testing session. Performance
   was significantly impaired on the hits-key components of the vigilance
   task, was less accurate on the primary and secondary reaction time tasks
   and showed greater dispersion in range of ability for participants in
   the `acute and hangover' compared to `control'. Probe memory revealed no
   significant group effect. Ratings of subjective state revealed
   significant group differences for the variables `ability to drive',
   `concentrate' and `react quickly' as well as `tiredness'. There were no
   group differences for performance on the SCOLP.
   Hangover had negative effects on self-reported subjective and physical

Abstract = {{Many uncertain factors affect the operation of Wastewater Treatment
   Plants. Due to the complexity of biological wastewater treatment
   processes, classical methods show significant difficulties when trying
   to control them automatically. Consequently soft computing techniques
   and, specifically, fuzzy logic appears to be a good candidate for
   controlling these ill-defined, time-varying and non-linear systems. This
   paper describes the development and implementation of a Fuzzy Logic
   Controller to regulate the aeration in the Taradell Wastewater Treatment
   Plant. The main goal of this control process is to save energy without
   decreasing the quality of the effluent discharged. The fuzzy controller
   integrates the information coming from two different signals: the
   Dissolved Oxygen and Oxidation-Reduction Potential values. The
   simulation results proved that fuzzy logic is a good tool for
   controlling the aeration of the wastewater treatment plant. The results
   obtained show that energy savings of more than 10\% can be achieved
   using aeration fuzzy control and at the same time still keeping the good
   removal levels.}},

Abstract = {{Beech seedlings were infected with the root rot pathogen Phytophthora
   citricola to study its impact on leaf physiology and water status. Net
   photosynthesis rate decreased two days after inoculation in infected
   seedlings. In contrast, electron quantum yield of photosystem II, leaf
   water potential, and total water consumption were only slightly impaired
   until 6 dpi. At the same time, wilt symptoms occurred on leaves. These
   results indicate the involvement of a mobile signal triggering the early
   changes in leaf physiology by root infection. As the elicitin gene of P.
   citricola was induced during root infection, we purified and
   characterised the elicitin protein and tested its ability to change leaf
   physiological parameters of beech and tobacco plants. P. citricola
   produced a single acidic elicitin (citricolin), which caused necrosis
   and decreased gas exchange of tobacco leaves. Furthermore, it induced an
   oxidative burst in tobacco cell suspension culture. However, none of
   these effects were observed in beech.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We present a controlled method for computing the exchange coupling in
   correlated one-dimensional electron systems based on the relation
   between the exchange constant and the pair-correlation function of
   spinless electrons. This relation is valid in several independent
   asymptotic regimes, including the low-electron-density case, under the
   general condition of a strong spin-charge separation. Explicit formulas
   for the exchange constant are obtained for thin quantum rings and wires
   with realistic Coulomb interactions by calculating the pair-correlation
   function via a many-body instanton approach. A remarkably smooth
   interpolation between high- and low-electron-density results is shown to
   be possible. These results are applicable to the case of one-dimensional
   wires of intermediate width as well. Our method can be easily
   generalized to other interaction laws, such as the inverse distance
   squared one of the Calogero-Sutherland-Moser model. We demonstrate
   excellent agreement with the known exact results for the latter model
   and show that they are relevant for a realistic experimental setup in
   which the bare Coulomb interaction is screened by an edge of a
   two-dimensional electron gas.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we studied the effects of lonchocarpin (LCC) and derricin
   (DRC), two chalcones isolated from the hexane fraction of roots from
   Lonchocarpus sericeus (Poir.) Kunth (Fabaceae), on human platelet
   aggregation induced by a variety of agonists. LCC and DRC (200 and 400
   mu g/ml) significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner adenosine 5
   `-diphosphate (ADP)-, arachidonic acid (AA)-, thrombin (THR)-, collagen
   (COL)-, and adrenalin (ADR)-induced aggregation. Neither LCC nor DRC had
   their effects potentiated after association with L-arginine (L-ARG), a
   NO donor, when the inducer was ADP. In contrast, the addition of LCC or
   DRC to pentoxifylline (PTX), a known phosphodiesterase inhibitor, caused
   a significant potentiation of platelet inhibition (41.1\% and 47.4\%)
   when compared with LCC (20.3\%) or DRC (17.9\%) alone. The addition of
   aspirin or yohimbine (YOH) to LCC or DRC did not change their effects on
   platelet aggregation induced by AA or ADR, respectively. These results
   suggest that the antiplatelet effect of LCC and DRC may be mediated
   mainly by phosphodiesterase activity inhibition or elevation of
   adenosine 3 `:5 `-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) and guanosine 3 `:5
   `-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) intracellular levels or even by inhibition
   of thromboxane (TX) formation, as these two substances inhibited the
   aggregation induced by AA, COL, and THR.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To determine the incidence of second malignancies among patients
   with Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) treated with autologous hematopoietic stem
   cell transplantation (AHSCT) compared with patients receiving
   conventional therapy alone and to identify potential risk factors for
   their occurrence.
   Patients and Methods We analyzed data on 1,732 consecutive patients with
   HL treated at the British Columbia Cancer Agency from 1976 to 2001,
   including 202 patients undergoing AHSCT. The median follow-up duration
   was 9.8 years for the whole cohort, 9.7 years for those patients treated
   with conventional therapy, and 7.8 years from AHSCT.
   Results The cumulative incidence of developing any second malignancy 15
   years after therapy for HL was 9\% (risk ratio = 3.5; P < .001);
   however, the incidence did not differ between those patients receiving
   conventional therapy alone compared with those undergoing AHSCT (10\%
   and 8\%, respectively; P = .48). In multivariate analysis, the only
   factor significantly associated with an increased risk of developing any
   second neoplasm or solid tumor was age >= 35 years (P < .0001). An
   increased risk of therapy-induced acute myeloid leukemia and
   therapy-induced myelodysplastic syndrome was seen for patients aged >=
   35 years (P = .03) and stage III/IV (P = .04).
   Conclusion Patients with HL are at increased risk of developing a second
   neoplasm. However, those patients undergoing AHSCT do not seem to be at
   greater risk compared with those patients receiving conventional therapy
   alone, at least during the first decade after therapy.}},

Abstract = {{The ``cost-benefit{''} hypothesis states that specific body organs show
   mass changes consistent with a trade-off between the importance of their
   function and cost of their maintenance. We tested four predictions from
   this hypothesis using data on non-breeding greylag geese Anser anser
   during the course of remigial moult: namely that (i) pectoral muscles
   and heart would atrophy followed by hypertrophy, (ii) leg muscles would
   hypertrophy followed by atrophy, (iii) that digestive organs and liver
   would atrophy followed by hypertrophy and (iv) fat depots be depleted.
   Dissection of geese captured on three different dates during wing moult
   on the Danish island of Saltholm provided data on locomotory muscles and
   digestive organ size that confirmed these predictions. Locomotory organs
   associated with flight showed initial atrophy (a maximum loss of 23\% of
   the initial pectoral muscle mass and 37\% heart tissue) followed by
   hypertrophy as birds regained the powers of flight. Locomotory organs
   associated with running (leg muscles, since geese habitually run to the
   safety of water from predator-type stimuli) showed initial hypertrophy
   (a maximum gain of 37\% over initial mass) followed by atrophy. The
   intestines and liver showed initial atrophy (41\% and 37\%
   respectively), consistent with observed reductions in daily time spent
   feeding during moult, followed by hypertrophy The majority of the 22\%
   loss in overall body mass (mean 760 g) during the flightless period
   involved fat utilisation, apparently consumed to meet shortfalls between
   daily energetic needs and observed rates of exogenous intake. The
   results support the hypothesis that such phenotypic plasticity in size
   of fat stores, locomotor and digestive organs can be interpreted as an
   evolutionary adaptation to meet the conflicting needs of the wing moult.}},

Abstract = {{We consider integrable Hamiltonian systems in R-2n with integrals of
   motion F = (F-1,..., F-n) in involution. Nondegenerate singularities of
   corank one are critical points of F where rank d F = n - 1 and which
   have definite linear stability. The set of corank-one nondegenerate
   singularities is a codimension-two symplectic submanifold invariant
   under the flow. We show that the Maslov index of a closed curve is a sum
   of contributions 2 from the nondegenerate singularities it encloses, the
   sign depending on the local orientation and stability at the
   singularities. For one-freedom systems this corresponds to the
   well-known formula for the Poincare index of a closed curve as the
   oriented difference between the number of elliptic and hyperbolic fixed
   points enclosed. We also obtain a formula for the Liapunov exponent of
   invariant (n - 1)-dimensional tori in the nondegenerate singular set.
   Examples include rotationally symmetric n-freedom Hamiltonians, while an
   application to the periodic Toda chain is described in a companion paper
   (Foxman and Robbins 2005 Nonlinearity 18 2795-813).}},

Abstract = {{This is a retrospective study on the superficial mycoses due to
   Trichophyton violaceum in the greater Athens area for the last 15 years
   - 1989-2003. During this period 104 patients were found to have an
   infection due to T. violaceum- an incidence rate of 0.75\% of all
   dermatophytosis. Of the patients 59 were Greeks, 15 Greek Gypsies and 30
   immigrants mostly from Albania (50\%). Of them 58 were children, 46
   adults (mainly women, 34 cases). Trichophyton violaceum infection was
   presented with a variety of manifestations (127 cases). The prevailing
   was tinea capitis present in 85 patients - 57 children, 24 women and
   four men (women : men 6 : 1). Tinea capitis together with other forms of
   the infection was found in 14 patients. Tinea facie, corporis, manuum,
   barbae and unguium were seen in nineteen patients. The isolation rate of
   T. violaceum infection in the Greek population remained at a low level

Abstract = {{Although long-delay learning has been demonstrated numerous times in the
   conditioned taste avoidance procedure, the empirical evidence showing
   this is almost exclusively limited to studies using emetics. Given that
   compounds outside the emetic class (e.g. drugs of abuse) are also
   effective in inducing conditioned taste avoidances, the present study
   assessed the ability of cocaine, a nonemetic psychoactive compound, to
   support long-delay conditioning as the unconditioned stimulus in
   conditioned taste avoidance preparation. Using saccharin as the
   conditioned stimulus, two taste-drug pairings were followed by six
   extinction trials during which saccharin was presented without
   subsequent injections of cocaine. During the two conditioning trials,
   animals were injected subcutaneously with cocaine (32 mg/kg) at
   different conditioned stimulus-unconditioned stimulus intervals, that
   is, 10, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 420 and 540 min. A control group of
   animals was given an equivolume injection of the drug vehicle at the
   10-min conditioned stimulus-unconditioned stimulus interval. After two
   conditioning trials, all treatment groups consumed significantly less
   saccharin than controls, with the magnitude of the effect decreasing as
   the conditioned stimulus-unconditioned stimulus interval increased.
   After six extinction trials, animals injected with cocaine at 10, 60 and
   120 min conditioned stimulus-unconditioned stimulus intervals still
   consumed significantly less than controls. These results with cocaine
   suggest that taste avoidance learning over long delays is not limited to
   classical emetic compounds and may, in fact, be characteristic of taste
   avoidance learning in general.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic metabolic acidosis stimulates net calcium efflux from bone due
   to increased osteoclastic bone resorption and decreased osteoblastic
   collagen synthesis. Previously, we determined that incubation of
   neonatal mouse calvariae in medium simulating physiological metabolic
   acidosis leads to a significant, cyclooxygenase-dependent, increase in
   RNA for bone cell receptor activator of NF-kappa B ligand (RANKL)
   compared with incubation in neutral pH medium. In this study, we tested
   the hypothesis that the acid-mediated increase in RANKL expression is a
   primary mechanism for the stimulated osteoclastic resorption. Acid
   medium increased the medium concentration of sRANKL without altering the
   concentration of the decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG). Inhibition of
   the RANKL pathway with concentrations of OPG up to 25 ng/ml, far greater
   than physiological, did not significantly decrease the robust
   acid-induced Ca efflux from bone nor did incubation of the calvariae
   with a different inhibitor, RANK/Fc (up to 50 ng/ml). Thus acid-induced
   net Ca efflux appears to involve mechanisms in addition to the RANK/
   RANKL pathway. Osteoblasts also produce TNF-alpha, another cytokine that
   stimulates the maturation and activity of osteoclasts. Incubation of
   calvariae in acid medium caused a significant increase in TNF-alpha
   levels. Incubation of calvariae with anti-TNF (up to 250 ng/ml) did not
   significantly decrease acid-induced net Ca efflux. However, the
   combination of RANK/Fc plus anti-TNF caused a significant but subtotal
   reduction in acid-induced Ca efflux, whereas the combination of RANK/Fc
   plus an isotype-matched control for the anti-TNF had no effect on Ca
   release. Thus simultaneous inhibition of RANKL and TNF-alpha is
   necessary to reduce acid-induced, cell-mediated net Ca efflux from bone;
   however, additional osteoblast-produced factors must also be involved in
   acid-induced, cell-mediated bone resorption.}},

Abstract = {{Members of the DCC family play key roles in axon guidance in vertebrates

   full-length zebrafish dcc. Zebrafish DCC shares the typical structure of
   the DCC subgroup of the immunoglobulin superfamily, consisting of four
   immunoglobulin and six fibronectin-type III repeats in the extracellular
   domain, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain with
   three conserved motifs. As a first step toward studying the function of
   dcc, we analyzed its sequence and characterized its expression pattern
   during embryonic and larval development. dcc is expressed highly in
   brain and spinal cord, but distinct staining was also observed in
   developing pectoral fins, pancreas, intestine, and heart. Thus, dcc may
   play roles not only in axon guidance, but in morphogenesis and
   functioning of these organs as well.}},

Abstract = {{Residual stresses due to the welding process in steel structures can
   significantly affect the fatigue behaviour. Usually, high tensile
   residual stresses up to the yield strength are conservatively assumed at
   the weld toes. This conservative assumption can result in misleading
   fatigue assessments. Areas with compressive residual stresses may be
   present in complex structures, where the details are less critical than
   predicted. This is shown in the paper by the example of fillet-welded
   stiffener ends, where beneficial compressive residual stresses cause the
   initiation of fatigue cracks at other locations in less-strained areas.
   Another example for the effects of residual stresses concerns the stress
   initiation and propagation at a structural detail under fully
   compressive load cycles. Fatigue cracks are possible here due to high
   tensile residual stress fields. The conclusion is that the
   welding-induced residual stresses should be known in advance for a
   reliable fatigue assessment, which becomes possible to an increasing
   extent by numerical welding simulation.}},

Abstract = {{During their first year of life, infants not only acquire probabilistic
   knowledge about the phonetic, prosodic, and phonotactic organization of
   their native language, but also begin to establish first
   lexical-semantic representations. The present study investigated the
   sensitivity to phonotactic regularities and its impact on semantic
   processing in 1-year-olds. We applied the method of event-related brain
   potentials to 12- and 19-month-old children and to an adult control
   group. While looking at pictures of known objects, subjects listened to
   spoken nonsense words that were phonotactically legal (pseudowords) or
   had phonotactically illegal word onsets (nonwords), or to real words
   that were either congruous or, incongruous to the picture contents. In
   19-month-olds and in adults, incongruous words and pseudowords, but not
   non-words, elicited an N400 known to reflect mechanisms of words,
   semantic integration. For congruous words, the N400 was attenuated by
   semantic priming. In contrast, 12-month-olds did not show an N400
   difference, neither between pseudo- and nonwords nor between incongruous
   and congruous words. Both 1-year-old groups and adults additionally
   displayed a lexical priming effect for congruous words, that is, a
   negativity starting around 100 msec after words onset. One-year-olds,
   moreover, displayed a phonotactic familiarity effect, that is, a widely
   distributed negativity starting around 250 msec in 19-month-olds but
   occurring later in 12-month-olds. The results imply that both lexical
   priming and phonotactic familiarity already affect the processing of
   acoustic stimuli in children at 12 months of age. In 19-month-olds,
   adult-like mechanisms of semantic integration are present in response to
   phonotactically legal, but not to phonotactically illegal, non-sense
   words, indicating that children at this age treat pseudo- sense
   pseudowords, but not nonwords, as potential word candidates.}},

Abstract = {{DAP kinases are a family of serine/threonine kinases known to regulate
   intrinsic apoptotic processes. DAP-related apoptotic kinase-2 (DRAK2) is
   highly expressed in lymphoid organs, with differential expression during
   thymocyte development. Low levels of transcript were observed in CD4/CD8
   double-positive (DP) and double-negative populations, whereas
   single-positive thymocytes possessed elevated levels. Ex vivo
   stimulation of DP thymocytes with phorbol myristate acetate or
   antibodies that activate the TCR complex led to the accumulation of
   DRAK2 in a protein kinase C- and MAP Kinase-dependent fashion. Although
   DAP kinase family members are thought to potentiate apoptosis, ectopic
   expression of DRAK2 using retroviral transduction of primary T cells and
   NIH3T3 fibroblasts failed to decrease rates of survival, suggesting that
   DRAK2 expression is not sufficient to promote apoptosis. Rather, our
   results demonstrate that DRAK2 is a primary response gene activated by
   TCR stimulation in DP thymocytes. Further, we observed that DRAK2
   controlled the threshold for calcium signaling in the thymus since
   positively selected Drak2-deficient thymocytes displayed a reduced
   requirement for TCR cross-linking. These findings are consistent with a
   role for DRAK2 in thymocyte selection and lymphoid maturation, and
   demonstrate that DRAK2 transduces non-apoptotic signals during thymocyte
   differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{PGE2 and PGI2 stimulate renin secretion and cAMP accumulation in
   juxtaglomerular granular (JG) cells. We addressed, at the single-cell
   level, the receptor subtypes and intracellular transduction mechanisms
   involved. Patch clamp was used to determine cell capacitance (C-m),
   current, and membrane voltage in response to PGE2, EP2 and EP4 receptor
   agonists, and an IP receptor agonist. PGE(2) (0.1 mu mol/l) increased
   C-m significantly, and the increase was abolished by intracellular
   application of the protein kinase A antagonist Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS.
   EP2-selective ligands butaprost (1 mu mol/l), AE1-259-01 (1 nmol/l),
   EP4-selective agonist AE1-329 (1 nmol/l), and IP agonist iloprost (1 mu
   mol/l) significantly increased C-m mediated by PKA. The EP4 antagonist
   AE3-208 (10 nmol/l) blocked the effect of EP4 agonist but did not alter
   the response to PGE2. Application of both EP4 antagonist and EP2-
   antagonist AH-6809 abolished the effects of PGE(2) on C-m and current.
   EP2 and EP4 ligands stimulated cAMP formation in JG cells. PGE(2)
   rapidly stimulated renin secretion from superfused JG cells and
   diminished the membrane-adjacent granule pool as determined by confocal
   microscopy. The membrane potential hyperpolarized significantly after
   PGE2, butaprost, AE1-329 and AE1-259 and outward current was augmented
   in a PKA-dependent fashion. PGE2-stimulated outward current, but not Cm
   change, was abolished by the BKCa channel inhibitor iberiotoxin (300
   nmol/l). EP2 and EP4 mRNA was detected in sampled JG cells, and the
   preglomerular and glomerular vasculature was immunopositive for EP4.
   Thus IP, EP2, and EP4 receptors are associated with JG cells, and their
   activation leads to rapid PKA-mediatedexocytotic fusion and release of
   renin granules.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) is one option for
   reducing the risk of a second breast cancer in women with a personal and
   family history of breast cancer. Few data are available regarding
   satisfaction, psychological, and social function after CPM. The purpose
   of this research is to evaluate women's long-term satisfaction with CPM,
   factors influencing satisfaction, and psychological and social function
   after CPM.
   Patients and Methods This was a descriptive study of all women with a
   family history of breast cancer, known to be alive, who elected CPM at
   Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) between 1960 and 1993 (n = 621). Ninety-four
   percent of the women (n = 583) completed a study-specific questionnaire.
   Results A mean of 10.3 years after the procedure, the majority of women
   (83\%) were satisfied with their CPM. A smaller number were neutral
   (8\%) or dissatisfied (9\%). Women who had a subcutaneous mastectomy had
   more problems with reconstruction, and fewer of these women were
   satisfied than women with simple mastectomy. Decreased satisfaction with
   CPM was associated with decreased satisfaction with appearance,
   complications with reconstruction, reconstruction after CPM, and
   increased level of stress in life. The majority of women experienced no
   change or favorable effects in self-esteem (83\%), level of stress in
   life (83\%), and emotional stability (88\%). Satisfaction with body
   appearance, feelings of femininity, and sexual relationships were the
   most adversely affected with 33\%, 26\%, and 23\% of the women
   responding negatively.
   Conclusion Although most women are satisfied with CPM, each woman should
   weigh the benefits alongside the potential adverse effects.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To evaluate the incidence of dry eye in rheumatoid arthritis
   (RA) patients with or without Sjogren syndrome (SS), and to investigate
   the correlation between dry eye and RA activity.
   DESIGN: Prospective case-control study.
   METHODS: In 72 RA patients, the severity of dry eye was assessed by the
   Schirmer test, tear break,up time, rose bengal staining, and fluorescein
   staining. The RA activity was evaluated by the Lansbury index (LI),
   which is based on the duration of morning stiffness, erythrocyte
   sedimentation rate (ESR), grip strength, and joint score.
   RESULTS: Ten percent of patients met the Japanese criteria for SS. No
   difference in dry eye tests or LI was observed between SS patients and
   non-SS patients. Even in the non,SS group, 90\% of patients were
   diagnosed with probable dry eye. In SS patients, positive correlations
   were observed between LI and Schirmer test (P = .048), ESR and Schirmer
   test (P = .035), ESR and rose bengal staining (P = .001), and grip
   strength and rose bengal staining (P = .047). No such correlations were
   observed in the non-SS patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Dry eye is common in RA patients, including those without
   SS. We found that there was a correlation between LI and Schirmer test
   in RA patients with SS, but no correlation when the entire group was
   analyzed. Dry eye always should be taken into consideration regardless
   of the RA activity, because the severity of dry eye is independent of RA
   activity.}},

Abstract = {{Sequential segmentation from a posterior ``proliferative zone{''} is
   considered to be the primitive mechanism of segmentation in arthropods.
   Several studies of embryonic and post-embryonic development and gene
   expression suggest that this occurs in all major arthropod taxa.
   Sequential segmentation is often associated with the idea of posterior
   production of body units that accumulate along the main body axis.
   However, the precise mechanism of sequential segmentation has not been
   identified yet, and, while searching for the genetic circuitry able to
   generate a first periodic pattern in the embryo, we can at least outline
   the distinctive role in segmentation of a proliferative zone. A perusal
   of myriapod segmentation patterns suggests that these patterns result
   from multi-layered developmental processes, where gene expression and
   epigenetic mechanisms interact in a nonstrictly hierarchical way. The
   posterior zone is possibly a zone of periodic signal production, but, in
   general, the resulting segmental pattern is not completely attributable
   to the activity of the signal generator. In this sense, a posterior
   proliferative zone would be more a ``segmental organizer{''} than a
   ``segment generator.{''}}},

Abstract = {{The uptake of resources from the environment is a vital process for all
   organisms. Many experimental studies have revealed that the rate at
   which this process occurs depends critically on the resource
   concentration, a relationship called ``functional response.{''} However,
   whether the concentration of the consumer normally affects the
   functional response has been the subject of a long-standing,
   predominantly theoretical, debate in ecology. Here we present an
   experimental test between the alternative hypotheses that food uptake
   depends either only on the resource concentration or on both the
   resource and the consumer concentrations. In short-term laboratory
   experiments, we measured the uptake of radioactively labeled,
   unicellular green algae (Monoraphidium minutum, resource) by the rotifer
   Brachionus calyciflorus (a consumer) for varying combinations of
   resource and consumer concentrations. We found that the food uptake by
   Brachionus depended on the algal concentration with the relationship
   best described by a Holling type 3 functional response. We detected
   significant consumer effects on the functional response only at an
   extraordinarily high Brachionus density (similar to 125 rotifers/mL),
   which by far exceeds concentrations normally encountered in the field.
   We conclude that con sumer-dependent food uptake by planktonic rotifers
   is a phenomenon that can occur under extreme conditions, but probably
   plays a minor role in natural environments.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa, NovoSeven,
   NovoNordiskA/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) has shown benefits in hemophilic
   patients and recently in transplant recipients. This study presents our
   experiences with rFVIIa in complicated liver transplant recipients.
   Methods. From May 2001 to August 2004, rFVIIa was administered to 7
   patients undergoing liver transplantation. All treatments were made on
   emergency bases, except for 1 case with hemophilia A, who received
   prophylactic treatment. The drug was delivered when severe bleeding with
   coagulopathy persisted despite the usual treatment with blood products.
   The drug doses were 60-90 mu g/kg; the results were evaluated clinically
   and analytically.
   Results. Seven patients undergoing liver transplantation were treated
   with FVIIa. Mean prothrombin times before and after treatment were 17.5
   and 10.9 seconds, respectively, with a mean reduction of 7.2 seconds (P
   = .03). Mean thromboplastin times before and after treatment were 38.1
   and 29.4 seconds, respectively, with a mean reduction of 8.7 seconds (P
   = .034). The average dose was 83.6 mu g/kg, leading to decreased
   consumption of blood products (P < .01). In all cases, rFVIIa allowed
   sufficient hemostasis to carry on definitive treatment. There was no
   mortality in this series.
   Conclusions. These results provide new evidence on the potential
   benefits of rFVIIa in liver transplantation, especially for rescue
   therapy in cases of severe bleeding.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. To examine size and distortion of popliteal aneurysms (PA)
   in relation to symptoms produced at presentation.
   Methods. A prospective study of all PA presenting to a single unit
   1988-1994. Wherever possible patients underwent angiography, duplex
   scanning and measurement of both PA diameter and the most proximal angle
   of distortion. Symptoms and measurements were noted at the time of first
   presentation.
   Results. Seventy-three patients presented with 116 PA. At initial
   diagnosis 44 PA (38\%) were asymptomatic and 39 (34\%) produced acute
   ischaemia. As the PA increased in diameter so did the degree of
   distortion (p < 0.0001). Size and distortion were greater in PA
   producing acute ischaemia or acute thrombosis than in asymptomatic PA (p
   < 0.01). Degree of distortion differentiated symptomatic from
   asymptomatic PA (p = 0.0066). Size was not significantly different
   between these two groups. For PA 3 cm or larger in diameter with greater
   than 45 degrees distortion sensitivity, specificity and positive and
   negative predictive values for thrombosis were 90, 89, 83 and 94\%,
   respectively.
   Conclusion. Distortion and size can differentiate between PA producing
   different symptoms. Combining the two provides a reliable method of
   differentiating PA which should be managed by early elective repair.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this trial was to evaluate the effects of diet and
   cooling in the holding pen before milking on rectal temperature,
   respiration rate and milk production and composition. Fifty-eight
   lactating Holstein cows were used in a factorial split-plot design, at
   Rafaela Experimental Station from 12 January to 3 March 2003. The
   treatments were combinations of two diets: control (CD) and balanced
   (BD) with two levels of cooling before milking: none (NSF) and a
   sprinkler and fans (SF). Forage:concentrate ratios for CD and BD were
   81:19 and 68:32, respectively. Cows were milked twice daily. Milk
   production was recorded daily, and milk composition (fat, protein,
   lactose and urea) was analysed twice a week. The physiological data were
   recorded once a week, before the cattle entered the holding pen and
   after milking, in the afternoon. Average maximum weekly temperature
   humidity index was 75.4 and ranged from 61.4 to 83. There were highly
   significant effects of cooling on physiological responses. Milk
   production was affected by diet and cooling, with no interaction; the
   highest and lowest production of milk was 22.42 and 20.07 l/cow per day,
   for BD+SF and CD+NSF, respectively. Protein was affected by diet, and
   was higher for BD (3.17 vs. 3.08\%). There were interaction effects on
   milk fat at the 8\% level, the highest concentration being 3.65\% for
   BD+NFS. It was concluded that under grazing conditions, cooling by
   sprinkler and fans before milking improves the comfort of dairy cows,
   and that the effects on milk production and composition are enhanced
   when diets are specially formulated for heat-stress periods.}},

   of this work was to identify and characterize the species of
   Cladosporium, detected in coffee fruits, and study the dynamics of
   colonization of the fruits during the maturation process. The species
   found on coffee fruits was identified as Cladosporium cladosporioides

Abstract = {{Optical coherence tomography (OCT) appears to be a promising technique
   to study skin in vivo. As part of an exploratory study to investigate UV
   induced effects non-invasively we aimed to evaluate the kinetics of
   acute UVB- as well as UVA1 induced skin alterations by means of OCT, and
   to correlate the results obtained with routine histology. Twelve healthy
   subjects received daily 60 J/cm(2) of UVA1 and 1.5 minimal erythema
   doses of UVB on their upper back over three consecutive days. One day
   (24 h) after the last UV exposure, OCT measurements and skin biopsies
   were performed in four subjects (day 1) on the centre of the irradiated
   sites and an adjacent non-irradiated control site. The same procedure
   was performed in four subjects 3 days and 6 days after irradiation,
   respectively. Prior to OCT assessment two waterproof marks were drawn on
   the centre of UVB and UVA1 exposed sites and the control site. The OCT
   scanner, SkinDex 300, was used in the RI1D measurement modus in order to
   investigate morphological features, epidermal thickness, and scattering
   coefficients. Immediately after OCT assessment, 4 mm punch biopsies were
   taken from the previously marked sites. OCT as well as histological
   examinations performed on day 1, 3, and 6, revealed markedly higher
   values for epidermal thickness on UVB exposed skin sites, and slightly
   increased epidermal thickening in UVA1 exposed sites. UVB exposed sites
   showed disruption of the entrance signal in the B-scan of OCT resulting
   in a thickened layer with a signal-poor centre corresponding to
   hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis as confirmed by routine histology.
   Surprisingly, the mean scattering coefficients of the epidermis were
   slightly lower on UVA1 exposed sites, as compared to non-irradiated
   skin. By contrast, the scattering coefficient of the upper dermis of
   UVA1 irradiated skin was hardly altered. Moreover, the scattering
   coefficient of the upper dermis assessed on UVB exposed skin on day 1
   was clearly smaller than the scattering coefficient observed on
   non-irradiated and UVA1 exposed skin. Conclusively, it was possible to
   demonstrate by means of OCT differences of epidermal thickness and
   pathological features of the stratum corneum following UV exposure. UVA1
   induced epidermal pigmentation as well as UVB induced dermal
   inflammation may affect the light attenuation in the tissue indicated by
   a decrease of the scattering coefficient. OCT seems to be a useful tool
   to monitor UV induced effects in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{The clinical safety, efficacy and acceptability of mifepristone and
   misoprostol in the Indian context have been well studied, but little is
   known about how they are being used, who is using them, how women access
   them or how providers, chemists, women and their partners perceive
   medical abortion. This paper reports on part of a study on these issues,
   a survey of 209 chemists, in the Indian states of Bihar and Jharkhand in
   2004. It found that only 34\% of the interviewed chemists stocked
   mifepristone and misoprostol, soles volumes were low and there was more
   demand for cheaper, often ineffective preparations for abortion. Men
   were more likely to buy abortifacient drugs than women. Chemists knew
   mifepristone and misoprostol were prescription drugs but less about
   dosage and side effects. Most sales appeared to be prescription driven,
   but some over-the-counter sales did occur, especially when ability to
   pay seemed high or the chemist knew the customer. Chemists need accurate
   information on the drugs they sell as abortifacients, encouragement to
   promote pregnancy tests, training in encouraging women to see a provider
   prior to purchase, and visual and written material to hand out Better
   adherence to existing regulations for all prescription drugs is
   important, but the best course is to increase the availability of
   low-cost, safe abortion services at primary Care level. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{The Advanced Thin Ionization Calorimeter (ATIC) balloon-borne experiment
   is designed to perform cosmic-ray elemental spectra measurements from 50
   GeV to 100TeV for nuclei from hydrogen to iron. These measurements are
   expected to provide information about some of the most fundamental
   questions in astroparticle physics today. ATIC's design centers on an 18
   radiation length (X-0) deep bismuth germanate (BGO) calorimeter,
   preceded by a 0.75 lambda(int) graphite target. In September 1999, the
   ATIC detector was exposed to high-energy beams at CERN's SPS accelerator
   within the framework of the development program for the Advanced
   Cosmic-ray Composition Experiment for the Space Station (ACCESS). In
   December 2000-January 2001 and again in December 2002-January 2003, ATIC
   flew on the first two of a series of long-duration balloon (LDB) flights
   from McMurdo Station, Antarctica. We present here results from the 1999
   beam tests, including energy resolutions for electrons and protons at
   several beam energies from 100 to 375 GeV as well as signal linearity
   and collection efficiency estimates. We show how these results compare
   with expectations based on simulations and their expected impacts on
   mission performance. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Medium-density fibreboard (MDF) was produced from fibres treated with
   maleated polypropylene wax. The objectives of this study were to improve
   the dimensional stability of MDF panels by this treatment; to observe
   the maleated polypropylene wax distribution within the MDF panels using
   conventional fluorescence microscopy; and to determine the effects of
   the treatment on the mechanical properties and vertical density profile
   of the panels. MDF panels were produced from two resin types
   (urea-formaldehyde and melamine-urea-formaldehyde) and three maleated
   polypropylene wax contents (0, 3 and 5\%). Photomicrographs show that
   maleated polypropylene wax forms agglomerates within the MDF panels
   which is an evidence of its poor distribution in our experimental
   conditions. Our results show an important reduction on thickness
   swelling and water absorption after water soaking for panels produced
   from treated fibres. Linear expansion and contraction in adsorption and
   desorption conditions between 80 and 50\% relative humidity increased
   following fibre treatment. However, thickness swelling and shrinkage in
   similar conditions showed an important reduction following fibre
   treatment. The fibre treatment did not have negative effects on the
   mechanical properties or the vertical density profile of MDF panels. The
   modulus of rupture and modulus of elasticity in bending were increased
   by the treatment independently of maleated polypropylene wax content.
   The internal bond strength increased following the addition of 5\%
   maleated polypropylene wax content.}},

   the molar ratio of scandium and gallium in the investigated composition,
   and consequently on the mean cationic radius at the Al3+ sites. The

Abstract = {{Based on the ab initio calculations of the electron structure, it is
   shown that nitrogen and hydrogen in the iron increase the state density
   at the Fermi level, whereas carbon decreases it, which is consistent
   with the available experimental data of conduction electron spin
   resonance. The results of calculations and measurements of the strain
   dependent internal friction and Snoek-Koster relaxation are used for the
   analysis of the interaction between dislocations and mobile or immobile
   interstitial atoms. It is shown that, if the moving dislocations in the
   iron-based austenite and ferrite are accompanied by the clouds of
   interstitial atoms, nitrogen and hydrogen increase the velocity of
   dislocations, whereas carbon decreases it. The obtained results are
   interpreted in terms of the local change in the density of free
   electrons within the dislocation atmospheres resulting in the
   corresponding change in the line tension of dislocations. Possible
   consequences for mechanical properties are discussed using the examples
   of hydrogen embrittlement and nitrogen-caused quasi-cleavage of
   austenitic steels. (c) 2005 Acta Materialia, Inc. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Periprosthetic infection is a significant complication in joint
   replacement surgery and develops in 0.5-2\% of cases. Staphylococcus
   aureus and commensal microorganisms of the skin, especially
   coagulase-negative staphylococci, as well as a broad spectrum of other
   potential pathogens typically already colonize the surface of the
   foreign body at the time of implantation. Specific mechanisms such as
   bacterial adhesion to host factors absorbed in the material, biofilm
   formation, and a metabolic adaptation of adherent microorganisms play a
   particularly important role in the pathogenesis and course of the
   disease. Microbiological diagnosis requires to some extent complex
   culture procedures of puncture specimens or tissue removed during
   surgery; this can be supplemented by modern molecular testing.
   Antimicrobial treatment must be conceived as a synopsis of clinical
   picture, confirmed pathogen, and the intended surgical procedure on an
   individual basis and is routinely administered as combination therapy
   for several weeks, sometimes also as sequential therapy. Validated
   preventive measures in joint replacement surgery include mandatory

Abstract = {{Phosphorus contents and phosphorus-releasing bacteria were characterized

   soluable inorganic phosphate (WSIP) in water bodies were as high as the

   phosphorus were 2 major forms of phosphorus existing in the sediments.
   Enumeration cif inorganic phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (IPB) and
   organic phosphorus-mineralizing bacteria (OPB) with culture-dependent
   method showed that these bacterial groups were not very rich in the
   ecosystem. Molecular identification and phylogenetic analysis of the
   predominant IPB and OPB strains indicated that there existed various
   kinds of bacteria participating in the phosphorus release. Laboratory
   tests on phosphorus release abilities showed IPB strains could liberate
   more than 50 mu g ml(-1), while OPB strains produced less than 2 mu g
   ml(-1) WSIP every day. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and renin-angiotensin system
   blockers (RAB) to prevent and treat chronic graft nephropathy may affect
   the incidence of anemia in renal transplant recipients. We compared 2
   sets of cadaver-donor recipients, namely those followed at the end of
   1995 (group 1; n = 252) versus 2003 (group 2; n = 530) in terms of
   general characteristics, incidence of anemia (hemoglobin {[}Hb] <= 13
   g/L males, 12 g/L females) or severe anemia (Hb <= 11 g/L males, 10 g/L
   females) and use cost of treatment with erythropoietin (EPO). Group 2
   was significantly older, heavier and longer since grafting. Fifty-seven
   percent received MMF, 21\% received azathioprine, and 5\% received
   rapamycin. In group 1, 83\% were given azathioprine. RAB were
   administered to 35.1\% in group 2 versus 14.7\% in group I (P <.001).
   Mean blood pressure was identical in the 2 groups, but graft function
   was worse in group 2 (Cockroft, 62 vs 74 mL/min; P <.001). Mean Hb
   levels (13.66 + - 3.1 vs 13.82 + - 1.7 g/L) and prevalence of anemia
   (36.9\% vs 34.5\%) for groups 1 and 2, respectively, were similar. The
   rate of severe anemia, however, was lower in group 2 (2.3 \% vs 8.7\%; P
   <.001). The use of EPO increased from 2.8\% (group 1) to 8.7\% (group 2;
   P <.01). In 2003, the cost of EPO was calculated at 1982
   euros/patient-year and 91,150 euros per year for the whole patient
   group. Despite accumulation of predisposing factors, the control of
   anemia in our patients has improved due to the expanded use of EPO.
   Along with its high cost, EPO therapy has potential positive
   repercussions on the quality of life and patient prognosis. Therefore,
   we need to precisely define the optimal use of EPO in renal transplant
   recipients.}},

Abstract = {{The scope of the present paper is to study the perspectives of using
   lignocellulosic fibrous plant residues as fillers of thermoplastic
   polymers. Those natural fibres are low-cost by-products,
   environmental-friendly and practically sustainable raw materials. The
   lignocellulosic materials used in this study were both untreated and
   pre-treated residues from eucalyptus wood, ground corncob, and brewery's
   spent grain. Polymer matrices of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and PVC
   plastisol were used, to prepare composite specimens with different
   amounts (10-50 phr) of lignocellulosic fillers. These specimens were
   tested for their mechanical properties, and additional assessment was
   made via measurements of their surface hardness and observations by
   stereoscopic optical microscopy. The results of this study show that
   loading of LDPE with natural fibres leads to a decrease in tensile
   strength of the pure polymer. On the other hand, the Young's modulus
   increases due to the higher stiffness of the fibres. Although the
   properties of some blends are acceptable for some applications, further
   improvement will be necessary, mainly by optimising fibre-polymer
   interface characteristics. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Vitamin D supplements have been used to prevent fractures. The effect
   may be mediated through increased bone mass, but also through reduced
   falling propensity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   association between 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels (25OHD), fall-associated
   variables (including tests of functional performance), and fracture in
   ambulatory women. At baseline 25OHD was measured in 986 women.
   Fall-associated variables were investigated at baseline. Fractures were
   recorded during a 3-year follow-up. Four percent of the women had 25OHD
   levels below 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/l), and 26\% had 25OHD levels below 30
   ng/ml (75 nmol/l). 25OHD correlated with gait speed ( r =0.17, P <
   0.001), the Romberg balance test ( r =0.14, P < 0.001), self-estimated
   activity level ( r =0.15, P < 0.001), and thigh muscle strength ( r
   =0.08, P =0.02). During the 3-year follow-up, 119 out of the 986 women
   sustained at least one fracture. The Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR)
   (95\% confidence interval) for sustaining a fracture during the
   follow-up was 2.04 (1.04-4.04) for the group of women with 25OHD below
   20 ng/ml, in which 9 out of 43 women sustained a fracture. Thirty-two of
   the 256 women with 25OHD levels below 30 ng/ml sustained a fracture
   during the follow-up, with a non-significant HR of 1.07 (1.07-1.61).
   This cohort of elderly, ambulatory women had a high mean 25OHD. A low
   25OHD was associated with inferior physical activity level, gait speed
   and balance. A 25OHD level below 30 ng/ml was not associated with an
   increased risk of fractures in this study. However, a subgroup of women
   with 25OHD levels below 20 ng/ml had a tendency to an increased risk of
   fractures, which may be associated with an inferior physical activity
   and postural stability.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic environment within the bioreactor and in the purification
   equipment is known to affect the activity and yield of enzyme
   production. In the present work, the effect of hydrodynamic flow
   parameters (P-G/V, epsilon(max), (tau) over bar (S), tau(S,max), (tau)
   over bar (N) and tau(N,max)) and interfacial flow parameters ((epsilon)
   over bar (G), (a) under bar and k(L)(a) under bar) on the activity of
   lipase has been comprehensively investigated in bubble column reactors.
   Lipase solution was subjected to hydrodynamic flow parameters in 0.15
   and 0.385 m i.d. bubble column reactors over a wide range of superficial
   gas velocity (0.01 < V-G < 0.4-ms(-1)). The flow parameters were
   estimated using an in-house CFD simulation code based on k-epsilon
   approach. The extent of lipase deactivation in both the columns was
   found to increase with an increase in hydrodynamic and interfacial flow
   parameters. However, at equal value of any of these parameters, the
   extent of deactivation was different in the two columns. The rate of
   deactivation was found to follow first order kinetics. An attempt has
   been made to develop rational correlations for the extent of
   deactivation as well as for the deactivation constant. The rate of
   deactivation was found to be depending on the average turbulent normal
   stress and interfacial flow parameters such as bubble diameter and
   bubble rise velocity. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{From 1997 to 1999, the prevalence of Salmonella was assessed at
   different stages through the pork, poultry, and beef meat production
   chains. Different dilutions of the initial sample suspension were
   analyzed to provide a semiquantitative evaluation of Salmonella
   contamination and to determine the most representative dilution
   necessary to detect a reduction in prevalence. An average of 300 samples
   for each type of meat were analyzed. According to Fisher's exact test,
   the dilution to be used to detect a reduction in prevalence was chosen
   based on an initial prevalence of 20 to 26\%. Based on this introductory
   study, a new sampling plan representative of the nationwide Belgian meat
   production process was used from 2000 through to 2003. This study
   confirmed the consistently high rate and level of contamination of
   poultry meat: broiler and layer carcasses were the most contaminated
   samples followed by broiler fillets and poultry meat preparations. A
   constant and significant decrease in Salmonella prevalence was observed
   for pork carcasses, trimmings, and minced meat and for beef minced meat.
   Less than 3\% of beef carcasses and trimming samples were positive for
   Salmonella. The Belgian plan, as utilized from 2000 to 2003, was
   suitable for monitoring of zoonoses because the sampling plan was
   representative of nationwide production processes, covered all periods
   of the year, and was executed by trained samplers and the analyses were
   carried out by recognized laboratories using an identical analytical
   method.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of sole and intercropping of field pea (Pisum sativum L.) and
   spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) on crop yield, fertilizer and soil
   nitrogen (N) use was tested on a sandy loam soil at three levels of urea
   fertilizer N (0, 4 and 8 g N m(-2)) applied at sowing. The N-15
   enrichment and natural abundance techniques were used to determine N
   accumulation in the crops from the soil, fertilizer and symbiotic N-2
   fixation. Intercrops of pea and wheat showed maximum productivity
   without the supply of N fertilizer. Intercropping increased total dry
   matter (DM) and N yield, grain DM and N yield, grain N concentration,
   the proportion of N derived from symbiotic N-2 fixation, and soil N
   accumulation. With increasing fertilizer N supply, intercropped and sole
   cropped wheat responded with increased yield, grain N yield and soil N
   accumulation, whereas the opposite was the case for pea. Fertilizer N
   enhanced the competitive ability of intercropped wheat recovering up to
   90\% of the total intercrop fertilizer N acquisition and decreased the
   proportion of pea in the intercrop, but without influencing the total
   intercrop grain yield. As a consequence, Land Equivalent Ratios
   calculated on basis of total DM production decreased from a maximum of
   1.34 to as low as 0.85 with increased fertilizer N supply. The study
   suggests that pea-wheat intercropping is a cropping strategy that use N
   sources efficiently due to its spatial self-regulating dynamics where
   pea improve its interspecific competitive ability in areas with lower
   soil N levels, and vice versa for wheat, paving way for future option to
   reduce N inputs and negative environmental impacts of agricultural crop
   production.}},

   oligomerization domain 2 (CARD15/NOD2) gene have been shown to be
   associated with Crohn's disease (CD). There is a strong support for
   shared genetic determinants between various autoimmune and inflammatory
   diseases. In particular, linkage of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and other
   autoimmune and inflammatory diseases has been reported on chromosome 16,
   encompassing the region containing the CARD15 gene. We therefore
   considered this gene as a good candidate for the T1D locus mapped to
   this region, and we tested the three CARD15 variants in the
   susceptibility to T I D in two independent settings: family based
   association analysis in Scandinavian multiplex families that we
   previously showed to be linked to this region, and case/control
   association study in a large cohort of French diabetic patients. We
   found no evidence for association of these variants with T1D overall,
   nor in subgroups of patients with or without the major risk genotypes at
   HLA-DRB1, at insulin (INS), or positive or negative for autoantibodies
   specific to other autoimmune diseases. Our results do not support a role
   for CD-associated CARD15 variants in the susceptibility to T1D, and
   suggest that another gene is responsible for the shared susceptibility
   between autoimmune and inflammatory diseases mapping to this region. (c)

Title = {{Chronic asymptomatic contralateral wrist scapholunate dissociation}},
Journal = {{PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1672-1678}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: The authors report a series of six patients who presented
   with scapholunate dissociation, with no significant contralateral
   antecedent trauma and no rheumatoid arthritis or congenital ligamentous
   laxity. Such patients may present with pain or a snapping/popping
   sensation in one wrist, undergo radiographs of both wrists, and are
   discovered to have scapholunate gapping bilaterally. The literature
   contains few reports of this condition, and this series of six is a
   relatively large one for this infrequently reported condition.
   Methods: The six charts were reviewed retrospectively; each patient was
   asked to return for follow-up and radiographic examination and each
   participated in a telephone questionnaire about pain, activity changes,
   new treatments, and exacerbation of wrist problems. The average
   follow-tip was 39 months, with a range of 6 months to 13.5 years.
   Results: One patient with severe unilateral instability and persistent
   pain underwent soft-tissue Surgical repair (Blatt reconstruction);
   another demonstrated unilateral dorsal intercalated segment instability
   with moderate pain symptoms but declined surgical reconstruction. The
   other 10 wrists, despite radiographically demonstrated widened
   scapholunate angles and rotatory subluxation of the scaphoid, had mild
   or no pain and no dorsal intercalated segment instability deformity.
   Conclusions: The evolution of the bilateral form of scapholunate
   dissociation seems to be benign unless dorsal intercalated segment
   instability deformity is present, which may then rapidly progress to
   degenerative arthritis and scapholunate advanced collapse wrist. Severe
   or minor repetitive trauma, inflammation, infection, tumors, and
   congenital ligamentous laxity have been etiologically implicated in
   scapholunate dissociation. The natural history of scapholunate
   dissociation involves volar rotation of the scaphoid and dorsal rotation
   of the Innate, progressing to malalignment and eventual arthrosis
   between the scaphoid and radius, the capitate and lunate, and the Iunate
   and hamate bones.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Cloretazine (VNP40101M) is a novel sulfonylhydrazine alkylating
   agent with significant antileukemia activity. A phase 1 study of
   cloretazine combined with cytarabine (1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine,
   ara-C) was conducted in patients with refractory disease.
   Design: Ara-C was given i.v. at a fixed dose of 1.5 gm/m(2)/d by
   continuous infusion for 4 days (patients ages < 65 years at time of
   diagnosis) or 3 days (patients ages 65 years). Cloretazine was given
   i.v. over 15 to 60 minutes on day 2 at a starting dose of 200 mg/m(2),
   with escalation in 100 mg/m(2) increments in cohorts of three to six
   patients until a maximum tolerated dose was established. The DNA repair
   enzyme O-6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) was measured at
   baseline.
   Results: Forty patients, including 32 with acute myeloid leukemia,
   received 47 courses of treatment. Complete responses were seen at
   cloretazine dose levels of >= 400 mg/m(2) in 10 of 37 (27\%) evaluable
   patients, and in this patient subset, AGT activity was significantly
   lower in patients that responded to treatment than in patients who did
   not (P <= 0.027). Dose-limiting toxicities (gastrointestinal and
   myelosuppression) were seen with 500 and 600 mg/m(2) of cloretazine
   combined with the 4-day ara-C schedule but not seen with the 3-day
   schedule.
   Conclusion: The recommended cloretazine dose schedule for future studies
   is 600 mg/m(2) combined with 1.5 gm/m(2)/d continuous infusion of ara-C
   for 3 days. The cloretazine and ara-C regimen has significant
   antileukemic activity. AGT activity may be a predictor of response to
   cloretazine.}},

Abstract = {{Following attachment of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to human epithelial cell
   lines, the cellular pilus receptor CD46 is shed from the cell and
   accumulates in the media. In this report, we assess Neisseria-induced
   alterations in CD46 surface distribution and characterize this
   complement regulatory protein following its release from the infected
   cell. Within 3 h of attachment of gonococci to human epithelial cell
   lines, CD46 is enriched beneath sites of microcolony adhesion. By 6 h
   post infection, differential ultracentrifugation of culture media from
   ME-180 monolayers resulted in sedimentation of structurally and
   functionally intact CD46. Electron microscopy of these 100 000 g pellets
   revealed 30-200 nm vesicles. These vesicles likely originated from the
   host cell as they contained additional host cell surface proteins
   including CD55 and the epidermal growth factor receptor. Further, these
   vesicles were visualized by quick-freeze, deep-etch electron microscopy
   in association with the surface of infected ME-180 cells and with pili
   of adherent gonococci. Like CD46 shedding, CD46 redistribution and
   vesicle release were insensitive to colchicine and cytochalasin-D but
   dependent on expression of the pilus retraction protein PilT. This
   vesiculation may represent a host cell defence response in which surface
   proteins that are commonly exploited by pathogens, such as CD46, are
   removed from the cell.}},

Abstract = {{Stereoscopic slant contrast is an apparent slant induced in a
   stereoscopically frontal plane surface (the test) opposite in direction
   to the specified stereoscopic slant of a neighbouring surface (the
   inducer). Test surfaces offset from the inducer in a direction collinear
   with the axis of slant (twist) show more contrast than those offset in a
   direction orthogonal to the axis of slant (hinge) {[}van Ee, R., \&
   Erkelens, C. J. (1996b). Anisotropy in Werner's binocular depth-contrast
   effect. Vision Research, 36, 2253-2262]. We attribute this anisotropy to
   the presence and extent of a gradient of relative disparity in twist
   configurations and the absence of such a gradient in hinge
   configurations. This hypothesis was tested by measuring the perceived
   slant of the test and inducer surfaces for horizontal and vertical axes
   of inducer slant and collinear and orthogonal surface offsets. For
   vertical axis slant, the hypothesis was supported; contrast variations
   with position of the test surface could be explained by variations in
   relative slant. For horizontal axis slant, variations in contrast could
   be accounted for by normalisation of the slanted surface, with relative
   slant remaining constant. Two further experiments showed that the extent
   of the gradient of relative disparity rather than the area of texture
   overlap of the two surfaces best predicted the contrast results and that
   perceived relative slant did not vary with the absolute slants of the
   two surfaces. The arrangement of stereo surfaces is critical in
   predicting their relative slant. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a simulator designed to handle multibody
   systems with changing constraints, wherein the equations of motion for
   each of its constraint configurations are formulated in minimal ODE form
   with constraints embedded before they are passed to an ODE solver. The
   constraint-embedded equations are formulated symbolically according to a
   re-combination of terms of the unconstrained equations, and this
   symbolic process is undertaken on-line by the simulator.
   Constraint-embedding undertaken on-the-fly enables the simulation of
   systems with an ODE solver for which constraints are not known prior to
   simulation start or for which the enumeration of all constraint
   conditions would be unwieldy because of their complexity or number.
   Issues of drift associated with DAE solvers that usually require
   stabilization are sidestepped with the constraint-embedding approach. We

Abstract = {{We analyse the respective benefits and drawbacks of ground-based and
   space-based transit surveys for extrasolar planets. Based on simple but
   realistic assumptions about the fraction of lower main sequence stars
   harboring telluric and giant planets within the outer limit of the
   habitable zone, we predict the harvests of fictitious surveys with three
   existing wide field optical and near-IR cameras: the CFHT-Megacam,
   SUBARU-Suprime and VISTA-IR. An additional promising instrument is
   considered, VISTA-Vis, currently under development. The results are
   compared with the harvests predicted under exactly the same assumptions,
   for the space missions COROT and KEPLER. We show that ground-based wide
   field surveys may discover more giant planets than space missions.
   However, space surveys seem to constitute the best strategy to search
   for telluric planets. In this respect, the KEPLER mission appears 50
   times more efficient than any of the ground-based surveys considered
   here. KEPLER might even discover telluric planets in the habitable zone
   of their host star.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: To define the frequency of seeing (FOS) characteristics of the
   short wavelength ( SW) sensitive visual pathway in clinically normal
   subjects and in diabetic patients with focal SW sensitivity loss.
   Methods: For clinically normal subjects, FOS was assessed at two retinal
   locations (4.24 degrees and 9.90 degrees eccentricity) for both white on
   white (WW) and SW stimulus parameters. Interexamination variability was
   quantified for the clinically normal subjects only. For patients with
   diabetes, FOS was assessed inside an area of focal SW sensitivity loss,
   and at the same eccentricity in the quadrant diametrically opposite,
   using SW stimulus parameters only.
   Results: For clinically normal subjects, the group mean SW FOS slope was
   significantly flatter (p< 0.0001) than that of WW at both locations. The
   coefficient of repeatability for SW FOS slope was +/- 41.55 dB(-1) (
   relative to a group mean sensitivity of 23.98 dB(-1)) and +/- 19.98
   dB(-1) ( group mean sensitivity 16.15 dB(-1)) for 4.24 degrees and 9.90
   degrees, respectively. For the patients with diabetes, the group mean SW
   FOS slope was significantly flatter ( p = 0.020), and group mean SW
   threshold significantly higher ( p = 0.007) in the area of focal SW
   sensitivity loss than in that of the non-focal sensitivity loss.
   Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that the clinical utility
   of SW automated perimetry will be limited by a greater magnitude of
   measurement variability, as indicated by a flatter FOS slope, compared
   to conventional automated perimetry.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. Portal vein thrombosis (PVT), which had been considered an
   absolute contraindication to orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), is
   currently considered a risk factor that increases morbi-mortality. The
   objective of this study was to compare OLT outcomes in patients with vs
   without PVT.
   Materials and methods. Between April 1986 and December 2003, a sample of
   83 patients with PVT was compared with another sample of 83 patients
   without PVT among 962 OLT performed in our department.
   Results. Both groups were homogeneous in terms of epidemiological
   variables, surgical technique, immunosuppression, and donor-related
   variables. There were no differences with respect to graft function
   during the first week following surgery. Surgical time and anhepatic
   phase duration was longer in the PVT group, albeit the differences were
   not significant. PVT patients also required more transfusions; a strong
   statistical association was observed with respect to blood (P =.12) and
   plasma (P =.11) transfusions and statistically significant differences
   regarding platelet transfusions (P =.02). Time on mechanical ventilation
   and the length of stay in the ICU were longer but not significant among
   PVT patients. The only statistically significant difference was the
   incidence of portal rethrombosis (P =.02). With respect to mean and
   global patient and graft actuarial survivals after 1, 3, 5, and 10
   years, we have observed no significant intergroup differences, although
   both patient (P =.48; NS) and graft (P =.96, NS) survivals were lower
   among PVT cases.
   Conclusions. PVT should not only cease to be considered a
   contraindication for OLT, but there were no significant differences
   between the outcomes despite this finding.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Tumor cell proliferation is a central feature of melanoma
   progression. In this study, we characterized three biomarkers of
   proliferation (Ki67 expression, dermal mitotic rate {[}MR], and
   tumorigenicity) in thin (<= 1.00 mm) primary cutaneous melanomas and
   examined their association with prognosis.
   Patients and Methods We used immunohistochemistry to determine Ki67
   expression using the monoclonal antibody MIB-1 in lesions from a
   prospective cohort that included 396 patients with thin invasive primary
   melanomas seen between 1972 and 1991. A multivariate Cox proportional
   hazards model was used to define independent prognostic factors, and
   recursive partitioning was used to develop a prognostic tree identifying
   risk groups.
   Results Dermal Ki67 expression was lower than epidermal Ki67 expression
   in radial growth phase (RGP) melanomas (n = 171), and dermal Ki67
   expression and MR were higher in tumorigenic vertical growth phase (VGP)
   melanomas In = 193) compared with RGP and nontumorigenic VGP melanomas
   (n - 42). Dermal Ki67 expression, MR greater than 0, growth phase,
   thickness, ulceration, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and sex were
   associated with metastasis at 10 years, however, only dermal Ki67
   expression, MR greater than 0, and sex were independent prognostic
   factors. Two high-risk groups were identified: men and women with dermal
   MR greater than 0 and dermal Ki67 expression >= 20\% in tumor cells and
   men with MR greater than 0 and Ki67 expression less than 20\%, with
   10-year metastasis rates of 39\% and 20\%, respectively.
   Conclusion Proliferation slows as melanoma cells enter the dermis and
   then increases with the onset of tumorigenic VGP. Ki67 expression and
   dermal MR provide independent prognostic information that can
   potentially be used in risk-based management of patients.}},

Abstract = {{This article offers a working model for analyzing Third World (or
   non-Western) science fiction. It examines specific works of Brazilian sf
   published during a limited time period, dividing them into discrete
   generations or eras based on historical events, then analyzing them in
   conjunction with a variety of Brazilian cultural myths. Each period
   requires a specific critical approach. While Brazilian texts of the
   1960s transform traditional sf icons, demonstrating an idealization of
   Brazilian identity and cultural myths, the dystopian and fantastic
   literature of the 1970s does the same in its political and environmental
   protest, and may be effectively analyzed by ecofeminist theory. Finally,
   works in a variety of subgenres, along with contemporary examples of
   alien and cyborg stories, provide rich material for postcolonial
   analysis and theories of globalization. Other contemporary trends
   include the overlap of science fiction, horror, and fantasy as a means
   to garner new audiences, new ``globalized{''} or national varieties of
   fantasy literature, and an influx of women authors into the genre.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we employ direct numerical simulation of turbulence
   one-way coupled to Lagrangian tracking to investigate microbubble
   distribution in upward and downward channel flow. We consider a closed
   channel flow at Re-iota = 150 and a dispersion of microbubbles
   characterized by a diameter of 220 mu m. Bubbles are assumed
   contaminated by surfactants (i.e., no-slip condition at bubble surface)
   and are subject to drag, gravity, pressure gradient forces, Basset
   history force and aerodynamic lift.
   Our results confirm previous findings and show that microbubble
   dispersion in the wall region is dominated by the action of gravity
   combined with the lift force. Specifically, in upward flow, bubble
   rising velocity in the wall region generates a lift force which pushes
   bubbles to the wall. In downward flow, bubble rising velocity against
   the fluid generates a lift force which prevents microbubbles from
   reaching the viscous sublayer.
   In the wall region, we observe bubble preferential segregation in
   high-speed regions in the downflow case, and non-preferential
   distribution in the upflow case. This phenomenon is related to the
   effect of the lift force. Compared to experiments, the current lift
   force model produces larger consequences, this effect being
   overemphasized in the upflow case in which a large number of bubbles is
   segregated near the wall. In this case, the resulting bubble wall-peak
   of concentration outranges experimental results.
   These results, so deeply related to the lift force, underline the
   crucial role of current understanding of the fluid forces acting on
   bubbles and help to formulate questions about available force models,
   bubble-bubble interactions and two-way coupling which can be crucial for
   accurate predictions in the region very near the wall. (c) 2005 Elsevier

   used, in place of a wavelet, in a wavelet transform for improving EEG
   wavelet analysis, intended for brain-computer interfaces. The hypothesis
   is that an optimal wavelet can be approximated by deriving it from
   underlying components of the EEG. The SNAP was compared to standard
   wavelets by measuring Support Vector Machine-based EEG classification
   accuracy when using different wavelets/filters for EEG analysis. When
   classifying P300 evoked potentials, the error, as a function of the
   wavelet/filter used, ranged from 6.92\% to 11.99\%, almost twofold.
   Classification using the SNAP was more accurate than that with any of
   the six standard wavelets tested. Similarly, when differentiating
   between preparation for left- or right-hand movements, classification
   using the SNAP was more accurate (10.03\% error) than for four out of
   five of the standard wavelets (9.54\% to 12.00\% error) and
   internationally competitive (7\% error) on the 2001 NIPS competition
   test set. Phenomena shown only in maps of discriminatory EEG activity
   may explain why the SNAP appears to have promise for improving EEG
   wavelet analysis. It represents the initial exploration of a potential
   family of EEG-specific wavelets.}},

Abstract = {{Orbital teratomas are rare embryonic tumors composed of a wide diversity
   of tissues derived from the three germinal layers. The presenting
   features include, a healthy newborn with extreme unilateral proptosis;
   marked stretching of the eyelids over a tense, fluctuating mass, with
   elongation of the palpebral fissure; enlargement of the bony orbit (two
   to three times normal size) with subsequent nasal and malar deformities;
   and transillumination of all or part of the orbital mass. Commonly the
   eye is normally developed but often vision is not preserved either due
   to exposure or secondary optic atrophy. The objective in the management
   of orbital teratoma is to save the eye to encourage orbitofacial
   development, maintain cosmesis and retain some vision. We report a case
   of massive congenital orbital teratoma successfully removed by an
   eyelid-sparing exenteration technique.}},

Abstract = {{The properties of the Mn2+ site in the protein concanavalin A were
   investigated by single crystal W-band EPR/ENDOR (electron-nuclear double
   resonance) measurements. Initially, room temperature EPR measurements
   were carried out, one type of Mn2+ was identified and its zero-field
   splitting (ZFS) tensor was determined. In contrast, low temperature EPR
   measurements showed that two chemically inequivalent Mn2+ are present,
   Mn-A(2+) and Mn-B(2+), differing in their ZFS tensors. Variable
   temperature measurements revealed a two-site exchange between the two
   types. Although the dynamic process has been characterized by its rate
   and activation energy, just from the EPR measurements it was not
   possible to assign it to a specific residue. H-1 ENDOR measurements of
   the water and imidazole protons, which are the main contributors to the
   ENDOR spectra, showed only one type of signals, namely, they were not
   sensitive to the differences between Mn-A(2+) and Mn-B(2+). Mn-55 ENDOR
   spectra, which are dominated by the Mn-55 isotropic hyperfine, a(iso),
   and the nuclear quadrupole interaction did sense the differences.
   Analysis of the spectra recorded with the magnetic field along the
   crystallographic axes showed that the two have the same a(iso), but
   different quadrupole tensors. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Dilute emulsions of dodecane in water were prepared under constant flow
   rate conditions with binary surfactant systems. The droplet size
   distribution was measured as a function of the mixed surfactant
   composition in solution. The systems studied were (a) the mixture of
   anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) with nonionic hexa(ethyleneglycol)
   mono n-dodecylether (C12E6) and (b) the mixture of cationic dodecyl
   pyridinium chloride (DPC) with C12E6. At a constant concentration of SDS
   or DPC surfactant in solution (below the CMC) the mean emulsion droplet
   size decreases with the increase in the amount of C12E6 added to the
   solution. However, a sharp break of this droplet size occurs at a
   critical concentration and beyond this point the mean droplet size did
   not significantly change upon further increase of the C12E6. This point
   was found to corresponded to the CMC of the mixed surfactant systems (as
   previously determined from microcalorimetry measurements) and this
   result suggested the mixed adsorption layer on the emulsion droplet was
   similar to the surfactant composition on the mixed micelles. The
   emulsion droplet size as a function of composition at the interface was
   also studied. The mean emulsion droplet size in SDS-C12E6 solution was
   found to be lower than that in DPC-C12E6 system at the equivalent mole
   fraction of ionic surfactant at interface. This was explained by the
   stronger interactions between sulphate and polyoxyethylene head groups
   at the interface, which facilitate the droplet break-up. Counterion
   binding parameter (beta) was also determined from zeta-potential of
   dodecane droplets under the same conditions and it was found that (beta)
   was independent of the type of the head group and the mole fraction of
   ionic surfactant at interface. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Support vector machine (SVM) learning has been recently proposed for
   image compression in the frequency domain using a constant
   E-insensitivity zone by Robinson and Kecman {[}1]. However, according to
   the statistical properties of natural images and the properties of human
   perception, a constant insensitivity makes sense in the spatial domain
   but it is certainly not a good option in a frequency domain. In fact, in
   their approach, they made a fixed low-pass assumption as the number of
   discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients to be used in the training
   was limited. This paper extends the work of Robinson and Kecman by
   proposing the use of adaptive insensitivity SVMs {[}2] for image coding
   using an appropriate distortion criterion {[}3], {[}4] based on a simple
   visual cortex model. Training the SVM by using an accurate perception
   model avoids any a priori assumption and improves the rate-distortion
   performance of the original approach.}},

Abstract = {{There is little experience on the use of monoclonal antibodies that
   block the high-affinity interleukin-2 receptor (basiliximab and
   daclizumab) in sequential therapy in renal transplants with risk of
   delayed graft function. This study sougth to test the efficacy and
   safety of the substitution of anticalcineurins with two doses of
   basiliximab or daclizumab in the immediate posttransplant period for
   recipients at risk of delayed renal graft function. Immunosuppression
   consisted of steroids, mycophenolate mofetil, and two doses of
   basiliximab (20 mg/day) on days 0 and 4 posttransplant or daclizumab (1
   mg/kg per day) on days 0 and 15 posttransplant. Anticalcineurins were
   not administered until the beginning of graft function. Among 49
   recipients (mean age 63.5 +/- 10.5 years), 40 received a kidney from a
   donor over 60 years of age, three from a non-heart-beating donor, and
   six from donors with an acute elevation of serum creatinine to 2.4 +/-
   0.86 (1.7-3.7). At a mean follow-up of 14.2 +/- 8.4 months, five
   patients experienced acute rejection episodes. Only 15 patients needed
   posttransplant dialysis (2.7 +/- 1.6). In 11 patients, cyclosporine
   (CsA) was introduced at 6 +/- 2.9 days posttransplant and in 37,
   tacrolimus on 8.6 +/- 3.6 days posttransplant. The incidence of kidney
   graft loss was 16.3\%. Patient survival was 96\%.
   Thirty-nine recipients are alive with functioning grafts, with mean
   serum creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL. In conclusion, substitution for
   anticalcineurins with interleukin-2-receptor blockade in the immediate
   posttransplant period for patients at risk of delayed graft function
   minimizes nephrotoxicity and reduces tubular necrosis, without
   increasing the risk of an acute rejection episode.}},

Abstract = {{Moller-Plesset MP2/6-31G method was used to examine the gas-phase
   elimination of 2-substituted alkyl ethyl N,N-dimethylcarbamates. The
   results of these calculations support a concerted non-synchronous
   six-membered cyclic transition state mechanism for carbarnates
   containing a C-beta-H bond at the alkyl side of the ester. These
   substrates produce the NN-dimethylcarbamic acid and the corresponding
   olefin. The unstable intermediate, N,N-dimethylcarbamic acid, rapidly
   decomposes through a four-membered cyclic transition state to
   dimethylamine and CO2 gas. Correlation of the logarithm of theoretical
   rate coefficients against original Taft's sigma{*} values gave an
   approximate straight line (rho{*} = - 1.39, r= 0.9558 at 360 degrees C).
   In addition to this fact, when log k(rel) is plotted against the
   theoretical log k(rel) for 2-substituted ethyl N,N-dimethylcarbamates a

Abstract = {{We present a study on the variations of the luminosity function of
   galaxies around clusters in a numerical simulation with semi-analytic
   galaxies, attempting to detect these variations in the 2dF Galaxy
   Redshift Survey. We subdivide the simulation box into equal-density
   regions around clusters, which we assume can be achieved by selecting
   objects at a given normalized distance ( r/r(rms), where r(rms) is an
   estimate of the halo radius) from the group centre. The semi-analytic
   model predicts important variations in the luminosity function out to
   r/r(rms) similar or equal to 5. In brief, variations in the mass
   function of haloes around clusters ( large dark matter haloes with M >
   1012 h(-1) M-circle dot) lead to cluster central regions that present a
   high abundance of bright galaxies ( high M{*} values) as well as
   low-luminosity galaxies ( high a); at r/r(rms) similar or equal to 3
   there is a lack of bright galaxies, which shows the depletion of
   galaxies in the regions surrounding clusters ( minimum in M{*} and a),
   and a tendency to constant luminosity function parameters at larger
   cluster-centric distances. We take into account the observational biases
   present in the real data by reproducing the peculiar velocity effect on
   the redshifts of galaxies in the simulation box, and also by producing
   mock catalogues. We find that excluding from the analysis galaxies which
   in projection are close to the centres of the groups provides results
   that are qualitatively consistent with the full simulation box results.
   When we apply this method to mock catalogues of the 2dF Galaxy Redshift
   Survey ( 2dFGRS) and the 2PIGG catalogue of groups, we find that the
   variations in the luminosity function are almost completely erased by
   the Finger of God effect; only a lack of bright galaxies at r/r(rms)
   similar or equal to 3 can be marginally detected in the mock catalogues.
   The results from the real 2dFGRS data show a clearer detection of a dip
   in M{*} and a for r/r(rms) = 3, consistent with the semi-analytic
   predictions.}},

Abstract = {{The application of fiber-reinforced composites (FRP) is gaining momentum
   as an alternative material for bridge replacement, repair, and

   in the use of FRP technology not being widely accepted. This paper
   presents the performance results, based on acoustic emission (AE), of
   six full-scale glass FRP bridge deck panels with nominal cross-sectional
   depths varying from 152 mm (6 in.) to 800 mm (30 in.). The objective was
   to develop for use during in-service field inspections an AE monitoring
   strategy that will determine the structural performance of the deck. As
   such, the characterization of damage, e. g., fiber breakage, matrix
   cracking, and delamination, was part of the investigated criteria and
   the contributing factors for identification of a monitoring strategy.
   Although some factors were determined to be associated with the
   performance evaluation of the structural integrity of the decks, further

Abstract = {{The relationship between serum triglyceride levels and cardiovascular
   disease has remained enigmatic despite four decades of research. The
   majority of the available evidence tends to support the role of
   hypertriglyceridemia as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular
   disease. However, there are no guidelines recommending a target
   triglyceride level for prevention of cardiovascular disease. The focus
   of lipid lowering therapy still remains the reduction of global
   cardiovascular risk by optimizing LDL cholesterol levels. Therapeutic
   options for triglyceride-lowering include lifestyle modification and
   pharmacological agents, such as fibrates, omega 3 fatty acids and
   niacin. Post-hoc analyses of the Helsinki Heart Study, Veterans Affairs
   High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Intervention Trial and Bezafibrate
   Infarction Prevention Study suggest a beneficial effect of the treatment
   of hypertriglyceridemia with fibrates, mainly in obese subjects with
   insulin resistance. However, in order to establish the actual clinical
   relevance of lowering triglyceride levels, prospective trials need to be
   conducted with the specific purpose of studying the effects of
   triglyceride reduction on clinical end points, i.e. coronary events and

Abstract = {{An alternative to classic sexual selection hypotheses for sex
   differentiated pre-mating behavior is that time available for mating-as
   individuals experience it-along with fitness differences among
   alternative potential mates, induces choosy versus indiscriminate mating
   behavior. This alternative hypothesis says that selection has acted so
   that all individuals flexibly express fitness-enhancing choosy,
   indiscriminate, and competitive mating behavior, induced by time-varying
   life histories, environmental and social cues. Key predictions of
   DYNAMATE, the formal model of adaptively flexible sex role behavior of
   individuals of both sexes within dynamically changing populations,
   include: (1) All individuals regardless of sex assess likely fitness
   outcomes from mating with alternative potential mates before expressing
   choosy or indiscriminate behavior. (2) Males and females express
   adaptively flexible, choosy and indiscriminate behavior so that
   individuals may change their behavior-from moment to moment-to fit
   dynamically changing circumstances. (3) Indiscriminate behavior of males
   and (4) choosy behavior of females would often be maladaptive even in
   species with greater female than male parental investment, when females
   have longer latencies to receptivity to re-mating than males, and when
   the relative reproductive rate of males is greater than in females. (5)
   Whether or not females show choosy behavior will not affect whether or
   not males exhibit choosy or indiscriminate behavior, and vice versa. (6)
   When other model parameters are equal, the proportion of individuals of
   a given sex expressing choosy or indiscriminate mating behavior is a
   function of the distribution of fitness ratios (a distribution of all
   fitness differences that would be conferred on an individual by mating
   with any two sequentially or simultaneously encountered alternative
   potential mates). (7) Whether same-sex individuals behaviorally compete
   is a function of the fitness that would be conferred if the strategist
   won access to a potential mate, but not a function of relative
   reproductive rate or its proxy, the operational sex ratio. We call for
   re-evaluation of sex differences in choosy, indiscriminate, and
   competitive behavior under strong experimental controls that level the
   ecological playing fields of males and females, i.e., under experimental
   conditions informing the mechanisms of phenotypic expression. We end
   with comments on the classic question of questions: why are the sexes as
   they are?.}},

Abstract = {{Population coverage of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) in Africa falls
   well below the Abuja target of 60\% while coverage levels achieved
   during vaccination campaigns in the same populations typically exceed
   90\%. Household (HH) cost of ITNs is an important barrier to their
   uptake. We investigated the coverage, equity and cost of linking
   distribution of free ITNs to a measles vaccination campaign. During a
   national measles vaccination campaign in Zambia, children in four rural
   districts were given a free ITN when they received their measles
   vaccination. In one urban district, children were given a voucher, which
   could be redeemed for a net at a commercial distribution site. About
   1700 HHs were asked whether they received vaccination and an ITN during
   a measles campaign, as well as questions on assets (e.g. type roofing
   material or bicycle ownership) to assess HH wealth. Net ownership was
   calculated for children in each wealth quintile. In the rural areas, ITN
   coverage among children rose from 16.7\% to 81.1\% and the equity ratio
   from 0.32 to 0.88 and in the urban area from 50.7\% to 76.2\% (equity
   ratio: 0.66-1.19). The operational cost per ITN delivered was \$0.35 in
   the rural area with direct distribution and \$1.89 in the urban areas
   with voucher distribution. Mass distribution of ITNs through vaccination
   campaigns achieves rapid, high and equitable coverage at low cost.}},

Abstract = {{Model checking is a formal technique for proving the correctness of a
   system with respect to a desired behavior. This is accomplished by
   checking whether a structure representing the system (typically a
   labeled transition system) satisfies a temporal logic formula describing
   the expected behavior. Model checking has a number of advantages over
   traditional approaches that are based on simulation and testing: it is
   completely automatic and when the verification fails it returns a
   counterexample that can be used to pinpoint the source of the error.
   Nevertheless, model checking techniques often fail because of the state
   explosion problem: transition systems grow exponentially with the number
   of components. The aim of this paper is to attack the state explosion
   problem that may arise when looking for deadlocks in concurrent systems
   described through the Calculus of Communicating Systems. We propose to
   use heuristics-based techniques, namely the A{*} algorithm, both to
   guide the search without constructing the complete transition system,
   and to provide minimal counterexamples. We have realized a prototype
   tool to evaluate the methodology. Experiments we have conducted on
   processes of different size show the benefit from using our technique
   against building the whole state space, or applying some other methods.

Abstract = {{An energy balance model for a two-dimensional ridge surface partly
   covered by a plastic mulch is presented. Previous approaches are
   modified and extended to include: (1) the circumsolar part of diffuse
   radiation; and (2) the altered interception of diffuse short- and
   long-wave radiation due to horizon obstructions and surface slope. A
   simple solution was found for the interception problem under an uniform
   radiating sky, and an extensive numerical simulation study with broadly
   varying sky conditions and surface geometries revealed an error of about
   10\% using this approximation. Similarly simulations for long-wave sky
   radiation interception highlighted the good predictive quality of the
   uniform sky solution with errors of about 1\%. Additionally, a thorough
   derivation of directional responses of transmissivity and reflectivity
   of different commonly used plastics is provided. Oblique direct
   radiation incidence angles due to ridged surfaces were taken into
   account using a Fresnel theory based approach adapted from window design
   research and extended to describe the effect of a liquid water film on
   the inside of the plastic. The validity of this proposed model to
   accurately predict the temperature dynamics for a two-dimensional ridge
   surface partly covered by a plastic mulch is presented in an
   accompanying paper. (c) 2005 Silsoe Research Institute. All rights

Journal = {{ARCHIVES OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: To compare peak joint powers and joint angles between
   comfortable and fast walking speeds among a group of elderly adults who
   exhibit low physical performance, and to test the primary hypothesis
   that peak ankle powers Would not change when walking speed was
   increased, but that peak hip power output would increase significantly
   with speed.
   Design: Three-dimensional analysis of joint kinematics and kinetics
   during comfortable and fast walking by both healthy and low-performing
   elderly adults (age, >70y).
   Setting: Gait laboratory.
   Participants: Twenty-four healthy elderly adults and 27 elders who
   exhibited low performance on a standard battery of walking, standing
   balance, and chair-rise tasks that places them at risk of
   mobility-related disability.
   Interventions: Not applicable.
   Main Outcome Measures: Peak lower-extremity joint powers and joint
   angles.
   Results: Low-performing elders increased both ankle and hip power
   outputs to increase walking speed. However, peak ankle power remained
   significantly below that of the healthy elderly adults even when the
   low-performing elders walked at a faster gait speed. Joint-power changes
   in the low-performing elderly were accompanied by a reduction in hip
   extension and ankle dorsiflexion, and an increase in transverse pelvic
   rotation.
   Conclusions: Compared with healthy elderly, the low-performing elderly
   adults showed speed-independent differences in ankle and hip mechanics
   that may reflect underlying neuromuscular impairments. In particular, an
   understanding of the interdependent contributions of hip flexibility and
   ankle power limitations seem important to inform interventions to
   maintain gait into advanced age.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The authors' goal was to examine the prevalence of impulse
   control disorders in psychiatric inpatients.
   Method: They used the Minnesota Impulsive Disorders Interview, a
   semistructured clinical interview assessing pathological gambling,
   trichotillomania, kleptomania, pyromania, intermittent explosive
   disorder, compulsive buying, and compulsive sexual behavior, to screen
   204 consecutively admitted psychiatric inpatients. One hundred twelve of
   the inpatients were women (54.9\%), and the mean age of the 204
   inpatients was 40.5 years (SD=13.2, range=18-83). Patients whose screen
   was positive for an impulse control disorder were evaluated with
   structured clinical interviews.
   Results: Sixty-three patients (30.9\%) were diagnosed with at least one
   current impulse control disorder. The most common impulse control
   disorders were compulsive buying (N=19 {[}9.3\%]), kleptomania (N=16
   {[}7.8\%]), and pathological gambling (N=14 {[}6.9\%]). Patients with
   and without co-occurring impulse control disorders did not differ
   significantly from each other on demographic measures or number or type
   of psychiatric diagnoses other than impulse control disorders.
   Conclusions: Impulse control disorders appear common among psychiatric
   inpatients. Additional, larger studies are needed to examine the
   prevalence of impulse control disorders in the general population and
   specific psychiatric groups.}},

Pages = {{1540-1545}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The effect of shear on the electrical conductivity of suspensions of
   conductive graphite particles in a nonconductive unsaturated polyester
   resin was investigated. At graphite loadings near 30 wt\% the electrical
   conductivity was higher when the suspension was undergoing shear than
   when shearing stopped. Moreover, shearing caused a large permanent
   increase in the electrical conductivity of the suspension. When shear
   was restarted after a period of rest the transient response of the
   electrical conductivity depended on the direction of previous shear,
   indicating that the suspension acquires an anisotropic structure under
   shear. The transition upon shear reversal was strain-dependent.
   Surprisingly, at graphite loadings near 50 wt\% the effect of shear on
   the electrical conductivity was the opposite of that at loadings near 30
   wt\%. At intermediate loadings the effect of shear on the electrical
   conductivity was less clear. The results may have applications in the
   manufacture of composite bipolar plates for fuel cells and of various
   other parts made from conductive polymers.}},

Abstract = {{A number of studies have indicated that imperfections in cellular solids
   can have a very large influence on their mechanical behavior. Waviness
   in cell walls can drastically reduce elastic stiffnesses, and various
   irregularities can reduce the effective strengths by large factors.
   These imperfections have in many instances been studied in isolation,
   i.e., only a singe type of imperfection was studied at a time. The goal
   of the present paper is to shed light on how different kinds of
   imperfections interact. There is a potential risk that when multiple
   kinds of imperfections are present, the mechanical properties of the
   cellular solid are worse than what would be predicted from each one in
   isolation. The present study is focused on linear elastic properties,
   although many of the conclusions apply also for other properties. The
   method employed is based on statistical averages and Taylor expansion
   arguments. Such techniques have in previous papers been applied to a
   single imperfection type. The conclusion from the present analysis is
   that, up to the third order in ``small{''} parameters describing the
   severity of the imperfections, there is no interaction between a number
   of different types of imperfections.

Abstract = {{Vacuum plasma-spraying (VPS) can be used for the industrial deposition
   of thick W coatings on actively water-cooled components made of low
   activation steel or stainless steel. Mock-ups made of martensitic
   steels, EUROFER and F82H, as well as steel 316L, were coated with 2 mm
   thick W-VPS layers. The coated materials are candidates for first wall
   components (ITER and DEMO) receiving moderate heat load of up to 1
   MW/M(2). Mixed tungsten/steel interlayers were applied to reduce the
   residual and thermal stresses at the substrate-coating interface and to
   improve the adhesion of the coating. The advantage of this mixed
   interlayer is that no further (high activation) materials have to be
   introduced to improve coating adhesion.
   The characterisation of the W-VPS layers includes the evaluation of the
   coating microstructure, the measurement of physical and mechanical
   properties and the metallographical examination before and after heat
   load tests.
   Heat load tests with steady state operation up to 2.5 MW/M2 and cycling
   heat loads of 2 MW/m(2), were successfully completed. They confirm the
   thermornechanical suitability of industrially manufactured W-VPS
   coatings for plasma facing first wall components made of steel. (c) 2005

   high heat fluxes is presently under construction at IPP Garching. The
   aim of this facility is to provide thermal testing capabilities for high
   heat loaded divertor components which have both active water cooling and
   large outer dimensions. The water-cooled test chamber is equipped with
   two ion sources for positive ion beam production. Initially, only one of
   the two individually controlled RF ion sources with 1.1 MW maximum beam
   power will be used for heat loading tests within an operating regime
   from 5 to 65 MW/m(2) at the target position. This paper presents the
   details of the technical characteristics and the systems for vacuum
   generation, cooling, power supply, control, target diagnostics and data
   acquisition. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nickel oxide yttria-stabilized zirconia (NiO-YSZ) anode materials were
   synthesized via hydrolysis of the corresponding chloride solutions with
   NH3, NH3+NaOH, and NaOH as precipitation agents. Powder properties such
   as crystallite size, morphology, and sintering behavior of the final
   NiO-YSZ materials were also studied. The mechanism of the formation of
   NiO-YSZ was established for the different co-precipitation techniques by
   the direct observation of Ni(NH3)(n)(+2) complexes, Ni(OH)(2) and NiO at
   different stages of the synthesis process. A direct relationship between
   the precipitation agent, the order of calcination from dry sample to
   final product, the final composition, the crystallite sizes and particle
   sizes of NiO, and the sinterability of the final products was
   established. A comparison of the powder and individual component
   properties indicate that the choice of precipitation agent greatly
   influences the final characteristics. Ni/YSZ materials prepared by
   NH3+NaOH precipitation offer higher Ni dispersion and nanocrystallinity
   of both the Ni and YSZ phases. The conductivity of both prepared
   materials compares well with mixed-oxide materials of higher Ni content.}},

Abstract = {{1 A possible role of arginine vasopressin (AVP) V-1b receptor subtype in
   stress-related disorders has been recently highlighted by the discovery
   of the agonist {[}1-deamino-4-cyclohexylalanine] AVP (d{[}Cha(4)]AVP)
   and the antagonist SSR149415. Both compounds have been proposed to
   target specifically V-1b receptors, since the reported affinities for
   the related V-1a, V-2 and oxytocin receptors are in the micromolar or
   submicromolar range. In the present study, we further investigated the
   binding affinities of d{[}Cha(4)]AVP and SSR149415 at recombinant human
   vasopressin V-1b (hV(1b)) and oxytocin (hOT) receptors expressed in
   Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and functional properties of both
   compounds at hV(1b), hV(1a), hV(2) and hOT receptors.
   2 d{[}Cha4] AVP bound to hV(1b) receptors and hOT receptors with pK(i)
   values of 9.68 +/- 0.06 and 7.68 +/- 0.09, respectively. SSR149415
   showed pK(i) values of 9.34 +/- 0.06 at hV(1b) and 8.82 +/- 0.16 at hOT
   receptors.
   3 d{[}Cha(4)]AVP stimulated {[}Ca2+](i) increase in hV(1b)-CHO cells
   with a pEC(50) value of 10.05 +/- 0.15. It showed pEC(50) values of 6.53
   +/- 0.17 and 5.92 +/- 0.02 at hV(1a) and hV(2) receptors, respectively,
   and behaved as a weak antagonist at hOT receptors (pK(B) 6.31 +/- 0.12).
   SSR149415 inhibited the agonist-nduced {[}Ca2+](i) increase with pK(B)
   values of 9.19 +/- 0.07 in hV(1b)-CHO and 8.72 +/- 0.15 in hOT-CHO
   cells. A functional pKi value of 7.23 +/- 0.10 was found for SSR1494151
   at hV(1a) receptors, whereas it did not inhibit 20 nM AVP response at
   hV(2) receptors up to 3 mu M.
   4 Data obtained confirmed the high potency and selectivity of
   d{[}Cha(4)] AVP at hV(1b) receptors, but revealed that SSR149415, in
   addition to the high potency at hV(1b) receptors, displays a significant
   antagonism at hOT receptors.}},

Abstract = {{The variable precision rough sets model (VPRS) along with many
   derivatives of rough set theory (RST) necessitates a number of stages
   towards the final classification of objects. These include, (i) the
   identification of subsets of condition attributes (beta-reducts in VPRS)
   which have the same quality of classification as the whole set, (ii) the
   construction of sets of decision rules associated with the reducts and
   (iii) the classification of the individual objects by the decision
   rules. The expert system exposited here offers a decision maker (DM) the
   opportunity to fully view each of these stages, subsequently empowering
   an analyst to make choices during the analysis. Its particular
   innovation is the ability to visually present available beta-reducts,
   from which the DM can make their selection, a consequence of their own
   reasons or expectations of the analysis undertaken. The practical
   analysis considered here is applied on a real world application, the
   credit ratings of large banks and investment companies in Europe and
   North America. The snapshots of the expert system presented illustrate
   the variation in results from the `asymmetric' consequences of the
   choice of beta-reducts considered. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A 3-yr study evaluated late winter (Feb), early spring (Apr), and late
   spring (Jun) calving systems in conjunction with varied weaning
   strategies on beef cow and calf performance from Northern Great Plains
   rangelands. Crossbred cows were randomly assigned to one of three
   calving systems (on average n = 168(.)calving systems(-1.)yr(-1)) and
   one of two weaning times (Wean 1, 2) within each calving system. The Feb
   and Apr calves were weaned at 190 and 240 d of age, whereas Jun calves
   were weaned at 140 and 190 d of age. Breeding by natural service
   occurred in a 32-d period that included estrous synchronization. Cows
   were managed throughout the year as appropriate for their calving
   season. Quantity and quality of hay and supplements were provided based
   on forage and weather conditions, physiological state of the cows, and
   available harvested feed resources within a year. After weaning,
   two-thirds of the early weaned steers were fed in confinement in
   Montana, and one-third were shipped to Oklahoma and were grazed or fed
   forage. One-half of the early weaned heifers grazed seeded pastures, and
   the other half was fed in confinement. Early weaned calves were weighed
   on approximately the same day as late-weaned calves. Birth weight and
   overall rate of gain from birth to weaning did not differ for calves
   from the three calving systems. Calf weaning weight differed by weaning
   age within calving system (P = 0.001), and calves from the Jun calving
   system that were weaned at 190 d of age tended (P = 0.06) to be lighter
   than calves of the same age from the Feb or Apr calving systems. Cow BW
   change and BCS dynamics were affected by calving system, but the
   proportion of cows pregnant in the fall was not. Cows suckled until
   later dates gained less or lost more BW during the 50 d between the
   first and second weaning than dry cows during this period. The previous
   year's weaning assignment did not affect production in the following
   year. Estimated harvested feed inputs were less for the Jun cows than
   for the Feb and Apr cows. We conclude that season of calving and weaning
   age affect outputs from rangeland-based beef cattle operations.}},

Abstract = {{Fragmentation pathways have been studied on the monoanions formed during
   electrospray ionization of a wide range of aliphatic dicarboxylic acids
   and their monoesters. All negative ion spectra were obtained from
   alcoholic or aqueous methanolic solutions without buffers or adjustment
   of pH, using either a Finnigan LCQ ion trap or a VG-Micromass Quattro
   triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Fragmentation pathways were studied
   using collision-induced dissociation and isotopic-labelling techniques.
   Two primary fragmentation pathways of the dicarboxylic acid monoanions
   were observed, namely decarboxylation of the non-ionized carboxyl group
   and loss of water from this group. The fragmentations were strongly
   dependent on the chain lengths of the diacids. In the case of a
   monoester anion, loss of a molecule of alcohol paralleled the loss of
   water from the diacid monoanion. Losses of water or alcohol were shown
   to lead to formation of reactive ynolate anions (HOOC(CH2)(x)CCO-, x =
   3-9), which in the ion trap spectrometer engaged in complex ion -
   molecule reactions consistent with the chemistry of these anions. For
   the longer chains (x > 6), the interactions between the ionized and
   non-ionized carboxyl groups led to readily formed ion-neutral complexes,
   which are described as a neutral molecule (ROH, R = H or alkyl) held by
   a pair of molecular tweezers.}},

Abstract = {{Abnormal phosphorus homeostasis occurs in dairy cows with an abomasal
   displacement or volvulus. The goal of this study was to identify
   potential mechanisms for hypophosphatemia and hyperphosphatemia in cows
   with a left displaced abomasum (LDA), right displaced abomasum (RDA), or
   abomasal volvulus (AV). Accordingly, the results of preoperative
   clinicopathologic analyses for 1,368 dairy cows with an LDA (n = 1,189),
   RDA, or AV (n = 179) (data set 1) and for 44 cows with an AV (data set
   2) were retrieved. Laboratory values were compared by Student's t-tests,
   and correlation and regression analyses were performed. Thirty-four
   percent of the animals from data set 1 (463/1,368) were
   hypophosphatermic (serum phosphorus concentration ({[}Pi]) < 1.4
   mmol/L), and 9\% (122/1,368) were hyperphosphatemic ({[}Pi] > 2.3
   mmol/L). Serum {[}Pi] was significantly lower (P < .05) in cows with an
   LDA (1.60 +/- 0.53 mmol/L; mean +/- SD) than in cows with an RDA or AV
   (1.85 +/- 0.68 mmol/L). For cows with an LDA, {[}Pi] was correlated with
   serum urea nitrogen concentration ({[}SUN]) (r = 0.34) and serum
   concentration of magnesium ({[}Mg]) (r = 0.20). For cows with an RDA or
   AV, linear correlations existed between {[}Pi] and {[}SUN] (r = 0.45),
   {[}Mg] (r = 0.43), and serum chloride concentration ({[}Cl]) (r =
   -0.27). Stepwise logistic regression analysis indicated that low {[}SUN]
   and the diagnosis of an LDA had the strongest associations with
   hypophosphatemia. In cows with hyperphosphatemia, {[}Pi] was most
   strongly associated with azotemia. In cows with an AV, the strongest
   correlations with {[}Pi] were found for {[}SUN] and serum creatinine. We
   conclude that hypophosphatemia in cows with an LDA is primarily due to
   decreased feed intake. In contrast, hyperphosphatemia in cattle with an
   RDA or AV appears to result from dehydration and decreased renal blood
   flow.}},

Abstract = {{Perturbative unitarity for WL+WL- -> WL+WL- scattering is discussed
   within the Randall-Sundrum theory with two 3-branes. It is shown that
   the exchange of massive 4D Kaluza-Klein gravitons leads to amplitudes
   growing linearly with the CM energy squared. If the curvature, m(0), of
   the metric is too small, the gravitational contributions lead to a
   violation of unitarity. However, m(0) must be small enough relative to
   the 5D Planck mass, M-P15, to avoid quantum gravitational effects. As a
   result, we find that there is only a small range of m(0)/M-Pl, for which
   the model is consistent. The width of the window is determined by the
   size of the 4D cutoff of the theory. The extension of the
   Randall-Sundrum scenario to include curvature-Higgs mixing is also
   considered and limits on the mixing parameter are determined.}},

Abstract = {{Attachment of bacteria to soil is an important component of bacterial
   fate and transport. Escherichia coli are commonly used as indicators of
   fecal contamination in the environment. Despite the fact that E. coli
   are derived exclusively from feces or manure, effect of the presence of
   manure colloids on bacteria attachment to agricultural soils was never
   directly studied. The objective of this work was to evaluate the
   magnitude of the effect of manure on E. coli attachment to soil.
   Escherichia coli attachment to soil was studied in batch experiments
   with samples of loam and sandy clay loam topsoil that were taken in
   Pennsylvania and Maryland. Escherichia coli cells were added to the
   water-manure suspensions containing 0, 20, and 40 g L-1 of filtered
   liquid bovine manure, which subsequently were equilibrated with air-dry
   sieved soil in different soil to suspension ratios. The Langmuir
   isotherm equation was fitted to data. Manure dramatically affected E.
   coli attachment to soil. Attachment isotherms were closer to linear
   without manure and were strongly nonlinear in the presence of manure.
   The maximum E. coli attachment occurred in the absence of manure.
   Increasing manure content generally resulted in decreased attachment.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The performance of a gear set is strongly influenced by the
   manufacturing and assembly quality. Therefore, detailed analyses at the
   design stage, where the effects of expected assembly and manufacturing
   errors can be simulated, are crucial. At all early design stage, when
   contact conditions are addressed, the widely used finite element method
   (FEM) may still result in unwanted computing time. The paper presents an
   Express model developed to serve as a fast design tool offering fine
   simulation and a high precision level. The model establishes load
   sharing, fillet stresses and pressure distribution along the contacting
   surfaces of meshing helical gear teeth. The calculations combine the
   finite strip method with a pseudo-three-dimensional (3D) model of the
   tooth base solved with finite differences to calculate tooth bending
   deflexion and fillet stresses. The accuracy of the procedure is
   demonstrated through 3D FEM models. A contact cell discretization
   completes the model. This very fast and accurate approach gives the
   contact pressure distributions resulting from the roll-slide motion of
   mating teeth. An analysis of a helical gear set in two different
   assembly positions reveals the effects of edge contact, and exhibits the
   influence of tooth stiffness reduction near tooth corners.}},

Abstract = {{The OFFSET (Odor from Feedlots - Setback Estimation Tool) model was
   developed to estimate the setback distances from animal production sites
   in Minnesota. It is based on odor emissions taken from field
   measurements and an evaluated air dispersion model. The odor emissions
   of a site were estimated using odor emission rates that were the
   geometric means of odor emissions measured from 280 animal buildings and
   manure storage units on 85 farms in Minnesota. The odor-annoyance-free
   intensity level was set at 2 (faint odor) on a 0 (no odor) to 5 (very
   strong odor) intensity scale. An evaluated air dispersion model,
   INPUFF-2, was used to calculate setback distances from various animal
   farms for the set odor-annoyance-free level under six weather conditions
   that favor odor transport. Setback distances are presented in a graphic
   form as well as mathematically as a function of the total odor emission
   factor and the desired odor-annoyance-free frequency of the neighbors.
   Odor-annoyance-free frequencies between 91\% and 99\% are based on the
   average weather data for Minnesota from 1984 to 1992. Suggestions for
   odor-annoyance-free frequency selections are given. The OFFSET model
   also deals with residences located in different directions from a
   livestock site. Additionally, it can determine the odor occurrence
   frequency of a residence surrounded by several livestock sites.
   Comparing the setback distances obtained from the OFFSET model and the
   odor events reported by the resident observers, it was found that the
   OFFSET model does not overpredict odor transport distances under very
   stable weather conditions. By comparing the OFFSET predictions with the
   odor complainers' distances from swine farms, it was clear that their
   residences had high odor occurrence frequencies. The OFFSET model was
   also evaluated by comparing odor occurrences documented by the resident
   odor observers in the vicinity of eight livestock farms. It was found
   that although the model may describe the average neighborhood intensity
   correctly, a high variation in the observed odor intensities existed for
   all levels of predicted intensities calculated from the OFFSET Further
   research is needed to improve the accuracy of OFFSET and also to improve
   the field odor measurement method by the resident observers to obtain
   reliable odor occurrence data. By comparing OFFSET with four other
   existing setback guidelines, it was found that the distances required by
   the other models fell in or below the 91\% to 98\% annoyance-free curves
   of the OFFSET.}},

Abstract = {{The hot deformation of AZ31 magnesium alloy has been studied by
   compression testing using a Gleeble 1500 machine at temperatures between
   250 and 450 degrees C and at strain rates ranging from 0.005 to 5 s(-1).
   Optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have been
   used to observe microstructures of the alloy. The experimental results
   show that the flow stress behaviour can be described by an exponential
   law at temperatures below 350 degrees C. At higher temperatures a power
   law of deformation is valid. The hot deformation activation energy 0
   derived from the experimental data is 112 U mol(-1) with a stress
   exponent n=7. Optical microscopy and TEM observations show that dynamic
   recrystallisation (DRX) takes place during the deformation process and
   the formation of new grains occurs by conventional DRX nucleation by
   bulging. The average DRX grain size D-rex is sensitively dependent on
   deformation temperature T and strain rate (epsilon) over dot and is also
   a function of the Zener-Hollomon parameter Z. The relationship between Z
   and D-rex has been experimentally constructed using linear regression.
   In the present work, DRX grains nucleate by bulging of some portions of
   serrated grain boundaries, accompanied by the formation of twinning.}},

Title = {{Multichannel fusion models for the parametric classification of
   differential brain activity}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{52}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces parametric multichannel fusion models to exploit
   the different but complementary brain activity information recorded from
   multiple channels in order to accurately classify differential brain
   activity into their respective categories. A parametric weighted
   decision fusion model and two parametric weighted data fusion models are
   introduced for the classification of averaged multichannel evoked
   potentials (EPs). The decision fusion model combines the independent
   decisions of each channel classifier into a decision fusion vector and a
   parametric classifier is designed to determine the EP class from the
   discrete decision fusion vector. The data fusion models include the
   weighted EP-sum model in which the fusion vector is a linear combination
   of the multichannel EPs and the EP-concatenation model in which the
   fusion vector is a vector-concatenation of the multichannel EPs. The
   discrete Karhunen-Loeve transform (DKLT) is used to select features for
   each channel classifier and from each data fusion vector. The difficulty
   in estimating the probability density function (PDF) parameters from a
   small number of averaged EPs is identified and the class conditional
   PDFs of the feature vectors of averaged EPs are, therefore, derived in
   terms of the PDFs of the single-trial EPs. Multivariate parametric
   classifiers are developed for each fusion strategy and the performances
   of the different strategies are compared by classifying 14-channel EPs
   collected from five subjects involved in making explicit match/mismatch
   comparisons between sequentially presented stimuli. It is shown that the
   performance improves by incorporating weights in the fusion rules and
   that the best performance is obtained using multichannel EP
   concatenation. It is also noted that the fusion strategies introduced
   are also applicable to other problems involving the classification of
   multicategory multivariate signals generated from multiple sources.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic parameters for height (HT), diameter (diameter at breast height

   population in Missouri were estimated from a single progeny test
   comprising 44 half-sibling families assessed at 3, 5, 7, 10, and 17
   years. Individual tree heritability estimates for growth traits at age
   10 years and younger were high (0.30-0.43), and those at age 17 years
   were low (0.11-0.24). Heritability estimates for dbh were lower than
   those for HT Family mean heritability estimates were moderate to high
   (0.32-0.66). Genetic correlations were higher than their phenotypic
   counterparts for all growth traits. Age-age genetic correlations for
   growth traits were moderate to high (0.68-0.98), indicating opportunity
   for early selection. Genetic correlations between different growth
   traits were high (0.81-1.00). Indirect selection on age 5- or 7-year HTs
   may be expected to produce over 25\% more volume at 17 years compared
   with direct selection for volume at age 17 years. Efficiencies of
   selection suggest that early HT is a better selection criterion for
   volume at older ages than dbh because of the high heritability at young
   ages and strong juvenile-mature genetic correlations. Genetic gain in an
   unrogued seed orchard was predicted to be 6.7 and 27.2\% for 10- and
   17-year volume, respectively. These results suggest that growth traits
   in shortleaf pine in Missouri have high genetic variation, and genetic
   improvement was effective.}},

Abstract = {{In the past, working-age immigrant families in Canada's large urban
   centres had higher home-ownership rates than the Canadian-born. Over the
   past 20 years, however, this advantage has reversed, due jointly to a
   drop in immigrant rates and a rise in the popularity of home-ownership
   among the Canadian-born. This paper assesses the efficacy of a fairly
   standard microeconomic consumer choice model, which includes indicators
   for age, income, education, family type and immigrant characteristics,
   plus several interactions with time, to explain these changes. It is
   found that the standard model almost completely explains the immigrant
   home-ownership advantage in 1981, as well as the rise in home-ownership
   rates over time among the Canadian-born. Even after accounting for the
   well-known decline in immigrant economic fortunes, however, it is shown
   that only about half of the 1981-2001 immigrant change in home-ownership
   rates is explained by the standard model.}},

   lattice sites in unentangled states, and allowing unitary evolution
   under time. Alice and Bob perform a projective measurement on their
   respective qutrits at a given time, and obtain a maximally entangled
   Bell state with a certain probablility. We also consider two further
   protocols, one based on simple repetition and the other based on
   successive measurements and conditional resetting, and show that the
   cumulative probability of creating a Bell state between Alice and Bob
   tends to unity.}},

Abstract = {{Source factors with regard to phosphorus (P) loss in runoff waters are
   often soil test P and P content of fertilisers applied. More recently,
   water extractable P (WEP) fractions in fertilisers and animal manure
   have been the focus of many field and plot-scale studies. This study
   evaluated changes in the WEP content of six poultry litters by varying
   the extraction ratio from 1:10 (20g fresh poultry litter to 200 ml
   water) to 1:200 (I g fresh poultry litter to 200 ml water), and also the
   relation between WEP content determined at these different ratios and P
   concentrations in runoff water collected during rainfall simulations.
   Six different poultry litters were surface-applied at equivalent total P
   (TP) application rates (similar to 67 kg {[}TP] ha(-1)) to 1.52 by 6.10
   in grass plots on a 5\% slope which received artificial rainfall at 5 cm
   h(-1) until 30 min of continuous runoff was observed. Four plots were
   used per treatment including four control plots (no poultry litter
   application). Water-extractable P content of the various poultry litters
   increased with a decrease in the amount of poultry litter used in the
   extraction, i.e. from an extraction ratio of 1:10 to 1:200. However,
   these results also suggest that the 1:10 extraction ratio may extract
   different fractions of WEP compared to the 1:200 extraction ratio, and
   that some variability in dry weight extraction ratios existed when using
   fresh poultry litter. Waterextractable P application rates were
   positively correlated to P concentrations in runoff waters from the
   small plots. This study reaffirmed the importance of WEP content of
   poultry litter when determining the potential for P loss in surface
   runoff but demonstrated differences in the relation between runoff
   soluble reactive P (SRP) concentrations and WEP application rates
   related to the runoff to rainfall ratio. Published by Elsevier Ltd on

   practices (11\%; chi(2) = 96.80; P = .0001). Overall, 62\% of eligible
   women enrolled onto the study and 50\% of enrollees completed genetic
   counseling. Women with a stronger family history of cancer (odds ratio
   {[}OR] = 3.18; 95\% CI, 1.36 to 7.44; P = .01) and those referred from
   oncology clinics and community oncology resources (OR = 2.97; 95\% CI,
   1.34 to 6.58; P = .01) were most likely to enroll onto the study.
   Referral from oncology clinics was associated significantly with
   participation in genetic counseling (OR = 5.46; 95\% CI, 1.44 to 20.60;
   P = .01).
   Conclusion Despite receiving a large number of referrals, only a small
   subset of women were eligible for enrollment. Oncology settings were the
   most effective at identifying eligible African American women and
   general medical practices were the least effective. Factors associated
   with enrollment included having a stronger family history of cancer and
   being referred from oncology clinics and community oncology resources.
   Referral from oncology clinics was the only factor associated
   significantly with participation in genetic counseling. Education about
   hereditary breast cancer may be needed among primary care providers to
   enhance appropriate referral of African American women to genetic
   counseling for BRCA1/2 mutations.}},

Title = {{A preliminary investigation of genomic screening in cervical carcinoma

Journal = {{INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{122}},

Abstract = {{Background \& objectives: Available clinical, radiological and
   histopathologic risk factors are not adequate for accurate prognosis in
   uterine cervix carcinoma. Hence there is a need to identify indicators
   to select high risk cases. Most cancers occur and progress through
   step-wise somatic genetic mutations. Thus screening of whole genome for
   specific genomic alterations and its outcome following treatment may
   predict prognosis. The present study was carried out to investigate
   genomic alterations associated with cervical carcinoma and any
   association of genomic alterations with clinico-pathologic parameters.
   Methods: Cervical carcinoma cases (n = 4) were subjected to protocol
   based clinical evaluation, treatment and follow up as a double blind
   procedure. Tumour samples were collected before radiotherapy and 3
   months after completion of radiotherapy. All the samples were stored at
   -80 degrees C. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was carried out
   to screen genomic alterations in all tumour samples obtained before
   treatment. Conventional fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was
   carried out to confirm the CGH findings and to follow up post-treatment
   samples. Patients were followed up for a minimum of one year or untill
   death.
   Results: The CGH analysis identified genomic losses and gains. The gains
   were observed mainly in chromosomes 1q 25.1, 3q 26.1, 6q 13-16, 9p 22
   and X, and losses in chromosome 10 and 11q21-24. CGH and FISH results
   were complementary to each other. Of the four patients, two were alive
   and two were dead at the end of follow up.
   Interpretation and conclusion: Initial results' indicated that
   persistence of genomic alterations and appearance of giant nucleus was
   associated with poor prognosis and the same may be used to follow up
   patient. Similar studies on large sample with longer period of follow up
   are warranted to validate our result.}},

   phosphorylation}},

Abstract = {{TNF-alpha\textbackslash{} is recognized as a significant contributor to
   myocardial dysfunction. Although several studies suggest that members of
   the NF-kappa B family of transcription factors are essential regulators
   of myocardial TNF-alpha gene expression, recent developments in our
   understanding of the modulation of NF-kappa B activity through
   posttranslational modification of NF-kappa B subunits suggest that the
   present view of NF-kappa B-dependent cytokine expression in heart is
   incomplete. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to examine the
   role of p65 subunit phosphorylation in the regulation of TNF-kappa
   production in cultured neonatal ventricular myocytes. Bacterial
   LPS-induced TNF-alpha production is accompanied by a 12-fold increase in
   phosphorylation of p65 at Ser(536), a modification associated with
   enhancement of p65 transactivation potential. Pharmacological inhibition
   of IKK-beta reduced LPS-induced TNF-alpha production 38-fold, TNF-alpha
   mRNA levels 6-fold, and I kappa B-alpha phosphorylation 5-fold and
   degraded I kappa B-alpha 2-fold and p65 phosphorylation 6-fold.
   Overexpression of dominant-negative p65 reduced TNF-alpha production
   3.5-fold, whereas overexpression of dominant-negative IKK-beta reduced
   LPS-induced TNF-alpha production 2-fold and p65 phosphorylation 2-fold.
   Overexpression of dominant-negative IKK-alpha had no effect on p65
   phosphorylation or TNF-alpha production, revealing that IKK-beta, not
   IKK-alpha, plays a central role in regulation of p65 phosphorylation at
   Ser536 and TNF-alpha production in heart. Finally, we demonstrated,
   using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, that LPS stimulates
   recruitment of Ser(536)-phosphorylated p65 to the TNF-alpha gene
   promoter in cardiac myocytes. Taken together, these data provide
   compelling evidence for the role of NF-kappa B signaling in TNF-alpha
   gene expression in heart and highlight the importance of this
   proinflammatory gene-regulatory pathway as a potential therapeutic
   target in the management of cytokine-induced myocardial dysfunction.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) based functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is accompanied by substantial acoustic
   gradient noise. This noise can influence the performance as well as
   neuronal activations. Conventional fMRI typically has a pulsed noise
   component, which is a particularly efficient auditory stimulus. We
   investigated whether the elimination of this pulsed noise component in a
   recent modification of continuous-sound fMRI modifies neuronal
   activations in a cognitively demanding non-auditory working memory task.
   Sixteen normal subjects performed a letter variant n-back task. Brain
   activity and psychomotor performance was examined during fMRI with
   continuous-sound fmRI and conventional fMRI. We found greater BOLD
   responses in bilateral medial frontal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus,
   left middle temporal gyrus, left hippocampus, right superior frontal
   gyrus, right precuneus and right cingulate gyrus with continuous-sound
   compared to conventional fMRI. Conversely, BOLD responses were greater
   in bilateral cingulate gyrus, left middle and superior frontal gyrus and
   right lingual gyrus with conventional compared to continuous-sound fMRI
   There were no differences in psychomotor performance between both
   scanning protocols. Although behavioral performance was not affected,
   acoustic gradient noise interferes with neuronal activations in
   non-auditory cognitive tasks and represents a putative systematic
   confound.}},

Abstract = {{This article draws on the insights of research on transnational
   migration to reconsider the process of identity formation among children
   of immigrants and the patterns of acculturation associated with

   Miami CILS sample to examine the relationship between segmented
   assimilation outcomes, nationality, and behaviours and attitudes
   associated with transnationalism. Key findings include evidence
   associating selective acculturation with greater transnational
   involvement, but also some limited evidence of downward assimilation
   associated with higher rates of sending remittances among some
   nationalities. Rather than contradicting each other, these findings
   suggest a diversity of transnational patterns that are both stratified
   by class and contoured by nationality and ethnicity. We conclude by
   outlining some of the questionnaire items and aspects of research design
   we would like to see implemented in future studies of transnationalism

Abstract = {{Programmable logic cores differ from stand-alone field-programmable gate
   arrays in that they can take on a variety of shapes and sizes. With this
   in mind, we investigate the detailed routing architecture of rectangular

   and Y channel capacities and show that the optimum ratio between the X
   and Y channel widths for a rectangular core is between 1.2 and 1.5. We
   also present a new switch block family optimized for rectangular cores.
   Further, we quantify the effects of logic block pin placement. Compared
   with a simple extension of an existing switch block, our new
   architecture leads to a density improvement of up to 11.9\%. Finally, we
   show that, if the channel width, switch block, and pin placement are
   chosen carefully, then the penalty for using a rectangular core
   (compared to a square core with the same logic capacity) is small; for a
   core with an aspect ratio of 2:1, the area penalty is 1.6\% and the
   speed penalty is 3.8\%.}},

Abstract = {{The hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein (NS) 5A is a
   phosphoprotein that associates with various cellular proteins and
   participates in the replication of the HCV genome. Human
   vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein (VAP) subtype A
   (VAP-A) is known to be a host factor essential for HCV replication by
   binding to both NS5A and NS5B. To obtain more information on the NS5A
   protein in HCV replication, we screened human brain and liver libraries
   by a yeast two-hybrid system using NS5A as bait and identified VAP-B as
   an WA-binding protein. Immunoprecipitation and mutation analyses
   revealed that VAP-B binds to both NS5A and NS5B in mammalian cells and
   forms homo- and heterodimers with VAP-A. VAP-A interacts with VAP-B
   through the transmembrane domain. NS5A interacts with the coiled-coil
   domain of VAP-B via 70 residues in the N-terminal and 341 to 344 amino
   acids in the C-terminal polyproline cluster region. NS5A was colocalized
   with VAP-B in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. The
   specific antibody to VAP-B suppressed HCV RNA replication in a cell-free
   assay. Overexpression of VAP-B, but not of a mutant lacking its
   transmembrane domain, enhanced the expression of NS5A and NS5B and the
   replication of HCV RNA in Huh-7 cells harboring a subgenomic replicon.
   In the HCV replicon cells, the knockdown of endogenous VAP-B by small
   interfering RNA decreased expression of NS5B, but not of NS5A. These
   results suggest that VAP-B, in addition to VAP-A, plays an important
   role in the replication of the HCV genome.}},

   control and pilocarpine-treated rats, except for the nucleus reuniens
   and the rhomboid nucleus, which had a lower intensity of staining in the
   epileptic group. In animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy, zinc seems
   to modulate glutamate release and to decrease seizure activity. In this
   context, a reduction of neo-Timm-stained terminals in the midline
   thalamus could ultimately result in an increased excitatory activity,
   not only within its related nuclei, but also in anatomical structures
   that receive their efferent connections. This might contribute to the
   pathological substrate observed in chronic pilocarpine-treated epileptic
   animals.}},

Abstract = {{In size-structured groups, conflict over rank, resources or access to
   breeding opportunities is expected to be greatest among individuals that
   are similar in size. We tested this general prediction using the
   cooperatively breeding African cichlid, Neolamprologus pulcher. We
   predicted that, when size differences between group members were small,
   we would observe some or all of: increased aggression, increased
   submissive behaviour, increased help by subordinates or avoidance of
   dominants by subordinates. We created standardised groups each with a
   breeder male and female and a large and small helper (both males). The
   size of all group members was kept constant, with the exception of the
   breeder males, which were either only slightly larger than the largest
   helper or much larger. This created either large or small size
   differences between breeder males and the large helper (the 2(nd) ranked
   male in the group). We found that large helpers showed more submissive
   behaviours, reduced affiliative behaviour and kept further from breeding
   sites when male breeders were small. We did not find a consistent
   influence of breeder size on aggression. Together, these results support
   the prediction that conflict between breeder and helper is increased
   when breeders are small, but that this conflict is expressed through
   changes in submissive and affiliative behaviours and in space use rather
   than aggression. In contrast to our predictions, large helpers increased
   helping (territorial defence) when the male breeder was large; the
   reasons for this are unclear.}},

   driver information processing. The work was conducted on behalf of
   Network Rail to meet a requirement to understand and manage the driver's
   interaction with the infrastructure through lineside reminder

   to describe driver performance in relation to infrastructure features
   and operational conditions. The model is capable of predicting the
   performance time, workload and error consequences of different
   operational conditions. The utility of the model is demonstrated through
   reports of its application to the following studies:
   Research on the effect of line speed on driver interaction with signals
   and signs.
   Calculation of minimum reading times for signals.
   Development of a human factors signals passed at danger (SPAD) hazard

   Study design: The Undergraduate Medical Education Committee of APGO and
   the NBME staff separately reviewed the same 2 NBME obstetrics and
   gynecology subject examinations. The questions were mapped to the 15
   essential elements of the APGO educational objectives and comparisons
   were made to check how well they matched.
   Results: All the essential elements of the educational objectives were
   covered by the NBME subject examination. Of the questions on the
   examination, 99\% were deemed appropriate for medical Students with 70\%
   Of the questions mapping to ``Priority 1{''} objectives.

Abstract = {{The rotation direction and depth order of a rotating sphere consisting
   of random dots often reverses while it is viewed under orthographic
   projection. However, if a short viewing distance is simulated under
   perspective projection, the correct rotation direction can be perceived.
   There are two motion cues for the rotation direction and depth order.
   One is the speed cue; points with higher velocities are closer to the
   observer. The other is the vertical motion cue; vertical motion is
   induced when the dots recede from or approach the observer. It was
   examined whether circular motion, which does not have any depth
   information but induces vertical velocities, masks the vertical motion
   cue. In Experiment 1, the effects of circular motion on the judgment of
   the rotation direction of a rotating sphere were examined. The magnitude
   of the two cues (the speed cue and the vertical velocity cue) as well as
   the angular speed of circular motion was varied. It was found that the
   performance improved as the vertical velocity increased and that the
   speed cue had slight effects on the judgment of the rotation direction.
   It was also found that the performance worsened as the angular speed of
   the circular motion was increased. In Experiment 2, the effects of
   circular motion on depth judgment of a rotating half sphere were
   investigated. The performance worsened as the angular speed of the
   circular motion increased, as in Experiment 1. These results suggest
   that the visual system cannot compensate perfectly for circular motion
   for the judgment of the rotation direction and depth order.}},

Abstract = {{West Nile virus (WNV) encodes two envelope proteins, premembrane (prM)
   and envelope (E). While the prM protein of all WNV strains contains a
   single N-linked glycosylation site, not all strains contain an N-linked
   site in the E protein. The presence of N-linked glycosylation on
   flavivirus E proteins has been linked to virus production, pH
   sensitivity, and neuroinvasiveness. Therefore, we examined the impact of
   prM and E glycosylation on WNV assembly and infectivity. Similar to
   other flaviviruses, expression of WNV prM and E resulted in the release
   of subviral particles (SVPs). Removing the prM glycosylation site in a
   lineage I or II strain decreased SVP release, as did removal of the
   glycosylation site in a lineage I E protein. Addition of the E protein
   glycosylation site in a lineage II strain that lacked this site
   increased SVP production. Similar results were obtained in the context
   of either reporter virus particles (RVPs) or infectious lineage 11 WNV.
   RVPs or virions bearing combinations of glycosylated and nonglycosylated
   forms of prM and E could infect mammalian, avian, and mosquito cells
   (BHK-21, QT6, and C6/36, respectively). Those particles lacking
   glycosylation on the E protein were modestly more infectious per genome
   copy on BHK-21 and QT6 cells, while this absence greatly enhanced the
   infection of C6/36 cells. Thus, glycosylation of WNV prM and E proteins
   can affect the efficiency of virus release and infection in a manner
   that is cell type and perhaps species dependent. This suggests a
   multifaceted role for envelope N-linked glycosylation in WNV biology and
   tropism.}},

Abstract = {{Geographic studies of refugee issues have emerged as salient topics of
   inquiry in the past decade. This spatial analysis of the migration
   experiences and heterolocal settlement patterns of refugees in an
   increasingly diverse part of the Pacific Northwest focuses on a place
   that the Atlantic Monthly recently called the last Caucasian bastion in
   the United States. Perceived as a region better known for its dense
   forests, progressive environmental policies, and rural ambience, the
   Portland metropolitan area and its hinterland in the Willamette Valley
   now resonate with ethnic and racial diversity. This article analyzes the
   spatial patterns and related networks of the three largest refugee
   groups in the region. Findings indicate that an overlapping and
   interrelated set of political, social, cultural, and economic networks
   are the most important factors in determining refugee residential
   patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Emergency physicians (EPs) are commonly faced with life-threatening
   entities. Particularly challenging are the aortic catastrophes, such as
   penetrating aortic ulcers (PAUs), intramural hematomas (IMHs), and
   atypical presentations of acute aortic dissections and ruptured
   abdominal aortic aneurysms. Several factors account for this: (1) the
   rapidly evolving knowledge (particularly in the pathogenesis and
   precursors of aortic dissection {[}AD]), (2) the lack of comfort caused
   by infrequent exposure, (3) the misconceptions about the work up and
   treatment, (4) the lack of emergent vascular surgery back up in the
   community, and finally (5) the high short-term mortality and missed
   rates. Finally, the media has publicized cases of celebrities and other
   patients who experienced fatal outcomes when their aortic catastrophes
   went undiagnosed. Practitioners of emergency care should, therefore,
   understand the challenges, be aware of the recent advances, and help
   limit the controversies in the evaluation and management of these

Volume = {{111}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{215-220}},

Abstract = {{Using seven tropical rainforest species of north Queensland, Australia,
   we simulated partial predation and compared the development of intact
   embryos and embryos from which various proportions had been removed,
   including in some cases the original root-shoot axis. Embryos of all
   species contained storage reserve cotyledons and germinate in a hypogeal
   manner. Species mean embryo masses ranged from 0.4-48.1 g. Partial
   embryo predation treatments were: 1/2 embryo treatment; embryos
   separated into component cotyledons, and 1/4 embryo treatment;
   cotyledons separated as above and subsequently cut in half. Germination
   was scored as production of roots and shoots, or roots or shoots only.
   Embryos from all species produced seedlings in all treatments, even
   after the removal of up to 75 percent of the cotyledonary reserve.
   Moreover, the proportion germinating were not different between intact
   embryos and i) separated cotyledons, ii) cotyledon halves that
   maintained or were adjacent to the embryonic axis (except for the
   largest seeded species), and iii) cotyledon halves that did not include
   the root-shoot axis (four species). Thus, production of roots and
   shoots, or roots or shoots only was largely independent of the presence
   of the embryonic root-shoot axis - implying that somatic cells in
   storage cotyledons are capable of differentiating into the full range of
   cell types typical of shoots and roots in the absence of the root-shoot
   axis. The generality of this response across all seven species suggests
   somatic embryogenesis in storage cotyledons may be a more widespread
   phenomenon in tropical floras than currently considered.}},

Journal = {{FOOT \& ANKLE INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{937-941}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: The most consistent deformities that allow early diagnosis
   of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva are the presence of bilateral
   short first rays and hallux valgus. The purpose of this study was to
   describe the radiographic features observed in the feet of patients with
   fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. Methods: The radiographs of 26
   feet (15 patients with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva) were
   reviewed to evaluate the radiographic changes that occur in the first
   ray. Variables analyzed were the hallux valgus (NV) angle, the distal
   metatarsal articular (DMA) angle, the proximal phalangeal articular
   (PPA) angle, the intermetatarsal (IM) angle, ratio of the lengths of the
   first and second metatarsal lengths (MT1:MT2), and the first and second
   ray length ratio. The length ratios were then subtracted from similar
   ratios in radiographs of age- and gender-matched normal patients
   previously reported. Results: The proximal phalanx was consistently
   shortened but morphologically dissimilar from subject to subject.
   Asymmetry was noted in some patients with bilateral radiographs. The
   mean HV angle was 28 degrees, and the mean IM angle was 10 degrees. The
   mean DMA angle was 33 degrees, and the mean PPA angle was 14 degrees.
   The MT1:MT2 ratio was 0.89, and the mean first ray to second ray length
   ratio was 0.87. The mean of the differences in the MTf:MT2 and first and
   second ray length ratios in patients with fibrodysplasia ossificans
   progressiva compared to the normal controls were 0.05 and 0.01,
   respectively. Fusion occurred between the abnormal tibial epiphysis of
   the proximal phalanx and metatarsal head with advancing age, and 68\% of
   the metatarsal heads were fused with the abnormal proximal phalangeal
   epiphysis. Conclusions: Foot pathology in patients with fibrodysplasia
   ossificans progressiva is variable but consistently involves an
   abnormality of the tibial aspect of the proximal phalangeal epiphysis of
   the hallux. This results in the clinical observation of hallux valgus in
   these patients. The first metatarsal is consistently shortened, and
   fusion between the epiphysis of the abnormal proximal phalanx and the
   shortened first metatarsal head occurs with advancing age.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To determine if ultrasound (US) findings of abnormal portal
   venous flow (APVF) before transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
   (TIPS) creation are predictive of increased mortality risk after TIPS
   creation.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of 141 patients with US
   before TIPS creation was performed. APVF was defined by (i)
   bidirectional flow, (ii) thrombus, and/or (iii) reversed flow. Model for
   End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores were calculated. Kaplan-Meier
   survival curves and log-rank tests were used to detect survival
   differences based on the presence of APVF. Multivariate analysis
   included APVF, MELD, Child-Pugh class, International Normalized Ratio,
   creatinine level, total bilirubin level, ascites, hepatocellular
   carcinoma, low serum sodium level, congestive heart failure, and
   myocardial infarction.
   RESULTS: Twenty-six percent of patients (36 of 141) exhibited APVF on US
   before TIPS creation. Patients with APVF had lower survival rates at 3
   and 6 months after TIPS procedures in comparison with patients with
   normal portal flow (P = .02 at 3 months and P = .04 at 6 months). In
   patients with MELD scores lower than 18, there was decreased survival
   based on APVF at 1, 3, and 6 months (P = .04, P = .02, and P = .04,
   respectively). In patients with MELD scores of 18 or greater, there was
   a trend for lower survival rates with APVF, but it did not reach
   statistical significance. Multivariate analysis of patients with MELD
   scores lower than 18 demonstrated only APVF and low serum sodium levels
   as independent predictors of outcome, with APVF resulting in a greater
   than six-fold increased likelihood of mortality.
   CONCLUSION: US findings of APVF before TIPS creation are associated with
   increased mortality risk and may be useful in identifying patients
   otherwise considered safe candidates based on MELD score alone.}},

   SWNTs on glass, we typically observe highly confined PL from short

   SWNTs on mica is extended along the tube up to several hundreds of

Abstract = {{Black bears (Ursus americanus) may not develop disuse osteoporosis
   during long periods of disuse (i.e. hibernation) because they may be
   able to maintain bone formation. Previously, we found that cortical bone
   bending strength was not compromised with age in black bears tibias,
   despite annual periods of disuse. Here we showed that cortical bone
   tensile strength (166-198 MPa) also does not decrease with age (2-14
   years) in black bear tibias. There were also no significant age-related
   changes in cortical bone porosity in black bear tibias. It is likely
   that the ability of black bears to maintain bone formation during
   hibernation keeps bone porosity low (2.3-8.6\%) with aging,
   notwithstanding annual periods of disuse. This low porosity likely
   preserves ultimate stress with aging. Female bears give birth and nurse
   during hibernation; however, we found no significant differences between
   male and female tensile material properties, mineral content, or
   porosity. Our findings support the idea that black bears, which
   hibernate 5-7 months annually, have evolved biological mechanisms to
   mitigate the adverse effects of disuse on bone porosity and strength.

Abstract = {{Whether a higher dose of a long-acting angiotensin II receptor blocker
   (ARB) can provide as much blockade of the renin-angiotensin system over
   a 24-hour period as the combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme
   inhibitor and a lower dose of ARB has not been formally demonstrated so
   far. In this randomized double-blind study we investigated
   renin-angiotensin system blockade obtained with 3 doses of olmesartan
   medoxomil (20, 40, and 80 mg every day) in 30 normal subjects and
   compared it with that obtained with lisinopril alone (20 mg every day)
   or combined with olmesartan medoxomil (20 or 40 mg). Each subject
   received 2 dose regimens for 1 week according to a crossover design with
   a 1-week washout period between doses. The primary endpoint was the
   degree of blockade of the systolic blood pressure response to
   angiotensin I 24 hours after the last dose after 1 week of
   administration. At trough, the systolic blood pressure response to
   exogenous; angiotensin I was 58\% +/- 19\% with 20 mg lisinopril (mean
   +/- SD), 58\% +/- 11\% with 20 mg olmesartan medoxomil, 62\% +/- 16\%
   with 40 mg olmesartan medoxomil, and 76\% +/- 12\% with the highest dose
   of olmesartan medoxomil (80 mg) (P =.016 versus 20 mg lisinopril and P
   =.0015 versus 20 mg olmesartan medoxomil). With the combinations,
   blockade was 80\% +/- 22\% with 20 mg lisinopril plus 20 mg olmesartan
   medoxomil and 83\% +/- 9\% with 20 mg lisinopril plus 40 mg olmesartan
   medoxomil (P =.3 versus 80 mg olmesartan medoxomil alone). These data
   demonstrate that a higher dose of the long-acting ARB olmesartan
   medoxomil can produce an almost complete 24-hour blockade of the blood
   pressure response to exogenous; angiotensin in normal subjects. Hence, a
   higher dose of a long-acting ARB is as effective as a lower dose of the
   same compound combined with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor
   in terms of blockade of the vascular effects of angiotensin.}},

Abstract = {{Expression of isolated beta integrin cytoplasmic domains in cultured
   endothelial cells was reported to induce cell detachment and death. To
   test whether cell death was the cause or the consequence of cell
   detachment, we expressed isolated integrin beta 1 cytoplasmic and
   transmembrane domains (CHI) in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial
   cells (HUVEC),and monitored detachment, viability, caspase activation
   and signaling. CH I expression induced dose-dependent cell detachment.
   At 24 h over 90\% of CH I-expressing HUVEC were detached but largely
   viable(>85\%). No evidence of pro-caspase-8,-3, and PARP cleavage or
   suppression of phosphorylation of ERK, PKB and I kappa-B was observed.
   The caspase inhibitor z-VAD did not prevent cell detachment. At 48 h,
   however, CH I-expressing cells were over 50\% dead. As a comparison
   trypsin-mediated detachment resulted in a time-dependent cell death,
   paralleled by caspase-3 activation and suppression of ERK, PKB and I
   kappa-B phosphoyrylation at 24 h or later after detachment. HUVEC
   stimulation with agents that strengthen integrin-mediated adhesion (i.e.
   PMA the Src inhibitor PP2 and COMP-AngI) did not prevent CHI-induced
   detachment. Expression of CHI in rat carotid artery endothelial cells in
   vivo caused endothelial cell detachment and increased nuclear DNA
   fragmentation among detached cells. A construct lacking the integrin
   cytoplasmic domain (CH2) had no effect on adhesion and cell viability in
   vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate that isolated beta 1
   cytoplasmic domain expression induces caspase-independent detachment of
   viable endothelial cells and that death is secondary to detachment (i.e.
   anoikis). They also reveal an essential role for integrins in the
   adhesion and survival of quiescent endothelial cells in vivo.}},

   phosphonic acid (Cyanex), exchangers of anions such as Primene JMT and
   the Tri-n-octylamine (T.O.A) M in various diluents (chloroform,
   kerosene). We applied to these synthetic systems the conventional
   variables. Interesting outputs were obtained for diluted solutions (0.05
   M). The study of the chemical variables made it possible to determine
   chemical parameters giving of the outputs of optimum extraction. A
   chemical modelling made it possible to identify the mechanisms of

Abstract = {{A PPGIS (Public Participatory Geographical Information System) has
   recently been developed in combination with PRA (Participatory Rural
   Appraisal) and GIs (Geographical Information Systems) methodologies to
   milise GIs in the context of the needs of communities that are involved
   with, and affected by development programmes. The impact of arsenic
   poisoning in Bangladesh is `tragic and painful' on patients' health and
   their social life what was described as the `worse mass poisoning in
   human history' in a WHO report. Deep tubewell is said to be a source of
   arsenic-free safe drinking water and people are mainly interested in
   deep tubewell water rather than rainwater harvesting, dug-wells, and
   pond-sand-filters (PSF) approved by the BAMWSP (Bangladesh Arsenic
   Mitigation Water Supply Project).
   This paper mainly explores the application and suitability of GIs with
   local community participation in deep tubewell planning for arsenic
   mitigation. The relevant data for this study were collected from the
   field survey. The PRA methods were used to obtain social and resource
   information; while a GIs was used to organise, analyse, and display the
   information. Participants from three different focus-groups were asked
   to determine their `own priorities' for spatial planning of deep
   tubewell for arsenic-free water. The study results valuable community
   perspectives on deep tubewell planning and reveals the suitability of
   PPGIS in spatial planning for arsenic mitigation with local community
   mapping overlay. The process of dialogue and preparation of mental
   mapping within each focus-group participants lead to enhance information
   about community needs of deep tubewell in the study area. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Increasingly, public health practice is turning to the application of
   community collaborative models to improve population health status.
   Despite the growth of these activities, however, evaluations of the
   national demonstrations have indicated that community health
   partnerships fail to achieve measurable results and struggle to maintain
   integrity required for sustaining efforts. Whereas community
   partnerships are difficult to evaluate, traditional evaluation methods
   may not be addressing outcomes most relevant to ways partnerships work
   and may fail to provide information needed by different Partners to make
   decisions about their continued involvement. This article presents the
   results of a qualitative case study designed to identify indicators of
   success for a specific community partnership and to test the feasibility
   of an evaluation tool more suitable for collaborative efforts. Using
   Principles of social capital, the research demonstrates that through the
   discovery and communication of what is valued by participating
   collaborative members, evaluations can both address internal information
   needs for sustainability and produce assessments of effects on health
   outcomes. The ``value{''} indicators generated by the evaluation tool
   are value presented, as is a description of the process by which they
   were negotiated. Feedback from the pilot-test participants on the
   feasibility and value of the process is also presented. By discovering
   outcome measures that suit both participants and policy makers,
   community partnerships may move toward greater accountability and hence
   sustainability. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

   correlations. Then, the gas-liquid mass transfer between the bubble and
   the surrounding liquid is studied theoretically. An equation describing
   the transport of the transferred species in the viscous boundary layer
   around the bubble is solved. In a second step, a bubble column of 6-10m
   height is studied experimentally. The gas phase in the column is
   characterized experimentally by means of a gammametric technique.
   Finally, the two studies are linked, yielding a 1D mathematical model

Abstract = {{Cyanobacterial biovolume is used as a guide to the public health risk
   from these organisms for users of potable and recreational waters. Most
   routine surveillance programs preserve phytoplankton samples before
   analysis. We tested the effect of Lugol's Iodine, a common preservative,
   on the cell biovolume of four common freshwater cyanobacteria,
   Microcystis aeruginosa, Anabaena circinalis, Cylindrospermopsis
   raciborskii and Aphanocapsa incerta. Linear dimensions and cell area
   were measured with an image analyser. All four species shrank after
   preservation. The magnitude of shrinkage varied with species and
   preservation time but was not affected by Lugol's concentration. The
   maximum shrinkage in each species was a 30-40\% reduction compared to
   the live cell biovolume. These results suggest shrinkage can be a
   greater source of uncertainty in estimating the biovolume of toxigenic
   cyanobacteria in aquatic environments than natural variability in the
   cell dimensions, instrument precision or cell counting. Standardised
   cyanobacterial biovolume lists based on agreed geometric shapes and

   (1700-fold) and disrupted signaling, but antagonist binding was
   unaffected. Mutation of Glu(54) had an almost identical pharmacological
   effect as mutation of Arg(46), raising the possibility that agonist
   binding required a mutual interaction between Glu(54) and Arg(46). The
   role of these two charged residues was investigated by 1) substituting
   Glu(54); 2) inserting additional Glu/Arg in transmembrane helix (TM) 1;
   3) repositioning the Glu/Arg in TM1; and 4) characterizing the
   reciprocal mutant {[}R46E/E54R] V1aR. We conclude that 1) the
   positive/negative charges need to be precisely positioned in this N
   terminus/TM1 segment; and 2) Glu(54) and Arg(46) function independently,
   providing two discrete epitopes required for high-affinity agonist
   binding and signaling. This study explains why Glu and Arg, part of an
   -R(X-3)L/V(X-3)E(X-3)L- motif, are conserved at these loci throughout
   this G protein-coupled receptor subfamily and provides molecular insight
   into key differences between agonist and antagonist binding
   requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To gain an understanding of the experience of pregnancy while

   Design: Phenomenological study.
   Setting: The participants were interviewed in their own homes, a quiet

   Participants: Fifteen pregnant women carrying a child with a nonlethal,
   congenital abnormality participated.
   Results: The pregnancy experience was of a paradoxical nature. Knowledge
   of the fetal diagnosis resulted in both positive and negative
   consequences. Three major themes were common to the experience for
   women: Time is good, but it is also the enemy; you grieve, but you do
   not grieve; my baby's not perfect, but (s)he's still mine.
   Conclusion: Because of the paradoxical feelings experienced, women need
   as much information as they request regarding the abnormality its
   treatment, and prognosis. An appointment during pregnancy with pediatric
   specialists to discuss the plan for care of the infant after delivery is
   beneficial. Health care providers should support women's prenatal
   attachment during this unique pregnancy.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Children with minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS)
   receive repeated courses of high dose oral prednisolone. No previous
   study has investigated the impact of this on final bone mineral density
   (BMD). Young adults previously reported in a large follow-up study of
   children with MCNS were invited to participate in a cross-sectional
   study. Areal BMD (aBMD) of the spine (L1-4), left femoral neck, and
   total left hip was measured using dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and
   volumetric BMD (vBMD) of the distal radius was measured by pQCT. BMD
   results were compared with reference data provided by the manufacturers
   of the densitometers.
   Methods. Thirty-four (24 male) of the original cohort of 62 participated
   in the study. The mean (SD) final height Z score of the cohort was -0.45
   (0.92) (P= 0.007) and mean BMI Z score 1.62 (1.53) (P < 0.0001).
   Results. There was a highly significant reduction in distal radial
   trabecular vBMD; the mean Z score was -0.95 (0.99) and T score -1.04
   (1.01) (both P < 0.0001); however, there was no reduction in distal
   radial total vBMD, the mean Z score being 0.00 (0.95) and T score -0.08
   (0.99), (P= 0.99 and 0.66, respectively). The aBMD of the lumbar spine
   and femoral neck also showed a reduction in T scores {[}-0.45 (1.27), P=
   0.045 and -0.49 (0.86), P= 0.002, respectively], but not Z scores
   {[}-0.37 (1.28) and -0.15 (0.87), respectively, both P= NS]. Total hip
   aBMD was not different from the control population.
   Conclusion. Adult survivors of childhood MCNS have a significant
   reduction in forearm trabecular vBMD, placing them at increased fracture
   risk at this site.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Mesothelial cell transplantation has been suggested to
   improve mesothelial repair after surgery, recurrent peritonitis and
   peritoneal dialysis.
   Methods. In this study we evaluated mesothelial cell transplantation
   during the resolution phase of experimentally thioglycollate-induced
   peritonitis in rats. To this end 4 x 10(6) DiO-labeled autologous
   mesothelial cells were transplanted 1 week after peritonitis induction.
   Peritoneal inflammation and permeability characteristics were evaluated
   after another week.
   Results. Mesothelial cell transplantation after peritonitis resulted in
   incorporation of these cells in the parietal mesothelial lining, leading
   to an acute transient submesothelial thickening which was not seen in
   transplanted animals without prior peritonitis induction. Long-term
   functioning of these repopulated mesothelial cells leaded to peritoneal
   activation as evidenced by a similar to twofold increase in peritoneal
   lymphocytes (P < 0.01) and omental mast cell counts (P < 0.05),
   accompanied by the induction of inflammation markers monocyte
   chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (P < 0.01) and hyaluronan (P < 0.01)
   in the transplanted peritonitis group, but not in rats with peritonitis
   without mesothelial cell transplantation or in control rats without
   mesothelial cell transplantation (all four parameters P < 0.01). In
   addition, trapping of transplanted mesothelial cells in the milky spots
   of omental tissue and lymphatic stomata of the diaphragm both in control
   and thioglycollate rats seems to increase microvascular permeability,
   reflected by apparent increased diffusion rates of small solutes and
   proteins.
   Conclusion. Altogether, our data underscore the importance of
   controlling peritoneal (patho)physiology and function in mesothelial
   transplantation protocols.}},

Abstract = {{A very popular approach in proteomics is the so-called ``shotgun
   LC-MS/MS{''} strategy. In its mostly used form, a total protein digest
   is separated by ion exchange fractionation in the first dimension
   followed by off- or on-line RP LC-MS/MS. We replaced the first dimension
   by isoelectric focusing in the liquid phase using the Off-Gel device
   producing 15 fractions. As peptides are separated by their isoelectric
   point in the first dimension and hydrophobicity in the second, those
   experimentally derived parameters (p/ and R-T) can be used for the
   validation of potentially identified peptides. We applied this strategy
   to a cellular extract of Drosophila Kc167 cells and identified peptides
   with two different database search engines, namely PHENYX and SEQUEST,
   with PeptideProphet validation of the SEQUEST results. PHENYX returned
   7582 potential peptide identifications and SEQUEST 7629. The SEQUEST
   results were reduced to 2006 identifications by validation with
   PeptideProphet. Validation of the PeptideProphet, SEQUEST and PHENYX
   results by p/ and RT parameters confirmed 1837 PeptideProphet
   identifications while in the remainder of the SEQUEST results another
   1130 peptides were found to be likely hits. The validation on PHENYX
   resulted in the fixation of a solid p-value threshold of < 1 X 10(-04)
   that sets by itself the correct identification confidence to > 95\%, and
   a final count of 2034 highly confident peptide identifications was
   achieved after p/ and RT validation. Although the PeptideProphet and
   PHENYX datasets have a very high confidence the overlap of common
   identifications was only at 79.4\%, to be explained by the fact that
   data interpretation was done searching different protein databases with
   two search engines of different algorithms. The approach used in this
   study allowed for an automated and improved data validation process for
   shotgun proteomics projects producing MS/MS peptide identification

Abstract = {{This study examined tactile and visual temporal processing in adults
   with early loss of hearing. The tactile task consisted of punctate
   stimulations that were delivered to one or both hands by a mechanical
   tactile stimulator. Pairs of light emitting diodes were presented on a
   display for visual;stimulation. Responses consisted of YES or NO
   judgments as to whether the onset of the pairs of stimuli was perceived
   simultaneously or non-simultaneously. Tactile and visual temporal
   thresholds were significantly higher for the deaf group when compared to
   controls. In contrast to controls, tactile and visual temporal
   thresholds for the deaf group did not differ when presentation locations
   were examined. Overall findings of this study support the notion that
   temporal processing is compromised following early death ss regardless
   of the spatial location in which the stimuli are presented. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to determine the differences
   between rural and urban surgeons with regard to practice patterns,
   factors in choosing a practice location, and educational needs.
   STUDY DESIGN: A list of surgeons obtained from the American Medical
   Association was examined using the Office of Management and Budget
   definition of rural Seventeen hundred rural surgeons were mailed
   surveys; 421 responded. One hundred fourteen urban surgeons were
   contacted by telephone. Questions were designed to measure job and
   community satisfaction, factors influencing their decision to practice
   in their current location, spectrum and volume of cases, and their
   perceived educational needs.
   RESULTS: Age distribution did not differ markedly between urban and
   rural surgeons. Motivation to practice in their current location varied
   considerably between urban and rural surgeons. Both groups equally rated
   quality of life as the leading factor influencing their current practice
   location. Urban surgeons rated other factors, such as income, practice
   growth, hospital facilities, and proximity to family, higher than rural
   surgeons. Practice patterns and educational needs also varied between
   the two groups. Rural surgeons performed more procedures per year with
   more variety in procedure type. Both groups felt that additional
   training in advanced laparoscopic techniques would be helpful, and rural
   surgeons felt that additional training in the surgical subspecialty
   areas was important.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although rural and urban surgeons do not differ in age or
   the importance of lifestyle in deciding career location, different
   factors do impact their choice of location. Practice pattern and
   educational needs varied markedly between rural and urban general
   surgeons.}},

Abstract = {{A phenomenological model for pulsating combustion by predicting

   methane-air mixtures have be en modeled across a range of practical,
   fuel-lean operating conditions, and predictions of primary pollutants
   from both models have been compared with available data. The use of a
   more realistic oscillatory Nusselt number is necessary to provide
   agreement with the experimental finding of relative insensitivity of
   primary pollutant emissions to input power. Oscillatory characteristics
   of combustion species are generated and are consistent with published
   data. Optimum operating conditions of the combustor are predicted to be
   around an equivalence ratio of 0.74, where NOx and CO emissions of only
   a few parts per million occur. NOx and CO predictions using the reduced
   mechanism provide better agreement with experimental data than those
   using GRI-Mech2.11. This probably results from the construction of the
   reduced model from the detailed mechanisms in GRI Mech3.}},

Abstract = {{Within this review, we describe a home-built pulsed electron
   paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer operating at 180 GHz as well
   as the incorporation of two double resonance techniques, electron
   nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and pulsed electron double resonance
   (PELDOR), along with first applications. Hahn-echo decays on a
   TEMPO/polystyrene sample are presented, demonstrating that the
   observation of anisotropic librational motions is possible in a very
   precise manner at high magnetic fields. Bisdiphenylenephenyl-allyl is
   used as a model system to illustrate the performance of the setup for
   H-1-ENDOR using the Mims as well as the Davies sequence. Furthermore,
   first H-1-Mims and Davies ENDOR spectra on a biological sample, the
   wild-type Ras(.)Mn(2+.)GDP protein, are reported. The capability of the
   180-GHz PELDOR setup is demonstrated using the three-pulse ELDOR
   sequence on the protein ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) subunit R2 from
   Escherichia coli, which contains two tyrosyl radicals at a 33 A
   distance. At 180 GHz, orientation selectivity is observed and the
   modulation frequency is found to be in good agreement with theoretical
   predictions. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The partial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde (FA) was studied over
   highly dispersed vanadia supported on mesoporous silica SBA-15
   (VOx/SBA-15). VOx/SBA-15 catalysts were prepared by a novel
   grafting/ion-exchange method and characterized using UV-VIS- and Raman
   spectroscopy. The resulting surface vanadium oxide species (0-2.3
   V/nm(2)), grafted on the inner pores of the SBA-15 silica matrix,
   consist of tetrahedrally coordinated monomeric and polymeric vanadia.
   The VOx/SBA-15 catalysts are active and highly selective for the
   production of FA between 300 and 400 degrees C. Comparison of the
   reactivity results with literature data reveals that a better catalytic
   performance can be obtained over vanadia supported on mesoporous silica
   in comparison with conventional silica samples with the same vanadium
   loading. Raman characterization of the catalyst after reaction at high
   conversion indicates that dispersed vanadia partly agglomerates into
   vanadia crystallites during methanol oxidation.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose.Mammography (MG), breast (BU) and axillary ultrasound (AU), and
   clinical examination (CE) are commonly used for clinical staging. These
   different methods were compared in order to assess the accuracy of
   clinical tumor staging (cT).
   Method.About 503 breast cancer (BC) patients were prospectively measured
   by MG, ultrasound and clinical examination. Pearson's correlation to
   pathological tumor size (pT) was tested and the deviation of MG, BU and
   CE to pT was analyzed in subgroups defined by pT, grading (G), estrogen
   receptor (ER), progesteron receptor (PR), proliferation (MIB-1) and
   HER2/neu. Association of AU to pN was examined by chi(2)-test. Receiver
   operating characteristics (ROC) were used to test the prediction of a pT
   > 2 cm.
   Results.Mammography correlated best with pT (r = 0.752). Mammography
   (mean (MG) = 2.17 cm) overestimated tumors in size (mean (pT) = 2.04 cm)
   rather than ultrasound (mean (BU) = 1.86 cm) and clinical examination
   (mean (cT) = 1.70 cm). pT of invasive ductal BC could be estimated
   significantly better than pT of invasive lobular BC. Smaller tumors were
   better to assess than larger ones. Tumors with a grading G1 were easier
   to estimate than tumors with G2/3. Best predictor of a pT > 2 cm was the
   mammography with an area under the curve of 0.876. The combination of
   all three modalities by linear regression performed even better with an
   AUC of 0.906.
   Conclusions.The dimension of invasive ductal carcinomas, small and low
   grading tumors is significantly better to estimate. Concerning treatment
   decisions, we propose a combination of all three modalities, as the best
   predictive value was seen for the complementary use of mammography,
   ultrasound and clinical examination.}},

Abstract = {{Women who are single parents, poor, and employed in low-paying jobs have
   little choice about being dependent on public assistance programs to
   meet basic personal and family needs. Objective: To explore women's
   perceptions of their health and well-being while enrolled in a
   work-based welfare program. This is the second in a series of articles
   about Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Design and Sample:
   Qualitative interviews and quantitative survey methods were used to
   explore perceptions of health and well-being in a purposive sample of
   mothers (n = 34) enrolled in a work-based welfare program in a city in
   the U.S. Midwest. Methods: Instruments used were a semistructured
   interview guide, a demographic data form, and the General Well-Being
   Schedule (i.e., a survey tool developed for the U.S. Health and
   Nutrition Examination Survey). Data collection was completed in June
   2000. The data were triangulated; using both quantitative and
   qualitative data added to the in-depth understanding of the subjects.
   Results: Distress levels reported by participants were significantly
   higher than in the general U.S. population. Conclusions: Results of this
   study suggest that current policies do not effectively support health
   and well-being of single mothers enrolled in work-based welfare
   programs.}},

Abstract = {{The worldwide need for fresh sources of drinking water continues to
   outstrip supply while the resources necessary to develop new supply
   remain limited. The best solution to this dilemma is the coordination of
   research efforts on an international basis. The Desalination and Water
   Purification Roadmap presents a summary of the water supply challenges
   facing the United States, and suggests areas of research and development
   that may lead to technological solutions to these challenges. These
   solutions have international application at the same time that
   innovation is occurring internationally.
   This Roadmap is a living document-updates to the Roadmap may be made on
   a regular basis to ensure that it remains current and relevant. The
   Roadmap is also complemented by a series of additional documents,
   created as a result of meetings to be held, focused on:
   Defining discrete research projects and priorities based on the
   information contained within this Roadmap;
   Identifying regulatory issues related to the implementation of
   desalination and water purification technologies, and developing
   potential solutions where conflicts are found;
   Identifying, evaluating, and quantifying the impaired water resources to
   better assess the impact that desalination and water purification
   technologies may have on water supplies;
   Generating plans to accelerate the commercialization of desalination and
   water purification technologies developed as a result of this Roadmap.
   This Roadmap cannot exist in a vacuum-technology development must be
   undertaken with the context of the product's end-use in mind. The goal
   of this process is to:
   Develop a consensus and direction to guide investments for the creation
   of new water purification technologies;
   Identify the roles that various sectors of the economy (e.g., national
   government agencies, the private sector, educational and non-profit
   organizations) can play in the creation of new water purification
   technologies; and
   Develop an expert group to review alternative water purification
   technologies.
   Toward these ends, we are now joined by a number of national and
   international organizations, each of which is contributing its own
   resources to a common end. This end includes assistance in developing
   novel water treatment technologies as well as improving and sharpening
   the roadmap itself.}},

Abstract = {{Although interferon (IFN) shows cardiotoxicity and arrhythmogenesis, the
   influence of IFN oil signal-averaged electrocardiography remains to be
   clarified. The aim of this Study was to test a clinical hypothesis that
   IFN therapy for hepatitis C Virus may induce ventricular late potentials
   (LPs) and related arrhythmias in patients with chronic active hepatitis.
   Signal-averaged and ambulatory electrocardiograms were recorded
   sequentially in patients with chronic active hepatitis C (n = 22)
   throughout the entire period of IFN therapy. The filtered QRS duration
   (fQRS) and low amplitude (< 40 mu V) signal duration (LAS40) were
   significantly increased (95.5 +/- 8.5 to 99.6 +/- 9.4 msec, P < 0.0001,
   and 32.8 +/- + 3.1 to 36.3 +/- 3.0 msec, P < 0.0001, respectively),
   whereas the root mean square voltage in the terminal 40 msec of the QRS
   (RMS40) was significantly decreased (25.5 +/- 5.4 to 22.3 +/- 5.2 mu V,
   P < 0.005) 1 month after starting the IFN therapy. The ventricular LP
   was negative in all subjects before starting therapy. but became
   positive in 7 patients after the therapy commenced. There were no
   differences in clinical baseline characteristics between the LP-positive
   (n = 7) and LP-negative (n = 15) groups. Significant increases in mean
   heart rate, QRS, and LAS40 were observed after starting the therapy,
   irrespective of the appearance of the ventricular LP, whereas a decrease
   ill RMS40 was observed only in the LP-positive group. No sustained
   ventricular arrhythmias were documented in the ambulatory
   electrocardiography and no cardiac events were encountered in the
   follow-up period. Therefore, the results indicate a reversible and
   subclinical risk of IFN-induced arrhythmogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Data on genotypic and phenotypic resistance testing of HIV-1 in the
   routine clinical setting are lacking. In a retrospective single-center
   study, all patients (n=102) for whom genotypic resistance typing (GRT)
   and phenotypic resistance typing (PRT) were performed during the
   calendar year 2002 were examined. GRT and PRT results were concordant
   for 79\% of the drugs, being highest for nevirapine (92\%) and lowest
   for didanosine (57\%). Concordance of results for protease inhibitors
   was lowest for lopinavir (78\%) and highest for indinavir (88\%).
   Discordant results for lamivudine were observed in 16\% of patients;
   90\% of these results corresponded to high-level resistance by PRT and
   susceptibility by GRT. Overall, HIV loads were lower and CD4+ cell
   counts higher after therapy following resistance testing, but a
   significant association with the number of active drugs as predicted by
   GRT or PRT could not be identified. In a subgroup of 43 patients with
   virological failure under antiretroviral therapy and sufficient
   follow-up data, HIV loads were significantly lower after 3 and 6 months.
   More patients with HIV loads < 400/ml had 2 or more active drugs
   according to PRT (21/29 {[}75\%]) than according to GRT ({[}15/29
   {[}52\%]; p=0.109. This was also found for HIV loads < 50/ml (PRT 16/22
   {[}72\%], GRT 10/22 {[}42\%]; p=0.103), although the differences were
   not statistically significant. There was no discernable difference
   between GRT and PRT in the clinic-based population, but the numbers of
   resistance tests performed are not sufficient to draw definitive
   conclusions.}},

Abstract = {{Targeting pathogenic T cells with Ag-specific tolerizing DNA vaccines
   encoding autoantigens is a powerful and feasible therapeutic strategy
   for Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases. However, plasmid DNA contains
   abundant unmethylated CpG motifs, which induce a strong Th1 immune
   response. We describe here a novel approach to counteract this undesired
   side effect of plasmid DNA used for vaccination in Th1-mediated
   autoimmune diseases. In chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune
   encephalomyelitis (EAE), combining a myelin cocktail plus
   IL-4-tolerizing DNA vaccine with a suppressive GpG oligodeoxynucleotide
   (GpG-ODN) induced a shift of the autoreactive T cell response toward a
   protective Th2 cytokine pattern. Myelin microarrays demonstrate that
   tolerizing DNA vaccination plus GpG-ODN further decreased anti-myelin
   autoantibody epitope spreading and shifted the autoreactive B cell
   response to a protective IgG1. isotype. Moreover, the addition of
   GpG-ODN to tolerizing DNA vaccination therapy effectively reduced
   overall mean disease severity in both the chronic relapsing EAE and
   chronic progressive EAE mouse models. In conclusion, suppressive GpG-ODN
   effectively counteracted the undesired CpG-induced inflammatory effect
   of a tolerizing DNA vaccine in a Th1-mediated autoimmune disease by
   skewing both the autoaggressive T cell and B cell responses toward a
   protective Th2 phenotype. These results demonstrate that suppressive
   GpG-ODN is a simple and highly effective novel therapeutic adjuvant that
   will boost the efficacy of Ag-specific tolerizing DNA vaccines used for
   treating Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases.}},

   were measured before and after category 11 blocking procedures used to
   change pelvic mechanics. Pre- and post-measurements were taken by a
   blinded assessor using a Zebris ultrasonic motion detector.
   Results: Changes were found in the lumbar spine only. Increased ranges
   of lumbar motion occurred in all planes except extension (21\%-57\%).
   Conclusion: Supine pelvic blocking as used in SOT affected lumbar ranges
   of motion in these 5 cases. This may indicate that functional change in
   the pelvis results in changes in lumbar motion, especially lumbar
   flexion. Larger data sets are needed for further study.}},

Abstract = {{Reasons for performing study: Injuries of the equine stifle are frequent
   causes of hindlimb lameness. Ultrasonography is useful for the diagnosis
   of many soft tissue lesions but, until recently, its application to the
   equine stifle has been limited to a description of normal and abnormal
   structures. A comparative study using gross anatomical sections to
   identify all structures visible on ultrasonographic images of the equine
   stifle has not previously been reported.
   Objectives: To provide a comprehensive comparative cross-sectional atlas
   of the normal equine medial femorotibial (MFT) joint and its related
   structures using ultrasonography.
   Methods: The stifle joints of 15 cadaver limbs were examined
   ultrasonographically using a systematic approach. Ten different scanning
   planes were defined. The lateral and medial femorotibial and the
   femoropatellar joints were injected with pigments of different colours.
   Each leg was frozen (10 in extension and 5 in flexion) and cut into
   slices corresponding to the different scanning planes. According to the
   different ultrasonographic reference images, 10 representative
   anatomical images were selected and digitised.
   Results: All bony and soft tissue structures were identified on the
   anatomical sections and subsequently located on the corresponding
   ultrasonographic images, except the caudal meniscotibial ligaments.
   Visualisation of the cruciate ligaments was a challenge due to their
   position and oblique orientation.
   Conclusions: Ultrasonography is a very useful technique for imaging both
   soft tissue and bony structures of the MFT joint and its related
   structures, although a protocol is required to perform a systematic and
   standardised ultrasonographic examination. Good anatomical knowledge is
   mandatory for identification of the different structures.
   Potential relevance: This study should contribute to 1) knowledge of the
   ultrasonographic anatomy of the equine MFT joint and its related
   structures, 2) use of a protocol for a standardised ultrasonographic
   examination and 3) the ability to recognise abnormal structures.}},

Title = {{Increased incidence of melanoma in renal transplantation recipients}},
Journal = {{CANCER}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{104}},

Pages = {{1962-1967}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND. It is well established that the incidence of nonmelanoma
   skin carcinoma is increased in renal transplantation recipients.
   However, existing studies are not in agreement over whether patients who
   undergo transplantation have an increased risk of melanoma. The
   objective of this study was to estimate the risk of melanoma among
   immunosuppressed renal transplantation recipients and to determine
   whether that risk is associated with patient and transplantation
   characteristics.
   METHODS. The authors studied 89,786 patients who under-went renal
   transplantation between 1988 and 1998 using the United States Renal Data
   System. Age standardized (to the United States 2000 population)
   incidence rates for melanoma were computed as diagnoses per 100,000
   population and were compared with rates from the Surveillance,
   Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data. Incidence rates also were
   stratified to examine differences by age and gender.
   RESULTS. Of the 89,786 patients who underwent transplantation, 246
   patients developed melanoma. The age-adjusted incidence rate of melanoma
   among renal transplantation recipients was 55.9 diagnoses per 100,000
   population. This represented an increase in age-adjusted, standardized
   risk that was 3.6 times greater than the SEER population. Stratified
   analysis suggested that the risk of melanoma accelerated in male
   transplantation recipients as age increased, but the risk leveled off
   with age among female transplantation recipients. Finally, there was a
   trend for patients who experienced at least 1 acute rejection episode to
   develop melanoma (odds ratio = 1.34; P = 0.059).
   CONCLUSIONS. Renal transplantation recipients were nearly 3.6 times more
   likely to develop melanoma than the general population. Physicians who
   care for renal transplantation recipients should be vigilant in
   screening for melanoma. Copyright 2005 American Cancer Society.}},

Abstract = {{Distance-based methods are popular for reconstructing evolutionary trees
   of protein sequences, mainly because of their speed and generality. A
   number of variants of the classical neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm have
   been proposed, as well as a number of methods to estimate protein
   distances. We here present a large-scale assessment of performance in
   reconstructing the correct tree topology for the most popular
   algorithms. The programs BIONJ, FastME, Weighbor, and standard NJ were
   run using 12 distance estimators, producing 48 tree-building/distance
   estimation method combinations. These were evaluated on a test set based
   on real trees taken from 100 Pfam families. Each tree was used to
   generate multiple sequence alignments with the ROSE program using three
   evolutionary models. The accuracy of each method was analyzed as a
   function of both sequence divergence and location in the tree. We found
   that BIONJ produced the overall best results, although the average
   accuracy differed little between the tree-building methods (normally
   less than 1\%). A noticeable trend was that FastME performed poorer than
   the rest on long branches. Weighbor was several orders of magnitude
   slower than the other programs. Larger differences were observed when
   using different distance estimators. Protein-adapted Jukes-Cantor and
   Kimura distance correction produced clearly poorer results than the
   other methods, even worse than uncorrected distances. We also assessed
   the recently developed Scoredist measure, which performed equally well
   as more complex methods.}},

   measures in the patients. Monocular mfVEPs were recorded to a pattern
   reversing display that modulated only the L- or M-cones. Also, standard
   automated achromatic visual fields and mfERGs were obtained. For the
   control subjects, the ratio of L-cone to M-cone mfVEP amplitudes
   increased as a function of retinal eccentricity. For the patients, the
   ratio did not vary with eccentricity. For all measures, responses were
   least affected for the first ring (central 2.4 degrees) and most
   affected for the third ring (11.6 degrees-44.4 degrees). For the first
   ring, mfERG amplitudes were more impaired than were the mfVEPs or the
   visual field thresholds. For most of the patients, there was local
   response correspondence among our measures of visual function. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to resolve anatomic
   ambiguities of the ponticulus so the surgeon will be better able to
   remove disease from the posterior tympanum.
   Background: The first step in refining an operative approach is to
   acquire a thorough understanding of the anatomy. A detailed study of one
   structure of the posterior tympanum, the ponticulus, has not yet been
   reported. Methods: Fifty temporal bone plugs harvested from human
   cadavers were studied. The presence or absence of the ponticulus, its
   configuration, and its proximity to other middle ear structures were
   recorded for each temporal bone.
   Results: There was complete formation of the ponticulus in 33 of the 50
   specimens. In 7, only a remnant of the ponticulus formed, and it was
   completely absent in 10 of the 50 specimens. In the 33 specimens in
   which the ponticulus was present, it measured less than I mm in
   thickness in 22, it was larger than 1 mm in 7, and in 4 specimens it
   extended down to the floor of the middle ear as a sheet of bone. In 8
   specimens, the ponticulus lay just adjacent to the stapes.
   Conclusion: The ponticulus is present in the majority of ears. It is
   best defined as a bridge of bone from the pyramidal eminence to the
   promontory and most commonly occurs as a thin, bony structure. This
   definitive study of the ponticulus will allow the otologic surgeon to
   better remove disease from the posterior tympanum.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) and atherosclerosis may be
   associated and may share common risk factors. We conducted a
   retrospective case-control study to investigate the association between
   WE and coronary atherosclerotic disease (CAD) by means of measuring
   coronary artery calcification and evaluating clinical risk factors.
   Methods: From 385 consecutive patients suspected of VTE, we randomly
   selected 89 cases with idiopathic VTE and 89 controls without VTE,
   frequency matched on gender and age. Risk factors for atherosclerosis
   were noted for both groups. Coronary artery calcification was quantified
   on pulmonary computed tomography (CT) angiographic images. The coronary
   artery calcification and risk factors were compared between the case and
   control groups. The associations between WE and the presence of coronary
   artery calcium and risk factors were assessed with logistic regression
   analysis.
   Results: A higher prevalence of coronary artery calcium was found in the
   case group (51.7\%) than in the control group (28.1\%) (P=0.001). The
   presence of coronary artery calcium was significantly associated with
   VTE with an odds ratio of 4.3 (95\% confidence interval, 1.9-10.1) in a
   multivariable model. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension were also
   significantly associated with VTE.
   Conclusion: A significant association between WE and CAD suggests that
   CAD is an independent risk factor for VTE. Diabetes and hypertension are
   also independent risk factors for VTE. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Abstract = {{Bead stiffened panels are extensively used in aircraft and other
   structural components to satisfy requirements of increased stiffness and
   weight reduction. Forming the vertical beads integrally in a composite
   panel as one piece makes it stiffer against compression buckling. Finite
   elements buckling analyses are performed for various panels with
   different beads spacing, beads depths, beads radiuses and panels
   lengths. The analysis of results has shown that the beads spacing is of
   chief significance as far as the panel buckling load is concerned. For a
   given panel, with a certain number of beads, there is an optimum value
   of beads spacing, which makes the panel stiffer than the other possible
   beads arrangement against buckling. A simple equation is proposed to
   estimate the optimum beads spacing for a given beaded panel.
   In order to, avoid several time consuming and costly finite elements
   buckling analyses, an approximate method is also proposed to obtain the
   upper and lower bound buckling load for the beaded panels. This fairly
   simple method benefits from the closed-form solution of a rectangular
   orthotropic plain plate. If the appropriate length and width are adopted
   for the orthotropic plain plate, the closed-form buckling solution of
   the same plate which is assumed to be either simply supported or clamped
   at the two sides can be used, respectively, to represent the lower or
   the upper limits to the critical buckling load of the corresponding
   composite beaded panel. This method can be used to estimate the buckling
   load of beaded panels in preliminary design stage of structures. (c)

Title = {{Type II collagen synthesis in the articular cartilage of a rabbit model

Abstract = {{Background The aim of this study was to observe time course changes in
   type II collagen synthesis in various regions of articular cartilage
   affected with osteoarthritis (OA) by examining the expression of type II
   collagen C-propeptide (pCOL II-C) and mRNA in a rabbit OA model.
   Methods. Osteoarthritis was experimentally induced by partial lateral
   meniscectomy in the knees of Japanese white rabbits. The cartilage of
   the animals was then examined histologically over time. The degenerative
   area of articular cartilage was divided into three areas, according to
   the degree of degeneration. The ability to synthesize type II collagen
   was estimated by the immunohistological staining of pCOL II-C and the in
   situ hybridization of mRNA in type II collagen.
   Results. The positive rate of pCOL II-C immunostaining in chondrocytes
   was highest in the central-degenerative region 1 week after surgery, and
   the highest rate in the para-degenerative region was observed 2 and 4
   weeks after surgery. The percentage of pCOL II-C positive cells
   increased as the histological degeneration score increased to moderate
   degeneration and then decreased with further progression of the severity
   of cartilage degeneration. Examination by in situ hybridization revealed
   that the regions marked by strong pCOL II-C mRNA expression were similar
   to those indicated by the immunohistology results.
   Conclusions. These results suggest that the type II
   collagen-synthesizing potential of chondrocytes is highest in moderately
   degenerated areas of OA articular cartilage. Cartilage repair continues
   to be seen even as OA advances, although the reaction varies depending
   on the stage of OA.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the auditory perception of source properties of
   a rolling object. Previous auditory perception experiments have shown
   that listeners are generally able to discriminate differences in the
   size and the speed of rolling wooden balls. In the Current study, we
   investigated whether listeners base their judgments oil spectral or on
   temporal information. Recorded sounds of rolling balls were manipulated
   by merging the temporal characteristics of one sound with the spectral
   characteristics of another. In this way 16 stimuli were obtained from
   four original recordings, which were presented pairwise. If listeners
   were asked to indicate the larger ball from two sounds, they had a
   preference for the Sound with the spectral content of a large ball. If
   listeners had to indicate the faster ball from two Sounds, they
   preferred the sound with the spectral content of a small ball, and, to a
   lesser degree, with the spectral content of a fast rolling ball. The
   temporal information in the sounds was of minor importance for the range
   Of stimuli used in these experiments.}},

Abstract = {{In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for
   multiple sclerosis, immunization with myelin Ags leads to demyelination
   and paralysis. To investigate which molecules are crucial for the
   pathogenesis of EAE, we specifically assessed the roles of the death
   receptors Fas and TNF-R1. Mice lacking Fas expression in
   oligodendrocytes (ODCs) were generated and crossed to TNF-R1-deficient
   mice. To achieve specific deletion of a loxP-flanked fas allele in ODCs,
   we generated a new insertion transgene, expressing the Cre recombinase
   specifically in ODCs. Fas inactivation alone as well as the complete
   absence of TNF-R1 protected mice partially from EAE induced by the
   immunization with myelin ODC glycoprotein. The double-deficient mice,
   however, showed almost no clinical signs of EAE after immunization.
   Histological analysis revealed that demyelination was suppressed in CNS
   tissue and that lymphocyte infiltration was notably reduced. We conclude
   that the death receptors Fas and TNF-R1 are major initiators of ODC
   apoptosis in EAE. Although only moderate reduction of lymphocyte
   infiltration into CNS tissue was observed, the absence of these
   receptors appears to confer protection from demyelination and
   development of clinical disease.}},

   horizontal electric field as low as 100 V/cm. Mechanisms are proposed to
   explain such an observation, and it is suggested that the vertical Al/Si
   interdifussion process is prolonged under horizontal electric fields
   because of the presence of electron-collision caused by Al or AlSix
   ions, which allows more nucleation to take place.}},

Abstract = {{Hexavalent chromium existing in the effluent is a major concern for the
   metal-processing plant. In this study, a new method combining
   nanoparticle adsorption and magnetic separation was developed for the
   removal and recovery of Cr(VI) from wastewater. The nanoscale maghemite
   was synthesized, characterized, and evaluated as adsorbents of Cr(VI).
   Various factors influencing the adsorption of Cr(VI), e.g., pH,
   temperature, initial concentration, and coexisting common ions were
   studied. Adsorption reached equilibrium within 15 min and was
   independent of initial Cr concentration. The maximum adsorption occurred
   at pH 2.5. The adsorption data were analyzed and fitted well by
   Freundlich isotherm. Cr(VI) adsorption capacity of maghemite
   nanoparticles was compared favorably with other adsorbents like
   activated carbon and clay. Competition from common coexisting ions such
   as Na+, Ca2+, mg(2+), Cu2+, Ni2+, NO3-, and Cl- was ignorable, which
   illustrated the selective adsorption of Cr(VI) from wastewater.
   Regeneration studies verified that the maghemite nanoparticles, which
   underwent six successive adsorption-desorption processes, still retained
   the original metal removal capacity. In addition, the adsorption
   mechanisms were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman spectroscopic techniques.

   to a generalized inverse force vibration problem to simultaneously
   estimate the unknown time-dependent external forces in a

Abstract = {{In this study we sought to determine whether a calcium sensitizer,
   levosimendan, would have a more favorable effect on postresuscitation
   myocardial function and, consequently, postresuscitation survival than
   beta-adrenergic dobutamine. The extreme decrease in survival before
   hospital discharge of resuscitated victims is attributed, in part, to
   postresuscitation myocardial failure, and dobutamine has been
   recommended for the management of postresuscitation myocardial failure.
   We studied a total of 15 animals. Ventricular fibrillation was induced
   in Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 450 to 550 g. Cardiopulmonary
   resuscitation (CPR), including chest compressions and mechanical
   ventilation, was begun after 8 minutes of untreated cardiac arrest.
   Electrical defibrillation was attempted after 6 minutes of CPR. Each
   animal was resuscitated. Animals were randomized to undergo treatment
   with levosimendan, dobutamine, or saline-solution placebo. These agents
   were administered 10 minutes after the return of spontaneous
   circulation. Levosimendan was administered in a loading dose of 12 mu g
   kg(-1) over a 10-minute period, followed by infusion of 0.3 mu g kg(-1)
   min(-1) over the next 230 minutes. Dobutamine was continuously infused
   of a dosage of 3 mu g kg(-1) min(-1). Saline-solution placebo was
   administered in the same volume and over the same amount of time as
   levosimendan. Levosimendan and dobutamine produced comparable increases
   in cardiac output and rate of left-ventricular pressure increase.
   However, administration of levosimendan resulted in lower heart rates
   and lesser increases in left ventricular diastolic pressure compared
   with both dobutamine and placebo. The duration of postresuscitation
   survival was significantly greater with levosimendan (16 +/- 2 hours),
   intermediate with dobutamine (11 +/- 2 hours) and least with
   saline-solution placebo (8 +/- 1 hour). Levosimendan and dobutamine both
   improved postresuscitation myocardial function. However, levosimendan
   produced more favorable postresuscifation myocardial function and
   increased the duration of postresuscitation survival.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major challenges in the design of future-generation
   high-speed networks is the provision of quality-of-service (QoS) to

   handle real-time traffic in passive star-coupled wavelength division
   multiplexing (WDM) optical networks. By taking channel and destination
   availability into account, DDS can dramatically improve network
   performance in terms of message loss rate. Moreover, this scheme has the
   capacity of preventing channel collision and destination conflict. In
   order to evaluate the proposed DDS algorithm, extensive discrete-event
   simulations and mathematical performance comparison are conducted by
   comparing its performance with Moore and Hodgson's algorithm and the
   earliest-due-date (EDD) algorithm. The results show that DDS can achieve
   the best performance among the three algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is an important coenzyme involved in
   the production of ATP, the fuel of energy, in every cell. It alternates
   between the oxidized form NAD(+) and the reduced form
   dihydronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and serves as a hydrogen
   and electron carrier in the cellular respiratory processes. In the
   present work, the catalytic effect of gold nanoparticles on the
   oxidization of NADH to NAD(+) was investigated. The addition of gold
   nanoparticles was found to quench the NADH fluorescence intensities but
   had no effect on the fluorescence lifetime. This suggested that the
   fluorescence quenching was not due to coupling with the excited state,
   but due to changing the ground state of NADH. The intensity of the 340
   nm absorption band of NADH was found to decrease while that of the 260
   nm band of NAD+ was found to increase as the concentration of gold
   nanoparticles increased. This conversion reaction was further supported
   by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy. The effect of the
   addition of NADH was found to slightly red shift and increase the
   intensity of the surface plasmon absorption band of gold nanoparticles
   at 520 nm. This gives a strong support that the conversion of NADH to
   NAD(+) is occurring on the surface of the gold nanoparticles, i.e. NADH
   is surface catalyzed by the gold nanoparticles. The catalytic property
   of this important reaction might have important future applications in
   biological and medical fields. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   (livers (1.50 fish/ h) was much more effective than passive capture with
   gill nets (0.07 fish/h) and setlines (0.06 fish/h). Eggs of Chinook
   salmon Oncorhyrichus tshawytscha were more effective as setline bait
   than were alewives Alosa pseudoharengus, but neither bait differed in
   effectiveness from rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax. Ages of captured lake
   sturgeon ranged from 1 to 23 years 47 of the 61 aged fish were younger
   than age 10. Strong relationships were found between weight, W, and
   length, L (W = .0000005 center dot L-3.5564; R-2 = 0.977) and between L

   lake sturgeon Population in the lower Niagara River is probably small

Abstract = {{The skin of diabetic subjects presents abnormalities in capillary blood
   flow and its regulation, often leading to the generation of plantar
   ulcers. In order to gain insight into this pathology for type 1 diabetic
   patients, Lyapunov exponents (LEs) of signals reflecting microvascular
   perfusion-laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) signals-are calculated. The
   algorithm to compute LEs is first validated on simulated data and LDF
   surrogates. Then, LDF signals recorded at rest and during the
   application of local and progressive pressure of 11.1 Pa/s are
   processed. The exponents appear in pairs and are different for healthy
   and type 1 diabetic subjects at rest; P = 0.0556 for the 7th, 8th, and
   9th LEs. Furthermore, progressive pressure has also a distinct effect on
   LEs. The difference is more pronounced for diabetic patients, for whom P
   = 0.0625 for the four LEs of highest absolute value. Because these
   differences arise from abnormalities in microvascular blood flow, they
   may help to explain the high prevalence of type 1 diabetic patients
   developing foot ulcers.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2005}},

Number = {{20}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We present the electronic band structures and dielectric tensors for a
   series of crystalline linear oligoacenes-i.e., naphthalene, anthracene,
   tetracene, and pentacene-calculated within the density functional
   framework. The band dispersions, the effective charge carrier masses,
   and the optical response are discussed as a function of the oligomer
   length compared to previously reported calculations. The total band
   dispersions of the two topmost valence and lowest conduction bands are
   between 0.14 and 0.52 eV, which, however, are strongly anisotropic.
   Regarding the charge transport properties, the band dispersions are
   large enough for bandlike transport only along crystalline directions
   within the herringbone plane. Except for naphthalene, the conduction
   bands are more dispersive than the valence bands. This indicates that
   the electron transport is favored compared to hole migration. The
   revised stable pentacene single-crystal structure exhibits the largest
   conduction-band dispersions among the series. Consequently the effective

Abstract = {{In this article, Victoria Hunter explores the concept of the `here and
   now' in the creation of site-specific dance performance, in response to
   Doreen Massey's questioning of the fixity of the concept of the `here
   and now' during the recent RESCEN seminar on `Making Space', in which
   she challenged the concept of a singular fixed `present', suggesting
   instead that we exist in a constant production of `here and nows' akin
   to `being in the moment'. Here the concept is applied to an analysis of
   the author's recent performance work created as part of a PhD
   investigation into the relationship between the site and the creative
   process in site-specific dance performance. In this context the notion
   of the `here and now' is discussed in relation to the concept of dance
   embodiment informed by the site and the genius loci, or `spirit of
   place'. Victoria Hunter is a Lecturer in Dance at the University of
   Leeds, who is currently researching a PhD in site-specific dance
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{The prime motivation for developing the proposed model of AlGaN/GaN
   microwave power device is to demonstrate its inherent ability to operate
   at much higher temperature. An investigation of temperature model of a 1
   mu m gate AlGaN/GaN enhancement mode n-type modulation-doped field
   effect transistor (MODFET) is presented. An analytical temperature model
   based on modified charge control equations is developed. The proposed
   model handles higher voltages and show stable operation at higher
   temperatures. The investigated temperature range is from 100 K-0-600
   K-0. The critical parameters of the proposed device are the maximum
   drain current (I-Dmax), the threshold voltage (V-th), the peak dc
   transconductance (g(m)), and unity current gain cut-off frequency
   (f(T)). The calculated values of f(T) (10-70 GHz) at elevated
   temperature suggest that the operation of the proposed device has
   sufficiently high current handling capacity. The temperature effect on
   saturation current, cutoff frequency, and trans-conductance behavior
   predict the device behavior at elevated temperatures. The analysis and
   simulation results on the transport characteristics of the MODFET
   structure is compared with the previously measured experimental data at
   room temperature. The calculated critical parameters suggest that the
   proposed device could survive in extreme environments.}},

Abstract = {{Pemetrexed has recently been approved for use in combination with
   cisplatin as first-line chemotherapy for malignant pleural mesothelioma

   orifices and no data are available about the interactions between
   radiotherapy and pemetrexed. We report the first case of radiation
   recall dermatitis occurring after pemetrexed chemotherapy in a patient
   with MPM previously treated with radiation therapy to the thoracoscopy
   and drainage orificies. The patient received chemotherapy with
   pemetrexed and cisplatin 19 days after completion of chest wall
   radiation therapy delivering 21 gray in 3 days. Conventional
   premedication by folic acid and intramuscular administration of Vitamin
   B-12 and prednisolone was correctly performed. Twelve days later,
   confluent erythematous and pruritus rash of the irradiated skin was
   observed. The toxicity grade of this lesion was evaluated at 2 according
   to the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria proposed by the
   Radiation Therapy Oncology Group. Pemetrexed challenge was performed
   without worsening of skin lesions. Three weeks later, skin cicatrisation
   was observed after a desquamative phase. Persistant hyperpigmentation
   was seen in the irradiated skin. Pemetrexed could also act as a
   radiosensitizing agent that should be used with care for several weeks
   after radiotherapy. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The two major constituents of coronavirus virions are the membrane (M)
   and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The M protein is anchored in the viral
   envelope by three transmembrane segments flanked by a short
   amino-terminal ectodomain and a large carboxy-terminal endodomain. The M
   endodomain interacts with the viral nucleocapsid, which consists of the
   positive-strand RNA genome helically encapsidated by N protein monomers.
   In previous work with the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a
   highly defective M protein mutant, M Delta 2, was constructed. This
   mutant contained a 2-amino-acid carboxy-terminal truncation of the M
   protein. Analysis of second-site revertants of M Delta 2 revealed
   mutations in the carboxy-terminal region of the N protein that
   compensated for the defect in the M protein. To seek further genetic
   evidence corroborating this interaction, we generated a comprehensive
   set of clustered charged-to-alanine mutants in the carboxy-terminal
   domain 3 of N protein. One of these mutants, CCA4, had a highly
   defective phenotype similar to that of M Delta 2. Transfer of the CCA4
   mutation into a partially diploid MHV genome showed that CCA4 was a
   loss-of-function mutation rather than a dominant-negative mutation.
   Analysis of multiple second-site revertants of CCA4 revealed mutations
   in both the M protein and the N protein that could compensate for the
   original lesion in N. These data more precisely define the region of the
   N protein that interacts with the M protein. Further, we found that
   fusion of domain 3 of the N protein to the carboxy terminus of a
   heterologous protein caused it to be incorporated into MHV virions.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Acute humoral rejection (AHR) is characterized by acute
   graft dysfunction associated with de novo production of donor-specific
   alloantibodies (DSA) and C4d deposition in peritubular capillaries of
   the renal allograft. It has been reported the combination of
   plasmapheresis (PP) and intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG)as effective
   rescue therapy for established AHR.
   Methods. Between 1999 and 2004, seven kidney allografts recipients
   suffered from AHR diagnosed by severe rejection and C4d staining in
   peritubular capillaries. All patients had a negative cross-match before
   renal transplantation.
   Results. All patients were treated with daily sessions of PP and in four
   cases IVIG was added after the last PP session. Tacrolimus and
   mycophenolate mofetil were employed as maintenance immunosuppressive
   regimen. In one case, rituximab was added to PP and IVIG owing to
   refractory humoral rejection. At 1 year, patient survival was 100\%,
   allograft survival was 70\%, and the mean serum creatinine was 201 mu
   mol/L.
   Conclusions. AHR is a severe form of rejection associated with a poor
   prognosis, but its early diagnosis and treatment with PP and IVIG allows
   reversal of AHR reaching a 70\% graft survival at 1 year.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology for the identification of a

   the unsteady perturbation potential flow about steady-state reference
   wing configurations. The resulting transfer functions between structural
   Lagrangean variables and generalized aerodynamic forces are approximated
   by means of rational expressions, and the aeroelastic ROM is identified
   by Coupling them with the structural operator. With the aeroelastic
   operator recast in a reduced-order form, transonic flutter boundaries
   lire detected through a classical eigenvalue analysis and the
   time-domain state-space aeroelastic model is also obtained. Applications
   of the methodology presented to a widely known aeroelastic test case

Abstract = {{Influences of photoperiod on plasma melatonin profiles and effects of
   melatonin administration on long-day-induced smoltification in masu
   salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) were investigated in order to reveal the
   roles of melatonin in the regulation of smoltification in salmonids.
   Under light-dark (LD) cycles, plasma melatonin levels exhibited daily
   variation, with higher values during the dark phase than during the
   light phase. The duration of nocturnal elevation under short photoperiod
   (LID 8:16) was longer than that under long photoperiod (LD 16:8).
   Melatonin feeding (0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/kg body weight) elevated plasma
   levels of melatonin in a dose-dependent manner for at least 7 h but not
   for 24 h. When masu salmon reared under short photoperiod were exposed
   to long photoperiod (LID 16:8) and fed melatonin (1 mg/kg body weight) 7
   hours before the onset of darkness, a significantly smaller proportion
   of smolts appeared in the melatonin-fed group after 32 days than in the
   control group. However, after 59 days of the treatment, there was no
   difference in the proportion of smolts between the control and
   melatonin-treated groups. Thus, melatonin feeding mimicked the effects
   of short photoperiod, which delays but does not completely suppress
   smoltification. These results indicate that the day length is transduced
   into changes in the duration of nocturnal elevation in plasma melatonin
   levels, and that artificial modification of the plasma melatonin pattern
   possibly delays the physiological processes of smoltification induced by
   long-day photoperiodic treatment.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{Background and aim of the study: Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), a
   neurohormone, is secreted predominantly from the ventricular myocardium.
   Studies investigating BNP secretion in diseases affecting the right side
   of the heart are scarce. The relationship between N-terminal proBNP
   (NT-proBNP) and echocardiographic and clinical findings was studied in
   cases with isolated moderate to severe rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS),
   and in patients with previous mitral valve replacement (MVR).
   Methods: Thirty-two patients with MS (mean age 41.2 +/- 5.7 years), 20
   with MVR (mean age 46.0 +/- 4.6 years) and 30 healthy individuals (mean
   age 40.3 +/- 4.9 years) were included in the study. In addition to
   NT-proBNP measurements, detailed transthoracic echocardiography was
   performed in all patients and healthy subjects.
   Results: Plasma levels of NT-proBNP were significantly higher in
   patients with MS than in those with MVR or in controls (99.8 +/- 12.7
   versus 74.7 +/- 6.9 and 48.5 +/- 10.5 pg/ml, respectively; p < 0.0001
   all groups). NT-proBNP levels showed a significantly greater increase in
   severe MS than in moderate MS (109.8 +/- 5.6 versus 88.3 +/- 7.6 pg/ml,
   p < 0.0001). NT-proBNP levels also were higher in MVR patients than in
   controls (74.7 +/- 6.9 versus 48.5 +/- 10.5 pg/ml; p < 0.0001). Although
   NT-proBNP levels did not correlate with left ventricular ejection
   fraction (LVEF) in patients with MS (r = -0.33; p > 0.05), there was a
   positive correlation with pulmonary artery pressure (r = 0.87; p <
   0.001) and a negative correlation with mitral valve area (MVA) (r =
   -0.89; p < 0.0001). However, multivariate analysis identified only MVA
   as an independent correlate of NT-proBNP (P = -0.47; p = 0.02).
   Conclusion: In patients with rheumatic MS, NT-proBNP levels correlated
   positively with MS severity. Moreover, NT-proBNP levels increased
   significantly in patients with MS, but were significantly lower in those
   who underwent MVR.}},

Abstract = {{A new cropping system for the warm temperature zone in Japan was
   developed on the basis of the flowering response in the non-pinching
   cultivation in snapdragons (Antirrhinum majus L.). First, the duration
   between the time the seeds were sown (every month) and the time to
   flowering were determined. The number of days from sowing to flowering
   was longest when seeds were sown in October; it was shortest when sown
   in June. The plant height was shortest when seeds were sown in June
   whereas it was tallest when sown in September. The cultivars bred in
   Japan seemed to belong to Group I or Group H. For harvest of cut flowers
   from summer to autumn, seeds of Group M cultivars that were sown in the
   mid-June to the end of July or those of Group IV sown between mid-June
   to mid-July yielded the best results. For optimum harvest from autumn to
   winter, seeds of Group I or H cultivars should be planted from
   mid-August to mid-October. To harvest flowers from spring to summer, we
   planted seeds of Group I and H cultivars in February of those of Group
   Ill and IV from the end of February to March. This cropping system makes

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH-SYSTEM PHARMACY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{2252-2259}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Purpose. The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, drug interactions, clinical
   efficacy, adverse effects, monitoring, and dosage and administration of
   enteric-coated (EC) mycophenolate sodium are reviewed.
   Summary. EC mycophenolate sodium is the EC salt form of mycophenolic
   acid (MPA), the active component of the prodrug, mycophenolate mofetil.
   EC mycophenolate sodium was developed to reduce the
   upper-gastrointestinal (GI) effects of mycophenolate mofetil. Unlike
   oral mycophenolate mofetil, which releases MPA in the stomach, EC
   mycophenolate sodium releases MPA in the small intestine. The absolute
   bioavailability of EC mycophenolate sodium is 72\%. MPA undergoes
   hepatic metabolism by glucuronyl transferase to the inactive
   mycophenolic acid glucuronide (MPAG), the predominant metabolite. The
   majority of an administered dose of EC mycophenolate sodium is found as
   MPAG in the urine. The mean terminal half-life of MPA ranges from 8 to
   16 hours. EC mycophenolate sodium and mycophenolate mofetil have
   equivalent mechanisms of action and drug interaction profiles. Thus far,
   EC mycophenolate sodium has demonstrated similar efficacy and safety to
   mycophenolate mofetil in two Phase III clinical trials of adult renal
   transplant recipients. One study demonstrated improved health-related
   quality of life in patients switched from mycophenolate mofetil to EC
   mycophenolate sodium. Ongoing Phase IV studies are trying to further
   determine advantages of the EC product.
   Conclusion. EC mycophenolate sodium is a safe and effective
   immunosuppressive agent approved for use in the prevention of acute
   rejection after renal transplantation. It offers an excellent addition
   to the current armamentarium of immunosuppressive drugs for transplant
   immunosuppression.}},

Abstract = {{Membership in certain intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), such as
   the World Trade Organization, has long been argued to stimulate trade.
   Yet, evidence linking IGOs to trade is mixed. The authors argue that
   identifying the influence of IGOs requires attention not only to the
   institutions IGOs enact, but also to the network through which they
   enact them. This approach allows them to demonstrate that trade between
   two countries increases by an average of 58\% with every doubling of the
   strength of IGO connection between the countries. They also contribute
   to debates regarding the mechanisms through which structural
   relationships influence economic behavior by showing that substantial
   trade benefits occur not only through economic IGOs, but also through
   IGOs that were formed for social and cultural purposes, and that
   connections through IGOs that are organizationally strong have more
   impact than those through minimalist IGOs.}},

Abstract = {{The present study revisits a subject that has been a source of
   long-standing bioarchaeological contention, namely, estimation of Nubian
   population origins and affinities. Using the Arizona State University
   dental anthropology system, frequencies of 36 crown, root, and intraoral
   osseous discrete traits in 12 late Pleistocene through early historic
   Nubian samples were recorded and analyzed. Specifically, intersample
   phenetic affinities, and an indication of which traits are most
   important in driving this variation, were determined through the
   application of correspondence analysis and the mean measure of
   divergence distance statistic. The results support previous work by the
   author and others indicating that population discontinuity, in the form
   of replacement or significant gene flow into an existing gene pool,
   occurred sometime after the Pleistocene. This analysis now suggests that
   the break occurred before the Final Neolithic. Samples from the latter
   through Christian periods exhibit relative homogeneity, which implies
   overall post-Pleistocene diachronic and regional population continuity.
   Yet there are several perceptible trends among these latter samples
   that: 1) are consistent with documented Nubian population history, 2)
   enable the testing of several existing peopling hypotheses, and 3) allow
   the formulation of new hypotheses, including a suggestion of two
   post-Pleistocene subgroups predicated on an age-based sample dichotomy.}},

Abstract = {{Aquaporin-5 (AQP5), an apical plasma membrane (APM) water channel in
   salivary glands, lacrimal glands, and airway epithelium, has an
   important role in fluid secretion. M-3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor
   (mAChR)-induced changes in AQP5 localization in rat parotid glands were
   investigated with immunofluorescence or immunoelectron microscopy,
   detergent solubility, and gradient density floatation assays. Confocal
   microscopy revealed AQP5 localization in intracellular vesicles of
   interlobular duct cells in rat parotid glands and AQP5 trafficking to
   the APM 10 min after injection of the mAChR agonist cevimeline.
   Conversely, 60 min after injection, there was a diffuse pattern of AQP5
   staining in the cell cytoplasm. The calcium ionophore A-23187 mimicked
   the effects of cevimeline. Immunoelectron microscopic studies confirmed
   that cevimeline induced AQP5 trafficking from intracellular structures
   to APMs in the interlobular duct cells of rat parotid glands. Lipid raft
   markers flotillin-2 and GM1 colocalized with AQP5 and moved with AQP5 in
   response to cevimeline. Under control conditions, the majority of AQP5
   localized in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction and floated to the
   light-density fraction on discontinuous density gradients. After 10-min
   incubation of parotid tissue slices with cevimeline or A-23187, AQP5
   levels decreased in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction and increased in
   the Triton X-100-soluble fraction. Thus AQP5 localizes in the
   intracellular lipid rafts, and M3 mAChR activation induces AQP5
   trafficking to the APM with lipid rafts via intracellular Ca2+ signaling
   and induces AQP5 dissociation from lipid rafts to nonrafts on the APM in
   the interlobular duct cells of rat parotid glands.}},

Abstract = {{Zinc is required for many biological functions including DNA synthesis,
   cell division, gene expression and the activity of various enzymes in
   humans and animals. Zinc concentrations in the plasma and erythrocytes
   are lower and urinary zinc excretion and serum insulin levels are higher
   in subjects with obesity. The effects of a weight-loss program based on
   a hypocaloric balanced diet were investigated on 23 obese females, who
   had a body mass index of more than 25.0 and had dieted for 6 months at
   the Nutrition Clinic, Institute of Nutrition Sciences, Kagawa Nutrition
   University, Tokyo, Japan. The subjects ranged in age from 29 to 76 (54.3
   +/- 13.0) years old. The hypocaloric balanced diet significantly reduced
   the body weight, body mass index, body fat percentage and amount of body
   fat with a slight lowering of blood pressure and plasma levels of
   triglyceride. Interestingly, the plasma concentrations of zinc were
   markedly enhanced at the end of the program.}},

Journal = {{KIDNEY INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{68}},

Abstract = {{Background. Elevation of plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) is common in
   patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Renal tubular epithelial cells
   are capable of synthesizing CRP. Although production of interleukin
   (IL)-6 has been described in RCC, CRP expression by carcinoma cells has
   yet not been investigated.
   Methods. In the present study we analyzed CRP plasma levels as well as
   intratumoral CRP and IL-6 expression of RCC from 40 patients who
   underwent radical nephrectomy by means of quantitative real-time
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry. For each
   tumor, specimens were obtained from tumor center, tumor margin, and
   unaffected surrounding renal tissue.
   Results. Preoperative plasma CRP levels correlated significantly with
   tumor stage (P= 0.05) and grade (P < 0.01). CRP mRNA expression was
   detected in 26 of 33 (79\%), 30 of 36 (83\%), and 32 of 36 (89\%)
   samples from tumor center, tumor margin, and unaffected surrounding
   tissue, respectively. However, levels of CRP mRNA were significantly
   higher in tumor tissue compared to adjacent renal tissue (P < 0.01).
   Clear cell carcinoma exhibited significantly higher CRP mRNA levels than
   papillary carcinoma (P < 0.05). CRP plasma levels correlated
   significantly with quantitative levels of CRP mRNA within tumors (P <
   0.0001). Immunohistochemically, strong CRP production was observed both
   in tumor cells and in tubular epithelial cells in unaffected tissue,
   respectively. All kidneys expressed IL-6 mRNA in the tumor and/or the
   unaffected tissue, but levels of intratumoral IL-6 mRNA showed no
   significant correlation with CRP plasma levels or local CRP
   transcription.
   Conclusion. In patients with RCC, a tumor-derived origin of some plasma
   CRP is likely. Activity of the IL-6/CRP network in RCC contributes to
   the accumulating evidence of the acute-phase reaction as a local
   inflammatory process.}},

Abstract = {{This article reports on an experimental investigation of inductively
   charged sprays used in crop spraying. Two-phase fluid mechanics and
   electric measurements are employed to provide an interdisciplinary basis
   for the electro-hydrodynamic characterization of the sprays. The charged
   sprays are produced using an air-atomizing induction-charging nozzle,
   which is convenient and practical for the electrification of aqueous
   liquids. The study comprises the examination of free-spray and
   deposition aspects of charged and uncharged sprays. The spray structures
   are characterized based on the drop size and velocity data obtained
   using laser-based techniques. The deposition study is further concerned
   with spectrophotometry, analysis to quantify, the drop residue on a
   grounded target. The charging characteristics of charged sprays are
   evaluated through the spray electric current and flow rate measurements,
   providing the spray specific charge. Test results demonstrate the
   dominance of aerodynamic effects within the charged free sprays,
   whereas, in the vicinity, of a grounded target, the sprays are
   influenced by the attractive electrostatic force fields created, leading
   to greater drop depositions on the target.}},

Abstract = {{Rock glaciers, a feature associated with at least discontinuous
   permafrost, provide important topoclimatic information. Active and
   inactive rock glaciers can be used to model current permafrost
   distribution. Relict rock glacier locations provide paleoclimatic
   information to infer past conditions. Future warmer climates could cause
   permafrost zones to shrink and initiate slope instability hazards such
   as debris flows or rockslides, thus modeling change remains imperative.
   This research examines potential past and future permafrost distribution
   in the Colorado Front Range by calibrating an existing permafrost model
   using a standard adiabatic rate for mountains (0.5 degrees C per 100 m)
   for a 4 degrees C range of cooler and warmer temperatures. According to
   the model, permafrost currently covers about 12 per cent (326.1 km(2))
   of the entire study area (2721.5 km(2)). In a 4 degrees C cooler climate
   73.7 per cent (2004.4 km(2)) of the study area could be covered by
   permafrost, whereas in a VC warmer climate almost no permafrost would be
   found. Permafrost would be reduced severely by 93.9 per cent (a loss of
   306.2 km(2)) in a 2.0 degrees C warmer climate; however, permafrost will
   likely respond slowly to change. Relict rock glacier distribution
   indicates that mean annual air temperature (MAAT) was once at least some
   3.0 to 4.0 degrees C cooler during the Pleistocene, with permafrost
   extending some 600-700 m lower than today. The model is effective at
   identify ing temperature sensitive areas for future monitoring; however,
   other feedback mechanisms such as precipitation are neglected. Copyright

   properties. Oxygen concentration was 5.5\% and 9.9\% and carbon dioxide
   concentration was 8.1\% and 4.5\%, in the control and packages
   containing 3 g of magnesium oxide, respectively, on day 12 in storage.
   Packaging mushroom in 0.015 mm LLDPE packages with 3g of magnesium oxide

Abstract = {{Nectar of butterfly-pollinated flowers contains generally higher levels
   of amino acids than does nectar of flowers pollinated by most other
   animal types. One proposed explanation is that these amino acids promote
   butterfly fitness, although the evidence has been equivocal. In a new
   study, Mevi-Schutz and Erhardt showed that nectar amino acids enhanced
   fecundity in the butterfly Araschnia levana, but only when the larval
   diet was poor. Their results support the hypothesis that butterflies are
   agents of selection for higher nectar amino acid production, suggest
   that the larval food plant has a key role in the evolution of the
   flower-butterfly mutualism, and demonstrate that the importance, to
   butterfly reproduction, of different nutrient sources varies with
   butterfly nutritional state.}},

   incompatibility across instruments, and the precision vs feasibility

   adaptive testing methodology, can be applied in rehabilitation to design
   functional outcome instruments that are comprehensive in scope,
   accurate, allow for compatibility across instruments, and are sensitive
   to clinically important change without sacrificing their feasibility.
   Finally, we present some of the pressing challenges that need to be
   overcome to provide effective dissemination and training assistance to

   decentralized detection system where decisions made at peripheral nodes
   need to be communicated to a fusion center. In this letter, the fusion
   of decisions from censoring sensors transmitted over wireless fading
   channels is investigated. The knowledge of fading channels, either in
   the form of instantaneous channel envelopes or the fading statistics, is
   integrated in the optimum and suboptimum fusion rule design. The sensor
   censoring and the ensuing fusion rule design have two major advantages
   compared with the previous work. 1) Communication overhead is
   dramatically reduced. 2) It allows incoherent detection, hence, the
   phase information of transmission channels is no longer required. As
   such, it is particularly suitable for wireless sensor network
   applications with severe resource constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Inhibition for CO2 corrosion of N80 steel by quaternary alkynoxymethyl
   amine (IMC-80-Q) and imidazoline in 3\% NaCl solution was investigated
   under static and flowing conditions by using modified rotating disk
   apparatus. The effects of flow velocity, concentration of inhibitor as
   well as entrained sand on inhibition performances were studied through
   weight loss test, scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation and
   electrochemical techniques including electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy (EIS), linear polarization resistance. Electrochemical
   parameters such as R-1 and C-d for IMC-80-Q exhibited
   peak-value-phenomenon at inhibitor concentration of 150 mg/L when flow
   rate was below 5 m/s, in contrast with 300 mg/L when flow rate was
   beyond 5 m/s. The optimum concentration was further enhanced by the
   entrained sand in the medium containing IMC-80-Q. The adsorption of
   IMC-80-Q under static condition obeyed Langmuir isotherm when inhibitor
   concentration was below 150 mg/L, but it changed into Freundlich
   isotherm as inhibitor concentration was beyond 150 mg/L. The optimum
   inhibitor concentration of imidazoline under static condition was 100
   mg/L, but it increased to 200 mg/L at 5 m/s. Under static condition
   imidazoline exhibited better inhibition than IMC-80-Q did; in contrast,
   at 5 m/s IMC-80-Q exhibited better inhibition than imidazoline did. The
   critical flow velocity was a function of both inhibitor type (IMC-80-Q
   or imidazoline) and inhibitor concentration. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Background. Pancreas graft thromboses represent more than 70\% of all
   technical failures; multiple risk factors have been implicated. We
   analyzed the thrombosis rates using portoiliac versus portocaval vein
   anastomoses.
   Patients and methods. The series includes 53 patients who underwent
   pancreas transplantation: 49 simultaneous pancreas-kidney and 4 pancreas
   after kidney. There were 27 men and 26 women, of mean age of 37.2 +/-
   7.0 years. We compared two groups of recipients that were classified
   according to venous anastomosis: (A) portoiliac (n = 30), and (B)
   portocaval (n = 23).
   Results. The recipients did not show significant differences in age,
   gender, or duration of diabetes mellitus, but body mass index was
   significantly higher among the portocaval group. A bladder-drained
   pancreas technique was more frequently performed in the portoiliac group
   (93\% of patients) versus an enteric-drained pancreas in the portocaval
   group (81\%; P < .001). Heparinization was performed in 12 recipients:
   11 (36.6\%) in the portoiliac group and 1 (4.3\%) in the portocaval
   group (P < .01). Vascular graft thrombosis (venous in six and arterial
   in one) developed in seven patients (13.2\%) all in the portoiliac group
   (23\%) (P < .02). Two-year patient survival was 93\% in the portoiliac
   group and 94\% in portocaval group (P = NS). Two-year graft survival was
   66.6\% in the portoiliac group and 85.9\% in portocaval group (P = .07).
   Conclusion. There was no graft thrombosis among patients with a
   portocaval vein anastomosis.}},

   using a quantum tetrahedral mean field theory are found to be consistent
   with theories based on spin-lattice coupling. We also found that there
   is a weak, but unquestionable, field-induced transition around 2.5 T, at
   which our magnetization shows a subtle anomaly and, at the same time,
   both the Neel point and the estimated gap energy exhibit a sharp
   increase. Another finding is that our high pressure data imply that

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{72}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We consider the electronic structure of, and magnetic exchange (spin)
   interactions between, nominally nonmagnetic Eu3+ ions (4f(6), S=3, L=3,
   J=0) within the context of the rocksalt structure compounds EuN and EuP.
   Both compounds are ionic (Eu3+; N3- and P3-) semimetals similar to
   isovalent GdN. Treating the spin polarization within the 4f shell, and
   then averaging consistent with the J=0 configuration, we estimate
   semimetallic band overlaps (Eu 5d with pnictide 2p or 3p) of similar to
   0.1 eV (EuN) and similar to 1.0 eV (EuP) that increase (become more
   metallic) with pressure. The calculated bulk modulus is 130 (86) GPa for
   EuN (EuP). Exchange (spin-spin) coupling calculated from correlated band
   theory is small and ferromagnetic in sign for EuN, increasing in
   magnitude with pressure. Conversely, the exchange coupling is
   antiferromagnetic in sign for EuP and is larger in magnitude, but
   decreases with compression. Study of a two-site model with S-1 center
   dot S-2 coupling within the J=0,1 spaces of each ion illustrates the
   dependence of the magnetic correlation functions on the model
   parameters, and indicates that the spin coupling is sufficient to alter
   the Van Vleck susceptibility. We outline a scenario of a
   spin-correlation transition in a lattice of S=3, L=3, J=0 nonmagnetic
   ions.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroinflammation has been suggested to play an integral role in the
   pathophysiology of various neurodegenerative diseases. Bacterial
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxins are general activators of
   immune-cells, including microglial cells, which induce expression of
   pro-inflammatory factors. The aim of this study was to characterize
   neurodegenerative effects of exposure to LPS, derived from Salmonella
   abortus equi bacteria, in an in vitro brain slice culture system.
   Quasi-monolayer cultures were obtained using roller-drum incubations of
   hippocampal slices from neonatal Sprague Dawley rats for three weeks.
   Microglia/macrophages were identified in the monolayer cultures by CD11b
   immunostaining, while neuronal populations identified included
   N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA-R1) receptor immunoreactive pyramidal neurons
   and smaller GABA-immunoreactive cells. Following exposure to LPS (100
   ng/ml) an increased density of CD11b positive cells was found in the
   cultures. In addition, the LPS exposure produced a
   concentration-dependent loss of the NMDA-R1 immunoreactive neurons in
   the cultures which was substantial at 100 ng/ml LPS. The loss of NMDA-R1
   cells was apparent already after 24 h exposure to LPS and seemed to be
   primarily due to necrotic-like cell death. However, a continued loss of
   cells was found when cultures were analyzed at 72 h, concomitant with an
   increase in the expression of p53 in the NMDA-R1 cells and TUNEL
   labeling of a few cells. Also the number of GABA-immunoreactive cells
   decreased rapidly and to a substantial extent after 24 h exposure to
   LPS, with a continued decrease up to 72 h. The findings show that
   Salmonella LPS increases the density of CD11b positive cells and acts as
   a potent neurotoxin in hippocampal roller-drum slice cultures. The
   LPS-induced neurodegeneration has both necrotic- and apoptotic-like
   properties and appears to be non-selective, affecting both pyramidal and
   GABA neurons. LPS-induced neurotoxicity in slice cultures may be a
   useful system to study processes involved in inflammatory-mediated
   neurodegeneration.}},

   `the sacred and the profane' as a heuristic to guide the dynamics of the
   process. Using a content analysis based on grounded themes, the findings
   show that with extended and supported use `transaction spaces' emerge
   where subject teachers begin to negotiate with new technologies thus
   creating new meanings and accommodations. These changes are evolutionary
   rather than transformatory with the evidence pointing to a `new' blend
   of technology and subject taking place; a trend that highlights the

Abstract = {{Previous work from this lab has shown that estrogen attenuates
   inflammatory cytokine production following brain lesions in young adult
   female rats, but not in older, reproductive senescent females. The
   present study was designed to elucidate whether these effects result
   from estrogen's actions on brain-resident immune cells (microglia) or on
   circulating immune cells recruited to the brain from blood. Microglia,
   harvested from the olfactory bulbs of ovariectomized young adult and
   reproductive senescent animals, were pretreated with 17 beta-estradiol
   and subsequently with the bacterial endotoxin LPS. LPS treatment
   significantly increased the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 beta in
   microglial cultures harvested from young and senescent females, but
   estrogen treatment had no effect on cytokine expression in either group.
   In young adult-derived microglia, LPS treatment also increased nitric
   oxide (NO), which was attenuated by estrogen, and MMP-9, which was not
   affected by estrogen. Reproductive senescent-derived microglia cultures
   had higher basal expression of NO and MMP-9 activity as compared to
   those from young adult microglial cultures, although LPS did not further
   stimulate these inflammatory markers. In blood cultures, LPS stimulated
   a dose-dependent increase in the inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha
   expression in both young adult and reproductive senescent animals.
   Estrogen replacement significantly attenuated TNF-alpha induction by LPS
   in blood cultures derived from young adult females. Paradoxically,
   estrogen replacement increased LPS-induced TNF-alpha expression in blood
   cultures derived from reproductive senescent animals as compared to
   age-matched controls. The age and estrogen dependent effects on
   circulating immune cells found in whole blood cultures closely mimic the
   effects of estrogen on cytokme expression in the young and senescent
   animals that we reported in vivo, supporting the hypothesis that the
   immunosuppressive actions of estrogen replacement on neural injury may
   result from hormone-action on circulating immune cells. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{The primary objective of this study was to evaluate temporal changes in
   heavy metal content of lower Columbia River sediment following
   terminated or reduced soluble heavy metal loading from the world's
   largest lead-zinc refinery and mining districts in the USA and Canada.
   Sediment cores were collected from two fine sediment depositional sites
   (similar to 600 km downstream) in August 1999 and were analyzed for
   total metal content, texture, and age/dating parameters. Zinc, cadmium
   and lead contents in 1999 declined by only a factor of two over their
   depth profile maxima (dated as between 1970 and 1980). In sharp
   contrast, more than a 10-fold decrease in dissolved metal loading
   occurred during this same period. Zinc in filtered Columbia River water
   at downstream locations also declined by > 10-fold, consistent with the
   reduced upper river solute-metal loading. Once soluble metal releases
   are reduced or terminated, the solute half-time in Columbia River water
   is months versus similar to 20 yr for adsorbed metals on surficial (or
   resuspended) bed sediments. The much slower rate of decline for
   sediment, as compared to the solute phase, is attributed to
   resuspension, transport and redeposition of irreversibly bound metals
   from upstream sedimentary deposits. This implies downstream exposure of
   benthic or particle-ingesting biota can continue for years following
   source remediation and/or termination of soluble metal releases.
   Accordingly, contaminant contents of both particulate and solute phases
   of river water, as well as sediment core sections, are suggested for
   assessing long-term biotic exposure/response to mitigation activities in
   the Columbia River and similar fluvial ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is an effective and accurate method for
   determination of porous media dielectric permittivity (i.e., for soil
   water content) and electrical conductivity (EC). Characterization of
   these properties using controlled wetting or drying of the porous media
   is of interest for studying and quantifying porous media physical and
   chemical properties. Our objectives were to develop a TDR measurement
   cell providing sample water content adjustment and solution exchange
   capability without repacking or disturbing the sample. A coaxial cell
   provides a well-defined sample packing volume in which radial
   distribution of the electromagnetic field averages the transmission line
   measurements over the entire sample. Using concentric porous stainless
   steel tubes as electrical conductors, complete or partial saturation of
   the porous medium (via matric potential control) was possible with the
   additional key advantage of soil solution exchange without changes in
   pore space or sample porosity. Solution exchange and suction adjustment
   were controlled through the center tube with influent solution (ECw)
   entering the sample through the outer wall and for unsaturated
   measurements an air inlet port facilitates air exchange. The cell was
   temperature controlled using an external PVC jacket connected to a
   circulating water bath. Both saturated and unsaturated measurements of
   electrical conductivity resulted in excellent agreement between
   measurements and model predictions. Permittivity measurements were
   dependent on cell orientation, likely due to differences in the water
   distribution within the cell. The utility of this new coaxial TDR
   pressure cell design for porous media research is the ability to
   simultaneously measure dielectric and ECb in a fixed pore space where
   water content and solution electrical conductivity are adjustable.}},

Abstract = {{Background: A recent study reported promising clinical results using
   eccentric quadriceps training on a decline board to treat jumper's knee
   ( patellar tendinosis).
   Methods: In this prospective study, athletes ( mean age 25 years) with
   jumper's knee were randomised to treatment with either painful eccentric
   or painful concentric quadriceps training on a decline board. Fifteen
   exercises were repeated three times, twice daily, 7 days/ week, for 12
   weeks. All patients ceased sporting activities for the first 6 weeks.
   Age, height, weight, and duration of symptoms were similar between
   groups. Visual analogue scales ( VAS; patient estimation of pain during
   exercise) and Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment ( VISA) scores,
   before and after treatment, and patient satisfaction, were used for
   evaluation.
   Results: In the eccentric group, for 9/10 tendons patients were
   satisfied with treatment, VAS decreased from 73 to 23 ( p< 0.005), and
   VISA score increased from 41 to 83 ( p< 0.005). In the concentric group,
   for 9/9 tendons patients were not satisfied, and there were no
   significant differences in VAS ( from 74 to 68, p< 0.34) and VISA score
   ( from 41 to 37, p< 0.34). At follow up ( mean 32.6 months), patients in
   the eccentric group were still satisfied and sports active, but all
   patients in the concentric group had been treated surgically or by
   sclerosing injections.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, eccentric, but not concentric, quadriceps
   training on a decline board, seems to reduce pain in jumper's knee. The
   study aimed to include 20 patients in each group, but was stopped at the
   half time control because of poor results achieved in the concentric
   group.}},

Title = {{Respiratory control stability and upper airway collapsibility in men and

Abstract = {{Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is two to three times more common in men
   as in women. The mechanisms leading to this difference are currently
   unclear but could include gender differences in respiratory stability
   {[}loop gain (LG)] or upper airway collapsibility {[}pharyngeal critical
   closing pressure (Pcrit)]. The aim of this study was to compare LG and
   Pcrit between men and women with OSA to determine whether the factors
   contributing to apnea are similar between genders. The first group of 11
   men and 11 women were matched for OSA severity (mean +/- SE
   apnea-hypopnea index = 43.8 +/- 6.1 and 44.1 +/- 6.6 events/h). The
   second group of 12 men and 12 women were matched for body mass index
   (BMI; 31.6 +/- 1.9 and 31.3 +/- 1.8 kg/m(2), respectively). All
   measurements were made during stable supine non-rapid eye movement
   sleep. LG was determined using a proportional assist ventilator. Pcrit
   was measured by progressively dropping the continuous positive airway
   pressure level for three to five breaths until airway collapse.
   Apnea-hypopnea index-matched women had a higher BMI than men (38.0 +/-
   2.4 vs. 30.0 +/- 1.9 kg/m(2); P = 0.03), but LG and Pcrit were similar
   between men and women (LG: 0.37 +/- 0.02 and 0.37 +/- 0.02,
   respectively, P = 0.92; Pcrit: 0.35 +/- 0.62 and -0.18 +/- 0.87,
   respectively, P = 0.63). In the BMI-matched subgroup, women had less
   severe OSA during non-rapid eye movement sleep (30.9 +/- 7.4 vs. 52.5
   +/- 8.1 events/h; P = 0.04) and lower Pcrit (-2.01 +/- 0.62 vs. 1.16 +/-
   0.83 cmH(2)O; P = 0.005). However, LG was not significantly different
   between genders (0.38 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.33 +/- 0.03; P = 0.14). These
   results suggest that women may be protected from developing OSA by
   having a less collapsible upper airway for any given degree of obesity.}},

Abstract = {{Our aim was to compare the prevalence of antibody to hepatitis C virus
   (anti-HCV) among recently initiated injecting drug users (IDUs) in
   London and Glasgow, and to identify risk factors which could explain
   differences in prevalence between the cities. Complementary studies of
   community recruited IDUs who had initiated injection drug use since 1996
   were conducted during 2001-2002. Data on HCV risk behaviours were
   gathered using structured questionnaires with identical core questions
   and respondents were asked to provide an oral fluid specimen which was
   tested anonymously for anti-HCV but was linked to the questionnaire.
   Sensitivities of the anti-HCV assays for oral fluid were 92-96\%.
   Prevalence of anti-HCV was 35\% (122/354) in London and 57\% (207/366)
   in Glasgow (P < 0.001). Multifactorially, factors significantly
   associated with raised odds of anti-HCV positivity were increasing
   length of injecting career, daily injection, polydrug use, having had a
   needlestick injury, and having served a prison sentence. In addition
   lower odds of anti-HCV positivity were associated with non-injection use
   of crack cocaine and recruitment from drug agencies. After adjustment
   for these factors, the increased odds of anti-HCV associated with being
   a Glasgow IDU were diminished but remained significant. HCV continues to
   be transmitted among the IDU population of both cities at high rates
   despite the availability of syringe exchange and methadone maintenance.
   Effectiveness of harm reduction interventions may be compromised by
   inadequate coverage and failure to reduce sufficiently the frequency of
   sharing different types of injecting equipment, as well as the high
   background prevalence of HCV, and its high infectivity. Comprehensive
   action is urgently required to reduce the incidence of HCV among
   injectors.}},

Abstract = {{Selecting patients who have suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) for
   coronary angiography remains difficult in some subgroups (e.g., women
   have often atypical symptoms and false-positive findings on noninvasive
   tests). This study evaluated gender differences and the clinical value
   of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in predicting CAD. We evaluated
   558 patients who had symptoms and underwent coronary angiography: 91
   women (61.2 +/- 9.5 years of age) had CAD ( >= l lesion with a decrease
   > 50\% in luminal diameter of a coronary artery), 29 women (57.9 +/- 7.0
   years of age) did not have CAD, 372 men (58.9 +/- 9.2 years of age) had
   CAD, and 66 men (54.6 +/- 8.7 years of age) did not have CAD. Maximal
   IMT was assessed bilaterally at the common carotid, bulb, and internal
   carotid arteries and expressed as mean IMT for each patient. Among
   patients who did not have CAD, women had lower mean IMT values than men
   (0.93 +/- 0.15 vs 1.05 +/- 0.19, p < 0.001). This gender difference was
   not seen in patients who had CAD (1.3 +/- 0.31 vs 1.31 +/- 0.31, p =
   0.92). Among women and men, those with CAD had larger IMT values than
   those without CAD. Multivariable regression analysis showed that age,
   CAD, hypertension, smoking, and diabetes had the strongest effect on IMT
   values in women and men. Receiver-operator characteristic analysis
   showed that women had a significantly lower IMT threshold for likelihood
   of CAD (p < 0.001) and that a mean IMT of 1.069 mm was highly predictive
   of concomitant CAD (sensitivity 79\%, specificity 90\%, positive
   predictive value 96\%); for men, the mean IMT threshold was 1.153 mm
   (sensitivity 66\%, specificity 74\%, positive predictive value 93\%). In
   conclusion, carotid IMT assessment may be a valuable tool in selecting
   patients for coronary angiography to predict the likelihood of CAD. This
   particularly concerns women in whom sensitivity and specificity of mean
   IMT are high. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background. E-mail is actively discussed as a promising method for
   clinical communication, but little study of patient and family
   preferences regarding its use has been done. This study aimed to
   describe patients' and family members' interest in and use of E-mail

   Methods. Surveys were distributed to patients and family members
   attending postoperative clinic visits. Seventy-four patients and 35
   caregivers completed the surveys.
   Results. Although one in three patients expressed interest in E-mailing
   their clinicians, only 9.5\% reported actually doing so. Symptom
   management and prescription refills were the most common issues
   addressed by E-mail. Few family members expressed any interest in using
   E-mail.
   Conclusions. The findings suggest that E-mail communication between
   patients with head and neck cancer or their family members with surgeons
   and nurses is not common. Interest in using E-mail tends to be stronger
   among patients than family members. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{515-526}},

Abstract = {{To date only a limited number of product development studies have
   examined the construct of department status. These studies mostly report
   that departments can reflect different levels of status among themselves
   during product development activities and that often the marketing
   department reflects greater status. These studies do not clarify the
   role that department status may pose for product development performance
   and product management performance. Some research would suggest that
   department status has a direct effect on performance, while other
   research would suggest that department status has an indirect effect on
   performance. The present study investigates whether the bestowing of
   department status is important to product development performance and
   product management performance, and, if so, how?
   Based on empirical results from a cross-industry study involving 668
   marketing, manufacturing, and R\&D managers, department status is found
   to have a significant indirect effect on product development and product
   management performance. Results further show that equal status among the
   three departments of marketing, manufacturing, and R\&D correlates with
   higher levels of interdepartmental collaboration, which in turn
   manifests the benefits of higher levels of performance.
   Interdepartmental collaboration is therefore shown to be a mediating
   variable between department status and performance.
   The empirical results of this study suggest that no one department
   should dominate the product development effort and/or product management
   effort. While study data tend to correspond with prior studies in that
   the marketing department tends to reflect higher status compared to R\&D
   and manufacturing, simply bestowing more status to marketing (or to
   another department for that matter) does not appear to be a proper
   course for facilitating interdepartmental collaboration nor for
   manifesting higher product development performance. Rather, equal status
   across marketing, manufacturing, and R\&D departments appears to
   represent the proper course of action to establish collaboration between
   these three departments and subsequently to reap the benefits of higher
   performance. Given the exploratory nature of this study, subsequent
   study is warranted. Avenues for future research along with tentative
   managerial implications are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Laser iridotorny often causes bullous keratopathy; however, the
   mechanism is unclear. We investigated whether changes in aqueous humor
   hydrodynamics after laser iridotomy have any role in conical endothelial
   cell loss.
   Materials and Methods: Porcine corneal endothelial cells were plated
   onto glass slides. Following I or 3 hours for adhesion, the endothelial
   cells were exposed to shear stresses (0.1-10 dyne/cm(2)) for 15
   trimutes, and the number of detached cells was counted. In addition, the
   pressure and shear stress on corneal endothelial layer were calculated
   in a virtual model of laser iridotomy.
   Results: The number of detached corneal endothelial cells increased with
   shear stresses in a dose-dependent manner. Significant increase of rate
   of detached corneal endothelial cells was observed at > 03 dyne/cM(2)
   after 1-hour attachment and at 1 dyne/cm(2) after 3-hour attachment. The
   maximum pressure on corneal endothelial layer was 0.007 mm Hg, which is
   negligible compared with intraocular pressure. However, the maximum
   shear stress oil the corneal endothelial layer could be > 1 dyne/cm(2)
   in some conditions of laser iridotomy.
   Conclusions: The resistance of corneal endothelial cell loss to shear
   stress is time dependent. Shear stress could be a cause of corneal
   endothelial cell loss in some conditions of laser iridotomy.}},

Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{1917-1932}},

Abstract = {{Owing to the spatial averaging involved in satellite sensing, use of
   observations so collected is often restricted to offshore regions. This
   paper discusses a technique to obtain significant wave heights at a
   specified coastal site from their values gathered by a satellite at
   deeper offshore locations. The technique is based on the approach of
   Artificial Neural Network (ANN) of Radial Basis Function (RBF) and
   Feed-forward Back-propagation (FFBP) type. The satellite-sensed data of
   significant wave height; average wave period and the wind speed were
   given as input to the network in order to obtain significant wave
   heights at a coastal site situated along the west coast of India.
   Qualitative as well as quantitative comparison of the network output
   with target observations showed usefulness of the selected networks in
   such an application vis-a-vis simpler techniques like statistical
   regression. The basic FFBP network predicted the higher waves more
   correctly although such a network was less attractive from the point of
   overall accuracy. Unlike satellite observations collection of buoy data
   is costly and hence, it is generally resorted to fewer locations and for
   a smaller period of time. As shown in this study the network can be
   trained with samples of buoy data and can be further used for routine
   wave forecasting at coastal locations based on more permanent flow of
   satellite observations. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSVE) is associated with
   significant morbidity and mortality, even with appropriate antiviral
   therapy. In the present investigation, the first to assess efficacy of
   corticosteroid treatment with aciclovir therapy in HSVE, multiple
   logistic regression analysis was performed of predictors of outcome in
   adult patients with HSVE.
   Methods: A non-randomised retrospective study of 45 patients with HSVE
   treated with aciclovir was conducted. The patients were divided into
   poor and good groups based on outcome at three months after completion
   of aciclovir treatment. The variables evaluated were: clinical variables
   (sex, age, days after onset at initiation of aciclovir, Glasgow Coma
   Scale (GCS) at initiation of aciclovir, initial and maximum values for
   the cell numbers and protein concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid,
   and corticosteroid administration); neuroradiological variables
   (detection of lesions by initial cranial computed tomography and by
   initial magnetic resonance imaging); and one neurophysiological variable
   (detection of periodic lateralised epileptiform discharges on the
   initial electroencephalogram). Single variable logistic regression
   analysis was performed followed by multiple logistic regression
   analysis. The best set of predictors for the outcome of HSVE was
   estimated by stepwise logistic regression analysis.
   Results: A poor outcome was evident with older age, lower GCS score at
   initiation of aciclovir, and no administration of corticosteroid.
   Patient age, GCS at initiation of aciclovir, and corticosteroid
   administration were found to be significant independent predictors of
   outcome on multiple logistic regression analysis, and these three
   variables also formed the best set of predictors (R-2 = 0.594, p <
   0.0001).
   Conclusion: Combination therapy using both aciclovir and corticosteroid
   represents one of the predictors of outcome in HSVE.}},

Abstract = {{We report a case of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) with hepatic
   inflammatory pseudotumor (IP). The patient was clinically diagnosed as
   having multiple metastatic tumors originated from cholangiocellular
   carcinoma as well as autoimmune pancreatitis and underwent left
   lobectomy of the liver. Histological examination showed a diffuse or
   dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltration with obliterating phlebitis but an
   absence of neoplastic proliferation both in the liver tumor and in the
   biopsy specimen of the pancreas. Abundant IgG4-positive plasma cells
   were seen in the lesions. This is the first case report that shows a
   simultaneous occurrence of hepatic IP and AIP, suggesting that these
   lesions appeared on the background of the recently proposed entity of
   IgG4-related systemic disease.}},

Abstract = {{Background: House dust mite allergen has previously been detected in the
   cord blood of some newborns but not others. The factors that affect the
   presence and levels in cord blood of this and possibly other allergens
   are unknown.
   Objective: To test the hypothesis that the levels of maternal allergen
   and allergen specific IgG affect the presence and levels of newborn
   allergen.
   Methods: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to measure the
   levels of house dust mite allergen Der p 1 and Der p 1 specific IgG and
   IgE in paired blood samples from 98 mothers and full-term newborns.
   Results: Der p 1 was detected in 27 mothers and 12 newborns. None of the
   71 mothers who lacked Der p 1 had Der p 1-positive newborns. When
   present, cord blood Der p 1 levels correlated with and were
   approximately one third of Der p 1 levels in maternal blood. Cord blood
   Der p 1 levels also tended to correlate with maternal blood levels of
   Der p 1 specific IgG but showed little, if any, correlation with
   maternal blood levels of Der p 1 specific IgE.
   Conclusions: When detectable, the levels of an allergen in the blood of
   newborns correlate with the levels of that allergen in the blood of
   their mothers and tend to be related to maternal levels of allergen
   specific IgG.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a physiological long-term model of the
   cardiovascular system. It integrates the previous models developed by
   Guyton, Uttamsingh and Coleman. Additionally it introduces mechanisms of
   direct effects of the renal sympathetic nerve activity (rsna) on tubular

   data from literature. The resulting mathematical model constitutes the
   first long-term model of the cardiovascular system accounting for the
   effects of rsna on kidney functions in such detail. The objective of
   developing such a model is to observe the consequences of long-term rsna
   increase and impairment of rsna inhibition under volume loading. This
   model provides an understanding of the rsna-related mechanisms, which
   cause mean arterial pressure increase in hypertension and total sodium
   amount increase (sodium retention) in congestive heart failure,

Abstract = {{Pattern recognition has a long history within electrical engineering but
   has recently become much more widespread as the automated capture of
   signal and images has been cheaper. Very many of the application of
   neural networks are to classification, and so are within the field of
   pattern recognition and classification. In this paper, we explore how
   probabilistic neural networks fit into the earlier framework of pattern
   recognition of partial discharge patterns since the PD patterns are an
   important tool for diagnosis of HV insulation systems. Skilled humans
   can identify the possible insulation defects in various representations
   of partial discharge (PD) data. One of the most widely used
   representation is phase resolved PD (PRPD) patterns. Also this paper
   describes a method for the automated recognition of PRPD patterns using
   a novel complex probabilistic neural network system for the actual
   classification task. The efficacy of composite neural network developed
   using probabilistic neural network is examined. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We have previously reported that there is a poor correlation between
   increase in the levels of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, UGT1A1 and
   UGT1A6, and decrease in the levels of serum total thyroxine (T-4) and
   free T-4 in phenobarbital (PB)-treated rats, although the PB-induced
   decrease in rats is generally thought to occur through induction of the
   UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (T-4-UDP- GT: UGT1A1 and UGT1A6). In the
   present study, to clarify a relationship between the decrease in serum
   T-4 level and the increase in the T-4- UDP-GT activity by PB in rats, we
   examined the relationship using Gunn rats, a mutant strain of Wistar
   rats deficient in UGT1A isoforms. Levels of serum total T-4, free T-4,
   and total triiodothyronine (T-3) were markedly decreased not only in
   Wistar rats but also in Gunn rats 1 day after the final administration
   of PB ( 80 mg/kg i.p., once daily for 4 days), and no significant
   difference in magnitude of the decrease between Wistar and Gunn rats was
   observed. On the other hand, the level and activity of T-4-UDP-GT were
   significantly increased by treatment with PB in Wistar rats but not in
   Gunn rats. Furthermore, significant decrease in the activity of hepatic
   type I iodothyronine deiodinase, which mediates the deiodination of T-4
   and T-3, by PB treatment was observed in both Wistar and Gunn rats. In
   addition, no significant change in the level of serum
   thyroid-stimulating hormone, the activity of hepatic sulfotransferase,
   and the binding of {[}I-125] T-4 to serum transthyretin and albumin by
   PB treatment was observed in either Wistar or Gunn rats. In conclusion,
   the present results demonstrate that the decrease in serum total T-4
   level by PB in Gunn rats is not dependent on the increase in hepatic
   T-4-UDP-GT activity and suggest that even in Wistar rats, the PB-induced
   decrease in serum T-4 level does not occur only through increase in
   hepatic T-4-UDP-GT.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines a brief preventive intervention as a model for
   embedding public health action in primary care.
   Background: Low fruit and vegetable intake is a major risk factor for
   cancer, coronary heart disease and stroke. The recommended intake of
   five portions per day would reduce death rates from these causes by
   20\%. However, average daily consumption in the UK is under three
   portions, and it is significantly lower in men, young people and tower
   socio-economic groups. In order to tackle risk factors such as poor
   diet, the white paper Choosing Health promises action and funding to
   mainstream prevention and transform the NHS from a sickness service to a
   genuine health service.
   The intervention: To promote increased fruit and vegetable consumption,
   primary care professionals working in a deprived area issue
   prescriptions which offer the patient discounts on fruit and vegetable
   purchases. Handover of each prescription to the patient is Linked
   explicitly to key five a day messages. This brief intervention takes 1-2
   min to deploy.
   Immediate outcomes: Evaluation is ongoing. However, early feedback
   suggests that the intervention of prescription plus key messages has a
   significant impact on patients in highlighting the connection between
   food and health. Clinicians express satisfaction at having a preventive
   intervention that can be deployed with confidence and consistency in
   routine primary care consultations.
   Discussion: This brief intervention is presented as a potential model.
   for embedding prevention in the day-to-day work of health professionals.
   Primary care is a natural setting for the promotion of health, but
   despite success in implementing some public health programmes, it has a
   patchy record in primary prevention. The reasons for this are examined,
   the impact of new contractual and commissioning levers is explored, and
   a general framework for mainstreaming public health action in primary
   care is proposed. (c) 2005 The Royal Institute of Public Health.

Abstract = {{Although the National Labor Relations Board has long held that the
   protections of the National Labor Relations Act do not apply to
   employees permanently stationed abroad, employees who are abroad
   temporarily present a different question. As of this uniting, two
   circuit courts have asked whether jurisdiction exists over workers on
   temporary foreign assignment. The Eleventh Circuit concluded that
   jurisdiction is appropriate; the Third Circuit reached the opposite
   conclusion. This Note argues that neither court analyzed the
   extraterritorial issues correctly. The proposed approach offered by this
   Note is as follows: Men a court seeks to assert jurisdiction over unfair
   labor practices occurring while employees are on temporary foreign
   assignments, the court should first apply an effects test, asking
   whether the conduct at issue caused intentional and harmful effects in
   the United States. Second, the court should ask whether an assertion of
   jurisdiction in the particular case at bar would offend notions of
   comity. This Note contends that under this two-part test, the vast
   majority of temporary foreign assignments would fall under the
   jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board.}},

Abstract = {{Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius UCC118 is a probiotic
   bacterium that was originally isolated from human intestinal tissues and
   was subsequently shown in a pilot study to alleviate symptoms associated
   with mild-moderate Crohn's disease. Strain UCC118 can adhere to animal
   and human intestinal tissue, and to both healthy and inflamed ulcerative
   colitis mucosa, irrespective of location in the gut. In this study, an
   enzymatic technique has been combined with proteomic analysis to
   correlate bacterial growth phase with the presence of factors present in
   the cell wall of the bacterium. Using PAGE electrophoresis, it was
   determined that progression from lag to log to stationary growth phases
   in vitro correlated with increasing prominence of an 84 kD protein
   associated with in vitro adherence ability. Isolated proteins from the
   84 kD band region were further separated by two-dimensional
   electrophoresis, resolving this band into 20 individual protein spots at
   differing isoelectric points. The protein moieties were excised, trypsin
   digested and subjected to tandem mass spectrometry. The observed
   proteins are analogous to those reported to be associated with the
   Listeria monocytogenes cell-wall proteome, and include DnaK, Ef-Ts and
   pyruvate kinase. These data suggest that at least some of the beneficial
   attributes of probiotic lactobacilli, and in particular this strain, may
   be due to nonpathogenic mimicry of pathogens and potentially be mediated
   through a form of attenuated virulence. (c) 2005 Federation of European

Abstract = {{Objectives: A hospital-based nutrition support team (NST) may need to
   demonstrate cost savings and quality benefits. The primary aim of this
   study was to determine whether an NST could show tangible cost savings
   (equipment, investigations, and medication costs) from managing patients
   considered for parenteral nutrition (PN). Secondary aims related to the
   quality issues of placement of PN catheters, catheter-related sepsis
   (CRS), duration of parenteral nutrition, and mortality.
   Methods: An NST was formed in 1999 and worked in all adult areas of a
   university hospital (Leicester Royal Infirmary). Comparative data about
   all patients given PN were collected for 2 consecutive years (a
   retrospective pre-NST year and a prospective NST year).
   Results: In the pre-NST year there were 82 PN episodes (54 patients),
   665 PN days, and a CRS rate of 71\% (seven infections/100 PN days). In
   the NST year, there were 133 referrals for PN but only 78 PN episodes
   (75 patients, 59\% of referrals), 752 PN days, and a decreased overall
   CRS rate of 29\% (three infections/100 PN days, P < 0.05) but a rate of
   7\% (0.6 infection/100 PN days) in the final 3 mo of the NST year.
   Tangible cost savings for the NST year were derived from 55 avoided PN
   episodes (42 pound 741) and 35 avoided CRS episodes (7974) pound.
   Thirty-nine percent of PN catheters were inserted by the NST with no
   insertion-related complications. Competency-based training of ward
   nursing staff decreased the CRS rate. Mean duration of PN increased from
   8 to 10 d (P not significant). In-hospital mortality for patients who
   had PN was 23 of 54 (43\%) ill the pre-NST year compared with 18 of 75
   (24\%) in the NST year (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Although the number of PN days increased with an NST,
   tangible cost savings of 50 pound 715 were demonstrated within the NST
   year by avoided PN episodes and a decreased incidence of CRS. These
   savings justify the salaries of a nutrition nurse specialist and a
   senior dietitian. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Large-conductance calcium- and voltage-gated potassium channels (BK or
   Slowpoke) serve as dynamic integrators linking electrical signaling and
   intracellular activity. These channels can mediate many different Ca2+-
   dependent physiological processes including the regulation of neuronal
   and neuroendocrine cell excitability and muscle contraction. To gain
   insights into the function of BK channels in vivo, we isolated a
   full-length cDNA encoding the alpha subunit of a Slowpoke channel from
   the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta (msslo). Amino acid sequence
   comparison of the deduced Manduca protein revealed at least 80\%
   identity to the insect Slo channels. The five C-terminal alternative
   splice regions are conserved, but the cloned cDNA fragments contained
   some unique combinations of exons E, G and I. Our spatial profile
   revealed that transcript levels were highest in skeletal muscle when
   compared with the central nervous system (CNS) and visceral muscle. The
   temporal profile suggested that msslo expression is regulated
   developmentally in a tissue- and regional-specific pattern. The levels
   of msslo transcripts remain relatively constant throughout metamorphosis
   in the CNS, transiently decline in the heart and are barely detectable
   in the gut except in adults. A dramatic upregulation of msslo transcript
   levels occurs in thoracic but not abdominal dorsal longitudinal body
   wall muscles (DLM), suggesting that the msSlo current plays an important
   role in the excitation or contractile properties of the phasic flight
   muscle. Our developmental profile of msslo expression suggests that
   msSlo currents may contribute to the changes in neural circuits and
   muscle properties that produce stage-specific functions and behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions (AgNORs) and MIB-1
   as proliferating activities have been applied separately to assess the
   malignant potential of cancer cells. We conducted staining of AgNORs and
   MIB-1 in 42 surgically-resected invasive breast carcinomas.
   Materials and Methods: Paraffin-embedded sections were used for double
   staining and the mean AgNOR counts in 100 MIB-1-positive and -negative
   cells were calculated.
   Results: The mean AgNOR count in MIB-1-positive cells was significantly
   higher than in MIB-1-negative ones. AgNOR counts in MIB-1-positive
   tumors were significantly higher in tumors >= 2 cm and those with
   positive nodes. Multivariate analysis identified the AgNOR count in
   MIB-1-positive tumors as the only independent factor related to node
   metastasis. Survival of patients with lower counts of AgNORs in
   MIB-1-positive tumors was significantly better compared to those with
   higher counts.
   Conclusion: Double staining of MIB-1 and AgNORs is useful for predicting
   lymph node metastasis and prognosis of patients with breast carcinoma.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of inductively coupled plasma (ICP) with CF4 gas on the
   surface electronic structures of Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) thin films has
   been studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning
   force microscopy (SFM). XPS data showed significant changes in
   core-level energies of In 3d(5/2), Sn 3d(2/5,) C 1s and F 1s, implying
   changes in bonding states of these species after CF4 plasma treatment.
   Local current maps of ITO surfaces using conducting atomic force
   microscopy (C-AFM) showed two distinct regions at applied bias of 0.1 V:
   conducting and non-conducting regions. Local I-V measurements in the
   conducting regions of as received ITO showed ohmic behavior. Most of the
   ITO surfaces became non-conducting with Sckottky behavior after surface
   treatment with CF4 plasma. Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) showed
   an increase in work function of ITO by similar to 0.8 eV after
   subsequent CF4 plasma treatment. When ITO films were exposed in ambient,
   the work function of ITO decreased gradually, mainly because water
   molecules were absorbed onto the surfaces. CF4 plasma allowed the making
   of more negative surfaces with more dangling bonds of fluorine ions
   (F-), and the surfaces kith F- induced electrons from the surfaces to be
   depleted. Subsequently, this caused the surface band to bend upward. As
   a result, the work function of ITO films was increased by the surface
   treatment, and this helps to inject holes more efficiently into the
   active light-emitting layer from ITO electrodes for improving the
   performance of organic-light emitting diodes (OLEDs).}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the consequences of inactivation of the serotonin
   transporter (SERT) gene on 5-HT homeostasis and function, 5-HT synthesis
   and turnover rates were measured using the decarboxylase inhibition
   method in multiple brain regions (frontal cortex, striatum, brainstem,
   hippocampus and hypothalamus) from mice with a genetic disruption of
   SERT. 5-HT synthesis rates were increased 30-60\% in the different brain
   regions of SERT -/- mice compared to littermate +/+ control mice despite
   55-70\% reductions in tissue 5-HT concentrations. Brain regions that
   possessed a greater capacity to increase synthesis and turnover (frontal
   cortex, striatum) demonstrated lesser reductions in tissue 5-HT. Female
   SERT -/- mice had greater increases (79\%) in brain 5-HT synthesis than
   male -/- mice did (25\%), a finding associated with higher brain
   tryptophan concentrations in females. Despite increased 5-HT synthesis,
   there was no change in either TPH2 or TPH1 mRNA levels or in maximal in
   vitro TPH activity in the brainstem of SERT -/- mice. Catecholamine
   homeostasis as reflected in brain tissue concentrations and in synthesis
   and turnover of dopamine and norepinephrine was unchanged in SERT -/-
   mice. Taken together, the results demonstrate a markedly altered
   homeostatic situation in SERT -/- mice that lack 5-HT reuptake,
   resulting in markedly depleted tissue stores that are inadequately
   compensated for by increased 5-HT synthesis, with brain region and
   gender specificity observed. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Hypobaric local anesthetics for total hip replacement (THR)
   have potential advantages related to body position and differential
   block. However, the dose requirements of hypobaric local anesthetics for
   THR have not been clearly established. Therefore, we undertook a
   dose-response study of hypobaric tetracaine for THR.
   Methods: In a randomized, controlled, and double-blinded manner, three
   groups of 20 patients each undergoing THR received spinal anesthesia
   using either 10, 12, or 14 mg of 0.2\% hypobaric tetracaine in a lateral
   decubitus position, with the operated side up. Adequate anesthesia was
   defined as: 1) upper sensory block between T10 and T4; 2) motor block of
   modified Bromage scale 2 or 3; and 3) time to sensory remission to the
   L2 level of more than three hours.
   Results: The number of patients who achieved adequate sensory and motor
   block levels was similar amongst the three groups. However, all patients
   who received 14 mg had a sensory remission time to L2 of more than three
   hours while only 30\% of the patients in the 12 mg group and no patient
   in the 10 mg group had the same remission time. A significant
   differential block was observed between the non-dependent and the
   dependent sides, but the degree of differential block was not different
   between the groups.
   Conclusion: 10 to 14 mg of 0.2\% hypobaric tetracaine achieved similar
   and adequate block levels, but different regression times. To ensure
   complete sensory block duration for THR, we recommend using 14 mg of
   0.2\% hypobaric tetracaine.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty-four Bacillus strains predominantly outgrown in a night soil
   treatment system were isolated and characterized. Under various culture
   conditions, cell interactions took place among them and cell population
   changed. Maximum removal of NH4+-N and cell production by the isolates
   occurred under the conditions of 30\% DO and C/N ratio of 8. Five
   dominant isolates were identified to be species of Bacillus cereus,
   Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis with similarities of
   78-94\%. Additions of 0.8\% peptone and 0.3\% yeast extract to a basal
   medium influenced the growth of isolates and the removal of NH4+-N in
   flask culture. Metal ions such as Ca2+, Fe2+ and Mg2+ had a similar
   effect. The specific growth rates of the five isolates were found to be
   in a range of 0.43-0.55 h(-1). During the flask experiment of nitrogen
   removal under aerobic growth conditions, active nitrification by the
   isolates occurred largely in I It with a decrease of COD and alkalinity
   reduced to only 74.6\% of theoretical value. From the nitrogen balance,
   the percentage of nitrogen lost in the flask culture was estimated to be
   33.0\%, which was presumed to convert to N-2 gas. This conversion of
   ammonia to N-2 without formation of nitrous oxide under aerobic growth
   conditions was confirmed by GC analysis. From all the results, it has
   been found that the Bacillus strains were able to occur simultaneously
   aerobic nitrification/denitrification and the 133 process using the
   Bacillus strains seemed to possess some economic advantages. (c) 2005

Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{An in situ vapor sorption apparatus has been constructed for use in
   small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements. The apparatus adapts
   two independent operating mechanisms, with and without a carrier gas, to
   control relative or absolute pressure, respectively, in the SANS
   sorption cell. By controlling the absolute pressure, a target relative
   vapor pressure between 0\% and 90\% can be reached within 1-2 min. The
   short response time makes it possible to correlate diffusion kinetics
   and/or sorption/desorption isotherms with structure evolution during
   wetting/drying, which is not possible in gravimetric methods. Also, one
   can extract diffusion coefficients and interaction parameters. Other
   uses include the enhancement of scattering contrast in the study of
   semicrystalline polymers by the preferential vapor sorption of
   deuterated vapor into the amorphous regions. Thus, one can obtain the
   same structural information as small-angle x-ray scattering measurements
   on dry samples. Also, the apparatus has the capability to inject a
   pore-masking liquid into the sample cell while under vacuum to ensure
   the filling of all open porosities in a sample. The capability to mix
   two vapors in various ratios facilitates the determination of a
   contrast-matching point using a single sample, which also eliminates a
   major source of systematic error. The performance of the apparatus is
   demonstrated using a polyelectrolyte membrane and semicrystalline
   polyethylene. Additionally, technical points relating to controlling the
   relative vapor pressure, relative humidity, and regarding the vapor
   distribution in the cell are discussed. (c) 2005 American Institute of

Abstract = {{A SAN (storage area network) is a mass storage solution, that is,
   designed to provide a high-reliability and high-speed network over fiber
   optic link. This paper is dealing with the stochastic SAN server
   management method which is focused on reliability. The (remote) backup
   servers are hooked up by the long-haul network and replace broken main
   severs immediately. If the SAN servers are represented as
   ``machines{''}, this system can be solved by using the stochastic
   maintenance model with main unreliable and random auxiliary spare
   (remote backup) machines, subject to random breakdowns, repairs, and two
   replacement policies: one for busy and another for idle or vacation
   periods. When the repair facility is not available because of the given
   conditions, auxiliary machines are being used for backups. Unlike
   existing models, the availability of auxiliary machines is changed for
   each activation of the system. Analytically tractable results are
   obtained by using a duality principle (which enables us to treat a more
   rudimentary system), semiregenerative analysis, and multivariate marked
   renewal processes. The results are demonstrated in the framework of
   optimized SAN server allocation problems with unreliable backup servers.

Abstract = {{Like the United States, Russia is a large industrialized nation with
   high violence rates. Although its overall homicide rate is among the
   highest in the world, however, local rates of crime vary widely.
   Similarly, the level of social support provided by the state varies
   throughout Russia due to former Soviet policies, the differential pace
   of political and economic change, and the level of development. Relying
   upon recent criminological literature oil social support theory, this
   study tested the hypotheses that areas with higher levels of social
   support will have lower homicide rates and that the effects of negative
   socioeconomic change on homicide rates will be moderated by levels of
   social support. Utilizing data from Russian regions (n = 78) and
   controlling for other structural covariates, negative binomial
   regression was employed to estimate the effects of social support oil
   regional homicide rates. As expected, negative socioeconomic change was
   associated with higher homicide rates, but the results provided no
   support for direct or conditioning effects of social support on
   homicide. The findings are discussed in the context of Russia-specific
   conditions and of the meaning of these findings for recent research on
   social support and crime. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Customer retention is a critical issue for the survival of any business
   in today's competitive marketplace. In this paper, we propose a dynamic
   procedure utilizing self-organizing maps and a Markov process for
   detecting and preventing customer defection that uses data of past and
   current customer behavior. The basic concept originates from empirical
   observations that identified that a customer has a tendency to change
   behavior (i.e. trim-out usage volumes) before eventual withdrawal and
   defection. Our explanatory model predicts when potential defectors are
   likely to withdraw. Two strategies are suggested to respond to the
   question of where to lead potential defectors for the next stage, based
   on anticipating when the potential defector will leave. Our model
   predicts potential defectors with little deterioration of prediction
   accuracy compared with that of the multilayer perceptron neural network
   and decision trees. Moreover, it performs reasonably well in a
   controlled experiment using an online game.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Service organizations often use various types of penalties without fully
   understanding the effects on customers' evaluations. Because customers'
   responses to penalties are usually negative, it is important for service
   organizations to properly administer and manage penalties. However,
   little is currently known about how customers view such
   ``punishments.{''} This study develops an integrated framework to
   explain customers' responses to penalties based on concepts from
   attribution theory, social justice theory, and expectancy
   disconfirmation. The study examines the effects of penalty attributes
   (severity, flexibility adequacy of an explanation), attributions (i.e.,
   causal inference), perceived justice, disconfirmation, and emotion on
   customers' evaluations of penalties imposed by service organizations.
   This research uses a cross-sectional survey design and collects data
   online using the critical incident technique. The results show that
   penalty attributes, attributions, perceived justice, and negative
   emotion have significant effects on customers' responses to penalties.
   The study provides useful guidelines to help service organizations
   manage penalties.}},

Abstract = {{The operational performance of the JET neutral beam injector (NBI)
   system during 2003 is presented and compared with NBI operation from
   1994 to 2002. The paper also addresses different demands imposed on NBI
   operation during the JET Joint Undertaking (until the end of 1999) and
   the European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA) JET operating contract
   (from 2000).
   The material presented shows new operational performance records
   achieved in 2003, derived from data focused on average and maximum pulse
   lengths, pulse power and injected pulse energy. Over the last 10 years,
   the issue of JET NBI positive ion neutral injector (PINI) reliability
   and availability has also been of significant interest. A discussion is
   presented where terminology is defined, technical systems causing
   unreliability and non-availability are analysed and operational
   practices are reviewed.
   The performance analysis shows that during the period of JET operation
   under the EFDA contract, the NBI facility has successfully changed from
   high power-short pulse to high power-long pulse (10 s) operation. It
   also shows that the sources of unreliability and non-avail ability have
   largely remained constant during this change. (c) 2005 EURATOM/UKAEA.

Abstract = {{Background Measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of
   inflammation, is recommended to improve cardiovascular disease (CVD)
   risk stratification. However, no studies have collectively evaluated how
   inflammatory markers cluster empirically and relate to angiographic
   coronary artery disease and CVD events.
   Methods From the WISE study, 580 women with fasting plasma samples of
   inflammatory markers (interleukin {[}IL]-6, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor
   alpha, transforming growth factor beta, CRP, serum amyloid A {[}SAA],
   and intercellular adhesion molecules) were analyzed over a median of 4.7
   years follow-up. All women were referred for coronary angiography
   (1996-2000) to evaluate suspected myocardial ischemia.
   Results In factor analysis, a ``proinflammation{''} factor (cluster)
   loaded on IL-6, CRP, and SAA (r = 0.63-0.87); a ``proinflammation and
   anti-inflammation{''} cluster loaded on IL-18 and tumor necrosis factor
   a (r = 0.72, 0.77); and an ``immunosuppressive{''} factor loaded singly
   on transforming growth factor beta (r = 0.96). No cluster was
   independently associated with angiographic coronary artery disease.
   However, quartile increases of the ``proinflammation{''} cluster (IL-6,
   CRP, and SAA) yielded death rates of 2.6\%, 7.2\%, 13.1\%, 26.6\%,
   respectively (P < .0001). Women with >= 2 of 3 proinflammation markers
   in the upper quartile had an adjusted relative risk of death of 4.21
   (95\% CI 1.91-9.25), a higher conferred risk than any single marker
   alone, all of which were roughly equally predictive.
   Conclusions Although IL-6, CRP, and SAA all predict CVD risk in women,
   development of global measures of inflammation and simply counting the
   number of markers with high levels improve CVD risk stratification. In
   addition, results indicate that the adverse impact of inflammation may
   be largely through other mechanisms than promotion of atherogenesis (ie,
   destabilization of vulnerable plaques).}},

Abstract = {{Persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) causes relevant mortality and
   cardiovascular and noncardiovascular morbidity. Therefore, maintenance
   of sinus rhythm is an important clinical goal, especially when the
   patient is symptomatic, despite the fact that current treatment
   strategies are not sufficient to completely prevent recurrent AF. In
   addition to underlying atrial disease that predisposes to AF, AF in
   itself induces structural and electrical adaptations ({''}electrical
   remodeling{''} and ``structural remodeling{''}). Underlying disease
   processes and parts of structural remodeling are not always reversible.
   Electrical remodeling, in contrast, is reversed by a few weeks of
   maintenance of sinus rhythm under experimental conditions. This
   corresponds to the period when most of the recurrent episodes of AF
   occur after cardioversion. Antiarrhythmic drugs that prolong the atrial
   action potential can assist in the prevention of recurrent AF by
   promoting the reversal of electrical remodeling. Such drugs, which are
   currently used over long periods after cardioversion, may only be needed
   until the physiological action potential duration is restored, for
   example, during the first few weeks after cardioversion of persistent
   AF. This treatment concept that we call ``targeted pharmacological
   reversal of electrical remodeling{''} would limit both cost and
   drug-induced side effects of antiarrhythmic drug therapy after
   cardioversion. The Flec-SL trial, ISECTN62728743, therefore tests the
   main hypothesis that targeted pharmacological reversal of electrical
   remodeling by short-term antiarrhythmic drug therapy for 4 weeks after
   cardioversion is not inferior to standard long-term antiarrhythmic drug
   therapy for the prevention of recurrent AF after cardioversion in a
   parallel group, randomized, multicenter, open, blinded end point
   analysis design. Based on its effectiveness and pharmacokinetic profile,
   flecainide is used to test the study hypothesis. The trial uses daily
   transtelephonic electrocardiographic monitoring for all patients and
   will be conducted within the German Atrial Fibrillation Competence
   NETwork (AFNET) to facilitate inclusion of patients from
   electrophysiologically oriented cardiology centers, ordinary hospitals,
   and off ice-based physicians.}},

Abstract = {{Endocrine gland-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (EG-VEGF) or
   Prokineticin-1 (PK-1) is a novel cysteine-rich protein that belongs to
   the AVIT protein family. EG-VEGF/PK-1, described as selective angiogenic
   mitogen, is widely expressed in different tissues including
   steroidogenic endocrine glands. This review summarizes the expression
   and functions of EG-VEGF/PK-1 in corpus luteum (CL)-derived cells:
   endothelial and steroidogenic cell types. EG-VEGF/PK-1 mRNA is expressed
   by luteal steroidogenic cells of human, rat and bovine ovaries, but was
   absent from the luteal Endothelial cells CLEC. Luteal EC expressed high
   levels of both PK-receptors PK-R1 and PK-R2 - the two G protein-coupled
   PK-1 receptors. Interestingly, expression of EG-VEGF/PK-1 and VEGF were
   inversely regulated in human and bovine luteinized granulosa cells.
   EG-VEGF/PK-1 elevated {[}3H]-thymidine incorporation, MAPK activation
   and c-jun/fos mRNA expression and enhanced LEC proliferation.
   EG-VEGF/PK-1 also inhibited serum starvation - induced apoptosis in
   these cells. Stress conditions such as serum withdrawal, TNF alpha and
   chemical hypoxia markedly increase PK-R2 expression, whereas mRNA levels
   of PK-R1 remain unchanged, implying that the anti-apoptotic effect of
   PK-1 on LEC may be mediated via PK-R2. Besides its direct mitogenic and
   anti-apoptotic effects, EG-VEGF/PK-1 elevated VEGF mRNA expression in
   bovine luteal steroidogenic cells, which possesses only PK-R1. Together,
   these findings suggest an important rote for PK-1 in luteal. function by
   acting as a mitogen and survival factor in LEC. Nevertheless, the
   inverse regulation of EG-VEGF/PK1 and VEGF mRNA expression by ovarian
   cells and the distribution of its receptors may suggest that in addition
   to its angiogenic effects, EG-VEGF/PK-1 may also play other roles in
   ovary. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To describe the functional consequences of hand
   osteoarthritis, and analyse associations between personal factors, hand
   impairment, activity limitations, and participation restrictions within
   the framework of the International Classification of Functioning (ICF).
   Methods: 87 women with hand osteoarthritis completed a clinical
   examination including recording of sociodemographic data, measures of
   hand impairment, and completion of self reported health status measures.
   The function subscale of the AUSCAN Osteoarthritis Hand Index was used
   as a measure of hand related activity limitations, while the Canadian
   Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) was used to describe and measure
   activity limitations and participation restrictions as perceived by the
   individual. The study variables were categorised using the dimensions in
   the ICF framework and analysed using bivariate and multivariate
   statistical approaches.
   Results: The patients described problems in many domains of activity and
   participation. The most frequently described hand related problems were
   activities requiring considerable grip strength combined with twisting
   of the hands. On the impairment level, the patients had reduced grip
   force and joint mobility in the hands, and resisted motion was painful.
   Regression analyses showed that hand related activity limitations were
   associated with measures of hand impairment, while activity and
   participation ( as measured by the COPM) were more strongly associated
   with personal factors than with hand impairment.
   Conclusions: Hand osteoarthritis has important functional consequences
   in terms of pain, reduced hand mobility and grip force, activity
   limitations, and participation restrictions. Rehabilitation programmes
   should therefore be multidisciplinary and multidimensional, focusing on
   hand function, occupational performance, and coping strategies.}},

   Calcite and fluid inclusion CO2 delta(13)C values between -3.1 and -10.9

   achievement of more oxidized conditions. Hydrogen and oxygen isotope
   analyses of the country rocks suggest minor isotope disequilibrium and

   subsolidus post-crystallization isotopic exchange, linked with

Abstract = {{An immunoassay with a lateral flow format has been developed for the
   detection of ruminant by-product material in animal feeds and feed

   destined for feeding to ruminants to ensure that they do not contain
   ruminant by-products in violation of the ruminant-to-ruminant feed ban
   established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1997. This feed
   ban was established as a firewall against exposure of ruminant livestock
   animals to the prion agents responsible for neurological diseases such
   as bovine spongiform encephalopathy and scrapie. The test is designed
   for field use, e.g., at a feed mill, and yields a qualitative
   (presence/absence) result in 15-20 min. The objective of the study was
   to validate the lateral-flow test for detection of ruminant by-product
   material in a variety of finished animal feeds and feed ingredients.
   Results indicate that the test is specific for ruminant material and can
   detect as little as 1\% ruminant material in these commodities.}},

Volume = {{133}},

Abstract = {{The 24-25 January 2000 eastern United States snowstorm was noteworthy as
   operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) guidance was poor for
   lead times as short as 36 h. Despite improvements in the forecast of the
   surface cyclone position and intensity at 1200 UTC 25 January 2000 with
   decreasing lead time, NWP guidance placed the westward extent of the
   midtropospheric, frontogenetically forced precipitation shield too far
   to the east.
   To assess the influence of initial condition uncertainties on the
   forecast of this event, an adjoint model is used to evaluate forecast
   sensitivities for 36- and 48-h forecasts valid at 1200 UTC 25 January
   2000 using as response functions the energy-weighted forecast error,
   lower-tropospheric circulation about a box surrounding the surface
   cyclone, 750-hPa frontogenesis, and vertical motion. The sensitivities
   with respect to the initial conditions for these response functions are
   in general very similar: geographically isolated, maximized in the
   middle and lower troposphere, and possessing an upshear vertical tilt.
   The sensitivities are maximized in a region of enhanced low-level
   baroclinicity in the vicinity of the surface cyclone's precursor upper
   trough. However, differences in the phase and structure of the gradients
   for the four response functions are evident, which suggests that
   perturbations could be constructed to alter one response function but
   not necessarily the others.
   Gradients of the forecast error response function with respect to the
   initial conditions are used in an iterative procedure to construct
   initial condition perturbations that reduce the forecast error. These
   initial condition perturbations were small in terms of both spatial
   scale and magnitude. Those initial condition perturbations that were
   confined primarily to the midtroposphere grew rapidly into much larger
   amplitude upper-and-lower tropospheric perturbations. The perturbed
   forecasts were not only characterized by reduced final time forecast
   error, but also had a synoptic evolution that more closely followed
   analyses and observations.}},

Abstract = {{Bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) lack the
   Coxsackie-adenovirus (Ad) receptor and thus are poorly transduced by
   vectors based on human Ad serotype 5 (Ad5). We investigated whether this
   problem could be overcome by using tropism-modified Ad5 vectors carrying
   fiber shaft domains and knobs of different human species B Ads (Ad5FBs).
   To allow quantitative analyses, these vectors coded for the enhanced
   green fluorescent protein (eGFP). Transgene expression analysis showed
   superior transduction of hMSCs by all Ad5FBs tested as compared with
   conventional Ad5 vectors. This was evident both by the frequency of
   eGFP-positive cells and by the eGFP level per cell. Highly efficient
   transduction of hMSCs, with limited variability between cells from
   different donors, was achieved with vectors displaying fiber domains of
   Ad serotypes 50, 35, and 16. These findings could not be reconciled with
   the very low levels of CD46, a recently identified receptor for species
   B Ads, on hMSCs, suggesting that AdFBs probably use receptors other than
   CD46 to enter these cells. We further observed that high eGFP levels
   were maintained in replication-restricted hMSCs for more than 30 days.
   In dividing hMSCs, foreign DNA delivered by Ad5FBs was expressed in a
   large fraction of the cells for approximately 3 weeks without
   compromising their replication capacity. Importantly, the transduced
   hMSCs retained their capacity to differentiate into adipocytes and
   osteoblasts when exposed to the appropriate stimuli. STEM CELLS

Abstract = {{A great deal of accumulated data testify that Five Factors Model not
   only describes adult personality but can be used for the description of
   structure of children's and adolescents' individual differences. In the
   present research data collected from 1220 parents and 10 13 adolescents
   were used to verify the adequacy of this Model for adolescents'
   personality description. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that Five
   Factors Model corresponded well to empirical data after four low-level
   factors had been merged into general ones. Age-related changes and
   gender differences in groups of different age and gender were revealed.
   Multiple Regression Analysis showed that there was an agreement between
   parents and their children in understanding of adolescent's personality
   (for one and the same scale the values of one of the subjects could be
   predicted on the basis of another subject's values), but the rate of
   this agreement was not high. Factor analysis based on canonical
   correlation and Structural Equation Modeling were used to synthesize
   information gathered from parents and adolescents. Both methods allow to
   distinguish covariation of variables due to subject from covariation of
   variables due to the source of information. It is shown that Five
   Factors Model fits data and explains adolescent's deviation in

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. The purpose of our study was to assess the clinical
   feasibility of MDCT angiography for evaluating hemodialysis
   arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs).
   MATERIALS AND METHODS. MDCT angiography of the complete vascular trees
   of 36 failing AVFs or AVF-related complications (20 native and 16
   polytetrafluoroethylene graft AVFs) was reviewed. The numbers and
   degrees of stenoses at the anastomoses, graft loops, and draining and
   central veins and the presence of aneurysms or thrombosis were recorded.
   Wilcoxon's signed rank test was used to compare the findings of MDCT
   angiography with those of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) (n =
   10), surgery (n = 22), or both (n = 4) performed within 2-6 days. Kappa
   statistics were used to correlate the clinical feasibility of MDCT
   angiography assessed by two reviewers.
   RESULTS. Among the 14 AVFs examined with both MDCT angiography and DSA,
   no significant difference was seen in the detection and grading (P =
   0.317 to > 0.999) of stenoses at various segments of the entire vascular
   tree. Among the 36 AVFs examined, MDCT angiography also showed no
   significant difference from DSA or surgery in revealing vascular
   stenoses, aneurysms, and thromboses from the supplying artery to central
   veins (p = 0.317 to > 0.999). Overall, the sensitivity, specificity,
   positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of MDCT
   angiography in lesion detection were 98.7\%, 97.5\%, 98.8\%, 97.2\%, and
   98.3\%, respectively. High image quality with superb interobserver
   correlation (K = 0.809 to > 0.999) validated the clinical feasibility of
   MDCT angiography for assessing AVFs.
   CONCLUSION. MDCT angiography is clinically feasible for evaluating the
   complete vascular tree of failing AVFs and in showing uncommon
   complications, including brachial aneurysms and central vein lesions.}},

Abstract = {{The adhesion behavior of Cu film on a low-k material has been
   investigated. A low-k film that was deposited by using a mixture of
   hexamethyldisilane (HMDS) and para-xylene (p-xylene) had a dielectric
   constant as low as 2.7 and was thermally stable up to 400 degrees C. An
   interfacial Ti layer, boron dopant in the Cu film, and N-2-plasma
   treatment were all applied to improve adhesion between Cu and the low-k
   film. Adhesion was significantly enhanced by the N-2-plasma treatment on
   the low-k film and by the boron dopant in the Cu film. This enhanced
   adhesion was attributed to the formation of new binding states between
   Ti and the plasma-treated surface of the low-k film and also to the
   diffusion of B from Cu to the Ti film. Boron dopant in the Cu film
   showed the best performance for adhesion among the three treatments. The
   Cu(B)/Ti/low-k film composite annealed at 350 degrees C withstood an
   applied load of about 23 N during a scratch test.}},

Abstract = {{Consulting engineering companies strive for more innovation and
   flexibility as a response to the contradictory demands from the
   organization and an unpredictable business environment. In doing so,
   knowledge management strategies, project organization and the
   redesigning of office spaces are employed. A five-year longitudinal set
   of ethnographic studies uses multidisciplinary perspectives to examine
   organizational change and development in a consulting engineering firm.
   The analytic approach encompasses three dimensions: the development of
   the firm itself, the way in which it organizes its projects and the
   spatial/community dimension. This enables an understanding of the
   multiple, often contrasting, organizing dynamics in the organization as
   well as diverse interests and groups found within this type of
   organization. It finds that it is not only the clients of the company
   who rule in a `project tyranny', but also other organizing dynamics that
   in contrast `perforate' the projects and maintain professional
   communities. The `tyranny' of projects affects the allocation of
   resources and the scheduling of work can constrain organizational and
   other innovations. An attempt to create a new organizational grouping in
   the studied engineering consultancy to `perforate' the project-based
   structure and improve internal interactions within the organization
   reveals that although spatial integration is obtained, too few resources
   are allocated to support the change. The implications for other
   consulting engineering organizations are the need for multiple
   organizing principles and management to bridge contradictory and
   competing concerns for skill development, resource alignment and
   innovation efforts; and a need to focus on soft management practices
   such as mediation, brokering and coaching.}},

Abstract = {{In general, striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) binding is assessed by
   use of data reconstructed by filtered backprojection (FBP). The aim of
   this study was to investigate whether the use of an iterative
   reconstruction algorithm (ordered-subset expectation maximization
   {[}OSEM]) may provide results comparable to or even better than those
   obtained by standard FBP. Methods: In 50 patients with parkinsonian
   syndromes, SPECT scans were acquired 4 h after injection of 185 MBq of
   (123)l-fluoropropyl-2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane
   ((123)l-FP-CIT) by use of a triple-head,gamma-camera fitted with
   low-energy, high-resolution fanbeam collimators. After reconstruction by
   FBP and OSEM, data were filtered with a Butterworth filter and corrected
   for attenuation. Patient studies were automatically fitted to a mean
   template with a corresponding 3-dimensional (3D) volume-of-interest map
   covering the striatum, caudate, and putamen as well as an occipital
   reference region to calculate specific DAT binding. In addition, studies
   with an anthropomorphic 3D striatal phantom were performed to mimic
   different pathologies. Results: Visual assessment of phantom and patient
   data suggested a better separation between the caudate and the putamen
   in studies reconstructed by OSEM than in those reconstructed by FBP.
   There was an excellent correlation between specific DAT binding assessed
   by OSEM and that assessed by FBP (R-2 values: striatum, 0.999; caudate,
   0.998; putamen, 0.998). Mean specific striatal binding obtained by OSEM
   was approximately 6\% lower than that obtained by FBP. In no case was
   diagnostic information from OSEM inferior to that from FBP. Conclusion:
   Iterative reconstruction of (123)l-FP-CIT SPECT studies for the
   assessment of DAT is feasible in routine clinical practice. A close
   correlation between FBP and OSEM data suggested that the latter also
   allow reliable quantification of DAT binding. Because of a better
   separation between the caudate and the putamen in the visual evaluation,
   as suggested by phantom and patient studies, OSEM may even be considered
   the preferable approach.}},

Abstract = {{During the past decade, Yellowstone cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki
   bouvieri) of Yellowstone Lake and its tributary streams have been
   affected by the introduction of lake trout (Salvelinus naymaycush),
   invasion by Myxobolus cerebralis (the cause of whirling disease), and
   drought conditions. Numbers of upstream migrating cutthroat trout at
   Clear and Bridge creeks have declined > 90\% in the past 5 years.
   Activity by bears has declined at spawning streams 1989-2004, and
   mirrored that of the cutthroat trout reductions, indicating cascading
   interactions in the food web of this system. Success by anglers has also
   declined, from two fish caught per hour in 1998 to less than one fish/h
   in 2004. To suppress lake trout, the National Park Service initiated a
   gillnetting program using up to 16 km of net each day, May-October. From
   1994-2004, > 100,000 lake trout were removed. The catch per unit effort
   and average length of spawning lake trout have declined, indicating that
   netting efforts may be impacting the population. As several important
   consumer species, including the threatened grizzly bear (Ursus arctos
   horribilis), use this population as an energy source, preservation of
   remaining cutthroat trout could be essential to maintain the integrity
   of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{GYF domains are conserved eukaryotic adaptor domains that recognize
   proline-rich sequences. Although the structure and function of the
   prototypic GYF domain from the human CD2BP2 protein have been
   characterized in detail, very little is known about GYF domains from
   other proteins and species. Here we describe the binding properties of
   four GYF domains of various origins. Phage display in combination with
   SPOT analysis revealed the PPG(F/I/L/M/V) motif as a general recognition
   signature. Based on these results, the proteomes of human, yeast, and
   Arabidopsis thaliana were searched for potential interaction sites.
   Binding of several candidate proteins was confirmed by pull-down
   experiments or yeast two-hybrid analysis. The binding epitope of the GYF
   domain from the yeast SMY2 protein was mapped by NMR spectroscopy and
   led to a structural model that accounts for the different binding
   properties of SMY2-type GYF domains and the CD2BP2-GYF domain.}},

Abstract = {{Subcellular events of Erysiphe cichoracearum infections of epidermal
   cells were visualized in living tissues of Arabidopsis plants carrying
   various green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged organelles via laser
   scanning confocal microscopy. Early in the infection sequence, cytoplasm
   and organelles moved towards penetration sites and accumulated near
   penetration pegs. Peroxisomes appeared to accumulate preferentially
   relative to the cytoplasm at penetration sites. Another early event,
   which preceded haustorium formation, was the aggregation of some
   GFP-tagged plasma membrane marker proteins into rings around penetration
   sites, which extended across cell-wall boundaries into neighboring
   cells. This feature localized to sites where papillae were deposited.
   The extrahaustorial membrane (EHM) encases the fungal feeding structure,
   the haustorium, separating it from the host cytoplasm. Eight plasma
   membrane markers were excluded from the EHM and remained in a
   collar-like formation around the haustorial neck. These observations
   support the suggestions that the EHM is a unique, specialized membrane
   and is different from the plasma membrane. Our results suggested two
   possibilities for the origin of the EHM: invagination of the plasma
   membrane coupled with membrane differentiation; or de novo synthesis of
   the EHM by targeted vesicle trafficking.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between medical practitioners and industry have a profound
   impact on medical decision-making. It is important to establish clear
   guidelines to ensure that the values of clinical care, the welfare of
   society and science prevail over commercial imperatives and monetary
   values, The Royal Australasian Collage of Physicians has revised its
   Guidelines for the relationships involving medical practitioners and
   industry to provide practical assistance to health care professionals in
   the understanding and management of thier interactions with industry.
   The Guidelines are advisory but provide argument and references to
   support their conclusions. They outline a practical approach to the
   management of dualities and conflicts of interests. Among other things,
   they recommend that gifts should be rejected, including those of small
   value and etertainment expenses. They argue that industry sponsorship to
   attend meetings should be restricted to cases where formal contributions
   are being made, that drug samples should not be accepted from
   pharmaceutical representatives and that endorsements of specific
   products and ``advertorials{''} should be avoided. They propose that
   clinicians should not actively recruit their own patients into studies
   in which they are investigators and that it should be a condition of
   agreement to participate by researchers and approval by ethics
   committees that there is a commitment to make publicly available all
   results potentially relevant to clinical practice. The Guidelines are
   intended to reflect changing community attitudes and will continue to be

Abstract = {{Electrochemical communication between an electrode and a multilayered
   enzyme model based on ``self-mediation{''} without a mediator was
   demonstrated as one of the advantages of using enzyme models instead of
   natural enzymes for the fabrication of biosensors. Heme undecapeptide
   (HP), as a peroxidase model, was immobilized on the indiumi-tin oxide
   (ITO) electrode as a multilayer and its elect rocatalytic reduction for
   H2O2 was studied. The cathodic current of the HP multilayer-modified
   electrode was found to be one order of magnitude larger than that of a
   HP monolayer-modified electrode, in which the surface coverage of HP was
   one order of magnitude smaller than that of the multilayer. Since direct
   electron transfer between upper HP molecules and the electrode is
   difficult, H2O2 was reduced via an electron self-exchange between the
   lower HP molecules. On the basis of the self-mediation, the overall
   catalytic reaction rate of the HP electrode was changed by simply
   varying the surface coverage of HP without a mediator. Taking advantage
   of this system, dynamic ranges for the detection of HP inhibitors such
   as cyanide, imidazole and histamine were adjusted. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{1,3-beta-D-Glucan synthase, which synthesizes a main component of fungal
   cell wall, is one of the promising targets for antifungal agents. In
   order to identify novel chemical classes of 1,3-beta-D-glucan synthase
   inhibitors, we screened a chemical library monitoring inhibition of the
   Candida albicans 1,3-beta-D-glucan synthase activity. The piperazine
   propanol derivative GS1578 1(2,6-difluoro-phenyl)-carbamic acid
   3-(4-benzothiazol-2-yl-piperazine-1-yl)-propyl esterl was identified as
   a potent inhibitor against 1,3-beta-D-glucan synthase with an IC50 value
   of 0.16 mu m. GS1578 exhibited in vitro antifungal activity against
   pathogenic fungi including C. albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus.
   Temperature-sensitive mutations of the FKS1 gene in the Delta fks2
   background of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where FKS1 and FKS2 encode
   putative catalytic subunits of 1,3-beta-D-glucan synthase, altered
   sensitivity to GS1578. This suggests that the antifungal activity of the
   piperazine propanol derivative has an effect on 1,3-beta-D-glucan
   synthase inhibition. Results of our initial evaluation suggest that the
   piperazine propanol derivative is a novel chemical structure of the
   class of antifungals which inhibit fungal cell growth by inhibiting
   fungal 1,3-beta-D-glucan synthase.}},

Abstract = {{In members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, ampC, which encodes a
   P-lactamase, is regulated by an upstream, divergently transcribed gene,
   ampR. However, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the regulation of ampC is not
   understood. In this study, we compared the characteristics of a P.
   aeruginosa ampR mutant, PAOampR, with that of an isogenic ampR(+)
   parent. The ampR mutation greatly altered AmpC production. In the
   absence of antibiotic, PAOampR expressed increased basal beta-lactamase
   levels. However, this increase was not followed by a concomitant
   increase in the P-ampC, promoter activity. The discrepancy in protein
   and transcription analyses led us to discover the presence of another
   chromosomal AmpR-regulated beta-lactamase, PoxB. We found that the
   expression of P. aeruginosa ampR greatly altered the beta-lactamase
   production from ampC and poxB in Escherichia coli: it up-regulated AmpC
   but down-regulated PoxB activities. In addition, the constitutive P-ampR
   promoter activity in PAOampR indicated that AmpR did not autoregulate in
   the absence or presence of inducers. We further demonstrated that AmpR
   is a global regulator because the strain carrying the ampR mutation
   produced higher levels of pyocyanin and LasA protease and lower levels
   of LasB elastase than the wild-type strain. The increase in LasA levels
   was positively correlated with the P-lasA, P-lasl, and P-lasR
   expression. The reduction in the LasB activity was positively correlated
   with the P-rhlR expression. Thus, AmpR plays a dual role, positively
   regulating the ampC, lasB, and rhlR expression levels and negatively
   regulating the poxB, lasA, lasl, and lasR expression levels.}},

Abstract = {{The diagnostic value of various classic electrocardiographic (ECG)
   voltage criteria for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) has not been
   established in a genotyped population. This study aimed to determine the
   most accurate diagnostic definition of classic ECG voltage criteria for
   detecting carriers of HC. ECG and echocardiographic findings were
   analyzed in 161 genotyped subjects (97 genetically affected, 64
   unaffected) from 20 families with disease-causing mutations in 4 genes.
   The diagnostic value of 4 voltage criteria (Cornell, Sokolow-Lyon,
   Romhilt-Estes, and 12-lead QRS voltage) for detecting carriers of HC was
   investigated. In all subjects, the Romhilt-Estes (point score >= 4)
   criterion and 12-lead QRS voltage ( 240 mm) were most sensitive (37\%
   and 36\%, respectively), with high specificity (95\% each), resulting in
   the greatest accuracy (60\% and 59\%, respectively). Using these
   criteria, in subjects without echocardiographic evidence of left
   ventricular hypertrophy, voltage abnormalities were found in 22.6\% of
   carriers and 4.7\% of noncarriers (p < 0.01). In conclusion., these
   findings suggest that the Romhilt-Estes and the 12-lead QRS voltage
   criteria may be the most accurate diagnostic definitions for HC on the
   basis of molecular genetic diagnoses. Furthermore, this study
   demonstrated that voltage abnormalities may be found in prehypertrophic
   carriers. Even when genetic testing becomes widely available, it will be
   difficult to make genetic diagnoses in all patients with HC because of
   its genetic heterogeneity. Therefore, understanding the diagnostic value
   of classic ECG voltage criteria may be important in detecting carriers,
   including those without left ventricular hypertrophy. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing disorder characterized by a
   compulsion to seek and take drugs, loss of control in limiting intake,
   and emergence of a negative emotional state in the absence of drug.
   Allostatic changes in reward function that lead to excessive drug intake
   provide a heuristic framework to identify the neurobiological and
   neuroadaptive mechanisms involved in the development of drug addiction.
   The brain reward system implicated in the development of addiction is
   comprised of key elements of the extended amygdala basal forebrain
   macrostructure and its connections. Neuropharmacological studies in
   animal models of addiction associated with excessive drug intake have
   provided evidence for the dysregulation of specific neurochemical
   mechanisms within the extended amygdala (opioid peptides,
   gamma-aminobutyric acid, glutamate, and dopamine). There also is
   recruitment of brain stress systems (corticotropin-releasing factor and
   norepinepMne) and dysregulation of brain anti-stress systems
   (neuropeptide Y), contributing to the negative motivational state
   associated with drug abstinence. The changes in the reward and stress
   systems are hypothesized to maintain hedonic stability in an allostatic
   state-as opposed to a homeostatic state-and as such, convey the
   vulnerability for the development of dependence and relapse. The
   compromised brain reward and stress systems provide additional
   motivation for drug-seeking derived from the negative reinforcement of
   acute withdrawal, and are hypothesized to contribute to the allostatic
   state of protracted abstinence that augments other forms of `craving'
   induced by environmental events. The allostatic state of protracted
   abstinence is an important target for developing novel behavioral and
   pharmacological therapies for drug addiction. (c) 2005 Association for

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives This report describes the evaluation of the
   COBAS AmpliPrep instrument for fully automated generic nucleic acid
   extraction in conjunction with hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, hepatitis C
   virus (HCV) RNA, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 RNA COBAS
   AmpliScreen amplification and detection using serial dilutions of the
   WHO international standards (IS) and the PeliCheck reference panels.
   Materials and Methods Serial diluted samples of the WHO IS and the
   PeliCheck reference panels were tested 24 times to determine the HBV
   DNA, HCV RNA and HIV-1 RNA detection limits by Probit analysis. The
   existence and extent of cross-contamination were assessed by testing
   alternating high titre HBV DNA-positive and -negative samples. The
   specificity of the AmpliPrep-AmpliScreen test for HBV was determined by
   testing 232 minipools consisting of six donations, all negative for
   HCV/HIV-1 nucleic acid testing (NAT) and HBsAg. In addition, a HBV
   genotypes A-G panel was tested.
   Results The respective 95\% detection limits (and 95\% CI) on the WHO IS
   and on the PeliCheck reference panels were 6.7 (4.3-13) IU/ml and 123
   (68-301) gEq/ml for HBV DNA, 23 (11-106) IU/ml and 126 (84-233) gEq/ml
   for HCV RNA, and 187 (108-422) IU/ml and 183 (108-434) gEq/ml for HIV-1
   RNA. Based on the WHO IS and the PeliCheck reference panels, no
   significant differences in sensitivity for HBV and HCV were found
   between AmpliPrep and the licensed MultiPrep extraction method. The
   sensitivity of AmpliPrep-AmpliScreen for HIV-1 was probably twofold
   lower as compared to the MultiPrep-AmpliScreen method. No cross
   contamination was observed. All 232 minipools were HBV NAT-negative. The
   AmpliPrep-AmpliScreen test for HBV detected HBV genotypes A-G with equal
   sensitivity.
   Conclusions The AmpliPrep instrument combined with the AmpliScreen
   assays for HBV, HCV and HIV-1 is robust and suitable for NAT donor
   screening. The sensitivity criteria for HIV-1 and HCV as defined by the
   Paul Ehrlich Institute and the Food and Drug Administration for minipool
   NAT screening are met by this system.

Abstract = {{The beneficial effect of surface peening (including shot peening, laser
   shock peening, low plasticity burnishing, etc.) on fatigue resistance of
   structural alloys is well documented and widely used in industry to
   improve component life. It is perhaps the most widely used technique
   that relies on the introduction of residual stresses into the component
   by direct mechanical means. The resulting stress states are usually
   evaluated experimentally by X-ray diffraction or other stress
   measurement techniques. In order for shot peening operations to be
   effective and reliable, the process of introducing residual stresses and
   strains into peened components must not only be controlled but also be
   predictable and quantifiable.
   The present paper establishes a framework for predictive modelling of
   the residual stress states due to surface peening. Firstly, uniform
   (within planes parallel to the surface) plastic deformation of the
   surface layer taking place during shot peening of a thin plate is
   simulated using the concept of eigenstrain.
   As a further demonstration of the capabilities of the proposed approach,
   flexible plate theory is applied to the analysis of stresses and
   deformations arising due to local peening within a circular area. The
   results are of considerable use and significance for the analysis of
   shot peening and peen forming operations.}},

Abstract = {{The SARS crisis revealed critical gaps in Ontario's health emergency
   response capacity, and identified, in the starkest terms possible, the

   development of the Ontario Health Plan for an influenza Pandemic
   (OHPIP), released in June 2005.
   Some key points arising from the provincial planning process include the
   necessity to:
   ensure a broad and inclusive development process;
   ensure the pandemic plan identifies: 1) clear roles and responsibilities
   of federal, provincial/territorial and municipal levels of government,
   2) the approach to occupational health and safety issues and ethical
   decision-making, 3) a communications strategy linking all affected
   sectors and levels of government and health sector; 4) any commitments
   to antiviral stockpiling, vaccine and antiviral allocation and use, and
   an approach for drug delivery from provincial stockpiles to local pub
   health units; 5) health human resource management and supplementation;
   and 6) key programs/services to be scaled back to maximize surge
   capacity;
   address best practices (e.g., involve all sectors of the health care
   system at the outset, acquire strategic expertise, coordinate/advocate
   with broader emergency response system, etc); and,
   outline future stages that include strengthening the delivery of
   clinical care to influenza cases; clarifying the role of primary care
   practitioners during a pandemic; leveraging Ontario's significant
   e-Health investments. Ontario's pandemic planning process aims to
   provide a robust, detailed document that will offer useful advice and

Abstract = {{The Southern Alps of New Zealand are the topographic expression of
   active oblique continental convergence of the Australian and Pacific
   plates. Despite inferred high rates of tectonic and climatic forcing,
   the pattern of differential uplift and erosion remains uncertain. We use
   a 25-m DEM to conduct a regional-scale relief analysis of a 250-km long
   strip of the western Southern Alps (WSA). We present a preliminary map
   of regional erosion and denudation by overlaying mean basin relief, a
   modelled stream-power erosion index, river incision rates, historic
   landslide denudation rates, and landslide density. The interplay between
   strong tectonic and climatic forcing has led to relief production that
   locally attains similar to 2 knit in major catchments, with mean values
   of 0.65-0.68 km. Interpolation between elevations of major catchment
   divides indicates potential removal of 10(1)-10(3) km(3), or a mean
   basin relief of 0.51-0.85 km in the larger catchments.
   Local relief and inferred river incision rates into bedrock are highest
   about 50-67\% of the distance between the Alpine fault and the main
   divide. The mean regional relief variability is +/- 0.5 km. Local
   relief, valley cross-sectional area, and catchment width correlate
   moderately with catchment area, and also reach maximum values between
   the range front and the divide. Hypsometric integrals show scale
   dependence, and together with hypsometric curves, are insufficient to
   clearly differentiate between glacial and fluvial dominated basins. Mean
   slope angle in the WSA (psi =30 degrees) is lower where major
   longitudinal valleys and extensive ice cover occur, and may be an
   insensitive measure of regional relief Modal slope angle is strikingly
   uniform throughout the WSA ( phi = 38-40 degrees), and may record
   adjustment to runoff and landsliding. Both psi and phi show non-linear
   relationships with elevation, which we attribute to dominant geomorphic
   process domains, such as fluvial processes in low-altitude valley
   trains, surface runoff and frequent landsliding on montane hillslopes,
   ``relief dampening{''} by glaciers, and rock fall/avalanching on steep
   main-divide slopes. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic behavior of an endoglucanase from the hyperthermophilic
   microorganism Pyrococcus furiosus was investigated using elastic neutron
   scattering. The temperature dependence of the atomic motions was
   correlated with conformational. and functional characteristics of the
   enzyme. The onset of biological function at temperatures higher than
   approximately 25 degrees C (the hyperthermostable enzyme is essentially
   inactive at room temperature) was associated with a dynamical transition
   in the anharmonic motions domain. This transition from the nonactive to
   the enzymatically active conformation involved structurally similar
   conformational substates in the energy landscape. From the mean-square
   displacement of the protein atoms, the molecular flexibility and the
   effective force constants were calculated at different temperature
   zones. The results showed that the activity increases at higher
   temperatures where the intramolecular bonds are weakened and the overall
   rigidity of the protein is decreased. Further temperature increase
   resulted in significantly increased atomic fluctuations featuring heat
   denaturation of the protein.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. Pegylated and nonpegylated cetyl alcohol/polysorbate
   nanoparticles (E78 NPs) are being tested as drug carriers for specific
   tumor and brain targeting. Because these nanoparticle formulations are
   designed for systemic administration, it is important to test the
   compatibility of these lipid-based NPs with blood and blood cells.
   Methods. The hemocompatibility of E78 NPs was evaluated with a
   particular focus on hemolytic activity, platelet function, and blood
   coagulation. Human red blood cell lysis was determined by measuring
   hemoglobin release. Activation and aggregation of human platelets were
   determined using flow cytometry and aggregometry, respectively. Finally,
   the whole blood clotting time was measured using human blood.
   Results. E78 NPs did not cause in vitro red blood cell lysis at
   concentrations up to 1 mg/mL. In addition, under conditions tested, E78
   and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated E78 NPs (PEG-E78 NPs) did not
   activate platelets. In fact, both NP formulations very rapidly inhibited
   agonist-induced platelet activation and aggregation in a dose-dependent
   manner. Additionally, E78 NPs significantly prolonged in vitro whole
   blood clotting time at a concentration of 500 mu g/mL or greater.
   Conclusions. It was concluded that PEG-coated and nonpegylated E78 NPs
   have potential blood compatibility at clinically relevant doses. Based
   on the calculated nanoparticle-to-platelet ratio, the concentration at
   which E78 NPs could potentially affect platelet function in vivo was
   approximately 1 mg/mL.}},

Abstract = {{A goal of dietary management of cardiovascular disease risk in patients
   with obesity and metabolic syndrome is improvement in the atherogenic
   dyslipidemia comprising elevated triglyceride, reduced high-density
   lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and increased numbers of small, dense
   low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. Individuals with a genetically
   influenced trait characterized by a high proportion of small, dense LDL
   ( phenotype B) respond to a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet with greater
   reduction of LDL cholesterol, apoprotein B, and mid-sized LDL2 particles
   than unaffected subjects (phenotype A). In contrast, in phenotype A
   subjects there is a reciprocal shift from large LDL1 to small LDL3 such
   that a high proportion convert to phenotype B. There is evidence for
   heritable effects on these diet-induced subclass changes and for the
   involvement of specific genes. For example, a haplotype of the APOA5
   gene associated with increased plasma triglyceride and small, dense LDL
   predicts greater diet-induced reduction of LDL2, a haplotype-specific
   effect that is strongly correlated with both increased VLDL precursors
   and LDL4 products. Understanding of such diet-genotype interactions may
   help to elucidate mechanisms that are responsible for phenotype B and
   for its differential dietary responsiveness. This information may also
   ultimately help in identifying those individuals who are most likely to
   achieve cardiovascular risk benefit from specific dietary interventions.}},

Abstract = {{The developmental requirements of ovarian follicles are dependent on the
   maturation stage of the follicle; in particular, elegant studies with
   genetic models have indicated that FSH is required for antral, but not
   preantral, follicle growth and maturation. To elucidate further the role
   of FSH and other regulatory molecules in preantral follicle development,
   in vitro culture systems are needed. We employed a biomaterials-based
   approach to follicle culture, in which follicles were encapsulated
   within matrices that were tailored to the specific developmental needs
   of the follicle. This three-dimensional system was used to examine the
   impact of increasing doses of FSH on follicle development for
   two-layered secondary (100-130 mu m; two layers of granulosa cells
   surrounding the oocyte) and multilayered secondary (150-180 mu m,
   several layers of granulosa cells surrounding the oocyte) follicles
   isolated from mice. Two-layered secondary follicles were FSH responsive
   when cultured in alginate-collagen I matrices, exhibiting FSH
   dose-dependent increases in follicle growth, lactate production, and
   steroid secretion. Multilayered secondary follicles were FSH dependent,
   with follicle survival, growth, steroid secretion, metabolism, and
   oocyte maturation all regulated by FSH. However, doses greater than 25
   mIU/ml of FSH negatively impacted multilayered secondary follicle
   development (reduced follicle survival). The present results indicate
   that the hormonal and environmental needs of the follicular complex
   change during the maturation process. The culture system can be adapted
   to each stage of development, which will be especially critical for
   translation to human follicles that have a longer developmental period.}},

   developed. it was found, that within 10 seconds of the plasma treatment,
   the surface temperature does not reach critical values and overcome
   safeness of the rubber blend what should induce the crosslinking
   process. However, it was confirmed that crosslinking of the surface

   of patients with myalgia (n=104) were tested against a 1\% reference

   n=111). The primary efficacy parameter in this double-blind,
   reference-controlled, randomized, multicenter study of 215 patients with
   pain in the lower and upper back was pain in motion, assessed with the
   aid of a visual analogue scale. Secondary efficacy parameters included
   pain at rest, pain on palpation, and functional impairment. With high
   concentrations of the treatment product, amelioration of pain on active
   motion (P<5x10(-9)), pain at rest (P<.001), and pain on palpation
   (P=5x10(-5)) was significantly more pronounced than that attained with
   the reference product and was clinically highly relevant. A number
   needed to treat of 3.2 was calculated from the study results. Global
   efficacy was significantly better (P=1 x 10(-8)) and onset of effects
   was faster (P=4x10(-7)) with the high-concentration product.
   Tolerability of the highly concentrated study product was good to
   excellent in all patients. Study results confirm the known
   anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of topical Symphytum cream. As a
   new finding, applicability in certain forms of back pain can be
   concluded.}},

Abstract = {{Xeroderma pigmentosum is characterized by increased sensitivity of the
   affected individuals to sunlight and light-induced skin cancers and, in
   some cases, to neurological abnormalities. The disease is caused by a
   mutation in genes XPA through XPG and the XP variant (XPV gene). The
   proteins encoded by the XPA, -B, -C, -D, -F, and -G genes are required
   for nucleotide excision repair, and the XPV gene encodes DNA polymerase
   eta, which carries out translesion DNA synthesis. In contrast, the
   mechanism by which the XPE gene product prevents sunlight-induced
   cancers is not known. The gene (XPE/DDB2) encodes the small subunit of a
   heterodimeric DNA binding protein with high affinity to UV-damaged DNA
   (UV-damaged DNA binding protein {[}UV-DDB]). The DDB2 protein exists in
   at least four forms in the cell: monomeric DDB2, DDBI-DDB2 heterodimer
   (LTV-DDB), and as a protein associated with both the Collin 4A (CUL4A)
   complex and the COP9 signalosome. To better define the role of DDB2 in
   the cellular response to DNA damage, we purified all four forms of DDB2
   and analyzed their DNA binding properties and their effects on mammalian
   nucleotide excision repair. We find that DDB2 has an intrinsic damaged
   DNA binding activity and that under our assay conditions neither DDB2
   nor complexes that contain DDB2 (UV-DDB, CUL4A, and COP9) participate in
   nucleotide excision repair carried out by the six-factor human excision
   nuclease.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of dielectric constant of solvent on the presence of ion
   aggregates/undissociated salt and their dissociation with the addition
   of polymer has been studied by FTIR for polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)
   based gel electrolytes containing ammonium triflate (NH4CF3SO3). Salt is
   fully dissociated in electrolytes containing dimethylacetamide (DMA)-a
   high dielectric constant solvent and some ion aggregates are also
   present whereas in electrolytes containing diethylcarbonate (DEC)-a low
   dielectric constant solvent, some undissociated salt is present. The
   conductivity behaviour of polymer gel electrolytes has been found to
   depend upon the dielectric constant of the solvent used. PMMA plays the
   role of a stiffener in electrolytes containing DMA and results in a
   small decrease in conductivity whereas in electrolytes containing DEC,
   the addition of PMMA results in an increase in conductivity which has
   been explained to be due to an increase in free ion concentration by the
   dissociation of undissociated salt and ion aggregates. The presence of
   free ions, ion aggregates, undissociated salt has also been examined by
   FTIR spectroscopy. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Four Indian soybean genotypes were investigated for the pattern of
   accumulation of trypsin inhibitor (TI) content during seed development
   and to determine the TI content at green pod consumption stage.. All the
   Genotypes exhibited varying levels of TI content at very early stage of
   seed development. This was substantiated by the presence of Kunitz
   inhibitor band, the polypeptide component which constitutes about 80\%
   of TI activity, at 30 days after flowering when native PAGE was run for
   different stages of bean development for different genotypes. Genotypes
   also differed in accumulation pattern of TI content during seed
   development. TI content, on dry weight basis, increased continuously
   from 30 days of flowering (DAF) till maturity for `Pb1' and `NRC37'
   while in `Shilajeet' the same pattern was observed except there was
   decline just before harvest maturity. Entirely different accumulation
   pattern was observed in `JS335' where TI content at 30 DAF was as high
   as observed at maturity and thereafter it fluctuated. Significant levels
   of TI were observed at suitable picking stage for green pod consumption
   in all four genotypes. It may be inferred that because of high moisture
   content TI content is mistakenly considered low in immature soybean.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Periodontitis develops as a result of the interaction of the
   host with subgingival plaque bacteria. Both Porphyromonas gingivalis and
   Treponema denticola are frequently associated together in these oral
   biofilms.
   Methods: The molecular basis for in vitro biofilm formation was
   investigated for P. gingivalis 38 1, T. denticola. 35405, and mixtures
   of the two organisms using microtiter plate assays. In addition, the
   biofilms were examined following confocal laser scanning microscopy.
   Results: P. gingivalis 381, but not T. denticola strains, formed
   biofilms in vitro. This property was dependent, in part, on the strain
   381 fimA, ppk, and usp genes. Microarray and Northern blot analyses
   suggested that the expression of the ppk gene was required for maximal
   expression of the uspA gene. P. gingivalis 381 formed synergistic
   biofilms when incubated with T. denticola strains. This process was
   dependent upon the strain 381 rgpB and fimA genes as well as the T.
   denticola flgE and cfpA genes.
   Conclusions: P. gingivalis 381 formed synergistic biofilms with T.
   denticola 35405. These results may be relevant to the previous
   observations that the two organisms are frequently observed together in
   subgingival plaque with the spirochetes localized to the exterior of the
   oral biofilms. It is suggested that other such synergistic effects may
   also occur between other plaque bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{Background: We have analyzed the records of our own hospitalized cases
   of bilateral chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) to reveal the prognosis.
   Methods: Ninety-eight cases of cSDH were operated at our hospital over a
   6-year period, in which 14 cases were classified as being bilateral.
   Among these 14 cases, 6 cases showed a rapid and aggressive clinical
   course. Therefore, complicated risk factors, the initial data on
   coagulofibrinolytic examination, magnetic resonance imaging appearance,
   and prognosis were analyzed.
   Results: Of the 6 cases, 5 showed a rapid aggravation as they awaited
   surgery. The period of the aggravation since the initial diagnosis
   harboring cSDH was 19 to 54 hours. One case was at first neurologically
   free from any disturbance but 17 hours later experienced a generalized
   seizure. All 6 cases experienced consciousness disturbance. In addition,
   3 of them manifested oculomotor palsy. Two cases showed an abnormality
   of coagulofibrinolytic activity. No significant risk factors were
   revealed. In 4 cases, T-2-weighted images (T2WIs) revealed the hematoma
   of a mixed high and low intensity, indicating that the hematoma
   consisted of both liquid and solid parts of a freshly formed blood clot.
   In 2 cases, the hematoma showed a low intensity in T-1-weighted image
   (T1WI), indicating a recent bleeding of a significant amount.
   Conclusion: The bilateral cases of cSDH should be treated as early as
   possible with simultaneous decompression of bilateral hematoma pressure,
   even if the patient shows minimal neurologic deficits. Mixed high and
   low intensity in T2WI or low intensity in T1WI is the most predictable
   factor to show rapid aggravation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   a chiral selector for capillary electrophoretic ICE), high-performance
   liquid chromatographic (HPLC), and gas chromatographic (GC) separation
   of the enantiomers of DL-amino compounds. We have previously used X-ray
   crystallographic analysis and HPLC with an immobilized 18C6H(4) Chiral
   stationary phase to study chiral recognition by 18C6H(4) of several DL
   amino acids (DL-AA). In this study CE was used for chiral recognition of
   several DL-AA in electrolyte solution containing 18C6H(4), in which the
   analyte (D or L amino acid) interacts freely. Among 14 DL-AA
   investigated, the e-nontiomers of nine (Glu, Ile, Met, PheG, Phe, Ser,
   Tyr, Val, and Thr) were successfully recognized in 4-15 mM 18C6H(4).
   Indirect photometric detection with a cationic dye, chrysoidine, was
   used to monitor non-chromophoric DL-AA. Among nine successfully
   recognized DL-AA, the D forms of Ser, Thr and Met migrated faster than
   the corresponding L forms. The strengths of interactions predicted from
   the order of migration of each enantiomer in CE were different from
   those in HPLC analysis. The different enantiomer recognition probably
   can be ascribed to the difference between CE in which the selector is
   not immobilized and HPLC in which the selector is immobilized by means
   of a spacer.}},

   the adsorption of the previously studied SMEP, that of SPU obeys the
   Frumkin equation with the 0 higher Gibbs energy of adsorption (-Delta

   an equimolar SPU + SMEP mixture (inhibitor IFKhAN-31), which is
   described by the Bockris equation. The cal- culations showed that -Delta

   displaced by an adsorbed inhibitor species from the metal-solution
   interface is n = 4. It was found that SMEP anions preadsorbed at
   oxidized iron do not affect the shape of the SPU adsorption isotherm,
   yet altering its constants. In the case of preadsorbed SPU, the SMEP
   adsorption isotherm changes its shape and cannot be described by any

   electrode in lower concentrations; i.e., PU anions stimulate the

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To report a case of recurrent heat-related illnesses
   associated with the use of benzhexol, chlorpromazine, and zuclopenthixol
   decanoate.
   CASE SUMMARY: During the summer of 2004, a 48-year-old man with a
   history of diabetes mellitus and schizophrenia was twice admitted to the
   hospital because of heat-related illnesses. On both occasions, he had
   been working under the sun in an open car park. His medications included
   benzhexol 2 mg twice daily, chlorpromazine 650 mg at bedtime, and
   zuclopenthixol decanoate intramuscular injection 600 mg every 4 weeks.
   In the first admission, the clinical diagnosis was heat stroke. He was
   discharged home on day 14, with precautionary advice against heat
   stroke. In the second admission, the clinical diagnosis was heat
   exhaustion. He was discharged home on day 4 and reminded of the
   precautions against heat stroke. An objective causality assessment
   revealed that the adverse event was possibly drug related in the first
   admission and probably drug related in the second admission.
   DISCUSSION: Several drugs can impair thermoregulation during exercise or
   under conditions of environmental heat stress. Anticholinergic drugs or
   drugs with anticholinergic effects can inhibit sweating and reduce heat
   elimination. Neuroleptics (anti psychotics), such as phenothiazines,
   have combined anticholinergic and central thermoregulatory effects. The
   set point of the temperature regulation center can be elevated by the
   antidopaminergic effect of antipsychotics, such as phenothiazines and
   thioxanthenes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Certain drugs may induce or worsen heat-related illnesses.
   During a heat wave, special attention should be given to those most at
   risk, and the importance of preventive measures should be emphasized.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: We report the results of a controlled survival study in a
   porcine model investigating Tisseel(R) or a combination of FloSeal(R)
   and Tisseel in dealing with vascular and collecting-system injury during
   partial nephrectomy.
   Materials and Methods: We performed an open right lower-pole partial
   nephrectomy on 15 large female pigs. The defect was repaired using
   standard open techniques (N = 5; controls), Tisseel only (N = 6; group
   I), or FloSeal followed by Tisseel (N = 4; group II). A Jackson-Pratt
   drain was placed. Nephrectomy and retrograde pyelography were performed
   at I week.
   Results: Operative times were shorter in both study groups, achieving
   statistical significance in group I (P 0.008). Warm-ischemia times were
   significantly improved in both study groups (P = 0.029 and P = 0.00005
   in groups I and II, respectively). Time to hemostasis was significantly
   shorter in group II only (P = 0.002) but approached significance in
   Group I as well (P = 0.09). Estimated blood loss was not significantly
   different from the controls in either group. When Tisseel was placed
   alone after hilar control, hematoma formation under the Tisseel was
   noted on release of the hilar clamp. After I week, there was one urinoma
   and three urine leaks in the control group. In group I, there was one
   urinoma and four urine leaks, and there was only one urine leak and no
   urinomas in group II. There were no hematomas in any of the groups.
   Conclusions: Tisseel alone is not adequate for either hemostasis or
   management of major collecting-system injury. FloSeal capped with
   Tisseel appears sufficient to control major vascular and
   collecting-system injuries without adjunctive surgical measures. A
   proposed technique for laparoscopic partial nephrectomy without
   reconstructive techniques is presented that warrants clinical study.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance sounding (MRS) is a non-invasive geophysical method
   that can be used to discriminate between the geophysical signals of pore
   water of the surrounding rock. This method is thus particularly
   attractive for hydrogeological applications.
   In order to investigate MRS for the benefit of applied hydrogeology, a
   comprehensive interdisciplinary study was carried out. The aim of this
   project was to develop an optimal methodology which could be easily
   adopted by hydrogeologists. This paper summarizes the main results
   obtained, with the objective of translating the MRS parameters into
   parameters that can be directly used by hydrogeologists.
   It was found that MRS is well adapted to the working scales of the
   hydrogeologist (i.e. field scale, well scale). It is able to provide
   significant information for the hydrogeologist, including:
   Reliable detection of the presence of water in the subsurface. This is
   the basic and most significant advantage of the method, which proved to
   be useful, particularly in and to semi-arid environments.
   Locating water-saturated formations (top and bottom), situated at depths
   between 0 and 100 in approximately.
   Estimation of the hydrodynamic parameters of detected aquifers:
   Through a rigorous inversion and calibration process, the MRS method
   enables the quantification of the specific yield (effective porosity) of
   aquifers and of the storage coefficient, the latter in unconfined
   aquifers only.
   In the present state-of-the-art, MRS is able to estimate the hydraulic
   conductivity (or transmissivity) of aquifers in localized favourable
   configurations, when calibration is available; otherwise, aquifers can
   be compared qualitatively.
   Thus the MRS method provides data that cannot be obtained with other
   non-invasive geophysical tools, and is already a valuable tool for
   applied hydrogeological projects.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual colonoscopy (VC), also known as CT colonography, is a
   noninvasive imaging method for the examination of the colon. The
   technique is easy, less labour-intensive than barium enema and
   conventional colonoscopy and is inherently safer since no adverse event
   or procedure-related complications have ever been reported. The success
   rate of VC is approximately 100\%, if bowel preparation and distension
   are optimal and no sedation is required. From the patient's perspective,
   the major advantages of VC include the very brief time required to
   perform the examination, the absence of contrast enemas and the
   potential for same-day colonoscopy when polyps are detected. To date
   several studies have reported sensitivity and specificity comparable
   with conventional colonoscopy in the detection of clinically significant
   polyps. However, the smaller the polyp size, the lower the sensitivity.
   The currently accepted clinical uses include the evaluation of patients
   who have undergone unsuccessful or incomplete conventional colonoscopy,
   patients with obstructing colorectal cancer, and those whose medical
   problems make them unsuitable for conventional colonoscopy. Current uses
   generally do not include the screening of asymptomatic persons, although
   recently published work has demonstrated no statistically significant
   differences between VC and conventional colonoscopy regardless of polyp
   size. A practical approach is to consider virtual colonoscopy `as a
   currently credible alternative screening method and as a reasonable
   alternative to the other colorectal cancer screening tests when a
   patient is unable or unwilling to undergo conventional colonoscopy'.}},

Abstract = {{Conflict management is crucial to the success of client-supplier
   collaborative new product development (NPD). This paper examines the
   critical success factors of conflict management in collaborative NPD.
   Using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), the importance of 4
   categories of success factors, namely relationship management, conflict
   handling system, new product development process management and
   communication, totally 13 factors, are prioritized. The results show
   that communication management, trust and commitment to the collaboration
   are the most important factors. Based on the factors identified, a
   hierarchy model of conflict management is proposed, with which clients
   and suppliers can formulate action plans for better conflict management.

Abstract = {{In contrast to the mechanisms of segmental and peristaltic contractions
   in the small intestine, not much is known about the mechanism of
   pendular contractions. High-resolution electrical and mechanical
   recordings were performed from isolated segments of the rabbit ileum
   during pendular contractions. The electrical activities were recorded
   with 32 extracellular electrodes while motility was assessed
   simultaneously by video tracking the displacements of 20-40 serosal
   markers. The electrical activities consisted of slow waves, followed by
   spikes, that propagated in either the aboral or oral direction. The
   mechanical activity always followed the initial electrical activity,
   describing a contraction phase in one direction followed by a relaxation
   phase in the opposite direction. Pendular displacements were always in
   rhythm with the slow wave, whereas the direction of the displacements
   was dictated by the origin of the slow wave. If the slow wave propagated
   aborally, then the pendular displacement occurred in the oral direction,
   whereas if the slow wave propagated in the oral direction, then the
   displacement occurred in the aboral direction. In the case of more
   complex propagation patterns, such as in the area of pacemaking or
   collision, direction of displacements remained always opposite to the
   direction of the slow wave. In summary, the direction and pattern of
   propagation of the slow wave determine the rhythm and the direction of
   the pendular motility. The well-known variability in pendular movements
   is caused by the variability in the propagation of the underlying slow
   wave.}},

   stoichiometry of the invasive green alga Codium isthmocladum in the
   wider Caribbean indicates nutrient enrichment}},
Journal = {{HARMFUL ALGAE}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Invasive blooms of the siphonaceous green algae Codium spp. have been
   considered a symptom of coastal eutrophication but, to date, only
   limited biochemical evidence supports a linkage to land-based nutrient
   pollution. Beginning in the summer of 1990, spectacular blooms of
   unattached Codium isthmocladum developed on deep coral reef habitats in
   southern Palm Beach County and northern Broward County, and in
   subsequent years, attached populations formed on reefs in northern Palm
   Beach County.
   To better understand the nutrition of these HABs, we collected C.
   isthmocladum and other reef macroalgae from various locations in
   southeast Florida as well as the wider Caribbean region for tissue C:N:P
   analysis in order to gauge variability in the type and degree of N-
   and/or P-limited growth. Widespread nutrient enrichment in floridian C.
   isthmocladum populations was evidenced by significantly higher tissue P
   (0.06\% versus 0.04\% of dry weight) and lower C:N (12 versus 19), C:P
   (425 versus 980), and N:P (35 versus 50) ratios compared to more
   nutrient-depleted Caribbean populations. To determine nutrient
   availability on southeast Florida's reefs, we sampled near-bottom waters
   at a variety of locations for DIN (=NH4+ + NO3- + NO2-) and SRP
   analysis. In general, concentrations of NH4+, NO3- and SRP were all high
   on southeast Florida's reefs compared to values reported for Caribbean
   coral reefs. Although summertime upwelling provides episodic NO3- and
   SRP enrichment to reefs in southeast Florida, these transient nutrient
   pulses have not historically supported C. isthmocladum blooms.
   We suggest that the widespread P enrichment of C. isthinocladum tissue
   and water column DIN:SRP ratios < 16:1 in southeast Florida drive this
   system toward N limitation where low level NH4+ enrichment becomes of
   paramount importance. Hence, the recent C isthmocladum blooms appear to
   be supported by increasing land-based nutrient pollution, particularly,
   sewage that is enriched in NH4+ and SRP at a low N:P ratio (< 10:1)
   critical to sustaining balanced growth during bloom formation. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{SRI has examined the organosolv (organic solvation) pulping of
   Australian bagasse using technology supplied by Ecopulp. In the process,
   bagasse is reacted with aqueous ethanol in a digester at elevated
   temperatures (between 150 degrees C and 200 degrees C). The products
   from the digester are separated using proprietary technology before
   further processing into a range of saleable products. Test trials were
   undertaken using two batch digesters; the first capable of pulping about
   25 g of wet depithed bagasse and the second, larger samples of about 1.5
   kg of wet depithed bagasse. From this study, the unbleached pulp
   produced from fresh bagasse did not have very good strength properties
   for the production of corrugated medium for cartons and bleached pulp.
   In particular, the lignin contents as indicated by the Kappa number for
   the unbleached pulps are high for making bleached pulp. However, in
   spite of the high lignin content, it is possible to bleach the pulp to
   acceptable levels of brightness up to 86.6\% ISO. The economics were
   assessed for three tier pricing (namely low, medium and high price). The
   economic return for a plant that produces 100 air dry t/d of brownstock
   pulp is satisfactory for both high and medium pricing levels of pricing.
   The outcomes from the project justify that work should continue through
   to either pilot plant or upgraded laboratory facility.}},

Abstract = {{UV LIGA involves the exposure of SU-8 negative resist, using a UV mask
   aligner, to produce high aspect ratio pillars or microchannels as part

   possible by the widespread use of a UV sensitive resist SU-8. Many
   papers have been written on the Fresnel diffraction theory of exposure,
   some key properties of SU-8 and prototype applications, but little
   attention has been paid to the variation in parameters that affect the
   tolerances and hence the reproducibility with which component dimensions
   can be maintained. It will be shown that the accuracy and precision,
   with which a feature on a mask can be reproduced throughout a thick
   resist structure, will depend on key parameters in the set-up of the
   mask aligner, the material properties of the SU-8 resist and the
   thickness of the resist structure. A simplified optical exposure model
   is used to predict the dimensions and wall taper angles of resist
   pillars or microchannels and their variation with changes in these

Abstract = {{This is a noncommutative-geometric study of the semiclassical dynamics
   of finite topological D-brane systems. Starting from the formulation in
   terms of A(infinity) categories, I show that such systems can be
   described by the noncommutative symplectic supergeometry of Z(2)-graded
   quivers, and give a synthetic formulation of the boundary part of the
   generalized WDVV equations. In particular, a faithful generating
   function for integrated correlators on the disk can be constructed as a
   linear combination of quiver necklaces, i.e. a function on the
   noncommutative symplectic superspace defined by the quiver's path
   algebra. This point of view allows one to construct extended moduli
   spaces of topological D-brane systems as non-commutative algebraic
   `superschemes'. They arise by imposing further relations on a
   Z(2)-graded version of the quiver's preprojective algebra, and passing
   to the subalgebra preserved by a natural group of symmetries.}},

   functional calculations are used to study the effect of interface

   solution for this oxide-oxide interface structure. Comparisons of
   experimental HRTEM images with calculated through-focus and

   metal-oxygen-metal (i.e., Mg - O - Fe) interface bonding with octahedral
   (B) coordination of the first Fe monolayer, rather than the combination
   of tetrahedral-octahedral-tetrahedral (ABA) stacking also found in
   Fe3O4. First-principles calculations for all the different models find
   metal-induced gap states in the interface oxygen layer. Consistent with
   the HRTEM results, the MgO-Fe3O4 interface stacking
   (...),4Mg/4O/4Mg/4O/3Fe(B)/4O/FeAFeBFeA,(...), is calculated to be the
   energetically most favorable, and effectively screening the MgO(111)

Abstract = {{Background: Multiplex abdominal aortic aneurysm families (MAAAFs) (>= 1
   subject Plus the proband) represent 1\% to 34\% of abdominal aortic
   aneurysm (AAA), but the percentage in France is unknown.
   Method: The MAAAF rate was retrospectively defined by analysis of 3
   groups: 72 of 104 consecutive individuals undergoing AAA surgery during
   1994, 24 of 53 women and 35 of 76 men with giant ( >= 9 cm) AAA operated
   on during 1986 to 1994. MAAAF characteristics were determined based on
   10 families issued from these 3 groups and 34 others identified

   probands and relatives, detailed pedigrees of each family, and computed
   tomography (CT) scans without contrast medium of the aorta and lower
   limb arteries for first-degree relatives >= 40-ycar-of age.
   Results: The MAAAF rate was 4.2\% for the consecutive-surgery patients

   detected no additional AAA among them (screened individuals M/F ratio,

   for the women's and gjant-AAA groups with CT screening, respectively.
   Characteristics were investigated in 104 affected subjects from 44
   MAAAFs: female relatives were more often affected than probands (P <
   0.025). Compared with men, affected female relatives were significantly
   older at diagnosis and surgery (P < 0.05 and P < 0.02, respectively), as
   were affected women (P < 0.02 and P < 0.01, respectively). CT scan
   screening identified significantly more AAA and abdominal aortic
   dilatations among the 44 MAAAFs than the consecutive-surgery group (5
   and 4, respectively; P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Although the MAAAF rate seems low in France, women from
   MAAAF were affected more often and later, suggesting that they should be
   screened.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate quantum metastability of a particle
   trapped ill between an infinite wall and a square barrier, with either a
   time-periodically oscillating barrier (Model A) or bottom of the well
   (Model B). Based on the Floquet theory, we derive in each case an
   equation which determines the stability of the metastable system. We
   study the influence on the stability of two Floquet states when their
   Floquet energies (real part) encounter a direct or an avoided crossing
   at resonance. The effect of the amplitude of oscillation on the nature
   of crossing of Floquet energies is also discussed. It is found that by
   adiabatically changing the frequency and amplitude of the oscillation
   field, one can manipulate the stability of states in the well. By means
   of a discrete transform, the two models are shown to have exactly the
   same Floquet energy spectrum at the same oscillating amplitude and
   frequency. The equivalence of the models is also demonstrated by means
   of the principle of gauge invariance. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The application of genetic male sterility in hybrid rice production has
   great potential to revolutionize hybrid seed production methodology. The
   two-line breeding system by using thermo-sensitive genic male sterility
   (TGMS) has been discovered and successfully developed as a breeding
   strategy in rice. One TGMS gene was investigated by a spontaneous rice
   mutant line, Sokcho-MS, originated from a Korean japonica variety. It
   was shown that Sokcho-MS is completely sterile at a temperature higher
   than 27 degrees C and/or lower than 25 degrees C during the development
   of spikelets, but fertile at the temperature ranging from 25 to 27
   degrees C regardless of the levels of day-length. Genetic analysis and
   molecular mapping based on SSR, STS and EST markers revealed that a
   single recessive gene locus involved the control of genic male sterility
   in Sokcho-MS. By using an F-2 mapping population derived from a cross
   between Sokcho-MS and a fertile indica variety Neda, the new TGMS gene,
   designated as tms6, was mapped primarily to the long arm of chromosome 5
   of Oryza sativa at the interval between markers E60663 (2.0 cM) and
   RM440 (5.8 cM). Subsequently, tms6 was fine mapped to the interval
   between markers RM3351 (0.1 cM) and E60663 (1.9 cM). As tms6 appeared to
   be independent of other mapped TGMS genes in rice, the genetic basis of
   Sokcho-MS was further discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a simple and effective lift-off method which relies
   upon a single layer of positive photoresist and the insertion of a
   diffuser in the conventional lithography. The inserted diffuser
   randomizes the paths of incident ultraviolet light, which creates the
   re-entrant photoresist profile necessary for proper metal lift-off. This
   method was applied to photoresists, with different thicknesses from 1.3
   mu m to 10 mu m, showing a uniform undercut of 0.3 mu m to 2.0 mu m,
   depending upon the photoresist thickness. The gold lift-off test was
   performed to show the suitability of the photoresist profile generated
   by the proposed method. We could obtain very neat gold sidewall patterns
   after evaporation onto the fabricated photoresist pattern. The
   simplicity and versatility of the proposed method will provide wider
   options for meeting the strong demands for a simple and effective

Abstract = {{A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed to investigate
   the natural ventilation of greenhouses. Before investigating its
   accuracy, a wind tunnel and particle image velocimetry (PIV) test was
   initially conducted to find the best experimental conditions and improve
   the PIV accuracy. After many trials of the PIV tests, good results were
   obtained in the PIV accuracy test, and the errors were shown to be
   mostly in the +/- 2.1\% range, with a maximum of 5.4\%. A single-span,
   wide-span greenhouse, one of the most popular types of multi.-span
   greenhouses in Korea, was used to get qualitative and quantitative
   airflow distribution in the greenhouse using PIV and CFD. To improve the
   CFD accuracy, the PIV- and CFD-computed airflows in the greenhouse were
   compared, particularly on the distribution, local air velocity, and
   turbulent intensity in the greenhouse. The quality of the mesh density
   and the design of the boundary condition, especially that of the wind
   velocity and turbulence profiles, were found to be very important for
   getting accurate results. Assuming the PIV results were accurate, the
   most accurate CFD results were obtained when using renormalization-group
   (RNG) k-epsilon and Reynolds stress turbulence numerical models. The
   errors of the CFD-computed air velocity when using the RNG k-epsilon and
   Reynolds stress models were -7.9\% and -7.6\%, respectively. However,
   the average errors of turbulent intensity when the RNG k-epsilon and
   Reynolds stress turbulence numerical models were used were -37.5\% and

Abstract = {{The transient receptor potential type V5 channel (TRPV5) is a
   Ca2+-selective TRP channel important for epithelial Ca2+ transport.
   Intracellular Mg2+ causes a fast voltage-dependent block of the TRPV5
   channel by binding to the selectivity filter. Here, we report that
   intracellular Mg2+ binding to the selectivity filter of TRPV5 also
   causes a slower reversible conformational change leading to channel
   closure. We further report that PIP2 activates TRPV5. Activation of
   TRPV5 by PIP2 is independent of Mg2+. Yet, PIP2 decreases sensitivity of
   the channel to the Mg2+ induced slow inhibition. Mutation of
   aspartate-542, a critical Mg2+-binding site in the selectivity filter,
   abolishes Mg2+-induced slow inhibition. PIP2 has no effects on
   Mg2+-induced voltage-dependent block. Thus, PIP2 prevents the
   Mg2+-induced conformational change without affecting Mg2+ binding to the
   selectivity filter. Hydrolysis of PIP2 via receptor activation of
   phospholipase C sensitizes TRPV5 to the Mg2+-induced slow inhibition.
   These results provide a novel mechanism for regulation of TRP channels
   by phospholipase C-activating hormones via alteration of the sensitivity
   to intracellular Mg2+.}},

Abstract = {{We study the metric properties of finite subsets of L-1. The analysis of
   such metrics is central to a number of important algorithmic problems
   involving the cut structure of weighted graphs, including the Sparsest
   Cut Problem, one of the most compelling open problems in the field of
   approximation algorithms. Additionally, many open questions in geometric
   non-linear functional analysis involve the properties of finite subsets
   of L-1.
   We present some new observations concerning the relation of L-1 to
   dimension, topology, and Euclidean distortion. We show that every
   n-point subset of L-1 embeds into L-2 with average distortion O(root
   logn), yielding the first evidence that the conjectured worst-case bound
   of O(root logn) is valid. We also address the issue of dimension
   reduction in L-P for p is an element of (1, 2). We resolve a question
   left open by M. Charikar and A. Sahai {[}Dimension reduction in the l(1)
   norm, in: Proceedings of the 43rd Annual IEEE Conference on Foundations
   of Computer Science, ACM, 2002, pp. 251-260] concerning the
   impossibility of dimension reduction with a linear map in the above
   cases, and we show that a natural variant of the recent example of
   Brinkman and Charikar {[}On the impossibility of dimension reduction in
   l(1), in: Proceedings of the 44th Annual IEEE Conference on Foundations
   of Computer Science, ACM, 2003, pp. 514-523], cannot be used to prove a
   lower bound for the non-linear case. This is accomplished by exhibiting
   constant-distortion embeddings of snowflaked planar metrics into
   Euclidean space. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   literature. By contrast, the steady state behavior is well understood
   and has been simulated by many researchers, as has the transient
   behavior with no crystallization on the spinline. In this study, this
   particular issue has been investigated in the low-speed spinning case
   where no necklike deformation occurs on the spinline, incorporating
   flow-induced crystallization into the mathematical model of the system
   and then devising proper numerical schemes to produce temporal pictures
   of fiber spinning process. It turns out that the difficulty in obtaining
   transient solution for fiber spinning when it is accompanied by
   flow-induced crystallization lies in the extreme sensitivity of the
   spinline velocity toward the fluid stress level. This parameter plays a
   key role in finding the spinneret stress level for the numerical
   marching scheme employed in obtaining the solutions of the governing
   equations. This is in sharp contrast to the case of no crystallization
   on the spinline where the profiles of spinline variables are almost
   insensitive to the spinneret stress level, thus allowing previous
   researchers to obtain transient solutions with little difficulty. In
   addition to the successful transient solutions of fiber spinning
   dynamics with flow-induced crystallization reported in the present
   study, it is also shown that the destabilizing effect of flow-induced
   crystallization in low speed spinning process is confirmed by a linear
   stability analysis. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   (DA-8159), a new erectogenic, and nitroglycerin has been evaluated in
   rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received DA-8159 (30 mg kg(-1)) as a
   single intravenous or oral dose with the simultaneous single intravenous
   administration of nitroglycerin (2.5 mg kg(-1)). After simultaneous
   intravenous administration, the total area under the plasma
   concentration-time curve from time zero to time infinity (AUC(inf)) of
   DA-8159 (746 vs 457 mu g min mL(-1)) was found to be significantly
   greater than with DA-8159 alone. Also, after simultaneous intravenous
   administration total body clearance (CL) (40.2 vs 65.6 mL min(-1)
   kg(-1)), renal clearance (CLR) (1.65 vs 5.11 mL min(-1) kg(-1)), and
   nonrenal clearance (CLNR) (38.3 vs 60.2 mL min(-1) kg(-1)) of DA-8159
   were significantly slower compared with DA-8159 alone. The slower CLNR
   of DA-8159 could have been due to the inhibition of the metabolism of
   DA-8159 by nitroglycerin, since DA-8159 is metabolized via CYP3A1/2 in
   rats and nitroglycerin inhibits CYP3A1/2 in rats. The slower CLR of
   DA-8159 could have been due to the urine flow rate-dependent CLR of
   DA-8159 in rats. After the simultaneous intravenous administration of
   nitroglycerin and DA-8159, the AUC(inf) of nitroglycerin was
   significantly smaller (635 vs 960 mu g min mL(-1)), which could have
   been due to the cardiac output-de pendent CL of nitroglycerin. However,
   after the oral administration of DA-8159, the pharmacokinetic parameters
   of DA-8159 with and without the intravenous administration of
   nitroglycerin became comparable. This was not due to the decrease in
   nitroglycerin's gastrointestinal absorption of DA-8159, but could have
   been due to changes in nitroglycerin's intestinal first-pass effect of
   DA-8159. Human studies are required to determine the administration time
   of DA-8159 when nitroglycerin is concomitantly taken.}},

Abstract = {{Density of moles is a strong predictor of malignant melanoma, therefore,
   enumeration of moles is often an integral part of many studies that look
   at malignant melanoma. An automatic method of segmenting and counting
   moles would help standardize studies, compared with manual counting. We
   have developed an unsupervised algorithm for segmenting and counting
   moles from two-dimensional color images of the back torso region, as
   part of a study to evaluate the effectiveness of sunscreen. The method
   consists of a new variant of mean shift filtering that forms clusters in
   the image and removes noise, a region growing procedure to select
   candidates, and a rule-based classifier to identify moles. When this
   algorithm was compared to an assessment by an expert dermatologist, the
   algorithm showed a sensitivity rate of 91\% and diagnostic accuracy of
   90\% on the test set, for moles larger than 1.5 mm in diameter.}},

Abstract = {{Infectious complications are still a major cause of morbidity and
   mortality in pediatric patients undergoing therapy for malignancy.
   Therapy-induced neutropenia is the most important risk factor for
   infectious risk in pediatric patients with cancer, but other factors,
   such as alterations in skin/mucosal barriers, and defects in
   cell-mediated or humoral immunity also contribute to the risk for
   infection. In most centers, about two thirds of bacteremic isolates are
   gram-positive pathogens, whereas gramnegative organisms are isolated
   less frequently, but are associated with considerably higher mortality
   rates. Prolonged neutropenia increases the risk for invasive fungal
   infection. in most cases, fever is an important and early indication of
   serious infection, particularly in children with neutropenia.
   Discrimination between serious and inconsequential infection in febrile
   children with neutropenia at the time of presentation is difficult, and
   serum markers have not been proven to reliably indicate infection.
   Although several groups investigate risk categories based on clinical
   tests or the genetic background, the current paradigm is to treat all
   pediatric patients with neutropenia and fever with intravenous
   broad-spectrum antibiotics. It is hoped that the identification of one
   or more predictive factors may be useful for tailoring antibiotic
   prophylaxis and therapy in children with cancer.}},

   invaded all 4 cell lines at greater levels. The results here support the
   Conclusion that both T. gondii and N. caninum, have the ability to

Abstract = {{Introduction: Diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and
   differentiation between Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)
   can be difficult in children. Several previous studies suggest that
   esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and biopsies are important in the
   initial investigation of children with suspected IBD. The aim of the
   present paper was to assess the importance of EGD in the initial
   diagnostic appraisal of children with suspected IBD.
   Methods: Children diagnosed with IBD over a 4-year period were
   identified from a dedicated IBD database. Retrospective chart review
   documented presenting signs and symptoms, endoscopic features in the
   upper and lower gastrointestinal tract and histological findings on
   mucosal biopsies.
   Results: Eighty-six children were diagnosed with IBD of whom 61 (70.9\%)
   had CD, 13 (21.3\%) UC, and the remainder, indeterminate colitis.
   Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed in 76 (88.4\%). Nine children
   were diagnosed with IBD solely on the basis of information obtained
   following EGD. None of these children had colitis and all had abnormal
   histological findings on review of mucosal biopsies from the upper
   gastrointestinal tract. Thirteen (23.6\%) of 55 children with CD had
   granulomas noted within biopsies obtained during EGD and another 20 had
   significant inflammatory changes on histological examination of upper
   gastrointestinal tract biopsies. Crohn's disease was diagnosed in 25 of
   38 children with pan-colitis. Thirteen children were correctly
   classified as having CD only following assessment of their upper
   gastrointestinal tract. This included the presence of upper gut
   granulomata in eight children.
   Conclusion: The performance of EGD in these children with IBD provided
   additional diagnostic yield and guided the differentiation of disease
   type in many patients. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is an essential
   component in the initial diagnostic assessment of children with possible
   CD or UC. (C) 2005 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.}},

   suitability of the kNN-method is examined. This method is based on the
   similarity of the present event with reference events, which can be
   estimated. First the k-nearest neighbours are determined and afterwards
   the specified estimate will be computed from their collected values of
   the goal variable for example by averaging.
   The kNN method has already been applied several times in forest science,
   e.g. to forecast the current forest fire risk (FELBER, 2005) or for
   forest stand density estimations (FRANCO-LOPEZ et al., 2001). Encouraged
   by these positive results we investigated the suitability of the kNN
   method to predict wood harvesting productivity using several case
   studies (Fig. 4).
   The results of our investigations show that the kNN method with k values
   between 12 and 17 is competitive to traditional statistical regression
   models. However, a systematic deviation between the models exist,
   especially in boundary regions. In comparison to parametric models the
   kNN-model exhibits special strengths.
   The kNN database can additional accommodate other existing models. When
   the database is constantly updated, the forecasts are operationally
   up-to-date.
   Different combinations of input parameters can be tested directly by the
   user. Furthermore it is possible to use data sets which are not
   complete. The method allows the estimation of several goal variables
   e.g. different factors of production (employees, machines, etc.) at the
   same time.
   The visualization of the k-nearest neighbours facilitates the estimation
   of the trustworthiness of the forecast. In case of doubt the data
   records of the nearest neighbours can be verified more precisely.
   Criteria which are not considered by the forecast thereby can include
   valuable additional information needed to interpret the results.
   Simplicity, topicality and transparency of the kNN method enable a good
   service achievement and an increasing customer satisfaction can be
   expected.
   The processing of the kNN method needs substantial computing power for
   large data sets and decreases the model performance when looking for the
   optimal number of nearest neighbours. Considering the minor amount of
   datasets in the field of wood harvesting currently no negative effects
   are expected.
   With the presence of data gaps the lack of inter- and extrapolation
   ability is a disadvantage of the method. Contrary to the parametric
   models `plausible' impact relationships cannot be created with the kNN
   model. These problems for productivity models are less important in
   comparison to growth modelling.
   After our initial investigations we believe the kNN method is suitable
   for the estimation of productivity in harvesting. For a final
   determination of the advantages and disadvantages of the method,
   however, further and more detailed investigations are necessary.
   The section forest use management of the WSL will continue the work with
   the kNN model for the purpose of the productivity estimation. In
   particular the development of a software component and the possibilities
   of an efficient data procurement will be examined.}},

Abstract = {{Electrospray (ES) mass spectrometry data is presented showing that
   agonist binding to the nuclear receptor (NR), retinoid X receptor alpha
   (RXR alpha), is competitive. The competitive nature of agonist binding
   can be used to discriminate between the specific and non-specific
   binding of small lipophilic molecules to NRs. Further, data is presented
   which show that high-affinity ligand binding to the RXR alpha
   ligand-binding domain (LBD) stabilises the domain homodimer. The results
   indicate that homodimerisation, a functional property of the receptor
   associated with the binding of agonist ligands, could be used to
   discriminate between specific and non-specific binding events.
   Additionally, we report on the remarkable stability of the gas-phase
   complex between the RXR alpha LBD protein and endogenous bile acids.
   Protein-bile acid interactions in the gas phase were found to be
   surprisingly strong, withstanding `in-source' fragmentation in the ES
   interface, and, in the case of taurocholic acid (TCA) and lithocholic
   acid-3-sulphate (LCA-3-sulphate), collision-induced dissociation within
   the collision cell of a tandem mass spectrometer. Bile acids were found
   to be inactive towards RXR alpha in transfection assays, and have not
   been reported to be ligands for the RXR alpha, although lithocholic acid
   (LCA) has been found to be a competitor in the photoaffinity labelling
   of RXR beta with 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA). The observation of
   strong RXR alpha-bile acid non-covalent complexes in ES mass
   spectrometry highlight the danger of extrapolating gas-phase binding
   data to the solution phase and further to a possible biological
   activity, particularly when surface-active compounds such as bile acids
   are involved. The introduction of a competitive ligand-binding
   experiment can alleviate this problem and allow the differentiation
   between specific and non-specific binding. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Marcgraviaceae are a rather small family of seven
   genera and approx. 130 neotropical species. This study aims to present a
   detailed palynological survey of the family in order to comment on the
   intrafamily relationships and possible correlations with pollinators.
   Methods In total, 119 specimens representing 67 species and all genera
   are observed using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy.
   Furthermore, eight species from five genera are studied with
   transmission electron microscopy.
   Key Results Our results show that pollen grains of Marcgraviaceae are
   small (20-35 mu m), have three equatorial apertures, granules on the
   colpus membrane, oblate spheroidal to prolate spheroidal shapes, mainly
   psilate to perforate ornamentations, and lalongate colpus-shaped
   thinnings at the inner layer of the exine, and show the presence of
   orbicules. Based on our fragmentary knowledge of the pollination biology
   of the family, there are no clear correlations between pollinators and
   pollen features.
   Conclusions The genus Marcgravia has a high percentage of reticulate
   sexine patterns and a relatively thin nexine. Sarcopera can be defined
   by the presence of an oblate spheroidal to even suboblate shape, while
   Ruyschia and Souroubea typically show prolate spheroidal to subprolate
   pollen grains. The presence of a thick foot layer in the pollen wall is
   characteristic of the genera Norantea, Sarcopera and Schwartzia. Pollen
   features that are taxonomically useful within the family are the shape,
   sexine sculpturing, and ultrastructure of the pollen wall.}},

Abstract = {{We show the first results from a newly-operation advanced x-ray stepper.
   and describe an improved type of x-ray mask for use on it. The Mod 5C is
   the newest x-ray stepper developed by JMAR (JSAL Nanolithography). It is
   configured for installation at the Center For NanoTechnology (CNTech) on
   a synchrotron radiation port of the Aladdin storage ring. The alignment
   system is based on a new IBBI detection system with demonstrated
   subnanometer resolution. For this system, three microscopes are used for
   detecting the misalignment between wafer and mask marks with the error
   signal fed back in the mask positioning stage with the mask locked to
   the wafer stage through the use of a high-resolution laser
   interferometer. Both field-by-field and global alignment techniques are
   possible, and multiple wafer sizes can be used with a NIST formal mask
   held in a kinematic mount, with a gap setting capable of adjustment
   between 2 and 50 microns. A novel beam scanning system was installed to
   deliver a uniform exposure over a field of 35 X 35 mm(2) field. The high
   power from the storage ring allows exposure times in chemically
   amplified resists of 5 - 10 s for the CNTech-designed beamline; shorter
   exposure times could be achieved with it refocusing beamline, and the
   stepper can be configured for an x-ray point source, To achieve sub-35
   nm resolution requires very small gaps. A new type of mask had to be
   developed, oil the basis of the mesa mask originally developed at MIT. A
   very high flatness is required to maintain a parallel mask-wafer
   exposure environment. Currently, for low cost and easy manufacturing, we
   employ gold-plated absorber masks with a silicon nitride membrane. From
   the initial exposures, the resolution achieved is below 50 nm with
   exposure conditions described. The issues of the resolution of the
   exposure tool are addressed and compared to the outcomes from detailed
   modeling, (c) 200.5 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{SigrafW is Windows-compatible software developed using the Microsoft (R)
   Visual Basic Studio program that uses the simplified Hill equation for
   fitting kinetic data from allosteric and Michaelian enzymes. SigrafW
   uses a modified Fibonacci search to calculate maximal velocity (V), the
   Hill coefficient (n), and the enzyme-substrate apparent dissociation
   constant (K). The estimation of V, K, and the sum of the squares of
   residuals is performed using a Wilkinson nonlinear regression at any
   Hill coefficient (n). In contrast to many currently available kinetic
   analysis programs, SigrafW shows several advantages for the
   determination of kinetic parameters of both hyperbolic and nonhyperbolic
   saturation curves. No initial estimates of the kinetic parameters are
   required, a measure of the goodness-of-the-fit for each calculation
   performed is provided, the nonlinear regression used for calculations
   eliminates the statistical bias inherent in linear transformations, and
   the software can be used for enzyme kinetic simulations either for
   educational or research purposes.}},

Abstract = {{The difficulty of obtaining significant long-term patency and good wall
   mechanical strength in vivo has been a significant obstacle in achieving
   small-diameter vascular prostheses. The aim of the present study was to
   develop a prosthetic graft that could perform as a small-diameter
   vascular conduit. Tubular structures of hyaluronan (HYAFF-11 tubules, 2
   mm diameter, 1 cm length) were grafted in the abdominal aorta of 30 rats
   as temporary absorbable guides to promote regeneration of vascular
   structures. Performance was assessed by histology, immunohistochemistry,
   and ultra-structural analysis. These experiments resulted in three novel
   findings: 1) complete endothelialization of the tube's luminal surface
   occurred; 2) sequential regeneration of vascular components led to
   complete vascular wall regeneration 15 days after surgery; and 3) the
   biomaterial used created the ideal environment for the delicate
   regeneration process during the critical initial phases, yet its
   biodegradability allowed for complete degradation of the construct four
   months after implantation, at which time, a new artery remained to
   connect the artery stumps. This study assesses the feasibility to create
   a completely biodegradable vascular regeneration guide in vivo, able to
   sequentially orchestrate vascular regeneration events needed for very

Abstract = {{Body image disturbance has been one of the most widely studied areas in
   the literature on eating disorders. Some of the tasks designed to assess
   it have been used to estimate the sizes of specific parts of the body,
   whereas others have served to make estimations of overall body size. In
   recent years, the introduction of innovative computing procedures has
   allowed the two approaches to be combined and has made their application
   more straightforward. The program we describe here (Body Image
   Assessment Software, or BIAS) evaluates body image distortions and body
   dissatisfaction via the on-screen presentation of a scale image, the
   different components of which can be modified by the patient The program
   was developed using Microsoft Access 2000 and Visual Basic for
   applications. It can be run on any computer with Windows and Microsoft
   Access 2000 or Microsoft Access 2000 RunTime, which makes it
   particularly easy to use and enables direct analysis of the recorded
   data through the use of applications such as SPSS.}},

Abstract = {{A single-blind randomized study was conducted on young (18-21 years, n =
   16) and mature (25-35 years, n = 16) drivers to assess how age, combined
   with a modest dose of alcohol (0.7 g/kg for males and 0.6 g/kg for
   females), influenced performance on a driving simulator. The driving
   tasks included detecting the presence of a vehicle on the horizon as
   quickly as possible, estimating the point on the road that an
   approaching vehicle would have passed by the participants' vehicle
   (time-to-collision) and overtaking another vehicle against a steady
   stream of oncoming traffic. The results of the vehicle detection task
   showed that detection times were significantly slower with maturity,
   alcohol consumption and lower approaching vehicle speeds (50kph),
   particularly on curved sections of road. Approaching vehicle speed was
   also found to significantly influence time-to-collision (TTC) judgments,
   such that faster approach speeds led to less underestimated (and
   therefore riskier) judgments of TTC than slower speeds. In the
   overtaking task, mature participants demonstrated impaired
   discrimination skills with varying approaching vehicle speeds, while
   young participants recorded significantly slower speeds while overtaking
   a vehicle, thus increasing the time that they spent in the opposing
   lane. In conclusion, young and mature drivers demonstrated pivotal
   differences in behavior in this study. Young drivers showed a greater
   tendency to engage in risky driving, while experienced drivers appeared
   to be more susceptible to perceptual influences. Overall, alcohol
   consumption impaired a driver's ability to divide attention, but had
   little effect on decision-making processes. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

   Information System (HEDIS (R)-Medicaid 3.0) and the goals and objectives
   of Healthy People 2010, to calculate allowable Medicaid reimbursement
   for comprehensive prevention services, and to describe patient
   expectations for prevention counseling. We obtained a convenience sample
   of all ages (under 17 years = 514, 18 years or older = 473), both sexes
   (male = 393, female = 594), and three racial/ethnic groups: African
   American = 687, White =173, Hispanic = 88 in a clinic that predominantly
   served Medicaid-insured patients. Participants 18 years of age and older
   were interviewed about expectations for preventive counseling. According
   to procedures rated A or B by the second United States Preventive
   Services Task Force (USPSTF), these patients had 11,504 service needs.
   Performance indicators from HEDIS-Medicaid 3.0 would have covered 2,571
   (22\%) while the goals and objectives of Healthy People 2010 would have
   covered 11,43 7 (99\%). Allowable Medicaid reimbursement estimates for
   100\% coverage averaged \$206.13 per person. A majority of patients in
   all race-sex groups expected counseling at least once per year. The
   results show that a focus on HEDIS-Medicaid 3.0 quality indicators in
   these patients would have been inconsistent with the goals and
   objectives of Healthy People 2010, that it would have promoted patient
   mistrust by failing to meet patient expectations, and that payment for
   100\% coverage of A and B USPFTF recommended preventive services at
   Medicaid rates would have constituted a small fraction of per capita
   yearly U.S. health care expenditures.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine whether induction of
   tachyphylaxis to peroxynitrite (induced by giving 10 intravenous
   injections of a 10-mu mol/kg dose) differentially affects the
   vasodilator responses elicited by systemic injections of the L- and
   D-isomers of S-nitrosocysteine (L-SNC and D-SNC), in
   pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. L- and D-SNC (12.5-200 nmol/kg, iv)
   elicited dose-dependent reductions in hindquarter, mesenteric, and renal
   vascular resistances. The L-SNC-induced vasodilator responses in the
   hindquarter and renal vascular beds were virtually abolished whereas the
   vasodilator responses in mesenteric bed were markedly diminished after
   administration of peroxynitrite. The D-SNC-induced vasodilator responses
   in the hindquarter and renal beds were slightly attenuated whereas the
   vasodilator responses in the mesenteric bed were not diminished after
   administration of peroxynitrite. The vasodilator responses elicited by
   the nitric oxide donor, MAHMA NONOate (5-50 nmol/kg, iv), were not
   attenuated by peroxynitrite. The finding that induction of tachyphylaxis
   to peroxynitrite diminishes the effects Of L- and D-SNC but not MAHMA
   NONOate suggests that the stereoisomers exert their vasodilator effects
   by mechanisms other than their decomposition to nitric oxide. Moreover,
   the finding that induction of tachyphylaxis to peroxynitrite causes a
   more pronounced attenuation of the vasodilator effects of L- than D-SNC
   Supports evidence that the stereoisomers differentially interact with
   stereo-selective S-nitrosothiol recognition sites in the vasculature.
   Taken together, these novel results support the possibility that
   peroxynitrite diminishes the vasodilator potencies of L- and D-SNC by
   oxidation and/or nitration of amino acids in these recognition sites.}},

Abstract = {{This paper motivates and describes a novel realization of transductive
   inference that can address the Open Set face recognition task. Open Set
   operates under the assumption that not all the test probes have mates in
   the gallery. It either detects the presence of some biometric signature
   within the gallery and finds its identity or rejects it, i.e., it
   provides for the ``none of the above{''} answer. The main contribution
   of the paper is Open Set TCM-kNN (Transduction Confidence Machine-k
   Nearest Neighbors), which is suitable for multiclass authentication
   operational scenarios that have to include a rejection option for
   classes never enrolled in the gallery. Open Set TCM-kNN, driven by the
   relation between transduction and Kolmogorov complexity, provides a
   local estimation of the likelihood ratio needed for detection tasks. We
   provide extensive experimental data to show the feasibility, robustness,
   and comparative advantages of Open Set TCM-kNN on Open Set
   identification and watch list (surveillance) tasks using challenging
   FERET data. Last, we analyze the error structure driven by the fact that
   most of the errors in identification are due to a relatively small
   number of face patterns. Open Set TCM-kNN is shown to be suitable for
   PSEI (pattern specific error inhomogeneities) error analysis in order to
   identify difficult to recognize faces. PSEI analysis improves biometric
   performance by removing a small number of those difficult to recognize
   faces responsible for much of the original error in performance and/ or
   by using data fusion.}},

Abstract = {{Ischemic brain injury is acute local inflammation, leading to
   accumulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Cytokines influence the
   recruitment of leucocytes and play a key role in the inflammatory injury
   processes. Recently, a number of studies have demonstrated a close
   relationship between brain ischemia. and cytokines. Interleukin-17
   (IL-17) is a newly identified T-cell-specific cytokine. In this study,
   we evaluated the source and the action of IL-17 over the course of
   cerebral ischemia in rats (Sprague-Dawley) and humans. The levels of
   IL-17 in the ischemic hemisphere of the human brain, which was removed
   at necropsy, were assayed immunohistochemically. In rats, permanent
   middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) was obtained by inserting nylon
   monofilament into the right external carotid artery, occluding the right
   middle cerebral artery. The expression of IL-17 mRNA in rat was assayed
   using oligoprobe in situ hybridization. IL-17 production by neuroglial
   cells was assayed by double-staining using antibody glial fibrillary
   acidic protein (GFAP) and antibody IL-17. Levels of IL-17 were elevated
   in the ischemic hemispheres of human brain compared with the opposite
   normal hemispheres and peaked at days 3-5 after brain ischemia. The
   IL-17-positive cells were found in the ischemic lesion region. IL-17
   mRNA was also elevated in ischemic hemispheres of pMCAO-operated rats,
   which were slightly elevated after 1 h and peaked at 6 days. IL-17 and
   GFAP double-stained were extensive in rat ischemic hemisphere. The
   ischemia-induced IL-17 expression in human brain reported here for the
   first time was very similar to that in rat model except that the peak
   was slightly earlier. We found for the first time that IL-17 was
   involved in an intense inflammatory reaction of brain ischemic injury in
   human. In pMCAO-operated rats, our findings suggest that IL-17 is
   produced by the neuroglial cells in the brain region undergoing ischemic
   insult. We suggest that in additional to T cells the neuroglial cell may
   be another cellular origin of IL-17 in later progression of brain
   ischemia.}},

Abstract = {{The temperature shift over the eastern flank of the Tibetan Plateau is
   examined using the last 50 yr of Chinese surface station observations.
   It was found that a strong cooling shift occurs in early spring ( March
   and April) and late summer ( July, August, and September) in contrast to
   the warming shift in other seasons. The cause of the March-April ( MA)
   cooling is investigated in this study.
   The MA cooling shift on the lee side of the Tibetan Plateau is found to
   be not a local phenomenon, but rather it is associated with an eastward
   extension of a cooling signal originating from North Africa that is
   related to the North Atlantic Oscillation ( NAO) in the previous winter.
   The midtropospheric westerlies over the North Atlantic and North Africa
   tend to intensify during positive NAO phases. The enhanced westerlies,
   after passing over the Tibetan Plateau, result in strengthened ascending
   motion against the lee side of the plateau, which favors the formation
   of midlevel stratiform clouds. The increased amount of stratus clouds
   induces a negative net cloud - radiative forcing, which thereby cools
   the surface air and triggers a positive cloud - temperature feedback. In
   this way, the cooling signal from the upstream could ``jump{''} over the
   Tibetan Plateau and leave a footprint on its lee side. The continental
   stratiform cloud - climate feedback plays a significant role in the
   amplification of the cooling shift downstream of the Tibetan Plateau.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Stress-enhanced platelet (PLT) storage lesions include
   increased glycolysis, discoid-to-sphere morphology change, and
   spontaneous PLT activation. It is not clear if reduction in glycolysis
   can alleviate storage lesion development.
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Apheresis PLT concentrates were exposed to
   17.2 J/mL UV light and 50 mu M riboflavin, followed by storage with
   various concentrations of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DOG) for 5 days. The control
   had no UV or 2-DOG exposure.
   RESULTS: Lactate production and glucose consumption were increased
   significantly to 0.1371 +/- 0.0281 and 0.0724 +/- 0.0151 mmol per 10(12)
   cells per hour for UV-treated PLTs, respectively, when compared to
   control samples. UV treatment induced a decline in pH to 6.55 +/- 0.26
   for treated PLTs on Day 5, hypotonic shock response (HSR) 33 +/- 25
   percent, extent of shape change (ESC) to 3.8 +/- 3.6 percent, swirl 1.0
   +/- 1.0 and increased P-selectin expression 85.2 +/- 9.4 percent.
   Addition of 2-DOG up to 20 mmol per L significantly reduced lactate
   production to 0.0515 +/- 0.0045 mmol per 10(12) cells per hour (p <
   0.05) and glucose consumption to 0.0293 +/- 0.0060 mmol per 10(12) cells
   per hour and increased pH to 7.35 +/- 0.09 in a dose-dependent manner.
   2-DOG, however, had no effects on HSR, ESC, swirl, and P-selectin
   expression. Furthermore, an exaggeration of UV-stressed PLT aggregation
   by addition of 2-DOG was also observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Increased glycolytic flux is not a direct cause for PLT
   morphology change and spontaneous activation during storage lesion
   development. Reduction of glucose utilization may increase PLT loss
   during storage.}},

Abstract = {{It is expected that a radioactive C-9-ion beam as a type of double
   irradiation source can increase the curative effect when applying it to
   heavy-ion cancer therapy, and it has been proved in our previous
   radiobiological experiment that the relative biological effectiveness
   (RBE) at the depths around the Bragg peak of a C-9 beam was greater than
   that of a therapeutic C-12 beam at least by a factor of 2. To
   characterize the physical basis of a C-9 ion beam applying to
   radiotherapy, a spherical tissue-equivalent proportional counter (TEPC)
   was used to measure the lineal energy (y) spectra at different depths
   along a radioactive C-9-ion beam in this work. Based on the measured
   spectra, the distribution of dose-averaged lineal energy in depth was
   derived. Moreover, the measured lineal energy spectra, were converted
   into the distributions of LET in absorbed dose at the different depths.
   The distribution of dose-averaged LET in depth, therefore, has been
   obtained for the C-9 beam. The dose-averaged LETs measured with the TEPC
   and our preceding parellel-plate proportional counter (PPPC) were
   compared. It has been found that both the measurements agreed well with
   each other at the entrance channel of the C-9 beam while the
   dose-averaged LETs by the TEPC were larger than those by the PPPC around
   the Bragg peak, i.e. the stopping region of the incident C-9 ions. This
   coincides with the expectation that all of the delayed alpha particles
   and protons, which are emitted isotropically during the decays of the
   C-9 ions, can be included by means of the TEPC measurement. The data
   sets obtained in this work provide a substantial physical basis for
   revealing the advantages of C-9 beams in cancer therapy.}},

Abstract = {{The Tuwu deposit is one of a series of recently discovered porphyry
   copper deposits in the eastern Tian Shan range of Xinjiang, China. Since
   its discovery in 1997, more than ten boreholes have been drilled and a
   suite of geophysical surveys has been acquired to delineate the deposit.
   As part of the geophysical program, a set of eight seismic reflection
   profiles was acquired in 2000, followed by a physical rock-property
   study in 2001. The ores are characterized by slightly higher density
   (Delta rho similar to 0.1 g/cm(3)) and significantly higher P-wave
   velocity (Delta V-p similar to 1.0-1.5 km/s) than the dioritic host
   rocks.
   The seismic surveys used 0.6- to 0.9-kg shallow dynamite sources, with a
   24-channel end-on spread and offsets up to 350 m. The orebody and
   associated igneous layers dip steeply (> 45 degrees) toward the south,
   so careful processing of the seismic data was required. Weak reflections
   from strati-graphic contacts are visible on most of the profiles,
   including the top of the intrusion and the base of the orebody. Since
   the observed reflections include a significant out-of-plane component,
   we developed a simple 2.5D migration procedure. This method was applied
   to line drawings of the seismic profiles, providing the basis for
   delineation of the orebody in three dimensions.
   Synthetic seismic sections computed using the inferred bounding surfaces
   of the ore deposit are in reasonable agreement with observed
   reflections, even for along-strike lines not used to build the model.
   The ability to verify interpreted reflections using line intersections
   was critical to the development of our model. The results of this work
   indicate that seismic methods may be useful as an aid for mapping the
   flanks of shallow, moderately dipping porphyry copper orebodies and
   associated strata, particularly for defining the structure of deeper
   sections of the mineralized zones in advance of}},

Abstract = {{Neurons exhibit diverse dendritic branching patterns that are important
   for their function. However, the signaling pathways that control the
   formation of different dendritic structures remain largely unknown. To
   address this issue in vivo, we use the peripheral nervous system (PNS)
   of Drosophila as a model system. Through both loss-of-function and
   gain-of-function analyses in vivo, we show here that the nonreceptor
   tyrosine kinase Abelson (Abl), an important regulator of cytoskeleton
   dynamics, inhibits dendritic branching of dendritic arborization (DA)
   sensory neurons in Drosophila. Enabled (Ena), a substrate for Abl,
   promotes the formation of both dendritic branches and actin-rich
   spine-like protrusions of DA neurons, an effect opposite to that of Abl.
   In contrast, p120catenin (p120ctn) primarily enhances the development of
   spine-like protrusions. These results suggest that Ena is a key
   regulator of dendritic branching and that different regulators of the
   actin cytoskeleton exert distinct effects on dendritic morphogenesis.}},

Title = {{Adenosine reduces glutamate release in rat spinal synaptosomes}},

Abstract = {{Background: A, adenosine receptor activation reduces hypersensitivity in
   animal models of chronic pain, but intrathecal adenosine does not
   produce analgesia to acute noxious stimuli. Here, the authors test
   whether increased inhibition by adenosine of glutamate release from
   afferents after injury accounts for this difference.
   Methods: Synaptosomes were prepared from the dorsal half of the lumbar
   spinal cord of normal rats or those with spinal nerve ligation.
   Glutamate release evoked by the TRPV-1 receptor agonist, capsaicin, was
   measured. Adenosine with or without adenosine A. and A2 receptor
   antagonists was applied to determine the efficacy and mechanism of
   adenosine to reduce capsaicin-evoked glutamate release.
   Results: Capsaicin produced a concentration-dependent glutamate release
   similarly in normal and nerve-injured rats. Capsaicin-evoked glutamate
   release was inhibited by adenosine or
   R-PIA(R-N6-(2-phenylisopropyl)-adenosine) in a concentration-dependent
   manner, with a threshold of 10 nM in both normal and nerve-ligated
   synaptosomes. Blockade of capsaicm-evoked glutamate release by adenosine
   was reversed similarly in synaptosomes from normal and spinal
   nerve-figated animals by an A, adenosine receptor antagonist DPCPX
   (8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine) but not by an A(2) adenosine
   receptor antagonist DMPX (3'7-dimethyl-1-proparaglyxanthine).
   Capsaicin-evoked glutamate release, as well as its inhibition by
   adenosine, did not differ between synaptosomes prepared from tissue
   ipsilateral and contralateral to spinal nerve ligation.
   Conclusion: These observations confirm previous neurophysiologic studies
   that presynaptic adenosine A, receptor activation inhibits glutamate
   release from primary afferents. This effect is unaltered after
   peripheral nerve injury and thereby is unlikely to account for the
   enhanced analgesic efficacy of intrathecal adenosine in this setting.}},

Abstract = {{To further strengthen the evidence-base of artemether for the control of
   schistosomiasis japonica, a randomised controlled trial was carried out
   in the Poyang Lake region, a highly endemic area in southern China. A
   total of 783 individuals, aged 6-60 years, were enrolled. They were
   first given a single oral dose of praziquantel (50 mg/kg). Then, they
   were randomly assigned oral artemether (6 mg/kg) or placebo,
   administered once every 2 weeks for 9-11 doses, covering the entire
   transmission season for Schistosoma japonicum in 2004. Stool examination
   1 month after the final dosing revealed eggs of S. japonicum in 3/373
   (0.8\%) of the artemether recipients and 56/361 (15.0\%) in placebo
   recipients (chi(2) = 53.69, P < 0.00 1). Compared to the baseline, the
   geometric mean intensity of S. japonicum infection had decreased by 96.1
   \% in the artemether group, and increased by 50.8\% in the placebo
   group. No acute cases of schistosomiasis japonica were observed in the
   artemether group, whereas three such cases were reported from the
   placebo group. Compliance with regard to multi-doses of artemether and
   placebo was 84.9, and 77.9\%, respectively. This study confirms that
   repeated oral artemether produces no drug-related adverse effects,
   significantly reduces incidence and intensity of patent S. japonicum
   infection and results in high compliance. Hence it can be used as an
   additional toot for the control of schistosomiasis japonica in the lake
   regions of China. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INSECTES SOCIAUX}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{323-326}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Although male haploidy in haplodiploid species aids purging of
   deleterious alleles, haplodiploid animals may nevertheless suffer
   significant negative effects of inbreeding. The effects may even be
   stronger in social Hymenoptera because the negative fitness consequences
   may be expressed at two levels: the individual level (inbred queens) and
   colony level (inbred workers). Surprisingly, in natural populations the
   impact of inbreeding on fitness has been studied in very few insects,
   and even fewer haplodiploid ones. Hence there is currently little
   understanding of the potential effects of inbreeding. One reason may be
   the difficulties in estimating inbreeding especially at the individual
   level, apart from the additional problems posed by haplodiploidy. In
   order to study the impact of inbreeding, its individual level must be
   estimated as precisely as possible. When the population pedigree is
   unknown, relatedness-based estimates of the individual inbreeding
   coefficient can be used to estimate inbreeding. Here we examine the
   relationship between inbreeding coefficients and relatedness in diploid
   and haplodiploid organisms, and provide guidelines for estimating
   inbreeding both at the individual and the colony level.}},

Abstract = {{A cDNA encoding cathepsin B was cloned from the scuticociliate, Uronema
   marinum, which invades the olive flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus,
   leading to high mortalities in culturing fish. The full-length
   scuticociliate cathepsin B (ScCtB) gene contains an open reading frame
   of 1053 base pairs encoding 350 amino acids. A homology search revealed
   that ScCtB shares sequence identity with several piscine cathepsin Bs
   (48\%-45\%). The protein of ScCtB from U marinum extracts was purified
   12.8-fold by a one step purification process using a DEAE-Sephagel high
   performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column. It had a molecular mass
   of 30 kDa, as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
   electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting, which was consistent
   with predicting molecular mass of mature protein (29.2 kDa) of ScCtB.
   The protease activity of the ScCtB enzyme was demonstrated by
   electrophoresis in a gelatin-acrylamide copolymerized gel. Its activity
   was quantified by cleaving a synthetic fluorogenic peptide substrate,
   Z-arginyl-arginyl-7-amido-4methylcoumarin (Z-Arg-Arg-AMC). The optimum
   pH for the protease activity was 5.5. Typical of cysteine proteases, the
   enzyme was inhibited by
   trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucyl-amido(4-guanidino)butane (E-64) and
   leupeptin. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   components into a hybrid model. The proposed model considers the
   characteristics of each point and the variant albedo to prevent the
   reconstructed surface from being distorted. The neural network inputs
   are the pixel values of the two-dimensional images to be reconstructed.
   The normal vectors of the surface can then be obtained from the output
   of the neural network after supervised learning, where the illuminant
   direction does not have to be known in advance. Finally, the obtained
   normal vectors are applied to enforce integrability when reconstructing
   3-D objects. Facial images and images of other general objects were used
   to test the proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that
   the proposed neural-network-based adaptive hybrid-reflectance model can
   be successfully applied to objects generally and perform 3-D surface
   reconstruction better than some existing approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We attempted to evaluate the therapeutic effect of
   trichloroacetic acid (TCA) for vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN)
   after hysterectomy and to identify factors affecting
   persistence/recurrence.
   Methods: Twenty-eight post-hysterectomy patients with various grades of
   VaIN were enrolled in this study between January 2001 and December 2003.
   They were managed with intravaginal 50\% TCA once weekly for 1-4 weeks,
   and all patients were followed up every 3 months for at least 1 year.
   Assessments by Papanicolaou smear and colposcopy were performed, as was
   biopsy when indicated during the follow-up period. Cox regression
   analysis was used to identify independent factors predicting
   persistence/recurrence.
   Results: In 20 of 28 patients (71.4\%) VaIN went into remission.
   Treatment success was observed in all 11 patients with VaIN I, whereas
   only 9 out of 17 patients (53\%) with VaIN II/III went into remission (P
   = 0.009). Severity of VaIN was the only significant independent
   predictor of persistence/recurrence (odds ratio = 3.5; 95\% confidence
   interval = 1.1, 11.6; P = 0.038). The treatment was well tolerated with
   no major side effects.
   Conclusions: Based on our findings, 50\% TCA was a potential agent with
   minimal side effects for low-grade VaIN. Further prospective controlled
   study is warranted to verify our statements. However, as for high-grade
   lesions, further investigation with different TCA concentration is
   compelling.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To compare the efficacy between one step with transient
   evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) and two steps with TEOAE and
   automated auditory brainstem response (AABR) in a newborn hearing
   screening program. We investigated their differences in referral rate,
   the accurate identification rate of congenital hearing loss (HL), and
   cost effectiveness. Method: From November 1998 to December 2004, a total
   of 21,273 healthy newborns were screened for HL in Mackay Memorial
   Hospital, Taipei. In the periods from November 1998 to January 2004 and
   from February 2004 to December 2004, the screening tools used were TEOAE
   alone (n = 18,260) and TEOAE plus AABR (n = 3,013), respectively.
   Results. A statistically significant decrease of referral rate was
   achieved in the group using TEOAE and AABR as screening tools when
   compared with TEOAE alone (1.8\% vs. 5.8\%). The accurate identification
   rate of congenital HL was 0.45\% in TEOAE protocol and 0.3\% in TEOAE
   and AABR protocol, which was not statistically significant. The total
   direct costs per screening were 10.1 U.S. dollars for the program using
   TEOAE alone and 8.9 U.S. dollars for the TEOAE plus AABR program. The
   intangible cost, however, was much higher in the earlier program because
   of the higher referral rate. Conclusion: In terms of the efficacy of a
   hearing screening program using the one step TEOAE and two step TEOAE
   and AABR programs, the later significantly decreased the referral rate
   from 5.8\% to 1.8\%. No significant difference was noted between the
   accurate identification rates of congenital HL. The total costs,
   including expenditures and intangible cost, were lower in the protocol
   with TEOAE plus AABR.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To survey the use of complementary and alternative medical
   therapies by pediatric pain management services affiliated with major
   universities.
   Design. A telephone survey was conducted of pediatric anesthesia
   training programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate
   Medical Education in the United States. The survey instrument included
   questions on the provision of complementary and alternative medical
   therapies in their pediatric pain programs.
   Results. Forty-three pediatric anesthesia fellowship programs (100\%)
   responded to the survey. Thirty-eight institutions (86\%) offered one or
   more complementary and alternative medical therapies for their patients.
   Those therapies included biofeedback (65\%), guided imagery (49\%),
   relaxation therapy (33\%), massage (35\%), hypnosis (44\%), acupuncture
   (33\%), art therapy (21\%), and meditation (21\%).
   Conclusions. This report documents trends in complementary and
   alternative medical therapies usage in the tertiary pediatric pain
   management service. There is a high prevalence in the integration of
   complementary and alternative medical therapies in pediatric pain
   management programs. Additional clinical research in the safety and

   Contribution of proband informant information}},

Abstract = {{Background. Overall findings of our first direct interview Family study
   of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) indicated that OCD is familial.
   In this replication study, we carefully examined the role of informant
   data in ascertaining OCD in relatives.
   Method. We interviewed 112 relatives of 57 OCD patients and 115
   relatives of 41 not ill controls predominantly by telephone. Additional
   analyses included a combined sample of relatives about whom any
   diagnostic information was available (228 OCD and 239 controls). To
   examine the contribution of proband information about relatives, we
   considered two sets of best-estimate diagnoses. First, we ascertained
   best-estimate diagnoses for relatives using information from direct
   interviews and from all informants except the proband. Then, we
   re-diagnosed relatives based on all available information, including
   reports from the proband about their relatives.
   Results. When relative diagnoses were derived without the benefit of
   proband informant reports, no evidence of familial OCD transmission was
   found. When diagnoses were made including information from the proband
   about the relative, evidence of familial OCD was found, but only when
   the diagnostic threshold was lowered to include cases with probable OCD
   or OCD symptoms. Other diagnoses (generalized anxiety disorder, social
   phobia, drug use disorder) were also higher among OCD relatives.
   Conclusions. This second study provides less robust support for familial
   transmission of OCD. Evidence for familial transmission of OCD was found
   only when diagnoses were made using information from the affected
   proband about their relatives. Taken in context of past findings, our
   own inconsistent results suggest that OCD may be heterogeneous with
   regard to familial transmission. Also, more careful attention should be
   paid to the contribution of informant reports, especially from relatives
   affected by the same disorder.}},

Abstract = {{There has been a captive Pan troglodytes colony at Taronga Park Zoo in
   Sydney, Australia, since the mid-1930s. Demographic data on these
   animals were first analyzed in 1986; however, further information
   collected for 15 years since then is now available. The reproductive
   histories of 33 females in the colony have been recorded, and these data
   form the largest collection of captive chimpanzee data from a setting
   that has involved natural breeding conditions since the mid-1960s. These
   data were analyzed in conjunction with data from wild populations to
   establish the degree of variability present within chimpanzee
   reproductive parameters, and to identify which distinctive life history
   characteristics persist in well-provisioned, natural-fertility
   populations. The age at first birth for the chimpanzee females is 9.8 yr
   on average (n=16), which is 1-4.8 yr earlier than the average for wild
   populations. In line with this accelerated reproduction, birth intervals
   are also significantly shorter than those in noncaptive chimpanzee
   populations. The median birth interval for all surviving infants (based
   on a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis') is 49 months (n=43) compared to 62
   + months for wild groups. At the same time, infant mortality remains
   high. The data confirm distinctive features of the life history of
   common chimpanzees, including later maturation, long birth intervals, a
   relatively invariant fertility schedule, and high juvenile mortality.
   However, aspects of both fertility and mortality are significantly
   related to social circumstances, indicating that in common chimpanzees,
   as in humans, life history characters may represent ecological and
   social adaptations rather than species-fixed characteristics.}},

Title = {{Topology of modified surfaces of involute helical gears with line

Abstract = {{The main defects of misaligned helical gear drives with parallel axes
   are: edge contact, noise, and not favorable conditions of bearing
   contact. One of the greatest concern of manufacturing of helical gear
   drives (with parallel axes) is the edge contact of tooth surfaces that
   is caused by misalignment. At present, attempts to avoid edge contact
   are based on providing chamfers of the tooth surfaces of the gears that
   may be obtained by modification of the profile of the cutting hobs. The
   zones of tooth surfaces with chamfers and zones with conventional screw
   involute surfaces are not connected smoothly, in many cases the
   magnitude of required chamfers is not determined analytically, and the
   edge contact is not avoided. The finishing process of helical gears with
   chamfers is a complicated one. The existing design has to be
   complemented with TCA (tooth contact analysis). These are the reasons
   why a new topology of modified helical gear tooth surfaces with involute
   and crowned zones is proposed. An involute zone is provided in the
   central area of gear tooth surfaces that will allow line contact if
   misalignment does not occur. Zones at the top, bottom, front, and back
   sides of tooth surfaces are crowned and allows localization of the
   bearing contact when misalignments occur. Crowned zones with smooth
   connections to the involute zone are obtained as the result of profile
   and longitudinal crowning. The function of transmission errors is
   provided at each cycle of meshing as the sum of three branches. Two
   branches of a parabolic function at the extremes of the cycle of meshing
   are in tangency with the middle branch of zero transmission errors. The
   generation of gear tooth surfaces is accomplished by a grinding worm.
   This has required the solution of two problems,
   (i) determination of the worm thread surface that is conjugated to the
   theoretical pinion tooth surface, and
   (ii) generation by the grinding worm of a crowned pinion tooth surface.
   Simulation of meshing of misaligned gear drives is accomplished by
   application of TCA program developed by the authors. The formation of
   the bearing contact is analyzed considering more than one cycle of
   meshing. Existence of areas of severe contact stresses is avoided. The
   developed approach is illustrated with numerical examples. (c) 2005

Title = {{Improving Key Predistribution with Deployment Knowledge in Static Sensor
   Networks}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Pairwise key establishment is a fundamental security service for sensor
   networks. However, establishing pairwise keys in sensor networks is a
   challenging problem, particularly due to the resource constraints on
   sensor nodes and the threat of node compromises. This article proposes
   to use both predeployment and postdeployment knowledge to improve
   pairwise key predistribution in static sensor networks. By exploiting
   the predeployment knowledge, this article first develops two key
   predistribution schemes, a closest pairwise keys scheme and a closest
   polynomials scheme. The analysis shows that these schemes can achieve
   better performance if the expected location information is available and
   that the smaller the deployment error is, the better performance they
   can achieve. The article then investigates how to use postdeployment
   knowledge to improve pairwise key predistribution in static sensor
   networks. The idea is to load an excessive amount of predistributed keys
   on sensor nodes, prioritize these keys based on sensors' actual
   locations discovered after deployment, and discard low-priority keys to
   thwart node compromise attacks. This approach is then used to improve
   the random subset assignment scheme proposed recently to demonstrate its
   practicality and effectiveness. The analysis indicates that the
   postdeployment knowledge can also greatly improve the performance and
   security of key predistribution.}},

Abstract = {{To examine the acquisition of insulin sensitivity after the initial
   biosynthesis of the insulin-responsive aminopeptidase ( IRAP), 3T3-L1
   adipocytes were transfected with an enhanced green fluorescent
   protein-IRAP (EGFP-IRAP) fusion protein. In the absence of insulin, IRAP
   was rapidly localized ( 1 - 3 h) to secretory membranes and retained in
   these intracellular membrane compartments with little accumulation at
   the plasma membrane. However, insulin was unable to induce translocation
   to the plasma membrane until 6 - 9 h after biosynthesis. This was in
   marked contrast to another type II membrane protein ( syntaxin 3) that
   rapidly defaulted to the plasma membrane 3 h after expression. In
   parallel with the time-dependent acquisition of insulin responsiveness,
   the newly synthesized IRAP protein converted from a brefeldin
   A-sensitive to a brefeldin A-insensitive state. The initial trafficking
   of IRAP to the insulin-responsive compartment was independent of plasma
   membrane endocytosis, as expression of a dominant-interfering dynamin
   mutant (Dyn/K44A) inhibited transferrin receptor endocytosis but had no
   effect on the insulin-stimulated translocation of the newly synthesized
   IRAP protein.}},

Abstract = {{over the past several years, studies of sphingolipid functions in the
   baker's yeast Sacchoromyces cerevisioe have revealed that the sphingoid
   LCBs (long-chain bases), dihydrosphingosine and PHS (phytosphingosine),
   are important signalling molecules or second messengers under heat
   stress and during non-stressed conditions. LCBs are now recognized as
   regulators of AGC-type protein kinase (where AGC stands for protein
   kinases A, G and c) Pkh1 and Pkh2, which are homologues of mammalian
   phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1. LCBs were previously shown
   to activate Pkh1 and 1302, which then activate the downstream protein
   kinase Pkc1. We have recently demonstrated that PHS stimulates Pkh1 to
   activate additional downstream kinases including Ypk1, Ypk2 and Sch9. We
   have also found that PHS acts downstream of Pkh1 and partially activates
   Ypk1, Ypk2 and Sch9. These kinases control a wide range of cellular
   processes including growth, cell wall integrity, stress resistance,
   endocytosis and aging. As we learn more about the cellular processes
   controlled by Ypk1, Ypk2 and S69, we will have a far greater
   appreciation of LCBs as second messengers.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: The goal of the study is to obtain genetic information from
   exfoliated colonocytes in the fecal stream rather than directly from
   mucosa cells within the colon. The latter is obtained through invasive
   procedures. The difficulties encountered by this procedure are that
   certain probe information may be compromised due to partially degraded
   mRNA. Proper normalization is essential to obtaining useful information
   from these fecal array data.
   Results: We propose a new two-stage semiparametric normalization method
   motivated by the features observed in fecal microarray data. A location
   - scale transformation and a robust inclusion step were used to roughly
   align arrays within the same treatment. A non-parametric estimated
   non-linear transformation was then used to remove the potential
   intensity-based biases. We compared the performance of the new method in
   analyzing a fecal microarray dataset with those achieved by two existing
   normalization approaches: global median transformation and quantile
   normalization. The new method favorably compared with the global median
   and quantile normalization methods.}},

Abstract = {{The insect body plan is very well conserved, yet the developmental
   mechanisms of segmentation are surprisingly varied. Less evolutionarily
   derived insects undergo short germ segmentation where only the anterior
   segments are specified before gastrulation whereas the remaining
   posterior segments are formed during a later secondary growth phase. In
   contrast, derived long germ insects such as Drosophila specify their
   entire bodies essentially simultaneously. These fundamental
   embryological differences imply potentially divergent molecular
   patterning events. Numerous studies have focused on comparing the
   expression and function of the homologs of Drosophila segmentation genes
   between Drosophila and different short and long germ insects. Here we
   review these comparative data with special emphasis on understanding how
   short germ insects generate segments and how this ancestral mechanism
   may have been modified in derived long germ insects such as Drosophila.
   We break down the larger issue of short versus long germ segmentation
   into its component developmental problems and structure our discussion
   in order to highlight the unanswered questions in the evolution of
   insect segmentation.}},

Abstract = {{We report the development and use of a synthetic, discrete event,
   discrete space model that functions as an epithelio-mimetic device

   drug-like compounds. We represent passive paracellular and transcellular
   transport, carrier-mediated transport and active efflux using
   stand-alone components. Systematic verification of the EMD over a wide
   physiologically realistic range is essential before we can use it to
   address questions regarding the details of the interacting mechanisms
   that are believed to influence absorption. We report details of key
   verification experiments. We demonstrate that this device can generate
   behaviors similar to those observed in the in vitro Caco-2 transwell
   system. To do that we used a series of hypothetical drugs and we
   simulated behaviors for two clinically used drugs, alfentanil and
   digoxin. The results support the feasibility and practicability of the
   EMD as a tool to expand the experimental options for better
   understanding the biological processes involved in intestinal transport
   and absorption of compounds of interest. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

   - Thrombin-enhanced interleukin-8 expression in term decidua}},

Volume = {{167}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence has linked preterm premature rupture of the fetal
   membranes (PPROM) to placental abruption. Because neutrophils are a rich
   source of proteases that can degrade extracellular matrix in
   abruption-associated PPROM, we examined whether decidual neutrophil
   infiltration complicates abruption-associated PPROM. Accordingly,
   immunostaining for the neutrophil marker CD15 was performed in placentas
   obtained after overt abruption (decidual hemorrhage) with or without
   PPROM and in control placentas. Abruptions were associated with a marked
   decidual neutrophil infiltration that peaked after PPROM, whereas
   decidua from gestational age-matched controls were virtually devoid of
   neutrophils. Neutrophil infiltrates co-localized with fibrin deposition.
   Because abruptions elicit intense decidua-enhanced thrombin production,
   we examined the regulation of abruption-induced neutrophil infiltration.
   Expression of the primary neutrophil chemoattractant interleukin-8
   (IL-8) was evaluated in leukocyte-free term decidual cells incubated
   with estradiol (E-2;control) or with E-2 + medroxyprogesterone acetate
   (to mimic pregnancy) thrombin. After 24 hours, enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay measurements indicated that thrombin (0.1 to 2.5
   U/ml) elicited a dose-dependent elevation in secreted IL-8 (P < 0.05)
   with 2.5 U/ml of thrombin increasing IL-8 levels by > 14-fold in E-2 and
   E-2 + medroxyprogesterone incubations. Results were validated by Western
   blot and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.
   In summary, thrombin-enhanced IL-8 expression in term decidual cells may
   explain how abruption-associated PPROM promotes decidual neutrophil
   infiltration.}},

Abstract = {{Although the SIV-infected Indian rhesus; macaque (Macaca mulatta) is the
   animal model most widely used for studying HIV infection, our current
   understanding of the functional macaque MHC class I molecules is
   limited. To date, SIV-derived CD8(+) T lymphocyte epitopes from only
   three high frequency macaque MHC class I molecules have been extensively
   characterized. In this study, we defined the peptide-binding properties
   of the high frequency Indian rhesus macaque class I molecule,
   Mamu-B{*}01 (similar to 26\%). We first identified a preliminary binding
   motif by eluting and sequencing endogenously bound Mamu-B{*}01 ligands.
   We further characterized the peptide-binding characteristics using
   panels of single amino acid substitution analogs. Using this detailed
   motif, 507 peptides derived from SIV(mac)239 were identified and tested
   for their Mamu-B{*}01 binding capacity. Surprisingly, only 11 (2.2\%) of
   these motif-containing peptides bound with IC50 values <= 500 nM. We
   assessed the immunogenicity of these peptides using freshly isolated
   PBMC from ten Mamu-B{*}01(+) SIV-infected rhesus macaques in IFN-gamma
   ELISPOT and IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha intracellular cytokine staining assays.
   Lymphocytes from these SIV-infected macaques responded to none of these
   peptides. Furthermore, there was no sequence variation indicative of
   escape in the regions of the virus that encoded these peptides.
   Additionally, we could not confirm previous reports of SIV-derived
   Mamu-B{*}01-restricted epitopes in the Env and Gag proteins. Our results
   suggest that the high frequency MHC class I molecule, Mamu-B{*}01, is
   not involved in SIV-specific CD8(+) T lymphocyte responses.}},

Abstract = {{Aims/hypothesis: Enlarged fat cells from obese subjects are
   characterised by insulin resistance and abnormal adrenergic regulation
   of lipolysis. The aim of the present study was to examine whether these
   aberrations return to normal following weight reduction. Materials and
   methods: Obese women (n=25) were investigated before and 3 +/- 1 years
   (mean +/- SD) after steady-state weight reduction and compared with
   control women who were matched to the cases at re-examination in terms
   of age and BMI. Adipocyte volume, lipogenesis and lipolysis were
   determined in isolated subcutaneous fat cells following stimulation or
   inhibition at different steps of the lipolytic cascade. Results: Weight
   reduction decreased fat cell volume and basal and adrenergic-regulated
   lipolysis rates to values that were 20-40\% lower than those in control
   women (p=0.0002-0.03), despite the fact that percentage body fat was
   almost identical in the two groups of women. Fat cell volume was
   directly proportional to lipolysis in obese subjects, both before and
   after weight reduction, and in control subjects. Insulin-induced
   antilipolysis and lipogenesis were completely normalised after weight
   reduction. Conclusions/interpretation: Body-weight-reduced obese women
   had low basal and catecholamine-stimulated adipocyte lipolysis,
   presumably due to adipose tissue hyperplasia. This could make an
   important contribution to body weight gain following weight loss.
   Adipocyte insulin resistance is secondary to obesity.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Enlarged fat cells and leptin hypersecretion are hallmarks of
   common obesity.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate fat cell size
   and leptin production in the basal state after long-term steady-state
   weight reduction to the nonobese state.
   Design: This prospective case-control study had a duration of 3 +/- 1
   (mean +/- SD) yr.
   Patients: Twenty-five obese women (cases) were studied. Each case was
   compared with a control subject matched for age, sex, and body mass
   index (BMI) at nadir of weight for the cases.
   Setting: This study was conducted at Karolinska University Hospital
   (Stockholm, Sweden).
   Intervention: The subjects were followed until they reached a
   steady-state weight reduction after lifestyle modification or bariatric
   surgery (cases). Treatment target was the nonobese state (BMI < 30
   kg/m(2)). Subcutaneous adipose tissue secretion of leptin, serum leptin
   levels, and fat cell volume were determined after an overnight fast.
   Results: Ten obese women (40\%) reached the nonobese state. This was
   accompanied by marked decreases in fat cell volume, leptin secretion,
   and serum leptin concentrations (P < 0.0001). The postobese cases had
   43\% smaller fat cell volume (P = 0.0008), 68\% lower adipocyte leptin
   production (P = 0.001), and 54\% lower serum leptin levels (P = 0.0007)
   than control subjects, despite almost identical percent body fat in the
   two groups. Fat cell volume, but not percent body fat or BMI, was
   directly proportional to leptin secretion and serum leptin
   concentrations.
   Conclusion: Adipose tissue hyperplasia ( too many small fat cells) and
   low leptin production resulting in relative hypoleptinemia in the
   fasting ( basal) state are common features of the postobese state in
   women.}},

Abstract = {{The organ opalladium(II) complex containing the (S)-form of
   ortho-palladated (1-(dimethylamino)ethyl)naphthylalene has been
   successfully utilised as a chiral template to promote the asymmetric
   endo-cycloaddition reaction between coordinated
   3,4-dimethyl-I-phenyl-phosphole and acrolein. The rate of this chiral
   template promoted reaction is dramatically affected by the solvent and
   temperature. In dichloromethane, the intermolecular cycloaddition
   reaction at room temperature gave a 2:1 mixture of the diastereomeric
   endo-substituted formyl-phosphanorbornene template complexes in 35 days.
   The major diastereomer Could be isolated by fractional crystallization.
   The absolute configurations and the coordination properties of the
   endo-formylphosphines in the isolated template complex have been
   established by X-ray crystallography. The enantiomerically pure
   endo-cycloaddition
   (-)-5-(formyl)-2,3-dimethyl-7-phenyl-7-phosphabicyclo{[}2.2.1]hept-2-ene
   was obtained by the treatment of the major product with dppe. When the
   endo-cycloaddition reaction was conducted in the ionic liquid
   1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ({[}hmim]{[}BF4D, the same
   2:1 diastereomeric mixture was obtained in two days. When the reaction
   temperature was raised to 85 degrees C, the reaction generated the two
   diastereomeric endo-cycloadducts as a 1: 1 mixture in 2 h. Similarly, a
   H mixture was obtained when the reaction was heated at 85 degrees C in
   1,2-dichloroethane for 2 days. (D 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Clinical treatment of depression or anxiety with selective serotonin
   reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) often results in delayed ejaculation or
   anorgasmia. Co-treatment with subtype-selective serotonin receptor
   antagonists may alter the timing of onset of action and potentiate or
   reduce sexual side effects. Sexual behavior in male Sprague-Dawley rats
   was examined after acute administration of the SSRI, paroxetine and the
   serotonin(1A) antagonist, WAY-100,635. Acute administration of
   paroxetine alone did not alter male ejaculatory behavior. However,
   administration of paroxetine plus WAY-100,635 resulted in a significant
   delay in mounting behavior and increased the time to ejaculation.
   Simultaneous administration of paroxetine and WAY-100,635 produced a
   greater delay in initiation of mounting behavior and ejaculation
   compared to sequential administration of paroxetine followed by
   WAY-100,635. The differential effect on sexual behavior or addition of
   specific serotonin receptor antagonists may be relevant for clinical
   treatment therapies of premature ejaculation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{In this work, we report measured electrochemical half-wave reduction
   potentials of 3-nitrofluoranthene (3-NF), 1-nitropyrene (1-NP),
   6-nitrochrysene (6-NC) and 9-nitroanthracene (9NA): = -0.51V; -0.61V;
   -0.64V; and -0.84V respectively. The cyclic voltammetry experiments with
   the nitro-PAH were carried out in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF),
   containing 0.1 mol L-1 tetraethylammonium perchlorate ( TEAP) using a
   three-compartment cell fitted with Pt working and auxiliary electrodes,
   and a Ag/AgI reference electrode (a silver wire in 0.1 mol L-1 DMF/TEAP
   containing 0.05 mol L-1 tetrabutylammonium iodide). These potentials can
   be ordered from the less to the more negative value, which corresponds
   to the same order by which the direct-acting mutagenicity decreases
   (3-NF >> 1-NP > 6-NC >> 9-NA). Thus, 3-NF, which shows the less negative
   first half-wave potential value is the more active mutagenic amongst the
   nitro-PAH studied. In this way, these properties may be used as an
   indicative of the health risks, asociated to nitro-PAH exposure, and
   thus being of great importance in toxicological studies.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To determine neonatal mortality and morbidity rates in
   monochorionic twins with chronic twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome
   (TTTS) treated with fetoscopic laser occlusion of vascular anastomoses.
   Study design In a prospective study of monochorionic twins delivered at
   our center between June 2002 and December 2004, neonatal outcome was
   assessed in 40 monochorionic twin pairs with TTTS treated with laser
   compared with 46 monochorionic twin pairs without TTTS.
   Results The neonatal mortality rate in the TTrS and no-TTTS group was
   8\% (6/76) and 3\% (3/90), respectively. The rate of severe cerebral
   lesions on ultrasound scanning in the TTTS and no-TTTS group was 14\%
   (10/72) and 6\% (5/82). respectively. The incidence of adverse neonatal
   outcome (neonatal death, major neonatal morbidity, or severe cerebral
   lesions) in the TTTS and no-TTTS group was, respectively, 26\% (20/76)
   and 13\% (12/90) (RR = 1.97, 95\% Cl = 1.03 to 3.77).
   Conclusions. Although perinatal outcome in TTTS has improved after laser
   therapy, neonatal mortality and morbidity rates remain high. Relative
   risk for adverse neonatal outcome is increased 2-fold in TTTS treated
   with laser relative to monochorionic twins without TTTS.}},

Abstract = {{Summit Russet (AS4118-3), the result of the cross A77236-6 x
   TND329-1Russ, was released in 2003 by the USDA/ARS and the Agricultural
   Experiment Stations of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. The vines of
   Summit Russet are erect, with very thick stems, large yellowish-green
   leaves and abundant white flowers. The tubers are tan, with medium
   russet skin, long-flattened shape, a slightly prominent eyebrow, white
   flesh, and moderately prominent pith. Tuber dormancy is very long.
   Summit Russet was compared with Russet Burbank in trials across the
   Pacific Northwest for yield, quality, and disease response. In general,
   Summit Russet produced similar or lower total yields than did Russet
   Burbank, but higher U.S. No. 1 yields. In Idaho variety trials, Summit
   Russet exhibited resistance to second growth, growth cracks, blackspot
   bruise, and stem-end discoloration, and moderate susceptibility to
   hollow heart and shatter bruise. In comprehensive product quality
   evaluations, Summit Russet was rated superior to Russet Burbank for
   french fry quality and similar for baked potato quality. French fry
   quality was retained after long-term storage. In replicated disease
   trials, Summit Russet was found to have good resistance to common scab,
   early blight tuber rot, and Verticillium wilt, and moderate resistance
   to Fusarium dry rot and tuber net necrosis caused by PLRV. It
   demonstrated susceptibility to late blight, foliar PLRV, PVX, PVYO, and
   bacterial soft rot. Biochemical analysis of Summit Russet tubers showed
   them to be higher in total solids and sucrose, and lower in dextrose
   than those of Russet Burbank. Tuber glycoalkaloid concentration as
   measured from tubers produced in 1994-1996 trials was 6.7 mg 100 g.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on evaluating organizational characteristics, the
   role of watershed-based planning, biodiversity protection efforts, and
   cooperative strategies in conservation organizations using a mail-out
   survey. The goal is to get more insights into interrelationships between
   variables and to summarize the interrelationships for organizational
   improvement and research. Descriptive statistics and structural equation
   modeling (path analysis) are used. There existed paths of influence
   among structural variables of an organization. Cooperation,
   volunteerism, publicity, leadership, and better funding opportunities
   were identified as key factors important for the success of an
   organization. Administrative leadership, funding, information
   management, and collaboration were identified as four elements of an
   organizational framework that were necessary for assessment,
   reorganization, and design of new organizations. There exists
   opportunities for more interaction with public and for coordination of
   efforts at a watershed scale. Education and incentive policies are
   suggested to improve conservation organizations.}},

Title = {{Why do acute myocardial infarction patients not call an ambulance? An
   interview with patients presenting to hospital with acute myocardial
   infarction symptoms}},
Journal = {{INTERNAL MEDICINE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{668-671}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Studies from overseas indicate that patients with acute
   myocardial infarction (AMI) symptoms often fail to use the emergency
   services as recommended, thereby depriving themselves from life-saving
   treatment in case of cardiac arrest and delaying the time to myocardial
   reperfusion in the presence of a coronary occlusion.
   Aims: To compare patients brought in by ambulance to those not brought
   in by ambulance and to question why some patients do not use the
   emergency services when presenting to hospital with AMI symptoms.
   Methods: Prospective interview and follow up of consecutive patients
   presenting with AMI symptoms to the emergency department of a tertiary
   hospital in a metropolitan area within a 1-month period.
   Results: Of the 215 patients presenting to the emergency department, 113
   (53\%) arrived by private transportation. Sixty (53\%) of these felt
   their symptoms did not warrant calling the ambulance, 17 (15\%) had
   first consulted their general practitioner. The private transport group
   accounted for 28\% of documented AMI.
   Conclusions: A large proportion of patients with AMI symptoms refrain
   from calling the emergency services because they do not consider
   themselves critically ill. Education programmes appear to be warranted
   because more appropriate use of emergency services will save lives.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have suggested that Nocardia asteroides may play a role
   in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), including the
   production of Lewy bodies, the inclusion bodies present in this
   disorder. This study explored the possible connection between Nocardia
   and two Lewy body-containing disorders, PD and dementia with Lewy bodies
   (I)LB). Substantia nigra specimens from individuals with PD, DLB, other
   neurodegenerative disorders, and normal subjects were evaluated for
   nocardial infection by in situ hybridization, PCR, and Gram staining.
   Brain specimens from a cynomolgus monkey experimentally infected with N.
   asteroides for 48 h served as the controls for in situ hybridization and
   Gram staining, and a nocardial pellet was the PCR control. The organism
   was detected by in situ hybridization and Gram stain in the
   experimentally infected monkey brain, and by PCR from the nocardial
   pellet. However, in situ hybridization reactivity was detected in only
   three of the 125 human brain specimens (2.4\%; one case each of PD, DLB,
   and Alzheimer's disease), and none of the specimens was positive for
   Nocardia by PCR or Gram staining. These findings do not support an
   association of Nocardia with Lewy body-containing disorders. (C) 2005

Abstract = {{We demonstrated that environmentally relevant levels of UVA and UVB can
   reduce sperm motility (UVA: by 38-58\%; UVB: by 42-85\%; P < 0.05) and
   subsequently fertilisation success (UVA: by 38-72\%; UVB: by 91-98\%; P
   < 0.05) of urchins (Anthocidaris crassispina) in a dose-dependent
   manner, implicating that recruitment of urchin populations might be
   reduced by UVR (ultraviolet radiation) prevailing in their natural
   habitats. Concomitantly, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was
   enhanced by UVA and UVB in a dose-dependent manner (UVA: by 1.3-fold;
   UVB: by 6.6-7.3-fold; P < 0.05), and the increase in ROS resulted in an
   increase in lipid peroxidation (LPO) in urchin sperm (UVA: by
   4.2-7.2-fold; UVB: by 2.3-2.7-fold; P < 0.05). This study demonstrated
   that ROS production and oxidative damages enhanced by UVR may account
   for the observed declines in sperm motility and fertilisation, and
   suggests that levels of UVR prevailing in the environment may pose a
   significant threat to the reproductive success of natural populations of
   urchins spawning in shallow waters.}},

Abstract = {{We have grown epitaxial Co films on a single monolayer of Pd on Cu(100)

   Co layers in comparison to 4 ML on Pd(100) substrate, which is due to a
   reduced lattice mismatch between Co and the Pd/Cu(100) substrate in
   comparison to the Co on Pd(100) system. Compared to Co films on Pd(100),
   a larger slope of the thickness dependence of longitudinal
   magneto-optical Kerr rotation has been found in the Co/Pd/Cu(100) films
   with thickness above 2 ML. We have also found an increase of

Abstract = {{The general aim of the work was to characterize the ice gradients in a
   dough stick during freezing and thawing processes in transient thermal
   conditions using MRI data. Firstly, the MRI signals obtained in
   steady-state thermal conditions for different MRI sequences were
   presented and discussed over the range {[}-15. +30 degrees C]. From
   these previous results. it direct relation between the MRI signal and
   the ice fraction was observed over the range {[}-10.8 degrees C.
   theta(m)] with theta(m) the initial freezing temperature. To validate
   the MRI method in transient thermal conditions, the ice fraction
   estimated from the MRI signal was converted into equivalent temperature
   (assuming thermodynamic equilibrium conditions) and compared with
   thermocouple temperature evolution during the freezing of a dough stick
   over the range {[}-10.8 degrees C theta(m)]. Good agreement confirmed
   that ice fraction could be monitored from MRI signal in transient
   thermal conditions. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   oxidase activity in hearts of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) null mice}},

Abstract = {{The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription
   factor characterized to play a role in detection and adaptation to
   environmental stimuli. Genetic deletion of the AhR results in cardiac
   hypertrophy that is mediated primarily by endothelin-1 (ET-1); ET-1 has
   been implicated in the elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the
   heart, which are thought to contribute to several cardiovascular
   disorders, including cardiac hypertrophy. Thus, we tested the novel
   hypothesis that ET-1 induces ROS in AhR null mice via ETA receptor
   activation. We first confirmed the presence of ROS in the hearts of AhR
   null mice by measuring superoxide (O-2(center dot-))-dependent oxidation
   of dihydroethidium. Ethidium fluorescence was increased 10-fold in the
   hearts of AhR null mice, compared to the wild type. Then, to elucidate
   whether ET-1 mediated the increase in ROS, mice were chronically treated
   with 100 ng/kg/day of the ETA receptor antagonist BQ-123. In AhR null
   mice, BQ-123 significantly reduced elevated plasma 8-isoprostane, a
   systemic end product of phospholipid oxidation by ROS, and cardiac
   thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), a nonspecific
   assessment of ROS production. Furthermore, BQ-123 reduced both cardiac
   lucigenin chemiluminescence and cardiac mRNA expression of NAD(P)H
   oxidase subunits gp91(phox), p47(phox), and p67(phox) in AhR null mice
   below the levels observed in wild-type mice. These findings demonstrate
   that ET-1 activation of ETA receptors mediates an increase in ROS that
   is associated with cardiac hypertrophy in AhR null mice. In addition,
   the ET-1-mediated increase in ROS appears to be initiated via increased
   NAD(P)H oxidase activity.}},

   this study, physical, chemical and biological long-term data (1980-2002)

   possible gradients of eutrophication in the Gulf. The Finnish coastal
   area of the Gulf of Finland is divided into three parts in an east-west
   direction, and into three zones (inner, middle, Outer) according to
   differences in descriptive parameters. We use principal component
   analysis (PCA) to study spatial and temporal differences in relation to
   eutrophication. Clear differences between coastal and offshore areas are
   seen. Differences between eastern and western Gulf are not as evident.
   The changes due to eutrophication are larger for the inner archipelago,
   whereas the outer areas have been more stable over time. The
   concentration of oxygen is the strongest driving Factor for
   eutrophication in the region. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In physics literature, there are several different characterizations of
   Haag's theorem and its consequences for quantum field theory. These
   different versions of Haag's theorem are due in part to various
   generalizations and more ``rigorous{''} proofs of Haag's theorem as well
   as to the fact that many of these proofs were done using different
   formulations of quantum field theory. As a result, there is confusion
   about what Haag's theorem is and when it was proved. This paper clears
   up some of these confusions by examining the history and development of
   Haag's theorem up to 1959. It is argued that the question of who proved
   Haag's theorem is tied up with what the theorem is taken to show.}},

Abstract = {{The structure of complexes formed by charged dendrimers and oppositely
   charged linear chains with a charge of at least the same as that of

   considered in terms of the Debye-Hockel approximation with a Debye
   radius that exceeds the dendrimer size. It was shown that the number of
   chain monomeric units adsorbed on the dendrimer is greater than
   necessary for its neutralization; i.e., the effect of charge inversion
   is observed. A nonmonotonic function relating the amount of monomer
   units of the chain to its length was derived and agrees qualitatively
   with the theoretical prediction by Nguyen and Shklovskii for a complex
   of a linear chain with an oppositely charged spherical macroion. This
   nonnionotonic relationship was also revealed during study of the

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to evaluate the resistance of Asian pear
   rootstocks to lime-induced iron chlorosis when grown in calcareous soil.
   Two experiments were conducted in greenhouse condition, using three pear
   rootstock species: Pyrus xerophila Yu, P. betulaefolia Bunge, and P.
   calleryana Decne). Plants were grown over 90 days in pots filled with
   calcareous soil. Difference in iron chlorosis tolerance was estimated by
   chlorophyll contents by using chlorophyll meter readings, iron contents
   in leaves, and growth parameters of plants. Among the three pear
   rootstocks, P. xerophila showed higher chlorophyll and iron content in
   fully expanded apical leaves than did P. betulaefolia and P. calleryana
   in high pH, calcareous soil. It was further confirmed in the grafting
   experiment with the `Housui' cultivar. These results confirmed that P.
   xerophila has a higher tolerance to lime-reduced iron chlorosis.
   However, further plant evaluation under field conditions is needed to
   verify whether P. xerophila can replace the widely used, P. betulaefolia
   in the Asian pear producing areas with high pH and calcareous soil,
   especially in the northwestern region of China.}},

Abstract = {{1 We previously reported that four lignans isolated from the bark of
   Machilus thunbergii Sieb. et Zucc. (Lauraceae) protected primary
   cultures of rat cortical neurons from neurotoxicity induced by
   glutamate.
   2 Among the lignans, meso-dihydroguaiarectic acid (MDGA) and licarin A
   significantly attenuated glutamate-induced neurotoxicity when added
   prior to or right after the excitotoxic glutamate challenge.
   3 The neuroprotective activities of two lignans appeared to be more
   effective in protecting neurons against neurotoxicity induced by NMDA
   than that induced by kainic acid.
   4 MDGA and licarin A diminished the calcium influx that routinely
   accompanies with the glutamate-induced neurotoxicity, and inhibited the
   subsequent overproduction of cellular nitric oxide and peroxide to the
   level of control cells. They also preserved cellular activities of
   antioxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione
   peroxidase and glutathione reductase reduced in the glutamate-injured
   neuronal cells.
   5 Thus, our results suggest that MDGA and licarin A significantly
   protect primary cultured neuronal cells against glutamate-induced
   oxidative stress, via antioxidative activities.}},

   gave the original complexes (C5H5)(2)-LnPtz(THF) (Ln = Yb(1), Er(2),

Abstract = {{Sharp ecological transitions in space (ecotones, edges, boundaries)
   often are where ecologically important events occur, such as elevated or
   reduced biodiversity or altered ecological functions (e.g. changes in
   productivity, pollination rates or parasitism loads, nesting success).
   While human observers often identify these transitions by using
   intuitive or gestalt assignments (e.g. the boundary between a remnant
   woodland patch and the surrounding farm paddock seems obvious), it is
   clearly desirable to make statistical assessments based on measurements.
   These assessments often are straightforward to make if the data are
   univariate, but identifying boundaries or transitions using
   compositional or multivariate data sets is more difficult. There is a
   need for an intermediate step in which pairwise similarities between
   points or temporal samples are computed. Here, I describe an approach
   that treats points along a transect as alternative hypotheses (models)
   about the location of the boundary. Carlin and Chib (1995) introduced a
   Bayesian technique for comparing non-hierarchical models, which I
   adapted to compute the probabilities of each boundary location (i.e. a
   model) relative to the ensemble of models constituting the set of
   possible points of the boundary along the transect. Several artificial
   data sets and two field data sets (on vegetation and soils and on
   cave-dwelling invertebrates and microclimates) are used to illustrate
   the approach. The method can be extended to cases in with several
   boundaries along a gradient, such as where there is an ecotone of
   non-zero thickness.}},

   micrometeorological and conventional snow measurements as well. The
   measurements confirmed the high sensitivity of microwave emission at 19
   and 37 GHz to the melting-refreezing cycles of snow. Moreover,
   micrometeorological data made it possible to simulate snow density,
   temperature, and liquid water content through a hydrological snowpack
   model and provided additional insight into these processes. Simulations
   obtained with a two-layer electromagnetic model based on the strong
   fluctuation theory and driven by the output of the hydrological snowpack
   model were consistent with experimental data and allowed interpretation
   of both variation in microwave emission during the melting and
   refreezing phases and in discerning the contributions of the upper and

Abstract = {{Two alloys of the Co-Ge system were produced by mechanical alloying
   starting from the elemental powders in the compositions Co20Ge80 and
   Co40Ge60. The crystalline structures of the CoxGe100, (x=20, 40) alloys
   obtained were investigated using the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique.
   The measured XRD patterns showed the presence of the peaks corresponding
   to the crystalline m-CoGe phase and also to the high pressure and
   temperature phase c-CoGe in the as-milled sample for Co20Ge80, although
   it was milled at room temperature and pressure. For Co40Ge60, the
   crystalline Co3Ge2 phase was obtained, and structural data for all
   phases were determined by means of a Rietveld refinement procedure. The
   thermal stability of the phases was investigated performing a heat
   treatment of the alloys at 450 T for 6 h and, after that, new XRD
   measurements were collected and were also studied using a Rietveld
   refinement procedure. The m-CoGe and Co3Ge2 phases seem to be very
   stable, but the relative amount of c-CoGe decreases a little, indicating
   a less stable phase, which can be explained by the fact that it is
   produced usually under extreme conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A cascade of morphological, ecological, demographical and behavioural
   changes operates within island communities compared to mainland. We
   tested whether metabolic rates change on islands. Using a closed circuit
   respirometer, we investigated resting metabolic rate (RMR) of three
   species of Crocidurinae shrews: Suncus etruscus, Crocidura russula, and
   C. suaveolens. For the latter, we compared energy expenditure of
   mainland and island populations. Our measurements agree with those
   previously reported for others Crocidurinae: the interspecific
   comparison (ANCOVA) demonstrated an allometric relation between energy
   requirements and body mass. Energy expenditure also scaled with
   temperature. Island populations (Corsica and Porquerolles) of C
   suaveolens differed in size from mainland (gigantism). A GLM showed a
   significant relationship between energy expenditure, temperature, body
   mass and locality. Mass specific RMR allometrically scales body mass,
   but total RMR does not significantly differ between mainland and island,
   although island shrews are giant. Our results are consistent with other
   studies: that demonstrated that the evolution of mammalian metabolism on
   islands is partially independent of body mass. In relation to the
   insular syndrome, we discuss how island selective forces (changes in
   resource availability, decrease in competition and predation pressures)
   can operate in size and physiological adjustments. (c) 2005 Elsevier

   Sample Population-Serum samples from 84 healthy cats and 9 cats with
   lameness, fever, anorexia, or fatigue.
   Procedure-Serum antibodies against B burgdorferi and A phagocytophilum
   were measured with an ELISA incorporating a whole-cell preparation or
   purified recombinant antigens, by means of western blot analysis, or
   indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) staining.
   Results-ELISA results indicated that 44 of 93 (47\%) sera contained
   antibodies against >= 3 B burgdorferi antigens, whereas 43 (46\%) were
   reactive to whole-cell B burgdorferi. Serum reactivity to protein 35,
   VlsE, and outer surface proteins A and F was most common. Seropositivity
   to ! 3 antigens occurred at the same rate (5/9) in the 9 ill cats as in
   the 84 healthy cats (46\% {[}39/84]). Of 13 sera reactive to recombinant
   antigens, 9 were seropositive as measured by western blot testing with
   whole-cell antigen. Seropositivity rates of 30\% and 38\% were detected
   for antibodies against A phagocytophilum via IFA and ELISA testing,
   respectively. Fifteen (16\%) sera had antibodies against both pathogens.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Cats living in areas infested by
   Nodes scapularis ticks are exposed to B burgdorferi and A
   phagocytophilum and, in some instances, may be coinfected. Most cats
   appeared healthy. An ELISA incorporating specific recombinant antigens
   may be used adjunctively with western blot and other assays to confirm B
   burgdorferi and A phagocytophilum infection in cats.}},

Pages = {{3447-3453}},

Abstract = {{Background: Pulmonary dysfunction is one of the most common
   manifestations of inflammatory response after cardioptulmonary bypass
   (CPB).
   Objective: This prospective randomized study was conducted to evaluate
   the effect of a modified ultrafiltration (MUF) technique on pulmonary
   function after CPB in children.
   Methods: Forty patients weighing from 5 to 10 kg with congenital heart
   disease who required CPB for primary biventricular operative repair were
   prospectively randomized into two groups. The control group received
   conventional ultrafiltration (CUF) during CPB, and the study group
   received CUF and MUF. Pulmonary compliance (static and dynamic) and gas
   exchange capacity of the lung expressed as oxygen index, respiratory
   index, ventilation index, and alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure
   difference were measured after intubation (baseline), at the termination
   of CPB, at the end of MUF, on admission to the ICU, and 6 h
   postoperatively.
   Results: There was no significant difference in lung compliance and gas
   exchange between the two groups before CPB. CPB produced a significant
   decrease in static and dynamic lung compliance in both groups. In the
   control group, static and dynamic lung compliance decreased from 1.0 +/-
   0.3 to 0.90 +/- 0.3 mL/cm/kg and 0.87 +/- 0.2 to 0.71 +/- 0.1 mL/cm/kg (
   SE) {[}p = 0.0002 and p = 0.002, respectively]. In the study group,
   static and dynamic lung compliance decreased from 1.0 +/- 0.2 to 0.89
   +/- 0.03 mL/cm/kg and 0.94 +/- 0.2 to 0.77 +/- 0.1 mL/cm/kg (p = 0.002
   and p = 0.002, respectively). There was no significant difference in the
   decrease in static (p = 0.9) or dynamic lung compliance (p = 0.3)
   between the two groups. MUF produced a significant immediate improvement
   in both static lung compliance (0.89 +/- 0.2 to 0.98 +/- 0.2 mL/cm/kg, p
   = 0.03) and dynamic lung compliance (0.77 +/- 0.1 to 0.93 +/- 0.2
   mL/cm/kg, p = 0.007). The same was observed regarding the gas exchange
   capacity. CPB produced a significant decrease in lung gas exchange
   capacity, and MUF produced a significant immediate improvement in lung
   gas exchange capacity. The effect of MUF on Ion compliance and gas
   exchange capacity was not sustained after admission to the ICU nor 6 h
   later postoperatively. There was no significant difference in the time
   of extubation between the two groups (12 +/- 3 h and 13 +/- 2 h, p =
   0.4), the length of ICU stay, or the total hospital stay
   postoperatively.
   Conclusions: The use of MUF after CPB can produce an immediate
   improvement in lung compliance and gas exchange capacity, which may
   effectively minimize pulmonary dysfunction postbiventricular repair of
   congenital heart disease. However, these improvements are not sustained
   for the first 6 h postoperatively and do not reduce the duration of
   postoperative intubation, ICU stay, or total hospital stay.}},

Abstract = {{With the installation of a new electron beam (EB) test facility JUDITH
   II, the parameter range of high heat flux simulations is extended and
   the urgent need of additional testing capacity is addressed. A nominal
   power of 200 kW combined with a beam scanning angle of +/- 14 degrees
   enables to test larger components of up to 0.5 m x 1 m surface area. A
   relatively low acceleration voltage (30-60 kV) reduces volumetric
   heating for the benefit of a more plasma like surface heating. Due to a
   very flexible and individual programmable system for electron beam
   pattern generation, very homogeneous load distributions can be achieved
   during static load tests and highly realistic simulations of ITER
   relevant transient heat loads become possible. Furthermore, static and
   transient loads can be combined in one single experiment. Improved
   diagnostics, such as IR-analyses, a spectrometer in the visible range, a
   photodiode array and acoustic emission shall finally contribute to a
   better understanding of the effects caused by extreme thermal shock
   loads. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The role of serotonergic system was investigated on peripheral

   Para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) was administered
   intracerebroventriculary (50, 100 mu g/rat) or intraperitoneally (150
   rng/kg, 3 days) and 2 or 24 h later, respectively, inflammation was
   induced by injection of carrageenan. Paw oedema was decreased
   significantly in PCPA-treated (100 mu g/rat, i.c.v.) rats compared to
   control groups. Injection of exogenous serotonin (i.c.v.) by dose of
   0.70 nmol/10 mu l/rat, but not the dose of 0.35 nmol/10 mu l/rat, 15 min
   after induction of inflammation completely reversed the
   anti-inflammatory effects of PCPA. Myeloperoxidase activity in inflamed
   paws was reduced significantly in groups received PCPA (either i.c.v. or

Abstract = {{In many African countries accurate and reliable identification of
   poached wildlife products like carcasses or meat presents a big problem
   when morphological characters such as skin hair or bones are missing. We
   describe a molecular based approach that has a potential of serving as a
   forensic tool in game meat identification in Africa. A mitochondial DNA
   marker (mt700) and one restriction enzyme, Rsa1 were used in the
   PCR-RFLP species identification of game meat obtained from two National
   Parks in Tanzania. Species-specific reference DNA fragment patterns were
   obtained using fresh meat from ten wildlife and four domesticated
   species. All species except the zebra, produced unique monomorphic RFLP
   patterns. Collectively, these patterns demonstrate the potential ability
   of genetic techniques for discriminating between and among wildlife and
   domestic species. The reference PCR-RFLP fragments enabled species
   identification of about 79\% of unknown meat samples. In addition, sex
   was also assigned to all of the samples following successful
   amplification of gender-specific, SRY and ZFY/X, chromosomal domains.
   Although the present study has been conducted on a limited range both in
   numbers and genetic diversity of wildlife species present in Africa, the
   results demonstrate the potential usefulness of the DNA approach in
   wildlife forensics in the continent.}},

Title = {{Urotensin II in end stage renal disease: An inverse correlate of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEPHROLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Background: Urotensin II (UTN) is a peptide highly conserved across
   species with disparate effects on the vascular system and it is
   currently unclear whether high plasma UTN levels play a vasculotoxic or
   a vasculoprotective role.
   Methods: In this study, we investigated the relationship between plasma
   UTN and sympathetic activity and cardiac natriuretic hormones in 191
   hemodialysis (HD) patients without clinical evidence of heart failure.
   Results: Plasma UTN was significantly higher in patients with end-stage
   renal disease (ESRD) (median: 6.5 ng/mL) than in age matched healthy
   subjects (median: 3.1 ng/mL) (p < 0.001). On univariate analysis, UTN
   was inversely related to heart rate (r=-0.24), dialysis treatment
   duration (r=-0.27), norepinephrine (r=-0.28), neuropeptide Y (NPY)
   (r=-0.66), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) (r=-0.41) and atrial
   natriuretic peptide (ANP) (r=-0.28) (all p < 0.008). Of note, in
   multiple regression analyses these associations maintained strength
   similar to that of the corresponding unadjusted correlation
   coefficients.
   Conclusions: The inverse links between UTN and neuro-hormonal factors
   indicate that UTN down-regulation in the presence of high sympathetic
   activity and high BNP could be a counter-regulatory response aimed at
   mitigating cardiovascular (CV) damage or that UTN itself acts as a
   protective factor.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: We investigated the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in
   patients with erectile dysfunction (ED).
   Materials and Methods: Consecutive patients who attended an andrology
   outpatient clinic complaining of ED were recruited for study purposes.
   ED severity was evaluated by the International Index of Erectile
   Function erectile function domain score. The psychiatric diagnosis was
   established by a semistructured clinical interview as well as by the
   Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 5 Diagnostic and
   Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV. The Beck Depression Inventory
   was also incorporated as a complementary tool to assess depressive
   symptom severity.
   Results: The study included 103 patients 20 to 76 years old (mean age
   +/- SD 47.06 +/- 14.78) with ED. Most patients were classified with
   moderate and severe ED (26.2\% and 44.7\%, respectively). A detectable
   psychiatric condition was present in 63.1\% of the patients, including
   depressive disorders in 25.2\%, anxiety disorders in 11.7\%,
   depression-anxiety comorbidity in 6.8\% and personality disorders in
   5.8\%. A positive psychiatric anamnesis was identified in 41 cases,
   while 24 were newly diagnosed. No significant association was found
   between the duration and severity of ED, and psychiatric morbidity or
   the severity of depressive symptoms (p >0.05). A positive association
   was found between the severity of depressive symptoms and the patient
   tendency to discuss the problem with their partner (p <0.01).
   Conclusions: Psychiatric morbidity is highly prevalent in patients with
   ED, potentially affecting treatment outcome. Because lifetime
   psychological problems were reported by more than half of the patients,
   a psychosocial history seems mandatory. Partner support appeared to have
   a significant role in the patient psychological state.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. - Owing to the very great age and the polypathology of the
   patients in geriatrics, we are often confronted to the palliative care
   decision.
   Purpose. - The purposes of this retrospective study were both to define
   the criteria leading to palliative care and to analyse the evolution of
   patients.
   Method. - We analysed 40 files of patients hospitalised in Geriatric
   internal medicine or Geriatric rehabilitation departments over 11
   months.
   Results. - Mean age was 85.4 years and 62.5\% of patients were females.
   Infections, heart failure, general weakness, orthopaedic affections,
   strokes and cancers were the main causes of hospitalisation. Patients
   had 3 medical or surgical histories of chronic or cured serious diseases
   and a MMSE average value of 17.7. The rate of malnutrition was 92\% and
   90\% of patients were very dependent. Severe infections, cancers, heart
   failure and severe pressure ulcers were the main affections for decision
   of palliative care. The latter was always decided by the staff with
   patients or families taking part in 8 cases and being informed in other
   cases. The palliative care lasted 7 days on average. Morphine was used
   in 31 cases. No artificial nutrition was introduced.
   Conclusion. - The decision of palliative care is very complex since
   great age, polypathology, great dependence and high prevalence of
   cognitive disorders are frequent in this population. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The transition to convection in the Rayleigh-Benard problem at small
   Knudsen numbers is studied via a linear temporal stability analysis of
   the compressible ``slip-flow{''} problem. Considering a power-law
   (variable hard-sphere) model of interaction our analysis indicates that
   for sufficiently large Froude numbers ``softer{''} potentials result in
   less unstable systems. At small Froude numbers this trend is reversed,
   i.e., the ``softer{''} interaction potentials correspond to a more
   unstable response. These results are discussed in terms of the opposing
   mechanisms of thermal expansion and compressibility. We carry out an
   asymptotic expansion for small temperature differences and establish the
   principle of exchange of stabilities for this limit. A singularity
   appears in this limit when compressibility effects are dominant. (c)

Abstract = {{Photocurrent measurements have been undertaken on bulk As40Te60-xInx
   glasses of different compositions. It has been found that the
   photocurrent increases with illumination, which can probably be
   understood on the basis of the large dielectric constant of these
   materials and also due to the presence of a larger number of positive
   defect states. Further, the composition dependence of the conductivity
   activation energy and the photosensitivity exhibit a maximum at x = 12.5
   (< r > = 2.65) and a minimum at x = 15 (< r > = 2.70). Earlier
   investigations on As-Te-In glasses, such as high-pressure resistivity
   behavior, electrical switching, etc., have identified the compositions x
   = 12.5 and x = 15 as the rigidity percolation threshold (RPT) and the
   chemical threshold (CT) respectively. Based on this, the maximum and the
   minimum seen in activation energy and photosensitivity of As40Te60-xInx
   glasses at x = 12.5 and x = 15 can be attributed to RPT and CT

Abstract = {{Successive stimuli of constant intensity applied to Ia afferents produce
   spinal monosynaptic reflexes (MSRs) of variable amplitude. We recorded
   simultaneous MSRs in the left and right L7 ( or L6) ventral roots of
   anesthetized cats. We analyzed the cross-covariance (CCV) between the
   amplitudes of bilateral MSRs. Long-time series ( 5 to 8 h) of these
   bilateral MSRs exhibited transitory changes in their covariations ( as
   measured by the zero-lag peak of their CCV), thus suggesting the
   existence of certain neural sources contributing to produce these
   changes. The aim of the present study was to show that spinal centers
   producing negative spontaneous cord dorsum potentials (nSCDPs)
   contribute to maintain correlations in the amplitude of bilateral MSRs.
   After spinal cord transection at the L1 segment, no significant changes
   were observed in the correlation between the amplitude of bilateral
   nSCDPs versus the amplitude of bilateral MSRs. However, this
   correlation, as well as the peak at zero lag in the CCV between
   bilateral MSRs and the CCV between bilateral nSCDPs, respectively, were
   abolished after a subsequent longitudinal bisection at the L1 - S2
   spinal segments. These results suggest that lumbar spinal neurons (
   bilaterally interconnected) contribute to maintain the synchronous
   fluctuations of bilateral MSRs.}},

Abstract = {{The genus Centaurium (centauries) comprises ca. 27 annual species and
   subspecies primarily distributed in the Mediterranean basin.
   Phylogenetic relationships, inferred from sequences of both nrDNA
   (internal transcribed spacer, ITS) and cpDNA (trnL intron and trnL-F
   spacer) regions, confirm the monophyly of Centaurium and reveal the
   importance of polyploidy within the genus. In each ITS clade, diploid to
   hexaploid species of centauries occur. Furthermore, polyploidization is
   often associated with hybridization events, as suggested by the
   importance of additive polymorphic sites detected in the ITS region.
   Hence, reticulation appears to be the main cause of phylogenetic
   incongruence-and resulting systematic controversies-detected in the
   genus. Based on molecular and cytological evidence, the origin of
   several polyploid systems is discussed. Allopolyploidy, associated or
   not with introgression, appears to be the main evolutionary trend in
   Centaurium, and only a few autopolyploid taxa have been detected so far.}},

Abstract = {{The data on the aftereffect of He-Ne laser light (lambda = 632.8 nm) on
   mitochondria of yeasts in late log phase were reviewed. The quantitative
   analysis of the ultrathin cell sections demonstrated a nonuniform
   thickness of the giant branched mitochondria typical for budding yeasts.
   Exposure to a dose of 460 J/m(2) (accelerating cell proliferation and
   activating respiratory chain enzymes, cytochrome c oxidase and NADH
   dehydrogenase), changed the macrostructure of the giant
   mitochondria-much of the narrow regions of the mitochondrial tube with
   profiles <= 0.06 mu m(2) were expanded (while no signs of organelle
   damage were observed). Such mitochondria are characterized by increased
   relative surface area of the cristae, which can be due to the activation
   of their respiration and ATP synthesis. The number of associations
   between mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum increased in irradiated
   cells in early log phase, which reflects the increased capacity of
   mitochondria to uptake Ca2+. Altered giant mitochondria configuration
   can increase the efficiency of both energy transfer and Ca2+ propagation
   through the cytoplasm.}},

Abstract = {{We performed a two-tiered, whole-genome association study of Parkinson
   disease (PD). For tier 1, we individually genotyped 198,345 uniformly
   spaced and informative single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) in 443
   sibling pairs discordant for PD. For tier 2a, we individually genotyped
   1,793 PD-associated SNPs ( in tier 1) and 300 P < .01 genomic control
   SNPs in 332 matched case - unrelated control pairs. We identified 11
   SNPs that were associated with PD (P < .01) in both tier 1 and tier 2
   samples and had the same direction of effect. For these SNPs, we
   combined P < .01 data from the case-unaffected sibling pair (tier 1) and
   case - unrelated control pair (tier 2) samples and employed a
   liberalization of the sibling transmission/disequilibrium test to
   calculate odds ratios, 95\% confidence intervals, and P values. A SNP
   within the semaphorin 5A gene (SEMA5A) had the lowest combined P value
   (P = 7.62 x 10(-6)). The protein encoded by this gene plays an important
   role in neurogenesis and in neuronal apoptosis, which is consistent with
   existing hypotheses regarding PD pathogenesis. A second SNP tagged the
   PARK11 late-onset PD susceptibility locus (P = 1.70 x 10(-5)). In tier
   2b, we also selected for genotyping additional SNPs that were borderline
   significant (P < .05) in tier 1 but that tested a priori biological and
   genetic hypotheses regarding susceptibility to PD (SNPs). In analysis of
   the combined tier 1 and tier 2b data, the two SNPs with the lowest n p
   941 P values (P = 9.07 x 10(-6); P = 2.96 x 10(-5) ) tagged the PARK10
   late-onset PD susceptibility locus. Independent replication across
   populations will clarify the role of the genomic loci tagged by these
   SNPs in conferring PD susceptibility.}},

Abstract = {{The worldwide spread of metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing
   gram-negative bacilli represents a great concern nowadays. Sensitive
   assays for their specific detection are increasingly demanded to aid
   infection control and to prevent their dissemination. We have developed
   a novel microbiological assay employing crude bacterial extracts,
   designated EDTA-imipenem microbiological assay (EIM), to identify MBLs
   in nonfermentative gram-negative clinical strains. We also evaluated the
   ability of EIM to detect MBLs in comparison to those of other currently
   employed screening methods, such as the EDTA disk synergy test (EDS)
   with imipenem as a substrate and the Etest method. The sensitivities of
   EIM and Etest were similar (1 versus 0.92, respectively) and much higher
   than that of EDS (0.67). Moreover, both EIM and Etest displayed the
   maximum specificity. Modifications were introduced to EDS, including the
   simultaneous testing of three different beta-lactams (imipenem,
   meropenem, and ceftazidime) and two different EDTA concentrations. This
   resulted in a sensitivity improvement (0.92), albeit at a cost to its
   specificity. A simple strategy to accurately detect MBL producers is
   proposed; this strategy combines (i) an initial screening of the
   isolates by the extended EDS assay to select the potential candidates
   and (ii) confirmation of the true presence of MBL activity by EIM.}},

Abstract = {{Using intracellular cytokine staining we show herein that T cells will
   respond to short-term (6 h) activation with phorbol ester plus ionomycin
   by production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IFN-gamma or both. Here
   CD4 T cells preferentially produce TNF and CD8 cells IFN-gamma. The same
   pattern is seen when T cells are activated with the Mycobacterium
   tuberculosis protein early secretory antigenic target-6 (ESAT-6).
   Responses with > 0.02\% IFN-gamma(+) CD3 cells were seen in 8 of 10
   patients diagnosed with tuberculosis and in 12 of 14 healthy individuals
   selected for likely exposure to M. tuberculosis. T cell responses to the
   1:1 complex of ESAT-6 and culture filtrate protein-10 (CFP-10) were
   inferior to ESAT-6 alone, and only reached the level of T cell response
   achieved with CFP-10 alone. Extending the time of incubation to 18 h
   leads to an increased response to the complex, but it still reached only
   the level of CFP-10 alone. In vitro digestion with lysosomal enzymes
   cathepsin L and S at 2000:1 protein to enzyme ratio demonstrates rapid
   digestion of the individual proteins while the ESAT-6-CFP-10 complex is
   resistant. The data suggest that the natural complex of ESAT-6-CFP-10 is
   less amenable to antigen processing leading to a lower T cell response
   as compared with the individual proteins.}},

Abstract = {{Gated SPECT recorded with 16 intervals determines left ventricular (LV)
   ejection fraction more accurately than does gated SPECT recorded with 8
   intervals but produces higher image noise. This study aimed to assess
   the results from sestamibi and (TI)-T-201 16-interval gated SPECT when
   both signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution were enhanced with an
   original method of reconstruction. Methods: Forty patients with coronary
   artery disease underwent (TI)-T-201 and sestamibi 16-interval gated
   SPECT and, to be used as a reference, cardiac MRI. Assessments of global
   and regional LV function provided by ordered-subsets expectation
   maximization (OSEM) with depth-dependant resolution recovery and
   temporal Fourier filtering were compared with those from conventional
   filtered backprojection (FBP) previously optimized by screening various
   filter frequencies and various temporal smoothing levels. Results: For
   both tracers, LV ejection fraction was determined best when the
   association of OSEM with depth-dependant resolution recovery was used
   alone, with temporal Fourier filtering, or with a slight 2-frame
   temporal smoothing: Mean absolute values of relative errors ranged from
   3.2\% to 3.6\% (4.0\%-7.9\% for FBP), and coefficient correlation ranged
   from 0.91 to 0.93 (0.70-0.91 for FBP). Among these 3 reconstruction
   methods, the association of OSEM with depth-dependant resolution
   recovery with temporal Fourier filtering provided the highest
   signal-to-noise ratio, with mean increases of 54\% for sestamibi and
   80\% for (TI)-T-201 when compared with FBP, and the best analysis of
   segmental contractility, with exact agreement rates with MRI being 73\%
   for (TI)-T-201 and 79\% for sestamibi. Conclusion: OSEM associated with
   temporal Fourier filtering and depth-dependant resolution recovery
   filtering enhances the LV function assessment provided by sestamibi and
   (TI)-T-201 16-interval gated SPECT and dramatically reduces image noise,
   a property that enhances and facilitates image interpretation.}},

Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{Background: Herpes simplex virus type 2 is common among MSM and is a
   risk factor for transmission of HIV. The findings of studies
   investigating the relationship between infection with HSV-2 and number
   of sex partners among MSM are inconsistent and rarely distinguish
   between male and female partners.
   Goal: To determine the prevalence and risk factors for infection with
   HSV-2, including the number and gender of sex partners, in a group of
   MSM in Baltimore, MD.
   Study: This was a cross-sectional study among young MSM in Baltimore.
   Results: Of the blood samples from 824 participants, 19.3\% had HSV-2
   antibodies. After adjusting for known HSV-2 correlates, independent
   predictors of HSV-2 seropositivity included HIV seropositivity, black
   race, older age, number of lifetime female sex partners, recent
   unprotected receptive anal intercourse with a man.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that female sex partners may be an
   important source of HSV-2 infection among young bisexual MSM. After
   adjusting for known HSV-2 correlates, the number of lifetime female but
   not male sex partners was independently associated with HSV-2. These
   results highlight the need for HSV-2 prevention and treatment efforts
   targeting MSM who also have sex with women. Future investigations of
   HSV-2 and sexual behavior among MSM need to distinguish between male and
   female sex partners.}},

Abstract = {{Hypothesis: The public health system has a specialized body of knowledge
   and expertise in bioterrorism and public health emergency management
   that can assist in the development and delivery of continuing medical
   education programs to meet the needs of emergency medical service
   providers. Methods: A nationally representative sample of the basic and
   paramedic emergency medical service providers in the United States was
   surveyed to assess whether they had received training in weapons of mass
   destruction, bioterrorism, chemical terrorism, radiological terrorism,
   and/or public health emergencies, and how the training was provided.
   Results: Local health departments provided little in the way of training
   in biologic, chemical, or radiological terrorism to responders
   (7.4\%-14.9\%) State health departments provided even less training
   (6.3\%-17.3\%) on all topics to emergency medical services providers.
   Training that was provided by the health department in bioterrorism and
   public health emergency response was associated with responder comfort
   in responding to a bioterrorism event (OR = 2.74, 95\% Cl = 2.68, 2.81).
   Conclusions: Local and state public health agencies should work with the
   emergency medical services systems to develop and deliver training with
   an all-hazards approach to disasters and other public health
   emergencies.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This Study, lasting LIP to 90 days, was undertaken in
   patients with osteoarthritis with persistent moderate to severe pain
   uncontrolled by standard therapy (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
   acetaminophen, and/or short-acting opioids) to evaluate functional
   outcomes, as well as efficacy and safety, of controlled-release
   oxycodone versus placebo.
   Methods: One hundred seven patients received either controlled-release
   oxycodone or placebo every 12 hours in this double blind, randomized,
   placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Stable previous regimens of
   acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents were allowed to
   continue. Primary efficacy variables included F Pain Inventory average
   pain intensity scores at completion of initial titration, Western
   Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores at days 30
   and 60, and the percentage of patients discontinuing due to inadequate
   pain control.
   Results: Controlled-release oxycodone was significantly superior to
   placebo in decreasing average pain intensity and in reducing
   pain-induced interference with general activity, walking ability (except
   at day 30), and normal work, as well as mood, sleep, relations with
   people (at days 60 and 90), and enjoyment in life. Daily functioning, as
   measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis
   Index, was also significantly improved in the controlled-release
   oxycodone group. In the placebo group, a significantly greater
   percentage of patients discontinued Clue to inadequate pain control.
   Adverse events were consistent with opioid adverse events, and no safety
   concerns were noted.
   Discussion: Treatment with controlled-release oxycodone of patients with
   osteoarthritis with persistent moderate to severe pain uncontrolled by
   standard therapy resulted in significant pain control and improvements
   in physical functioning.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents some of the motivations and main conclusions from a
   series of joint Nordic research initiatives in which an integrated
   research approach to the development of future generations of advanced
   fabricated structures have been employed. The integrated research
   approach includes coordinated efforts in several key technologies:
   high-speed welding processes, high strength materials, cost-effective
   NDE, post-weld treatments and FE-based design assessment tools.
   Traditionally, fatigue assessment methods for welded structures have
   been developed based on small-scale test specimens and verification
   studies for large structures are rarely published. Applications on
   complex structures have led to several new assessment concepts and areas
   for future work. A modified structural stress method that proposes a
   multi-linear stress distribution through the plate thickness is
   introduced. Also, a crack growth assessment method in which the
   constraint equations of a sub-model are linked to the global model is
   presented. Both these new methods are promising for complex structures.
   The crucial role of boundary conditions for complex structures is
   highlighted as is the future challenge of understanding and making use
   of the residual stress state for welded structures.}},

Abstract = {{Background Some cases of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) do not
   protrude above the skin.
   Objectives To assess the prevalence of these DFSPs and further to
   describe their presentation and course.
   Methods One hundred and forty-three patients were retrospectively
   collected. They were asked to complete a standardized questionnaire
   indicating the history and appearance of the DFSP from the first skin
   changes identified to the time of diagnosis.
   Results Eighty-one DFSPs were described as protuberant ab initio, and 62
   as initially nonprotuberant (npDFSP). The latter remained at this stage
   for a mean period of 7.6 years. Twenty-nine per cent of npDFSPs were
   `morphoea-like', 19\% were `atrophoderma-like' and 42\% were
   `angioma-like'. Age at diagnosis was similar for both initial
   presentations. npDFSPs were most often misdiagnosed by physicians.
   Conclusions Nearly half the patients first identified their early
   DFSP-related skin changes as patches. Both this frequency and the long
   duration at this preprotuberant stage should prompt dermatologists to
   consider the diagnosis of DFSP earlier, in order to make surgical
   treatment easier.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the effects of different concentrations of carbon
   dioxide and the presence of low levels of carbon monoxide on quality
   attributes throughout storage of fresh pork sausages. Four pork forelegs
   (initial pH 5.5-5.7) were used to prepare a total of 120 fresh sausages,
   which were packaged in different atmospheres containing
   (\%O-2/\%CO2/\%N-2): 0/20/80; 0/60/40; 40/20/40; 40/60/0; 80/20/0; and
   0.3\% CO/30\% CO2/rest argon. The packs were stored for 20 days at 2 +/-
   1 degrees C in the dark. Three packs for each atmosphere were opened
   every 4 days for subsequent analysis of pH, colour CIE L{*}, a{*}, b{*},
   TBARS formation, microbial psychotrophic aerobes and sensory
   discolouration and off-odour. Results showed that increasing
   concentrations of carbon dioxide promoted oxidation of both myoglobin
   and lipids, most probably due to its effect of lowering pH. Therefore,
   preservation of colour and odour of fresh pork sausages packaged in
   modified atmosphere was better achieved using atmospheres containing low
   CO2 concentrations (20\%) rather than high (60\%). However, their
   shelf-life depended also on the concentration Of O-2; 20\% CO2 with high
   O-2 (80\%) enhanced the red colour, but shortened shelf-life, while 20\%
   CO2 in the absence Of O-2 extended freshness to 16 days. The atmosphere
   containing 0.3\% CO, together with 30\% CO2, maintained the red colour
   for 20 days, but failed to keep fresh odour longer than 16 days. (C)

Abstract = {{Cod fillets were salted in brines with different pHs (6.5 and 8.5) and
   saline compositions. Water-holding capacity, protein extractability, dry
   matter, ion content and hardness in muscle were assessed to determine
   the effect of replacing NaCl with varying combinations of KCl, CaCl2
   and/or MgCl2. Discriminant and principal component analyses were
   performed to better understand the relationships between brine
   composition and functional properties of brined cod. Partial replacement
   of 50 \% NaCl with 50 \% KCI reduced penetration of Na+ into muscle, as
   did the addition of small amounts of CaCl2 (0.8 \%) and/or MgCl2 (0.4
   \%) to pH 6.5 brines. The use of 0.4 \% MgCl2 at pH 6.5 negatively
   affected functional properties and further hindered salt penetration
   into the muscle. The use of KCI in pH 8.5 brines increased hardness,
   negatively affecting protein water-extractability. Moreover, the
   addition of divalent salts, at basic pHs, slightly decreased
   water-holding capacity. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Parents' satisfaction with their child's orthodontic care: A comparison

Journal = {{PEDIATRIC DENTISTRY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{451-456}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this Study was to compare the quality of
   orthodontic care between orthodontists and pediatric dentists when
   measured by parental satisfaction.
   Methods: Six pediatric dentists and 5 orthodontists participated in the
   study. Quality of care was measured using the peer assessment rating
   (PAR) occlusal index, treatment duration, and parental satisfaction.
   Parental satisfaction was evaluated using a 25-item questionnaire
   measuring 3 dimensions: (1) treatment process; (2) psychosocial effects
   of treatment; and (3) treatment outcomes. The questionnaire items were
   scored on a scale of ``strongly disagree{''} to ``strongly agree.{''}
   Results: At baseline, no differences were seen in the gender, starting
   dentition, and permanent teeth extractions of patients treated by the
   orthodontist and pediatric dentists. Statistically significant
   differences were seen in patients': (1) pretreatment age; (2) race; (3)
   primary teeth extractions; (4) treatment stages; and (5) pre-PAR scores.
   No statistically significant differences between orthodontists and
   pediatric dentists were observed regarding overall parental satisfaction
   or the dimensions of satisfaction. These results did not change after
   controlling for potential confounding factors such as patient's age,
   gender, starting dentition, treatment stage, extraction recommendations,
   pre-PAR score, treatment duration, and percentage PAR reduction.
   Conclusions: The quality of orthodontic care, when measured by parental
   satisfaction, was similar between orthodontists and pediatric dentists.
   This indicates that, as far as parents are concerned, pediatric dentists
   performed orthodontic treatment to the same high standard as
   orthodontists.}},

Title = {{The independent impact of extended pattern biopsy on prostate cancer
   stage migration}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF UROLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{174}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1789-1793}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: There are many factors impacting stage migration for prostate
   cancer. The number of prostate core biopsies is known to increase
   detection of prostate cancers. It is still unknown whether the number of
   biopsies is an independent predictor of tumor size. This is important as
   a number of studies show that tumor volume is an independent predictor
   of cancer progression.
   Materials and Methods: Using the University of California, San Francisco
   Urologic Oncology database, a retrospective review of 378 patients
   undergoing radical prostatectomy by a single surgeon during 2000 to 2003
   was performed. Patient and tumor specific variables including age,
   prostate specific antigen (PSA), number of biopsies, biopsy Gleason
   grade, tumor volume in the surgical specimen and surgical specimen tumor
   grade were studied. Univariate and multivariate statistical methods
   including multiple and logistic regression were used to characterize
   patients by the number of biopsy cores. Tests of significance to
   identify predictors of tumor size were based on the partial F statistic
   and the likelihood ratio test.
   Results: A total of 317 eligible patients were studied, of whom 119 had
   6 biopsies and 198 had more than 6 biopsies. The 2 groups of patients
   were evenly matched in terms of age, PSA and Gleason sum, with no
   statistically significant differences observed. On univariate analysis,
   mean tumor volume was larger for patients receiving 6 core biopsies vs
   greater than 6 core biopsies (3.85 Vs 2.04 cc, p=0.0009). Additionally,
   statistically significant differences were observed when comparing
   median tumor volumes, as well as excluding extremely large volume
   tumors. On multivariate analysis the number of biopsies performed (6 vs
   more than 6), was an independent predictor of tumor size (p=0.006),
   controlling for primary Gleason score, Gleason sum, PSA as a continuous
   or categorical variable, year of biopsy and year of surgery.
   Conclusions: The use of extended pattern prostate biopsy templates
   results in the detection of smaller volume prostate cancers, independent
   of PSA and Gleason grade. These biopsy templates have contributed to the
   downward stage migration of prostate cancer detection and may possibly
   contribute to the risk of over detection.}},

Abstract = {{Background In congestive heart failure (CHF), it is unknown whether race
   affects mortality and whether the effect of treatments differs by race.
   Methods This study was a post hoc analysis of data from the DIG study
   that evaluated the effect of digoxin on morbidity and mortality in CHF.
   Results Investigators followed 897 black and 6660 white participants for
   a mean of 37 months. Compared with whites, blacks were younger (60 +/-
   13 vs 65 +/- 11 years). Total mortality was 34.2\% in blacks and 33.6\%
   in whites; hospitalization for worsening CHF occurred in 39\% of blacks
   and 28\% of whites. Cox regressions with race as the only covariate
   showed no effect of race on risk for death (relative risk = 1.04, 95\%
   CI 0.93-1.18, P = .49) but an increase in CHF hospitalization in blacks
   (relative risk = 1.52, 95\% CI 1.35-1.70, P = .0001). Multivariate Cox
   regression showed no difference by race in risk for death or
   death/hospitalization for CHF and no difference in the effect of digoxin
   on either end point.
   Conclusion Race is not an independent predictor of mortality in CHF. The
   effect of digoxin on morbidity and mortality in CHF does not differ in

   threshold cycle numbers. The curves showed a wide dynamic range
   (1,000,000-fold input) and high correlation values (> 0.99). The PCR
   amplification efficacy of the standard template was similar to that of
   intact genomic DNA obtained from peripheral blood with B. gibsoni
   infection. The detection limit of the assay was 9 parasites/mu l of
   blood with B gibsoni infection. The intra-assay and interassay
   coefficients of variation of the threshold cycles ranged from 0.70\% to
   1.89\% and from 1.18\% to 1.92\%, respectively. This assay system was

Abstract = {{The angular dependence of the reflectance from an absorbing randomly
   oriented polydomain medium consisting of domains either small or large
   compared with the wavelength is investigated. Besides the two
   conventional cases, where the refractive index of the incidence medium
   is either smaller or larger than the averaged index of refraction
   (small-domain limit) or every principal index of refraction of the
   domains (large-domain limit), we also discuss a third principal case,
   which exists only in the large-domain limit. In this third case, only
   one of the principal indices of refraction is larger than that of the
   incidence medium, while the averaged index of refraction is smaller.
   Thus, in contrast to the small-domain limit, total reflection is
   completely suppressed even in the absence of absorption. A
   characteristic property of such a polydomain medium is its ability to
   considerably depolarize linear polarized light in spite of being
   optically isotropic. Additionally, the parallel polarized reflectance R,
   can exceed the perpendicular polarized reflectance R, over certain angle
   of incidence ranges. Absorption decreases these domain-size-dependent
   properties, even under the assumption of constant anisotropy.
   Nevertheless, for materials with low absorption indices, these effects
   can affect the optical properties significantly. (c) 2005 Optical

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a new concept for wireless pulse-width modulation (PWM)
   control of a parallel dc-dc buck converter. It eliminates the need for
   multiple physical connections of gating/PWM signals among the
   distributed converter modules. The new scheme relies on radio-frequency
   (RF) based communication of the PWM control signals from a master to the
   slave modules. We analyze the system stability and demonstrate the
   experimental effectiveness of the wireless control scheme for a
   two-module parallel buck converter for 10-kHz and 20-kHz switching
   frequencies and for channel lengths of 1.5 and 15 ft, respectively. The
   proposed control concept may lead to easier distributed control
   implementation of parallel dc-dc converters and distributed power
   systems, and may lead to redundancy that is achievable using
   droop,method. It may also be used as a backup for wire-based control of
   parallel converters to provide fault tolerance.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Both {[}I-131]meta-iodobenzylguanidine ({[}I-131]MIBG) and the
   topoisomerase I inhibitor topotecan are effective as single-agent
   treatments of neuroblastoma. The aim of this study was to investigate
   the efficacy of {[}I-131] MIBG in combination with topotecan in vitro
   and in vivo.
   Experimental Design: The cell lines used were SK-N-BE(2c) (human
   neuroblastoma) and UVW/NAT (glioma cell line transfected with the
   noradrenaline transporter gene). Three different treatment schedules
   were assessed: topotecan given before (schedule 1), after (schedule 2),
   or simultaneously (schedule 3) with {[}I-131] MIBG. DNA strand breakage
   was evaluated by comet assay, and cytotoxicity was determined by
   clonogenic survival. Efficacy was also measured by growth delay of tumor
   xenografts in nude mice.
   Results: Combination schedules 2 and 3 caused more cytotoxicity than
   schedule 1. Similarly, significant DNA damage was observed following
   treatment schedules 2 and 3 (P < 0.005) but not schedule 1. The mean
   number of days fora doubling in volume of SK-N-BE (2c) tumors and a
   10-fold increase in volume of UVW/NAT tumors were 10.4 and 18.6
   (untreated), 19.7 and 25.3 (topotecan alone), 22.8 and 31.9
   ({[}I-131]MIBG alone), 26.3 and 37.1 (combination schedule 1), 34.3 and
   49.7 (combination schedule 2), and 53.2 and > 71 (combination schedule
   3), respectively. The highest rate of cure of both xenografts was
   observed following treatment with combination schedule 3.
   Conclusions: The combination of topotecan and {[}I-131] MIBG compared
   with either treatment alone gave rise to greater than additive DNA
   damage, clonogenic cell kill, and tumor growth delay. These effects were
   dependent on the scheduling of the two agents.}},

Abstract = {{Validation of surveillance data is necessary to ensure its scientific
   credibitity, to identify methodological problems within the surveillance
   programme, to help increase compliance and participation in the
   surveillance programme, and to identify data quality issues at local
   level. Surgical site infection surveillance (SSIS) in Scotland has been
   implemented in collaboration between Health Protection Scotland (HPS)
   and staff in acute divisions in Scotland. A team at HPS carried out a
   study to validate the SSIS data reported to them. The aims of the
   validation study were: (i) to measure the completeness of the
   denominator data; (ii) to measure the accuracy of all SSIS data items
   reported to HPS; and (iii) to determine the sensitivity, specificity,
   positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of
   the SSIs reported to HPS against the SSIs validated as part of this
   study. The methodology utilized for validation of SSIS data was based on
   an evaluation research approach. The evaluation research approach
   involves a range of investigative activities, aimed at judging the worth
   of a programme or practice, and measures SSIS in terms of structure,
   process and outcome. The completeness of the denominator and the means
   of identifying eligible patients was identified. Descriptive information
   about how SSIS data were collected and managed at hospital, {[}eve{[}
   was collated, and the accuracy and completeness of the reported SSIS
   data were measured by case note review of selected cases. SSIS data from
   27 hospitals in 15 acute divisions and one special health board were
   validated. The results indicated that a total of 91\% of the procedures
   carried out (denominator) during a specified three-month period were
   reported to HPS. The case notes validated over 90\% of records reported
   to HPS; however, there was variation in data quality between hospitals.
   The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of the SSIs reported to HPS
   were 96.7, 99.0, 94.6 and 99.4\%, respectively. Where problems with data
   were identified at local level, hospitals have been offered guidance to
   improve their data. As a result of this study, HPS are confident that
   the Scottish SSIS data are reliable and robust. (c) 2005 The Hospital

   background organisms and related, non-target species were detected at
   approximately 4.5 log(10) lower levels of sensitivity than H. pylori by
   this assay. A standard curve was generated for the method from analyses
   of filters containing known numbers of added H. pylori cells. Cell
   numbers on these filters were determined by staining with a
   species-specific fluorescent antibody and solid phase cytometry
   analyses. The mean detection sensitivity of the method was 10 H. pylori
   cells per filter with a 95\% confidence sensitivity of 40 cells and a
   95\% confidence precision interval of +/- 0.57 log(10) based on
   duplicate analyses of the samples. One liter drinking water samples from
   several locations in the US were inoculated with the same H. pylori cell
   suspensions used to generate the standard curve and gave measurements
   that were consistent with the standard curve suggesting that these

Abstract = {{Modification of commercial LC/MS instrumentation to allow both
   atmospheric pressure (AP) LC/MS and GC/MS is described. Advantages of
   this additional capability versus LC/MS alone include higher
   chromatographic resolution in the GC versus LC mode, greater peak
   capacity for complex mixture analysis, higher sensitivity for a variety
   of volatile compounds, and the ability to observe compounds of low
   polarity that are not readily observed in LC/MS. Advantages over
   conventional GC/MS include the ability to use higher carrier gas flow
   and shorter columns for passing less volatile materials through the gas
   chromatograph, selective ionization, and rapid switching between
   positive and negative ion modes. Other advantages include application of
   the enhanced capabilities of LC/MS instrumentation to GC/MS analyses
   such as cone voltage fragmentation, MSn, high mass resolution, and
   accurate mass measurement. Limitations of APGC/MS include the inability
   to observe saturated hydrocarbon and certain other highly nonpolar
   compounds and less odd-electron fragmentation for computer aided library
   searching. For some analyses, the limitation related to ionization of
   highly nonpolar compounds is advantageous, as is the simplified mass
   spectrum and easy molecular weight identification that results from less
   fragmentation observed in the AP ionization mode. (c) 2005 American

Abstract = {{The IC50 values of 14 drugs were determined in recombinantly expressed
   CYP2C9 (rCYP2C9) and human hepatocytes and the data used to simulate
   clinical area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) changes
   upon coadministration with prototypic CYP2C9 substrates. There was an
   excellent correlation between IC50, apparent values determined using
   diclofenac and naproxen as CYP2C9 substrates (r(2) = 0.82, p < 0.0001),
   with values being generally higher in the naproxen assay. After
   correcting for nonspecific binding, the IC50, unbound values were
   similar between the assays, for the majority of compounds. Two
   compounds, amiodarone and benzbromarone, demonstrated substrate-specific
   differences, activating naproxen O-demethylase to similar to 250\% of
   control activity at 1 mM and 1 mu M, respectively, while inhibiting
   diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation with IC50, apparent values of 3 mu M and
   0.04 mu M, respectively. CYP2C9 IC50, apparent values generated in human
   hepatocytes were systematically higher than those determined with
   rCYP2C9. After correcting for nonspecific binding, there was an
   excellent correlation of IC50, unbound values generated in the different
   milieu (r(2) = 0.88, p < 0.0001). The ratio of inhibitor concentration
   at the entrance to the liver to the inhibition constant ({[}I](in)/K-i)
   was used to simulate clinical delta AUC changes and compared with that
   observed in vivo. Where {[}I](in, total)/K-i, apparent was used, there
   were zero false negatives (observed delta AUC >= 2, predicted delta AUC
   < 2), eight correct assignations, and seven false positives (observed
   delta AUC <= 2, predicted delta AUC > 2. Where {[}I](in), (unbound)/K-i,
   (unbound) was used, there was one false negative, 14 correct
   assignations, and zero false positives. In summary, the data presented
   here suggest that for CYP2C9 interactions, the use of total liver
   inhibitor concentrations may indeed avoid false negatives, but more
   realistic predictions may be achieved using unbound liver inhibitor
   concentrations and unbound in vitro inhibition parameters.}},

Title = {{Advantages of terminating Zippy Estimation by Sequential Testing (ZEST)
   with dynamic criteria for white-on-white perimetry}},
Journal = {{OPTOMETRY AND VISION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose. A number of automated perimeters use the Zippy Estimation by
   Sequential Testing (ZEST) algorithm, which is an adaptive Bayesian
   method, for determining sensitivity measures. There are two popular
   rules for deciding when to terminate Bayesian procedures: (1) after a
   fixed number of presentations; or (2) when the probability density
   function (pdF) over all thresholds modified by the procedure becomes
   sufficiently narrow (a dynamic termination criterion). It has recently
   been argued that fixed termination criteria perform equally as well as
   dynamic criteria when applied in a fashion typical of laboratory-based
   visual psychophysics. Perimetry, however, has specific requirements; the
   tests must be very short, there is a wide range of possible
   sensitivities, and erroneous responses from the patient must be
   tolerated. This study used computer simulation to compare fixed and
   dynamic termination criteria for the ZEST algorithm using conditions
   typical of white-on-white perimetry. Methods. Eight ZEST procedures were
   compared using the following termination criteria: fixed termination
   after 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 presentations; dynamic termination when the
   standard deviation of the pdf was I dB, 1.5 dB, and 2 dB. Four patient
   error models were used: ideal, typical false-positive, typical
   false-negative, and unreliable patients. We also ran a version of ZEST
   that set the likelihood function exactly equal to the patient's
   frequency of seeing curve. Results. The mean absolute error and standard
   deviation of error in threshold measurement was higher for the fixed
   termination criteria than for dynamic termination criteria of the same
   average number of presentations. Conclusions. The results of our
   simulations indicate that dynamic procedures have some distinct benefits
   over fixed termination procedures when a minimum of presentations are
   required and response errors are made as in a white-on-white perimetric
   setting. Dynamic termination criteria are at least partially successful
   in expending more presentations when required to enhance test precision.}},

Abstract = {{Chemically defined media allow for a variety of metabolic studies that
   are not possible with undefined media. A defined medium, AM3, was
   created to expand the experimental opportunities for investigating the
   fermentative metabolism of succinate-producing Actinobacillus
   succinogenes. AM3 is a phosphate-buffered medium containing vitamins,
   minerals, NH4Cl as the main nitrogen source, and glutamate, cysteine,
   and methionine as required amino acids. A. succinogenes growth trends
   and end product distributions in AM3 and rich medium fermentations were
   compared. The effects of NaHCO3 concentration in AM3 on end product
   distribution, growth rate, and metabolic rates were also examined. The
   A. succinogenes growth rate was 1.3 to 1.4 times higher at an NaHCO3
   concentration of 25 mM than at any other NaHCO3 concentration, likely
   because both energy- producing metabolic branches (i.e., the
   succinate-producing branch and the formate-, acetate-, and
   ethanol-producing branch) were functioning at relatively high rates in
   the presence of 25 mM bicarbonate. To improve the accuracy of the A.
   succinogenes metabolic map, the reasons for A. succinogenes glutamate
   auxotrophy were examined by enzyme assays and by testing the ability of
   glutamate precursors to support growth. Enzyme activities were detected
   for glutamate synthesis that required glutamine or alpha-ketoglutarate.
   The inability to synthesize a-ketoglutarate from glucose indicates that
   at least two tricarboxylic acid cycle-associated enzyme activities are
   absent in A. succinogenes.}},

   Study design Prospective randomized `blinded' experimental trial.
   Methods The quality of induction, of anaesthesia (at 5-minute intervals)
   and of recovery were assessed in 93 badgers, given either one of three
   ketamine (K)-medetomidine (M)-butorphanol (B) combinations: group A - M
   K B at 20/40/80 mu g kg(-1); group B - M K B at 20/40/60 mu g kg(-1);
   and group C - M K B at 1 20/60/40 mu g kg(-1), or ketamine (K) alone at
   2 mg kg(-1) (group D). The assessor was ignorant of the combination
   administered. Physiological variables (heart and respiratory rates and
   rectal temperature) were measured at 5-minute intervals during
   anaesthesia. Gingival mucus membrane colour was also recorded.
   Results Induction to anaesthesia was most rapid with ketamine (2 mg
   kg(-1)) although induction quality did not differ between techniques.
   Ketamine used alone gave the poorest score for anaesthesia quality.
   Heart rate (HR) and scores for gingival mucus membrane colour were
   higher in animals anaesthetized with ketamine alone. Rectal temperature
   did not differ significantly between the techniques at any time during
   anaesthesia. Ketamine used alone produced the poorest quality of
   recovery.
   Conclusion and clinical relevance The M-K-B combinations investigated
   overcame several side effects associated with ketamine anaesthesia. but
   at the expense of more variable induction times, lower Hits. and poorer
   mucus membrane coloration.}},

   parameter to optimise the agreement between the experimental ferrite
   fraction curve, obtained by dilatometry, and the simulated ferrite
   fraction. A strong decrease of the gamma/alpha interface mobility is
   found when the austenitisation temperature decreases from 1373 to 1173
   K. A good agreement is obtained between the simulated microstructure and
   the actual microstructure observed after cooling. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Rhabdomyolysis is a common and potentially lethal clinical syndrome that
   results from acute muscle fiber necrosis with leakage of muscle
   constituents into blood. Myoglobinuria is the most significant
   consequence, leading to acute renal failure (ARF) in 15\%-33\% of
   patients with rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis occurs from inherited
   diseases, toxins, muscle compression or overexertion, or inflammatory
   processes, among other disorders. In some cases, no cause is found.
   We describe 475 patients from the Johns Hopkins Hospital inpatient
   records between January 1993 and December 2001 for the following
   discharge diagnosis codes: myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, myopathy,
   toxic myopathy, malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome,
   and polymyositis. Of 1362 patients, 475 patients with an acute
   neuromuscular illness with serum creatine kinase (CK) more than 5 times
   the upper limit of normal (> 975 IU/L) were included. Patients with
   recent myocardial infarction or stroke were excluded. The etiology was
   assigned by chart review. For all, the highest values of serum CK, serum
   creatinine and urine myoglobin, hemoglobin, and red blood cells were
   recorded. Forty-one patients had muscle biopsy within at least 2 months
   from. the onset of rhabdomyolysis.
   Of the 475 patients, 151 were female and 324 were male (median age, 47
   yr; range, 4-95 yr). Exogenous toxins were the most common cause of
   rhabdomyolysis, with illicit drugs, alcohol, and prescribed drugs
   responsible for 46\%. Among the medical drugs, antipsychotics, statins,
   zidovudine, colchicine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and
   lithium were the most frequently involved. In 60\% of all cases,
   multiple factors were present. In 11\% of all cases, rhabdomyolysis was
   recurrent. Underlying myopathy or muscle metabolic defects were
   responsible for 10\% of cases, in which there was a high percentage of
   recurrence, only 1 etiologic factor, and a low incidence of ARE In 7\%,
   no cause was found. ARF was present in 218 (46\%) patients, and 16 died
   (3.4\%). A linear correlation was found between CK and creatinine and
   between multiple factors and ARF, but there was no correlation between
   ARF and death or between multiple factors and death. Urine myoglobin
   detected by dipstick/ultrafiltration was positive in only 19\%.
   Toxins are the most frequent cause of rhabdomyolysis, but in most cases
   more than 1 etiologic factor was present. Patients using illicit drugs
   or on prescribed polytherapy are at risk for rhabdomyolysis. The absence
   of urine myoglobin, by qualitative assay, does not exclude
   rhabdomyolysis. With appropriate care, death is rare.}},

Abstract = {{Fresh Houttuynia cordata THUNB. is a Chinese materia medica generally
   used in Chinese medicine therapy. It possesses the actions of clearing
   heat, eliminating toxins, reducing swelling, discharging pus and
   relieving stagnation. However, dry H. cordata has traditionally been
   used in clinical application instead of the fresh counterpart. In this
   paper, the chemical profiles of H. cordata were established using
   fingerprinting techniques. A modified GC-MS method was developed in the
   comparison of fingerprints among fresh and dry herbs of H. cordata. It
   was shown that the varieties, as well as relative levels of chemical
   components, in the fresh herb were more abundant than in the dry
   counterpart. Fingerprinting profiles were found to be consistent for
   fresh herbs acquired from various production areas, but the relative
   abundance of peaks were varied. Besides, the chemical components among
   different medicinal portions of fresh herbs were found to be
   inconsistent. The developed fingerprint can be successfully applied to
   distinguish between fresh and dry herbs, as well as determining
   differentiation among different medicinal portions.}},

Title = {{Surgery or assisted reproduction? A decision analysis of treatment costs

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF UROLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{174}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1926-1931}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Assisted reproductive technology (ART), including in vitro
   fertilization and intracytoplasmic sperm injection, is routinely used to
   treat male factor infertility. Because of the success of ART, the
   optimal method to achieve pregnancy with male infertility is
   controversial. Two examples in which ART competes with traditional male
   infertility treatments are varicocelectomy and vasectomy reversal. We
   used formal decision analysis to estimate and compare the
   cost-effectiveness of surgical therapy and ART for varicocele and
   vasectomy reversal.
   Materials and Methods: Decision analysis models were created for
   infertile men seeking paternity with varicocele and with post-vasectomy
   obstruction. Outcome probabilities applied to the model were derived
   from institutional and published sources. Costs of interventions were
   calculated from institutional data. Sensitivity analyses determined
   which elements were most important and, thus, were used to calculate
   threshold values.
   Results: Vasectomy reversal is as cost-effective as ART if bilateral
   vasovasostomy can be performed. However, if unilateral or bilateral
   vasoepididymostomy is required, sperm retrieval/ intracytoplasmic sperm
   injection may be more cost-effective due to lower patency rates.
   Vasectomy reversal is more cost-effective across all pregnancy rates
   provided that patency rates are greater than 79\%. Surgical repair of
   varicocele is more cost-effective when the postoperative pregnancy rate
   is greater than 14\% in men with a preoperative total motile sperm count
   of less than 10 million sperm and greater than 45\% in men with greater
   than 10 million total motile sperm.
   Conclusions: A decision analysis based comparison of ART and classic
   surgical therapy suggests that varicocelectomy and vasectomy reversal
   are the most economical treatments in many cases of infertility due to
   these lesions. Tailoring the decision models to individual centers
   permits more accurate comparisons using specific costs as well as the
   surgical outcomes and results of ART.}},

Abstract = {{Accelerated atherosclerosis in dialysis patients is characterized by
   severe vascular calcification, and the magnitude of vascular
   calcification is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality.
   Calcification-dependent arterial stiffness is considered to be a major
   determinant of cardiac failure in uremia.
   Fetuin-A/alpha(2)-Heremans-Schmid glycoprotein is an abundant serum
   protein with powerful calcification inhibitory properties. Fetuin-A
   deficiency was recently linked to cardiovascular mortality in dialysis
   patients. Fetuin-A knockout (fetuin-KO) mice spontaneously develop
   widespread soft tissue calcification, including significant myocardial
   calcification, whereas larger arteries are spared. Therefore, this
   investigation offers the unique opportunity to study the functional role
   of isolated myocardial calcification independent of arterial stiffness
   by assessing the hemodynamics of fetuin-KO mice. Cardiac output in
   fetuin-KO mice was lower than in wild-type mice (fetuin-KO 1.81 +/- 0.18
   versus WT 2.45 +/- 0.29 ml/min per g; P < 0.005), and fetuin-KO mice
   were refractory to dobutamine stimulation. Left ventricular relaxation
   was significantly impaired in fetuin-KO hearts with the relaxation index
   reduced by 23\% (P < 0.005). After ischemia, fetuin-KO hearts displayed
   a continuous decline in left ventricular developed pressure after the
   initial phase of reperfusion, resulting in 77 +/- 15\% of preischemic
   left ventricular developed pressure (P < 0.05 versus wild-type). In
   fetuin-KO mice, dystrophic cardiac calcification, with myocardial
   calcium contents increased 60-fold, was associated with profound
   induction of profibrotic TGF-beta; and downstream collagen and
   fibronectin mRNA synthesis. In conclusion, independent of arterial
   stiffness, calcification-associated ``myocardial stiffness{''}
   characterized by cardiac fibrosis, diastolic dysfunction, impaired
   tolerance to ischemia, and catecholamine resistance thus may constitute
   an underestimated cardiovascular risk factor that contributes to cardiac
   failure in calcification-prone states.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Computer-aided technologies have been recently employed for use
   in extracorporeal bone tissue engineering strategies. In this pilot
   animal experimental study, the intention was to test whether autologous
   osteoblast-like cells cultured in vitro on individualized scaffolds can
   be used to support bone regeneration in a clinical environment.
   Materials and Methods: For this purpose, mandibular bone defects were
   surgically introduced into the mandibles of minipigs and the scaffold of
   the defect site was modeled by computer-aided design/computer-aided
   manufacturing technique. Autologous bone cells from porcine calvaria
   were harvested from minipigs and grown in culture. Cells were seeded on
   scaffolds generated by rapid prototyping of polylactic acid/polyglycolic
   acid copolymers. The defects were then reconstructed by implanting the
   tissue constructs. Results: The intraoperative sites as well as the
   postoperative computerized tomographic scans demonstrated an accurate
   fit in the defect sites. The implanted scaffold constructs enriched with
   osteoblast-like cells were well tolerated and appeared to support bone
   formation, as revealed by histologic and immunohistochemical analyses.
   Discussion: These results indicated that in vitro expanded
   osteoblast-like cells spread on a resorbable individualized scaffold can
   be capable of promoting the repair of bony defects in vivo. Conclusion:
   These results warrant further attempts to combine computer modeling and
   tissue engineering for use in bone reconstructive surgery.}},

Abstract = {{A method for the determination of ochratoxin A ( OTA) in sultanas from
   Turkey using extraction with a sodium bicarbonate solution ( 2\% NaHCO3)
   followed by immunoaffinity clean-up and liquid chromatography with
   fluorescence detection was used to assess the frequency of occurrence
   and level of OTA. In-house validation was carried out with spiked
   samples at levels of 0.15, 1.5, 5.0 and 10 mu g kg(-1) and average
   recoveries were 91, 93, 87 and 89\%, respectively. The limits of
   detection and limit of quantification in Turkish sultanas were 0.026 and
   0.09 mu g kg(-1), respectively. A survey for the presence of OTA was
   carried out on 264 unprocessed sultana samples during the production
   seasons between 1998 and 2000 collected annually from vineyards and from
   packing-houses. The analyses of unprocessed sultanas showed that 32.2\%
   of the total number of samples contained no detectable OTA, whereas
   9.8\% of sultana samples had OTA concentrations above 10 mu g kg(-1),
   and the remaining 58\% had levels within the range 0.026-10 mu g kg(-1).
   There were big differences in median concentrations between years.
   Considering the year of production, it appears that sultanas produced in
   1998 and 2000 showed the lowest incidence of OTA contamination ( median
   < 0.02 mu g kg(-1)), whereas 2002 showed the highest incidence ( median
   4.3 mu g kg(-1)1). The overall mean OTA concentration was calculated as
   3.4 mu g kg(-1), and the overall median as 0.9 mu g kg(-1). Among the
   samples analysed, the highest detected level of OTA was 54 mu g kg(-1).}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. We report four cases of unusual presentation of colonic cancer
   revealed by an abscess of the abdominal wall.
   Materials and methods. Our study included 3 men and I women ranging in
   age from 33 to 66 years presenting with abdominal wall abscess (in the
   left anterior abdominal wall in 2 patients and in the quadratus lumborum
   muscle in the other 2 patients). Our cases were listed from the
   departments of radiology and abdominal surgery of Sahloul hospital from
   1995 through 2000. Ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT)
   were performed in all cases; barium enema in three.
   Results. US and CT revealed segmental colonic wall thickening (left
   colon in three patients and right colon in one patient). The diagnosis
   of colonic cancer was reached by colonoscopy with biopsy in all 4 cases.
   All of our patients underwent surgical treatment.
   Conclusion. In this era of newer diagnostic imaging modalities, US and
   CT must frequently be used in the evaluation of patients with abdominal
   wall abscess, to depict intra-abdominal infection and especially
   malignant lesion causing abdominal wall abscess.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{2546-2559}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Telomeres are complex structures that serve to protect chromosome ends.
   Here we provide evidence that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae telomeres may
   contain an anticheckpoint activity that prevents chromosome ends from
   signaling cell cycle arrest. We found that an internal tract of
   telomeric repeats inhibited DNA damage checkpoint signaling from
   adjacent double-strand breaks (DSBs); cell cycle arrest lasted 8-12 h
   from a normal DSB, whereas it lasted only 1-2 h from a DSB adjacent to a
   telomeric repeat. The shortened or abridged arrest was not the result of
   DNA repair, nor reduced amounts of single-stranded DNA, nor of
   adaptation. The molecular identity of this telomere repeat-associated
   anticheckpoint activity is unknown, though it is not dependent upon
   telomerase or telomere-proximal gene silencing. The anticheckpoint may
   inhibit the ATR yeast ortholog Mec1 because Rad9 and Rad53 became
   dephosphorylated and inactivated during the abridged arrest. The
   anticheckpoint acts regionally; it inhibited signaling from DNA breaks
   up to 0.6 kb away from the telomeric repeat but not from a DSB present
   on a separate chromosome. We propose that after formation of the DSB
   near the telomeric repeat, a mature telomere forms in 1-2 h, and the
   telomere then contains proteins that inhibit checkpoint signaling from
   nearby DNA breaks.}},

Title = {{Nursing intervention after carotid endarterectomy: a randomized trial of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Aim: This paper reports a study evaluating the short-term impact of
   nursing-led, co-ordinated care after discharge following carotid
   endarterectomy.
   Background: Patient education about stroke risk factors, combined
   systematically with carotid endarterectomy, holds unrealized potential
   to improve patient outcomes. Nurses are well-placed in the healthcare
   system to co-ordinate this type of education.
   Method: A randomized controlled trial was conducted between October 2001
   and October 2002. Patients having carotid endarterectomy (n = 133) were
   randomized to either the intervention (n = 66) or control group (n =
   67). The intervention consisted of telephone liaison with the patient by
   a Registered Nurse at 2, 6 and 12 weeks following carotid
   endarterectomy, combined with education about stroke risk factor
   management and structured liaison with the patient's surgeon and
   referring general practitioner. While patients allocated to the control
   group did not receive any postoperative telephone contact directly from
   the Registered Nurse during the study, their general practitioners
   received structured postoperative liaison.
   Results: The co-ordinated care postdischarge intervention had a
   statistically significant positive effect on patient knowledge of stroke
   warning signs (P = 0.002), patient self-reported changes to improve
   lifestyle (P = 0.006) and diet modification (P < 0.001). Statistically
   significant improvements from baseline to follow-up were detected in
   both groups for other outcomes.
   Conclusion While nursing-led, co-ordinated care after discharge achieves
   important improvements for short-term outcomes, carotid endarterectomy
   itself may have been a catalyst for improved patient outcomes. Further
   research of nursing-led co-ordinated care initiatives for vascular
   surgery patients is needed.}},

Title = {{Foraging behaviour of Armillaria rhizomorph systems}},
Journal = {{MYCOLOGICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{109}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1195-1207}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The foraging behaviour of Armillaria rhizomorph systems is poorly
   understood owing to their cryptic position within the soil. We
   investigated foraging in a homogeneous environment (i.e. agar), finding
   that rhizomorph systems of the more parasitic species, A. mellea, A.
   ostoyae, and A. tabescens, lacked melanin and the approximately
   cylindrical cord-like form observed in the field. In contrast,
   rhizomorph systems of the more saprotrophic species, A. calvescens, A.
   gallica, and A. sinapina, developed radially resembling those in the
   field. For the three saprotrophic Armillaria species, the number of
   rhizomorph tips, total rhizomorph length and total rhizomorph surface
   area were significantly positively correlated with increasing rhizomorph
   system diameter and elapsed time in two developmental tests. However,
   the fractal dimension (D), used as a measure of foraging intensity, was
   temporally invariable, suggesting that one component of foraging
   behaviour is innate. In a heterogeneous environment (i.e. sand) and in
   the absence of a potential nutrient source, we observed that rhizoniorph
   systems of A. gallica most often developed asymmetrically. While
   rhizomorph foraging was unresponsive to the lateral placement of an
   uncolonised stem segment, we were able to demonstrate directional growth
   toward an uncolonised Quercus velutina stem segment placed above or
   below the colonised source stem segment. When neighboring rhizomorph
   systems were conspecific genets of A. gallica, we observed that the
   growth of one rhizomorph system was directed toward zones unoccupied by
   its neighbour. However, the foraging intensity of the neighbouring
   genets, as measured by fractal dimension (D), was unaffected by the
   proximity of a neighbour. When neighbouring rhizomorph systems
   represented different species (A. gallica and A. mellea), A. gallica
   rhizomorph systems produced more total length and more foraging tips but
   concentrated their rhizomorph production away from the neighbouring A.
   mellea genet. In contrast, A. mellea rhizomorph systems produced
   significantly more foraging tips per unit length, both overall and in
   the zone of confrontation with the neighbouring A. gallica genet. Our
   observations are consistent with field observations of territoriality
   among Armillaria genets, and provide evidence that rhizomorph systems of
   more parasitic Armillaria spp. are able to compete effectively with the
   larger rhizomorph systems of more saprotrophic Armillaria species.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The magnitude of atrophy and strength loss induced by partial
   or complete disuse of skeletal muscles varies greatly among individuals.
   Factors predisposing some individuals to more extreme responses have not
   been identified. The purpose of this investigation was to determine
   whether 1) level of activity before disuse or 2) sex differences
   influence the magnitude of atrophy and changes in muscle strength,
   endurance, and sense of muscular effort in response to 21 d of arm
   suspension. Methods: Thirty-one individuals (18 women, 13 men) completed
   either 8 wk of resistance training (TRAINED group) or no training
   (UNTRAINED group) before 21 d of elbow muscle arm suspension achieved by
   having one arm in a sling tethered to the body by a swathe. Muscle
   volume was measured using serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   cross-sectional images. Functional measurements included maximal
   isometric force (MIF) for elbow flexion, one-repetition maximum (1RM)
   for biceps curl, number of repetitions to fatigue at 50\% of 1RM, and
   sense of muscular effort measured using a force-matching task. Results:
   Flexor muscle volume decreased (P < 0.001) by -7.7 +/- 7.3\% across all
   subjects. The decrease (P < 0.001) in flexor muscle volume was
   significant in men but not women. Arm suspension induced decreases (P <
   0.001) in MIF and 1RM that did not differ across sex or training groups.
   The number of repetitions to fatigue decreased (P < 0.05) in the
   UNTRAINED but not TRAINED groups. No changes in sense of muscular effort
   were measured. Conclusion: The smaller initial muscle size or
   sex-specific factors attenuated muscle loss but not strength or
   endurance losses in females during disuse. Resistance training before
   disuse may attenuate the loss in muscular endurance.}},

Abstract = {{Catch-and-release fishing commonly occurs in recreational fisheries,
   including those for the striped bass Morone saxatilis of the Atlantic
   coast. The contribution of catch-and-release practices to overall
   fishing mortality is often not estimated. We estimated the
   catch-and-release mortality for the Hudson River spawning stock of
   striped bass in 2001. Volunteer anglers caught striped bass between
   April 30 and May 16, 2001. Fish were transferred to transport boats in
   live wells and placed in one of nine 15,000-L land-based holding tanks.
   Control fish were collected by electrofishing and otherwise handled
   similarly. Treatment and control fish were uniquely tagged and held
   together for 5 d. Hooking mortality was estimated via conditional rate
   and additive rates. These two estimation technique.,; partitioned total
   observed mortality into hooking mortality and handling mortality, the
   latter being estimated from control fish. Catch-and-release mortality
   for striped bass averaged 16\% for traditional J hooks and 5\% for
   circle hooks over the entire period. Hook location and the occurrence of
   bleeding were the most influential variables in determining the
   probability of death. Mortality rate increased when water temperatures
   reached 16 degrees C. This mortality rate is significant and should be
   considered when accounting for Hudson River striped bass removals from
   their spawning population.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Preclinical evaluation is an essential step in the assessment
   of new antiinflammatory or analgesic drugs. This study was undertaken to
   develop a new mode of evaluation of drug effectiveness based on behavior
   indicating well-being in a rat model of chronic inflammatory pain. We
   chose to examine the circadian pattern of spontaneous behavior.
   Methods. The work was performed with a model of chronic monarthritis
   induced by Freund's complete adjuvant. Variations in behavioral patterns
   during the time course of arthritis were analyzed. In a second phase,
   the impact of acetaminophen and 2 nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs
   (aspirin and celecoxib), which are currently used in clinical practice
   to treat chronic inflammation, was studied after 7 days of treatment.
   Results. The nocturnal pattern of activity of healthy rats comprised 3
   main bursts. Chronic painful monarthritis altered this spontaneous
   pattern of nocturnal behavior (normal period of activity). Monarthritic
   rats showed a decrease in the total time spent in activity during the
   night, and lost their pattern of activity. These behavioral disturbances
   were reversed after long-term treatment with acetaminophen or celecoxib,
   with celecoxib appearing to be more effective. Aspirin was ineffective.
   Conclusion. These results enabled us to test this new procedure as a
   means of assessing well-being or ill-being during stages of chronic
   inflammatory pain in rats, and the effectiveness of repeated
   pharmacologic treatments.}},

Abstract = {{The coding regions for the N-domain, and full length
   peridinin-chlorophyll a apoprotein (full length PCP), were expressed in
   Escherichia coli. The apoproteins formed inclusion bodies from which the
   peptides could be released by hot buffer. Both the above constructs were
   reconstituted by addition of a total pigment extract from native PCP.
   After purification by ion exchange chromatography, the absorbance,
   fluorescence excitation and CD spectra resembled those of the native
   PCP. Energy transfer from peridinin to Chl a was restored and a specific
   fluorescence activity calculated which was similar to 86\% of that of
   native PCP. Size exclusion analysis and CD spectra showed that the
   N-domain PCP dimerized on reconstitution. Chl a could be replaced by Chl
   b, 3-acetyl Chl a, Chl d and Bchl using the N-domain apo protein. The
   specific fluorescence activity was the same for constructs with Chl a,
   3-acetyl Chl a, and Chl d but significantly reduced for those made with
   Chl b. Reconstitutions with mixtures of chlorophylls were also made with
   eg Chl b and Chl d and energy transfer from the higher energy Qy band to

Abstract = {{Objective: This study assessed the efficacy of 1) matching patients to
   treatments and 2) adding additional family therapy or cognitive therapy
   in a group of recently discharged patients with major depression.
   Method: Patients with major depression were recruited during a
   psychiatric hospitalization. After discharge, they were randomly
   assigned to one of four treatment conditions that were either
   ``matched{''} or ``mismatched{''} to their pattern of cognitive
   distortion and family impairment. The four treatment conditions were 1)
   pharmacotherapy alone; 2) combined pharmacotherapy and cognitive
   therapy; 3) combined pharmacotherapy and family therapy; and 4) combined
   pharmacotherapy, cognitive therapy, and family therapy. Randomly
   assigned treatment continued for 24 weeks on an outpatient basis.
   Results: Among patients with at least moderate depressive symptoms at
   hospital discharge, low rates of remission (16\%) and improvement (29\%)
   were obtained. Matched treatment led to a significantly greater
   proportion of patients who improved and greater reductions over time in
   interviewer-rated depressive symptoms than mismatched treatment.
   However, matched treatment did not produce greater change in
   self-reported depression or interviewer-rated suicidal ideation.
   Treatment that included a family therapy component also led to a greater
   proportion of patients who improved and to significant reductions in
   interviewer-rated depression and suicidal ideation than treatment
   without family therapy.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that 1) current treatments are not
   very efficacious in the aftercare of hospitalized depressed patients, 2)
   treatment matching moderately improves outcome for patients who are
   symptomatic at hospital discharge, and 3) inclusion of family therapy
   improves the outcome of posthospital care for depressed patients.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To determine the neurodevelopmental outcome of prematurely
   born newborns with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities.
   Study design A total of 89 prematurely born newborns (median age 28
   weeks postgestation) were studied with MRI when stable for transport to
   MRI (median age, 32 weeks postgestation); 50 newborns were studied again
   near term age (median age, 37 weeks). Neurodevelopmental outcome was
   determined at 18 months adjusted age (median) using the Mental
   Development Index (Bayley Scales Infant Development 11) and a
   standardized neurologic exam.
   Results Of 86 neonatal survivors, outcome was normal in 51 (59\%),
   borderline in 22 (26\%). and abnormal in 13 (15\%). Moderate/severe MRI
   abnormalities were common on the first (37\%) and second (32\%) scans.
   Abnormal outcome was associated with increasing severity of white matter
   in jury, ventriculomegaly, and intraventricular hemorrhage on MIU. as
   well as moderate/severe abnormalities on the first (relative risk {[}RR]
   = 5.6. P =.002) and second MRI studies (RR = 5.3; P=.03). Neuromotor
   abnormalities on neurologic examination near term age (RR = 6.5; P =.04)
   and postnatal infection (RR = 4.0; P = 01) also increased the risk for
   abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome.
   Conclusions In premature newborns, brain abnormalities are common on MRI
   early in life and are associated with adverse neurodevelopmental

Abstract = {{Intensive pastoralism with goats transforms semiarid thicket in the
   Eastern Cape, South Africa from a dense vegetation of tall shrubs to an
   open landscape dominated by ephemeral grasses and forbs. Approx. 800 000
   ha of thicket (which prior to the introduction of goats had a closed
   canopy and a Portulacaria afra Jacq. component) have been transformed in
   this manner. Ecosystem C storage in intact thicket and loss of C due to
   transformation were quantified. Carbon storage in intact thicket was
   surprisingly high for a semiarid region, with an average of 76 t C
   ha(-1) in living biomass and surface litter and 133 t C ha(-1) in soils
   to a depth of 30 cm. Exceptional C accumulation in thicket may be a
   result of P. afra dominance. This succulent shrub switches between C-3
   and CAM photosynthesis, produces large quantities of leaf litter
   (approx. 450 g m(-2) year(-1)) and shades the soil densely. Transformed
   thicket had approx. 35\% less soil C to a depth of 10 cm and approx.
   75\% less biomass C than intact thicket. Restoration of transformed
   thicket landscapes could consequently recoup more than 80 t C ha(-1).}},

Abstract = {{Age-related impaired wound healing states lead to substantial morbidity
   and cost, with treatment in the USA resulting in an expenditure of over
   \$9 billion per annum. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a ubiquitous
   adrenal hormone with immunomodulatory properties whose levels decline
   significantly with advanced age in humans. Conversion of DHEA locally to
   downstream steroid hormones leads to estrogenic and/or androgenic
   effects which may be important in age-related skin homeostasis, and
   which would avoid systemic adverse effects related to estrogen. We
   report that systemic DHEA levels are strongly associated with protection
   against chronic venous ulceration in humans. DHEA accelerated impaired
   healing in an impaired healing model (mice rendered hypogonadal)
   associated with increased matrix deposition and dampens the exaggerated
   inflammatory response. Such effects were mediated by local conversion of
   DHEA to estrogen, acting through the estrogen receptor, and vitro
   studies suggest a direct effect on specific pro-inflammatory cytokine
   production by macrophages via mitogen activated kinase (MAP) and
   phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3) kinase pathways. In addition, we show that
   local injection of DHEA accelerates impaired healing in an ageing mouse
   colony. We suggest that exogenous application of DHEA accelerates
   impaired wound repair, results which may be applicable to the
   prophylaxis and treatment of human impaired wound healing states.}},

Abstract = {{Optical imaging in biomedicine is governed by the light absorption and
   scattering interaction on microscopic and I macroscopic constituents in
   the medium. Therefore, light scattering characteristics of human tissue
   correlate with the stage of some diseases. In the near infrared range
   the scattering event with the coefficient approximately two orders of
   magnitude greater than absorption plays a dominant role. When measuring
   the optical parameters variations were discovered that correlate with
   the rheumatoid arthritis of a small joint. The potential of an
   experimental setup for transillumination of the finger joint with a
   laser diode and the pattern of the stray light detection are
   demonstrated. The scattering caused by skin contains no useful
   information and it can be removed by a deconvolution technique to
   enhance the diagnostic value of this non-invasive optical method. Monte
   Carlo simulations ensure both the construction of the corresponding
   point spread function and the theoretical verification of the stray
   light picture in rather complex geometry.}},

Abstract = {{Drawing on an empirical study of IT outsourcing in the UK and Germany,
   this paper explores the lessons for modularity that can be drawn from
   the outsourcing of knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS). Because
   of the inseparability of information and production technologies, IT
   outsourcing is frequently accompanied by wider transformations in
   clients' production technologies. This results in the need for knowledge
   and organisational coordination in the form of the transfer of staff
   from the client and the retained IT organisation. Modularity is often
   presented as a design strategy that stimulates innovation. Our research
   findings challenge the generalisability of this claim when examining
   KIBS outsourcing. We show that intangibility of services exacerbates the
   conflicts between clients and suppliers, which may present obstacles to
   innovation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Serotonergic (5-HT) neurons are implicated in modulating nociceptive
   transmission. It is established that 5-HT neuronal activity is enhanced
   by rhythmic behaviors such as chewing and locomotion in animals. We thus
   hypothesized that 5-HT descending inhibitory pathways may be enhanced by
   rhythmic behavior of gum chewing in humans. To evaluate this idea, we
   examined nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR), while a subject chewed gum
   rhythmically for 20 min. NFR was elicited by electrical stimulation of
   the sural nerve, and the evoked potential was recorded from the biceps
   femoris muscle. Visual analogue scale (VAS) was also obtained. To assess
   5-HT activity, we determined 5-HT levels quantitatively in platelet poor
   plasma (PPP) and whole blood (WB) using HPLC system. Both NFR area and
   VAS were significantly decreased at 5 min after the onset of chewing and
   these reductions persisted until cessation of chewing. There were no
   significant changes in NFR and VAS while resting without chewing. The
   PPP 5-HT level increased significantly just after cessation of chewing
   and had returned to the pre-chewing level by 30 min after cessation of
   chewing. The WB 5-HT level obtained 30 min after cessation of chewing
   was significantly greater than the pre-chewing level. Serotonin
   transporters have recently been discovered at the blood-brain barrier,
   suggesting that the rise in blood 5-HT may possibly reflect an increase
   in 5-HT level within the brain. The present results support our
   hypothesis that the rhythmic behavior of chewing suppresses nociceptive
   responses via the 5-HT descending inhibitory pathway. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Interannual and long-term variations of the characteristics of
   atmospheric centers of action (ACAs) in the Northern Hemisphere are
   analyzed. Different empirical data covering the period from the late
   19th to the early 21st century and the reanalysis data are used. The
   emphasis is on the detection of significant changes in ACA
   characteristics in winter, when the long-term surface warming is most
   considerable. Statistically significant tendencies toward the
   intensification of the Aleutian Low and of the North Atlantic centers of
   action in the second half of the 20th century are noted. The tendencies
   of change in the behavior of the Siberian High obtained from different
   empirical data differ from one another. A statistically significant
   connection of the North Pacific centers of action with El Nino/La Nina
   events is noted. During El Nino (La Nina), the Aleutian High deepens
   (weakens) and shifts eastward (westward) and the Hawaiian High weakens
   (intensifies) and , moves southward (northward). It is pointed out that
   there was an increase in the correlation of the characteristics of the
   North Pacific centers of action with sea-surface temperature in the El
   Nino and La Nina region at the end of the 20th century. Wavelet analysis
   shows that the four- to six-year cyclicity of the Aleutian and Hawaiian
   centers of action, which is inherent in El Nino, rengthened by the end
   of the 20th century.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Ultrasound scans provide the basis for detection of
   intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) but often fail to distinguish
   IUGR from small-for-gestational age (SGA) fetuses. This study introduces
   the concept of Z-velocity, calculated as changes in Z-scores over time,
   as an additional criterion in the diagnosis of IUGR.
   Methods: A computer program simulated 50 000 fetal abdominal
   circumference (FAC) scans based on published growth formulae.
   False-positive rates were calculated to determine optimal scan time and
   scan intervals. Using an independent simulation of 32 500 FAC scans, the
   two methods were compared using receiver-operating characteristics (ROC)
   curve analysis.
   Results: ROC showed areas under the curve of > 0.74 over the complete
   range of scan intervals. The positive predictive value of growth arrest
   as the only diagnostic criterion was, however, too low to recommend it
   as an exclusive or the first diagnostic criterion.
   Conclusions: Z-velocity can be used to decide whether further
   investigations for growth abnormality are required in fetuses that fall
   below the 10(th) percentile. The gain of combined diagnostic approaches
   should be calculated from large databases that include the neonatal
   ponderal index as the gold standard. Copyright (c) 2005 ISUOG.}},

Abstract = {{Background Atrio-oesophageat fistula has been reported as a rare but
   life-threatening complication of ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF).
   Therefore, the position of the oesophagus in relation to the left atrium
   (LA) is of major importance for AF ablation.
   Methods and results In order to investigate the possible anatomical
   variability between the oesophagus and the left atrium,
   muLtidetector-row spiral computed tomography (MDCT) of 60 healthy mates
   (age 58.1 +/- 5.1 years; LA diameter 5.4 +/- 0.7 x 3.8 +/- 0.6 cm; LA
   volume 60.5 +/- 15.4 ml) was analyzed. The distance between the
   oesophagus and the ostia of the pulmonary veins (PV) ranged between 0
   and 50.7 mm. Especially for the left PV, the oesophagus was closer than
   5 mm to the ostia in 29 cases (48\%; n = 24 for left superior PV; n = 10
   for left inferior PV; n = 0 for right superior PV; n = 1 for right
   inferior PV). In addition, the oesophagus was very close to the LA watt
   (0.8 +/- 0.9 mm; range 0-3.3 mm). Intraobserver variability was 1.1 +/-
   0.7 mm or 3.5\%.
   Conclusion The position of the oesophagus in relation to the LA and the
   PV demonstrates high variability. In many cases, the oesophagus is very
   close to the ostia of the PVs and ties only a short distance from the LA
   wall. Thus, an anatomical localization of the oesophagus may be critical
   before or during AF ablation to prevent atrio-oesophageal fistula,
   especially as there is a need for transmural atrial lesions. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine the thermal resistance of
   spores of Bacillus anthracis and potential surrogates. The heat
   resistance of spores suspended in buffer (pH 7.0 or 4.5), milk, or
   orange juice was determined at 70, 80, and 90 degrees C. D-values for B.
   anthracis strains Sterne, Vollum, and Pasteur ranged from < 1 min at 90
   degrees C to similar to 200 min at 70 degrees C and were lower under
   acidic than under neutral conditions. The D-values for B. anthracis
   spores fell within the range obtained for spores from eight strains of
   Bacillus cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus mycoides, and Bacillus
   subtilis. However, there were significant differences (P < 0.001) among
   the D-values of the strains. The z-values in pH 7.0 buffer and milk
   averaged similar to 10.5 degrees C and were not significantly different
   among strains (P < 0.05). The z-values in pH 4.5 buffer and orange juice
   averaged 12.9 and 13.9 degrees C, respectively, significantly (P < 0.05)
   higher than those obtained in milk or in pH 7.0 buffer. The significance
   of this difference was driven by large differences among a few strains.
   The z-values for B. anthracis strain Pasteur were twice as high in the
   acid media than in the neutral media. This study confirms that B.
   anthracis spores are not unusually heat resistant and that spores from
   validated Bacillus species are appropriate surrogates for thermal
   resistance studies.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To directly measure dynamic intraocular pressure (IOP)
   during vitrectomy and to determine whether disposable pressure
   transducers placed in the infusion line can indirectly measure with
   accuracy the dynamic IOP during vitrectomy.
   Methods: Experimental clinical study of 10 patients undergoing
   vitrectomy. Dynamic IOP was sampled via an extra pars plana incision
   with a catheter transducer equipped to measure direct IOP during
   vitrectomy,by attaching a metal flange near the pressure-sensing tip.
   Disposable blood pressure transducers were placed in the infusion tubing
   fluid path to determine the IOP by indirect means. During various
   maneuvers of vitrectomy including air-fluid exchange and gas-forced
   infusion, pressure measurements were taken simultaneously from the
   indwelling pressure transducer and the disposable blood pressure sensors
   in the infusion line.
   Results: The directly measured IOP varied between 0 and 120 mm Hg during
   vitrectomy. During fluid flow, the indirectly measured IOP, calculated
   from the infusion line pressures, accurately corresponded with the
   directly measured IOP.
   Conclusions: Closed vitrectomy causes wide fluctuations in TOP. The IOP
   can be accurately measured during fluid flow with inline sensors.}},

Abstract = {{Centaurea solstitialis (yellow star thistle) has been proven to cause
   equine nigropallidal encephalomalacia in horses. Over the last fifty
   years, nigropallidal encephalomalacia has been of interest to human
   medicine due to the possible connection with Parkinson's disease.
   Previous Studies indicated the presence of neurotoxic nitrogenous
   Compounds in polarextracts of the plant. In order to give a more
   detailed description of the nitrogen-containing fraction of C.
   solstitialis, various samples were collected at different development
   stages. Different aliquots of the same aqueous extract were directly
   derivatized with ophthaldialdchyde and dansyl chloride and analyzed
   separately by reversed-phase HPLC. A complete profile of the free
   nitrogenous fraction of C solstitialis was given and results obtained
   with the two derivatization procedures were compared. No particularly
   high level of free aspartic and glutamic acids, two potent
   neuroexcitotoxic amino acids, were found in polar extracts of the plant.
   Tyramine resulted to be the most important biologically active amine
   present in C. solstitialis (with a mean concentration of 2.0 mg/100 g of
   dry weight). (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Phosphorus distribution between potassic alkali feldspar and
   metaluminous haplogranitic liquid at 200 MPa (H2O): the effect of
   undercooling on crystal-liquid systematics}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the applicability of P2O5 concentration in potassic alkali
   feldspar as a monitor of P2O5 in melt for undercooled systems,
   crystal-melt partitioning for P was evaluated via feldspar growth
   experiments in P-bearing ((3 wt\% P2O5), water-saturated haplogranitic
   liquids at 200 MPa, with liquidus undercoolings (Delta T) of 25, 50,
   100, 200, and 300 degrees C. Increasing undercooling in the range Delta
   T=25-200 degrees C shows an evolution of crystal morphologies, from
   euhedral and well-filled individuals at Delta T=25-50 degrees C to
   radial clusters with increasingly skeletal habit at greater
   undercooling. Experiments at Delta T=100-200 degrees C also document the
   development of P- (up to (9 wt\% P2O5) and Si-enriched, more alkaline
   boundary layers adjacent to crystals. Experiments at Delta T=300 degrees
   C show an additional change in crystallization fabric in which
   spherulites of skeletal crystals form in open (vapor) space created by
   the dissolution of bulk silicate, and compositional boundary layers are
   not observed. We interpret the changes in reaction products at Delta
   T=300 degrees C to indicate conditions below a glass transition; hence,
   partition coefficients were not determined for this undercooling. Values
   of K (d)(P)(Kfs/melt) from experiments at Delta T=25-200 degrees C,
   calculated from pairs of crystal and immediately adjacent liquid
   compositions (including boundary layers at higher undercooling), are
   mostly in the range of 0.25-0.55 and show no effective change with
   increased undercooling. Essentially no change in K (d)(P)(Kfs/melt) with
   undercooling apparently stems from an interplay between boundary layer
   composition and a change in the substitution mechanism for P in feldspar
   from AlPSi-2, common in peraluminous to metaluminous liquids near
   equilibrium, to increasing proportions of ({[} ],P)(M+,Si)(-1) with
   increased undercooling. Bulk glass and liquid beyond boundary layers in
   experiments with significant percentages of crystallization are
   homogeneous, and show pronounced fractionation primarily due to the
   removal of an orthoclase component. Because crystallization was still in
   progress in experiments with Delta T <= n200 degrees C, compositional
   homogeneity in the bulk liquid requires extremely rapid diffusion of
   most haplogranite components (Na, K, and Al), apparently resulting from
   chemical potential gradients stemming from the removal of components
   from the liquid by crystal growth. Similar homogeneity and bulk
   fractionation in experiments with Delta T=300 degrees C requires rapid
   diffusive equilibration for the alkalis even at temperatures below an
   apparent glass transition. Unlike the haplogranite components, P is only
   concentrated in liquid boundary layers (Delta T <= 200 degrees C) or
   low-density aqueous vapor (Delta T=300 degrees C) adjacent to crystals.
   Hence, the P2O5 contents of melt inclusions likely are not
   representative of bulk melt concentrations in significantly undercooled
   systems (Delta T <= 50-100 degrees C).}},

   based on the 96-well plate format have been developed for use with blood

   extractions from ticks. To meet this need, we developed a
   high-throughput method for DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR) testing of tick samples. A liquid-handling robot was used to
   extract DNA in a 96-well binding column plate with vacuum manifold. The
   quantity, purity, and quality of DNA recovered from Ixodes scapularis
   Say, 1821. nymphs with this method were reproducible and comparable with
   existing manual DNA extraction techniques. The DNA yield from pools of
   five nymphal ticks averaged 0.432 +/- 0.04 mu g (95\% CI). The robot
   also prepared real-time PCR reactions in 96-well plates, directly from
   the extracted DNA. A modification of the existing P20 tool resulted in
   accurate pipetting of 1- to 2-mu l volumes with a reproducibility of +/-
   0.038 mu l when dispensing 1.0 mu l. By using this process, 96 samples

Abstract = {{Due to broadly distributed heterogeneities, the multistep character of
   the development of random damage in brittle materials or rocks,
   reflecting the discrete nature of the fracturing process, enables us to
   compare the diffusion of damages with the percolation phenomenon. Based
   on a discrete scale hierarchy, the fracturing process leading to
   material failure is then identified with a second-order phase
   transition, enabling prediction. In this connection, this paper presents
   a prediction scheme for the catastrophic failure or the lifetime of
   highly loaded materials or rocks. An experimental measurement method and
   a modelling of bi-phase materials or rocks are proposed. Although this
   scheme is introduced in the context of materials science, it also works
   in rock for the prediction of large natural earthquakes and some
   artificially induced earthquakes and rock bursts due to damming and
   mining. Results with strong forecasting potential explain for the first
   time the origin of complex critical exponents through a structural
   parameter. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the referral patterns of patients to a stroke
   prevention clinic (SPC) and to test the adequacy of prereferral
   diagnosis and management of modifiable risk factors for stroke. Methods:
   We collected prospective data on consecutive patients referred to the
   SPC at University of Alberta Hospital in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.
   Outcome measures included: alternate diagnoses to stroke or transient
   ischemic attack (TIA), uncontrolled or undiagnosed hypertension,
   hyperlipidemia and diabetes, therapies, and investigations leading to
   carotid endarterectomy. Results: Two thousand and eleven patients were
   referred to SPC. Nearly 25\% of the referrals originated from the
   emergency room and the rest from general physicians. Of the referrals,
   68.7\% were confirmed as TIA or stroke at the SPC. Among 138 1 patients
   with TIA or stroke, 736 had history of hypertension. Uncontrolled
   hypertension was found in 265 patients (36.0\% of those with
   hypertension: 95\% CI: 32.5-39.5) while undiagnosed hypertension was
   found in 103 (15.9\% of those without hypertension: 95\%CI:
   13.14-18.79). History of hyperlipidemia was present in 451 patients
   (32.6\%) and 356 (78.9\%: 95\% CI: 75.2-82.69) of these patients were
   not at target for secondary prevention. Among 930 patients without
   history of hyperlipidemia, 739 (79.5\%: 95\% CI: 76.8-82.1) were
   diagnosed with hyperlipidemia through the SPC. Fasting blood glucose
   levels above 7.1 mmol/L in patients with and without history of diabetes
   were 221 (79.2\%: 95\% CI: 74.5-83.9) and 66 (6\%: 95\%CI: 4.6-7.4)
   respectively. Conclusions: Management of risk factors for stroke needs
   improvement. SPCs should consider actively managing the classical
   modifiable risk factors of stroke.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the right and left ventricular systolic and
   diastolic function in middle aged patients with sickle beta
   thalassaemia.
   Methods: Forty three patients with sickle beta thalassaemia were
   recruited for echocardiographic study while 55 controls, matched for age
   and sex, served as the control group. Parameters measured included:
   dimensions and wall thickness of left (LV) and right (RV) ventricle and
   left atrium, LV mass, and cardiac index. LV and RV contractility
   variables-ejection fraction, circumferential fibre shortening velocity,
   end systolic stress, end systolic stress/volume index ratio, mitral and
   tricuspid annulus systolic excursion, and Tei index-were also
   calculated. The study also evaluated parameters of RV and LV diastolic
   function including early and late atrioventricular flow velocities (E
   and A wave respectively), E/A ratio, deceleration time (DT), isovolumic
   relaxation time (IVRT) as well as pulmonary and hepatic veins systolic
   to diastolic (S/D) ratio.
   Results: Chamber enlargement, greater LV mass index, cardiac index, and
   RV wall thickness were found in the anaemic group compared with
   controls. The LV and RV contractility variables of the patients were
   similar to controls. Conversely the LV and RV Tei index was
   significantly greater in the patient group. Diastolic dysfunction was
   present in the anaemic patients resulting from the increased LV and RV
   A-wave, the longer LVIVRT, RVIVRT, and RVDT, as well as the higher
   hepatic and pulmonary veins S/D ratio.
   Conclusions: The results show that in middle aged patients with sickle b
   thalassaemia the diastolic function is abnormal in both ventricles but
   still more in RV, whereas the systolic function remains unchanged.}},

Abstract = {{The two Bacillus subtilis strains (DM-03 and DM-04) were isolated from
   two extremely different habitats; one from the traditional fermented
   food and another one from a petroleum contaminated soil sample. These
   strains produced quantitatively and qualitatively, different cyclic
   lipopeptides isoforms under laboratory culture conditions. MALDI-TOF
   mass spectral analysis revealed that lipopeptide profile varied
   according to the producing B. subtilis strains; iturins and surfactins
   isoforms were pre-dominant cyclic lipopeptides produced by B. subtilis
   DM-03 and DM-04 strains, respectively. A comparative study showed that
   these strains possessed distinct preferences for the carbon and nitrogen
   substrates, temperature and pH for optimal growth and biosurfactant
   production. Our study documented that the cyclic lipopeptide isoforms
   produced by the respective strains played an important role in the
   utilization of available hydrophobic substrate(s) from their natural
   habitats and conferred some kind of competitive advantage to the
   producing B. subtilis strains in their parent ecological niche. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Fault ride-through specifications listed in modern transmission and
   distribution grid codes specify that wind-turbine generators (WTGs) must
   remain connected to electricity networks at voltage levels well below
   nominal. Achieving reliable operation at greatly reduced voltage levels
   is proving problematic. A particular problem regarding power
   converter-based WTGs is that standard controllers designed for reliable
   operation around nominal voltage levels will not work as designed during
   low network voltages that can occur during a fault. A consequence of
   this is greatly increased converter currents, which may lead to
   converter failure. This paper presents a nonlinear controller design for
   a power converter-based WTG that ensures that current levels remain
   within design limits, even at greatly reduced voltage levels, thus
   enhancing the WTG's fault ride-through capability.}},

Abstract = {{This essay starts with a brief remark about the - necessary - detours of
   the historical pathway to the concept of schizophrenia. The first part
   on nosographic approaches then describes the results of cross-sectional
   and longitudinal psychopathological symptom-assembling, subgrouping by
   factorial analyses, and the cross-cultural stability of the emerging
   disease concept: The human idiopathic syndrome of structural mental
   decline in its clinical variegation. The second part about denosological
   approaches provides an account of the clinical concepts of basic
   symptoms, spectrum disorders, neuropsychological deficits and their
   genetic family loading. Genetics of neuropsychological deficits
   demonstrate in detail that risk and protective factors to schizophrenia
   are genetically closely enmeshed. Higher familial loading of some
   neuropsychological deficits compared to the actual disease itself points
   at the dilemma that functional psychopathology deepens causal
   understanding and yet looses specificity for the disease syndrome. The
   concluding part of this essay emphasizes some sequelae of denosological
   approaches: Better tools for earlier recognition treatment and
   prevention; ego-distal concepts of basic dysfunctions rather than the
   previous ego-proximal concepts, hence better self-esteem, insight, and
   destigmatisation for patients.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental results based on the optical excitations in the III-V-based
   ferromagnetic semiconductors are reviewed. On the bases of results
   obtained by both cw- and femto-second-pulse optical excitation, we point
   out the feasibility of magnetization rotation in the hole-mediated
   ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As via the angular momentum and
   photon energy of light. Here, p-d exchange interaction is the effective
   channel that transmits a small change in spill axis of the valence band
   to the ferromagnetically coupled Mn Spill sub-system. Within the limit
   of this picture, we also discuss a hole-Mn spin complex for which hole
   and Mn spins rotate and relax together upon optical excitation. Partial
   magnetization reversal observed in the experiments of the electrical
   current injection in (Ga,Mn)As-based magnetic-tunnel-junction devices is
   also reviewed in view of the effects caused by the spin-polarized holes.
   Here, we point out that a spin Current of 10(5) A/cm(2) may be reduced
   further if spin injection efficiency call be improved by the optimal
   designs of the device structure. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The male courtship display of the fiddler crab Uca perplexa is a
   conspicuous claw waving that is directed at females to attract them to
   their burrows for mating. Like most other fiddler crabs, this species
   has an approximately biweekly reproductive cycle with mating spread over
   about 10 days. However, most mating takes place in the 3 days
   immediately preceding new and full moons. We examined the relation
   between the time males spend waving to females and the time they
   subsequently spend underground in their burrow, guarding their mates
   until they ovulate and then fertilizing their eggs. Early in the mating
   period, males courted females for about 3-5 s before the female entered
   their burrows, and males guarded these females for 3-5 days. During the
   3 days of peak mating activity, courting time decreased significantly to
   about 2 s and guarding time decreased to about 1 day. This pattern
   cannot be explained by females preferring extended waving periods,
   decreased female choosiness towards the end of the mating period or
   variation in male waving over the mating period. We conclude that males
   of this species modulate their investment in courtship according to
   changing levels of female responsiveness to courtship. (c) 2005 The

Abstract = {{Ferulic acid-related compounds possess antioxidant activity.
   Dehydrodiisoeugenol and ferulic acid dimer (bis-FA), but not the parent

   (LPS)-induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene expression in RAW 264.7
   cells. To clarify the mechanism of their inhibitory effects on COX-2
   expression, the phenolic O-H bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) and
   ionization potential (IP) of 8 ferulic acid-related compounds were
   calculated by both semi-empirical molecular orbital (AM1, PM3) and ab
   initio (3-21G{*}, 6-31G{*}) and density function theory (DFT) (B3LYP)
   methods. COX-2 inhibition appeared in compounds with phenolic O-H BDE
   higher than 85.76 kcal/mol, as calculated by the density function theory
   (DFT) approach. The phenolic O-H BDEs of the most potent compounds,
   dehydrodiisoeugenol and bis-FA, were 85.99 and 85.76 kcal/mol,
   respectively. No causal relationship between COX-2 inhibition and IP was
   found. Neither dehydrodiisoeugenol nor bis-FA possessed significant
   scavenging activity against the 1, 1-diphenyl-2picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)
   radical. The NSAID-like activity of dehydrodiisoeugenol and bis-FA
   appears to be related to their phenol function. Binding of activator
   protein-1 (AP-1) to the 12-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive
   element (TRE) sequence in LPS-stimulated cells was inhibited by bis-FA
   at 1 mu M and dehydrodiisoeugenol at 0.1 mu M, but not by the parent

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: The relationships between the adipokines tumor necrosis
   factor (TNF)-alpha and adiponectin and the parameters of glucose
   homeostasis and severity of liver disease were assessed in nonobese
   nondiabetic subjects with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
   METHODS: A frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test, serum
   cytokine measurement, and 7-day alimentary record were performed in 20
   biopsy-proven NASH patients and 45 age-, sex-, and BMI-matched controls
   (30 insulin sensitive and 15 insulin resistant).
   RESULTS: Patients with NASH had impaired pancreatic beta-cell function
   compared with both insulin-sensitive (adaptation index, AI: 97.7 +/-
   17.7 vs 307.4 +/- 24.1 min(-2) mmol(-1) L; p= 0.00001) and
   insulin-resistant (adaptation index, AI: 97.7 +/- 17.7 vs 201.4 +/- 41.1
   min(-2) mmol(-1) L; p= 0.001) controls. Serum adiponectin levels were
   also significantly lower in the NASH group than in the two control
   groups and correlated with adaptation index and with the severity of
   hepatic steatosis, necroinflammation, and fibrosis. When NASH patients
   were grouped according to the severity of histological liver damage,
   adiponectin was the only variable discriminating patients with higher
   necroinflammatory grade and fibrosis score from those with milder
   lesions.
   CONCLUSIONS: beta-cell secretory impairment is present in nonobese
   patients with NASH before glucose intolerance appears and may contribute
   to their increased risk for developing diabetes. Hypoadiponectinemia is
   a feature of NASH and may have a pathogenetic role in beta-cell
   dysfunction and in hepatic necroinflammation and fibrosis, independently
   of insulin resistance, visceral fat accumulation, TNF-alpha axis
   activity, and dietary habits. Our findings provide further rationale for
   therapeutic approaches aimed at increasing adiponectin levels together
   with restoring beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{Statement of problem. Removable denture bases are made of modified
   poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), which has reliable bond strength with
   resins containing methyl methacrylate (MMA). However, some hard relining
   materials with different chemical compositions have been reported to
   have less than adequate bond strength to PMMA denture base polymers.
   Purpose. This in vitro study evaluated the initial bonding properties of
   chairside hard relining materials to different removable denture base
   polymers, As well as the structure of the interface.
   Material and methods. The tensile strength (MPa) of adhesion of 8
   chairside hard relining materials (Original Truliner, GC Reline Hard,
   Ufigel Hard, Triad Reline, New Truliner, Light Liner, Astron LC Hard,
   and Flexacryl Hard) was tested against 3 denture base polymers (Ivocap
   Plus, Paladon 65, and Palapress Vario). Dumbbell-shaped specimens with a
   6-mm diameter of bonding surface were used for tensile testing of bond
   strength (n=5). An MMA containing hard relining material (Original
   Truliner) was used as a control. Tensile strength of the bond was
   calculated using the bonding area and maximum force under tension.
   Statistical analyses of data were conducted with 2-way analysis of
   variance (alpha=.05). The influence of the bonding agents and the
   relining materials on the PMMA denture base surface layer and its
   structure were investigated. The depths of the swollen layers were
   measured with a transmission light microscope. Fracture surfaces after
   testing were also visually evaluated. Chemical analyses of all materials
   prior to testing were performed using high-performance liquid
   chromatography.
   Results. Significant differences were found among tensile bond strengths
   of chairside hard relining materials to PMMA denture base polymers
   forming 3 different groups (P<.001). No significant difference among
   different denture base polymers was found with regard to tensile
   strength of adhesion (P=.918), but the interaction term between hard
   relining material and denture base polymer was found to be significant
   (P<.001). The tensile bond strength of the relining materials and
   denture base polymers was found to range from 8\% to 60\% of the
   strength of the PMMA denture base polymers.
   Conclusion. The chemical composition of the bonding agents and the
   relining materials and their combinations affected the depth of the
   swollen layers of the denture base polymers and the tensile strength of
   adhesion.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Following an accidental observation of reduced sensitivity
   for detection of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (HCV) with a novel
   commercially available automated chemiluminescent microparticle
   immunoassay (CMIA, ARCHITECT (R) Anti-HCV) compared to a
   well-established microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA, AxSYM HCV
   Version 3.0), we wanted to explore whether this could be explained by a
   variation in marginal sensitivity, to be expected between highly
   sensitive assays of different formats, or represented a reduced
   sensitivity of the CMIA to certain antibody profiles.
   Objectives: To evaluate the ability of the CMIA to detect low
   concentrations of anti-HCV antibodies as defined by various patterns in
   the recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA) and already detected in the MEIA
   system.
   Study design: All patient sera tested for anti-HCV reactivity during a
   period of 3 years (27,978) were evaluated. A total of 90 sera had a
   sample/cut-off ratio (S/CO) between 1.0 and 1.5 in the MEIA test and
   were available for further testing. Of these, 19 had a probable/possible
   presence of anti-HCV antibodies based on presence of at least two bands
   of >= 1+ strength in the RIBA, or because the patient was known to be
   anti-HCV positive. These 19 sera were tested with the CMIA. In addition,
   16 sera with strong reactivity to various antigen combinations in the
   RIBA were serially diluted until testing negative in both microparticle
   test systems.
   Results: Seven of the 19 sera (37\%) were negative (S/CO < 1.0) in the
   CMIA. At least 3 (16\%) of these 19 sera were very likely to be true
   anti-HCV positive sera (from infants with known anti-HCV positive
   mothers). HCV-RNA was not detected in any of the sera tested. Testing of
   sera after serial dilution indicates that the CMIA has a lower
   sensitivity to c22- and c33c-antibodies than the MEIA, possibly also to
   c 100-3-antibodies.
   Conclusion: Our findings indicate that ARCHITECT (R) Anti-HCV is less
   sensitive than AxSYM HCV Version 3.0 in detecting antibodies to c22 and
   c33c in patients who have cleared their HCV-infection and have naturally
   declining levels of antibodies. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The effects of a GaN single-crystal target (SC-GaN) of laser-ablated GaN
   thin films on sapphire were investigated. GaN thin films were grown on a
   single-crystalline c-plane sapphire substrate using the SC-GaN. Unlike
   the usual growth behavior in laser ablation of a sintered ceramics GaN
   target (CR-GaN), the rocking curves of the obtained GaN films were
   superimposed patterns composed of sharp and broad components. The
   interface between the GaN film and sapphire substrate was atomically
   flat and sharp. To investigate the effects of the target on the plume of
   a pulsed laser deposition process in detail, the plume was analyzed by
   Langmuir probe methods and optical emission spectroscopy (OES). The
   Langmuir probe results showed that the electron temperature for the
   plume of an SC-GaN was nearly one third of that of a CR-GaN, although
   the ion density in the plume of the SC-GaN was found to be greater than
   the ion density in that of the CR-GaN. OES data showed a significant
   fraction of the oxygen species in the plume of the CR-GaN. These are
   thought to be the primary cause of damage and/or impurity to growing
   films in the plume of the CR-GaN.}},

Abstract = {{Spinal cord injuries (SCI) often lead to severe bladder dysfunctions.
   Our previous studies have demonstrated that following SCI, rat bladder
   wall tissue became hypertrophied, significantly more compliant, and
   changed its mechanical behavior from orthotropic to isotropic. In order
   to elucidate the link between the tissue microstructure and mechanical
   properties of the wall, we have developed a novel semi-automated image
   analysis method to quantify smooth muscle bundle orientation and mass
   fraction in the bladder wall tissues from normal and 10 day-post-SCI
   rats. Results of the present study revealed that there were significant
   (p < 0.05) increases in smooth muscle area fractions as well as
   significantly (p < 0.001) fewer cell nuclei per muscle area in the SCI
   groups compared to the normal groups. Furthermore, while the normal rat
   bladders exhibited predominant smooth muscle orientation only in the
   longitudinal direction, the SCI rat bladders exhibited smooth muscles
   oriented in both the circumferential and longitudinal directions. These
   results provide first evidence that bladder smooth muscle cells exhibit
   hypertrophy rather than hyperplasia and developed a second, orthogonal
   orientation of smooth muscle bundles following SCI. The results of the
   present study corroborate our previous mechanical anisotropy data and
   provide the basis for development of structure-based constitutive models
   for urinary bladder wall tissue.}},

   array to track their positions. Filament shortening and lengthening

Abstract = {{Microelectrical mechanical systems (MEMS) devices coated with a thin
   film of ionic liquid showed significant improvement in wear life. These
   promising tribological findings led to the current study of the
   micro-nano behaviour of an ionic liquid, 1,2-dimethyl-3-butyl
   imidazolium hexafluorophosphate (DMBI-PF6), when applied as a thin film
   on a polished silicon surface. The films remain as microdroplets in
   ambient conditions but undergo drastic changes when agitated by an
   atomic force microscope (AFM) contact scan or touched with a biased AFM
   tip. The nanotribological characteristics including mobility, diffusion
   and scratch resistance are studied. In the case of DMBI-PF6, it was
   observed that the imidazolium ion is a mobile phase while PF6 is
   attached to the silicon surface. Crystallites are formed as a result of
   tip contact and depend on the tip bias and environmental conditions.
   Crystallization of DMBI-PF6 from the liquid phase with no tip bias
   showed substantial variation in crystal shape compared to those formed
   under the influence of an electric bias.}},

Abstract = {{We present a rare case of colon perforation caused by hydrostatic
   irrigation enema in a patient with chronic renal failure. A 76-year-old
   woman was admitted to our hospital because of an exacerbation of lumbar
   pain and increased difficulty in walking. She had a medical history of
   traumatic neck pain and chronic lower back pain, which had been treated
   with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for 8 years. On
   admission, the C-reactive protein level was 6.8 mg/dl, so we planned to
   do a colonoscopy to determine the cause of inflammation. The patient
   developed abdominal pain approximately 3.5 h after a pre-procedural
   enema was administered. An emergency operation was performed and a small
   perforation was found in the sigmoid colon. We conclude that the cause
   of the colon perforation was a combination of the use of a hydrostatic
   retrograde irrigation enema in a patient with chronic renal failure who
   had been treated with long-term NSAIDs.}},

Abstract = {{The structure and developmental patterns of inflorescence of longan
   (Dimocarpus longan Lour.) were studied microscopically and by the naked
   eye. In inflorescence of longan, compound dichasia are arranged on three
   to four orders of monopodial axes without the formation of terminal
   flowers, indicating that longan inflorescence is pleiothyrse; cymose
   partial inflorescences are arranged on more than two monopodial axes.
   Most of the monopodial axes had differentiated by the end of November
   just before the cool season. The first sign of inflorescence formation
   was the appearance of bract primordia at apical meristems of the
   preformed monopodial axes, with lateral axes preceding the main axes.
   Dichasia were formed in the axils of bract primordia, and the formation
   of bracts and dichasia continued. Bract appearance can be detected by
   the naked eye I week after microscopically detected bract appearance.
   Shoots with intermediate characteristics between the inflorescence and
   the vegetative shoots were formed; dichasia were formed on the lateral
   axes, but not on the main axes in intermediate shoots. These results
   suggest that apical meristems on the terminal shoot produce monopodial
   axes, together with foliage leaf primordia, before floral induction, but
   produce bract primordia and compound dichasia, which are composed of
   sympodial axes, after floral induction.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to evaluate hip fracture risk in relation
   to fall direction, and to elucidate factors that influence the impact
   force in falls on the hip. Eight healthy volunteers performed deliberate
   falls in three directions (lateral, posterolateral and posterior) on a
   force platform covered by a mattress of 13 cm thickness. Fall descent
   motions and impact postures were examined by a three-dimensional
   analyzer. The maximum ground force reaction, velocity of the greater
   trochanter at impact, and activity of quadriceps and gluteus medius were
   measured. In all trials of lateral and posterolateral falls, but not of
   posterior falls, the subjects hit their greater trochanter directly on
   the mattress. The impact forces were between 2,000 N and 4,000 N.
   Posterolateral falls showed significantly higher velocity at impact than
   did posterior falls. The height and the lower limb length exhibited
   positive correlations with the impact force in all directions of fall.
   In the lateral fall, there was a positive correlation between the
   activity of quadriceps and the impact force. In view of the impact
   point, force, and velocity, the posterolateral fall seemed to carry the
   highest risk of hip fracture.}},

Abstract = {{The issue of providing a mobile virtual private network (MVPN) service
   by a cellular network is addressed in this study. The main focus of this
   study is on two aspects of MVPN handling: a multicast transmission, and
   location management of the MVPN members. Virtual private networks (VPNs)
   already exist in wired networks. The growing number of mobile users
   increases the demand for mobile services. It is expected that future
   wireless networks will have to provide wireless internet services, and
   in particular, to support MVPNs. In order to maintain an MVPN service
   offering, the system must support an efficient information delivery to
   the MVPN members. In order to achieve this goal, the physical locations
   of the MVPN members must be known to the system. In this study, we
   present methods to efficiently route and transmit information to the
   MVPN members, without affecting the quality of the personal service
   provided to each and every MVPN member. It is shown that the wireless
   MVPN bandwidth requirement is significantly less than the equivalent
   bandwidth required by a wired VPN. The offered bandwidth utilization is
   significantly better than the efficiency of IP-based multicast
   transmission in the Internet, and the proposed IP-based multicast
   transmission in cellular networks. Copyright (C) 2005 John Wiley \&

   more than 90\%; (ii) the DOM stabilisation level in the composting
   reactor of the bio-toilet system was greater than that shown by DOM from
   other sources, (iii) stabilisation of DOM in the bio-toilet system was
   characterised by an increasing amount of macromolecules (MW > 30,000 Da)

   signals, and an intelligent fuzzy system to assess the degree of
   acceptability of the weld. The fuzzy system is also able to detect the
   risk of specific problems (e.g., anomalies in the current, voltage or
   speed of the arc, contamination with other materials, holes) and the
   position of defects along the welding line. In an extensive experimental
   comparison, the fuzzy system outperforms a former version of the
   detection algorithm based on a statistical approach.}},

Abstract = {{Male mice receiving vitamin E (5.0 g alpha-tocopherol acetate/kg of
   food) from 28 wk of age showed a 40\% increased median life span, from
   61 +/- 4 wk to 85 +/- 4 wk, and 17\% increased maximal life span,
   whereas female mice equally supplemented exhibited only 14\% increased
   median life span. The alpha-tocopherol content of brain and liver was
   2.5-times and 7-times increased in male mice, respectively. Vitamin
   E-supplemented male mice showed a better performance in the tightrope (
   neuromuscular function) and the T-maze ( exploratory activity) tests
   with improvements of 9-24\% at 52 wk and of 28-45\% at 78 wk. The rates
   of electron transfer in brain mitochondria, determined as state 3 oxygen
   uptake and as NADH-cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome oxidase
   activities, were 16-25\% and 35-38\% diminished at 52-78 wk. These
   losses of mitochondrial function were ameliorated by vitamin E
   supplementation by 37-56\% and by 60-66\% at the two time points
   considered. The activities of mitochondrial nitric oxide synthase and
   Mn-SOD decreased 28-67\% upon aging and these effects were partially
   (41-68\%) prevented by vitamin E treatment. Liver mitochondrial
   activities showed similar effects of aging and of vitamin E
   supplementation, although less marked. Brain mitochondrial enzymatic
   activities correlated negatively with the mitochondrial content of
   protein and lipid oxidation products (r(2) = 0.58 - 0.99, P < 0.01), and
   the rates of respiration and of complex I and IV activities correlated
   positively (r(2) = 0.74 - 0.80, P < 0.01) with success in the behavioral
   tests and with maximal life span.}},

Abstract = {{Our model of detection and discrimination is based on the common
   assumption that, for psychoacoustic tasks dominated by a single auditory
   comparison, d-prime is equal to a perceived-intensity difference divided
   by the standard deviation of this perceived intensity. In general, the
   transformation from the external, physical intensity of an acoustic
   signal to an internal, perceived intensity is nonlinear, compressive,
   and similar to the transformation from physical intensity to loudness.
   We represent the compression associated with this intensity
   transformation by a quadratic function. This leads to explicit
   mathematical representations of the external-to-internal intensity
   transformation and its inverse. For psychoacoustic tasks such as
   intensity discrimination, increment detection, and forward masking, we
   can write explicit expressions for d-prime and signal threshold. Model
   predictions based on these expressions are in pod agreement with
   experimental data from the literature, as well as observations from our
   laboratory. Some of these comparisons between model and data lead to
   predictions regarding the dependence of internal noise (or variance) on
   stimulus intensity for intensity discrimination and increment detection.
   Other comparisons suggest that the influence of neural adaptation on
   forward masking is greater than the influence of masker persistence. The
   quadratic-compression model may provide a useful framework for
   understanding a variety of simple psychoacoustic tasks.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To determine whether glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate (CS)
   at concentrations approximating those achieved in plasma by oral
   administration would influence gene expression of selected mediators of
   osteoarthritis in cytokine-stimulated equine articular chondrocytes.
   Sample Population-Samples of grossly normal articular cartilage obtained
   from the metacarpophalangeal joint of 13 horses.
   Procedure-Equine chondrocytes in pellet culture were stimulated with a
   sulosaturating dose of recombinant equine interleukin (relL)-1 beta.
   Effects of prior incubation with glucosamine (2.5 to 10.0 mu g/mL) and
   CS (5.0 to 50.0 mu g/mL) on gene expression of matrix metalloproteinase
   (MMP)-1, -2, -3, -9, and -13; aggrecanase 1 and 2,; inducible nitric
   oxide synthase (iNOS); cyclooxygenase (COX)-2; nuclear factor kappa B;
   and c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) were assessed by use of a quantitative
   real-time polymerase chain reaction assay.
   Results-Glucosamine at a concentration of 10 mu g/mL significantly
   reduced relL-1 beta-induced mRNA expression of MMP-13, aggrecanase 1,
   and JNK. Reductions in cytokine-induced expression were also observed
   for NOS and COX-2. Chondroitin sulfate had no effect on gene expression
   at the concentrations tested. Conclusions and Clinical
   Relevance-Concentrations of glucosamine similar to those achieved in
   plasma after oral administration in horses exerted pretranslational
   regulation of some mediators of osteoarthritis, an effect that may
   contribute to the cartilage-sparing properties of this
   anninomonosaccharide. Analysis of results of this study indicated that
   the influence of CS on pretranslational regulation of these selected
   genes is limited or lacking.}},

Title = {{A novel 5 ` ATRX mutation with splicing consequences in acquired alpha
   thalassemia-myelodysplastic syndrome}},
Journal = {{HAEMATOLOGICA}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1463-1470}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Background and Objectives. Acquired a thalassemia (hemoglobin H (HbH)
   disease) is a rare complication of neoplastic chronic myeloid disorders,
   especially myelodysplastic syndrome. Acquired HbH has recently been
   associated with mutations in an X-linked gene, ATRX, previously linked
   to inherited ATR-X syndrome (alpha thalassemia-retardation-X linked).
   Design and Methods. A Swiss man with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia
   complicated by various autoimmune disorders and by strikingly
   microcytic, hypochromic anemia was analyzed for the presence of acquired
   HbH. After HbH detection, we sought an underlying genetic cause. We used
   denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography to screen for an ATRX
   mutation, and measured ATRX expression by reverse transcriptase
   polymerase chain reaction.
   Results. The patient had 50\% HbH-containing cells on supravital
   staining. Marrow karyotype and the a globin cluster were normal. A
   clonally-restricted ATRX point mutation was detected in the conserved
   splice donor motif in intron 4 (IVS 4 +2 T -> C). Plasmid vector cloning
   of patient ATRX cDNA demonstrated both exon 4 skipping and partial
   intron retention with activation of a cryptic splice site, both outcomes
   resulting in frameshifts with premature stop codon generation in exon 5
   and near-decimation of ATRX expression in myeloid cells. Normal exon 6
   alternative splicing was retained.
   Interpretation and Conclusions. Intronic ATRX mutations with splicing
   consequences, uncommon in inherited ATR-X syndrome because of their
   devastating effect on expression of functional protein, should be
   routinely sought when undertaking molecular analysis of acquired HbH
   disease. Detection of an acquired ATRX mutation can help support
   clonality in karyotypically normal ambiguous myeloid disorders with HbH.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Antibodies to Proteus mirabilis were previously detected in
   patients with established rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We examined the
   prevalence of antibodies to P. mirabilis and their associations with RA
   in early synovitis patients.
   Methods. Two hundred and forty-six patients with inflammatory arthritis
   for less than 1 yr were prospectively evaluated for 1 yr. Of these
   patients, 30\% had rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive RA, 16\% RF-negative
   RA, 17\% a spondyloarthropathy and 37\% undifferentiated arthritis.
   Serum antibodies to P. mirabilis, Escherichia coli and other potentially
   arthritogenic organisms (Chlamydia, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter,
   Yersinia and parvovirus B19) and for antibodies specific for
   immunoglobulin (Ig) G damaged with advanced glycation end-products
   (anti-IgG-AGE) were measured.
   Results. IgM and IgA anti-Proteus antibodies were significantly higher
   in patients with RF-positive RA compared with all other patient groups
   (P < 0.0005 and P < 0.005). Anti-P. mirabilis IgG, and IgG, IgA, and IgM
   antibodies to other potentially arthritogenic pathogens did not differ
   in the patient groups. IgM antibodies to E. coli were elevated in
   RF-positive RA patients. Anti-P. mirabilis IgM and IgA results were not
   explained by false-positive reactions, because after absorption of RF
   there was no decrease in antibodies to Proteus in 10 of 12 patients.
   Proteus and E. coli antibodies were highest in patients positive for
   both RF and anti-IgG-AGE antibodies (P < 0.001). Patients with erosions
   tended to have higher IgA anti-Proteus titres, but no association with
   the shared HLA epitope or treatment was detected.
   Conclusion. Anti-P. mirabilis IgM and IgA and anti-E. coli IgM antibody
   elevations are associated with early seropositive RA and the presence of
   anti-IgG-AGE antibodies. The role that P. mirabilis or E. coli plays in
   early RF-positive RA requires further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{We report the optical properties of unannealed hafnium-aluminate (HfAlO)
   films grown by atomic layer chemical vapor deposition (ALCVD) and
   correlate them with the aluminum contents in the films. Vacuum
   ultraviolet spectroscopic ellipsometry (VUV-SE), high-resolution
   transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), channeling Rutherford
   backscattering spectrometry (RBS), and resonant nuclear reaction
   analysis (NRA) were employed to characterize these films. In the
   analyses of ellipsometry data, a double Tauc-Lorentz dispersion produces
   a best fit to the experimental VUV-SE data. As a result, the determined
   complex pseudodielectric <epsilon > functions of the films clearly
   exhibit a dependency on the aluminum densities measured by RBS and NRA,
   We show that the optical fundamental band gap E-g shifts from 5.56 +/-
   0.05 eV for HfO2 to 5.92 +/- 0.05 eV for HfAlO. The latter was grown by
   using an equal number of pulses of H2O/HfCl4 and H2O/TMA
   (trimethylaluminum) precursors in each deposition cycle for HfO2 and
   Al2O3, respectively. The shift of E-g to higher photon energies with
   increasing aluminum content indicates that intermixing of HfO2 and Al2O3
   occurred during the ALCVD growth process. We found that E-g varies
   linearly with the mole fraction x of Al2O3 in the alloy
   (HfO2)(x)(Al2O3)(1-x), but has a parabolic dependency with the aluminum
   density. We also observed a consistent decrease in the magnitudes of the
   real <epsilon(1)> and imaginary <epsilon(2)> part of <epsilon > of HfAlO
   films with respect to those of HfO2 as the Al density increased. The
   absence of the approximate to 5.7 eV peak in the <epsilon > spectrum,
   which was previously reported for polycrystalline HfO2 films, indicates
   that these films are amorphous as confirmed by their HRTEM images. (c)

Abstract = {{Epidemiologic studies suggested that vitamin E has a protective effect
   against prostate cancer. We showed here that tocopherol-associated
   protein (TAP), a vitamin E-binding protein, promoted vitamin E uptake
   and facilitated vitamin E antiproliferation effect in prostate cancer
   cells. Interestingly, without vitamin E treatment, overexpression of TAP
   in prostate cancer cells significantly suppressed cell growth; knockdown
   of endogenous TAP by TAP small interfering RNA (siRNA) in nonmalignant
   prostate HPr-1 cells increased cell growth. Further mechanism dissection
   studies suggested that the tumor suppressor function of TAP was via
   down-regulation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling, but
   not by modulating cell cycle arrest or androgen receptor signaling.
   Immunoprecipitation results indicated that TAP inhibited the interaction
   of PI3K subunits, p110 with p85, and subsequently reduced Akt activity.
   Constitutively active Akt could negate the TAP-suppressive activity on
   prostate cancer cell growth. Moreover, stable transfection of TAP in
   LNCaP cells suppressed LNCaP tumor incidence and growth rate in nude
   mice. Furthermore, TAP mRNA and protein expression levels were
   significantly down-regulated in human prostate cancer tissue samples
   compared with benign prostate tissues as measured by reverse
   transcription-PCR, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry.
   Together, our data suggest that TAP not only mediates vitamin E
   absorption to facilitate vitamin E antiproliferation effect in prostate
   cancer cells, but also functions like a tumor suppressor gene to control
   cancer cell viability through a non-vitamin E manner. Therefore, TAP may
   represent a new prognostic marker for prostate cancer progression.}},

Abstract = {{Burns and scalds continue to be a frequent cause of injuries in children
   and adolescents. Depending on the depth and extent of the injury there
   may be danger to life due to loss of liquid, effects on vitally
   important structures, or infections resulting from loss of the
   protective function of the skin. Initially, treatment of pain and
   circulatory shock are paramount. Following this wound treatment and
   rehabilitation become increasingly important. In the beginning there is
   flooding of extreme amounts of stress hormones. As treatment proceeds
   patients are repeatedly exposed to painful interventions such as wound
   toileting and skin transplantation. Furthermore, treatments intended to
   put affected limbs in appropriate positions and to mobilize them are
   often agonizing despite the use of analgesics. All these interventions
   may remind patients of the initial burn accident with its associated
   extremely high level of stress activation. It is difficult for children
   to adapt to a situation they cannot understand and to cooperate to the
   required degree. At the same time they have to cope with a separation
   from their parents over a considerable time. Later on distortions of
   body image will come to the fore, particularly in the case of facial
   burns, as well as loss of the ability to use limbs, if there are
   impairments of hands or joints. Although infants can cope quite well
   initially, psychosocial consequences can occur at puberty after a long
   delay.}},

   the non force-free model of Hidalgo is a good approximation to the

   conclusion is reached based on the good fits obtained with the model for
   most of the clouds, in spite of the variety of profiles found in the
   magnetic field strength and in every of its components. The model
   incorporates the distortion and expansion of the cross-section of the
   MCs. We have compared, when available, the results obtained with those
   in literature. The unique published global study of the MCs at the same
   time interval has been provided by Lepping using the circular
   cross-section model of Burlaga, and the results are available in his web
   page. From all the parameters he obtained, only the longitude, phi, the
   latitude, theta, and the distance of maximum approach of the spacecraft
   to the cloud axis, y(0), may be compared with those obtained by
   Hidalgo's model. As we show, the main discrepancy between both models
   refers to the longitude values. Concerning the comparison with other
   models of literature, only the Bastille day and October 2003 magnetic
   clouds have been studied by other authors.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To study the effect of commonly used preservative free
   artificial tear, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) 0.5\% (Refresh Plus,
   Allergan, Irvine, California) on visual acuity in symptomatic dry eye
   (SDE) and asymptomatic dry eye (ADE) patients.
   DESIGN: Nonrandomized prospective clinical trial.
   METHODS: Prospective study involving 20 patients (40 eyes) with SDE and
   20 patients (40 eyes) with ADE, all 40 years and older, were recruited
   from a clinic setting over a I-month period. Distance visual acuity was
   measured by the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)
   vision chart and near visual acuity was measured by the Lighthouse Near
   Vision chart before and 30 seconds after instillation of one drop of
   CMC. Distance and near visual acuity was measured both with and without
   correction. The duration of action of CMC was measured at 1-minute
   intervals until the patient's visual acuity returned to pretear level.
   RESULTS: In both SDE and ADE groups, uncorrected and corrected near and
   distance vision showed a statistically significant improvement after the
   use of CMC (P < .05). There was no statistically significant difference
   in improvement between the SDE and ADE groups in all categories (P
   values > .05). The mean duration of improvement of vision was 2.93
   minutes in the SDE group and 3.70 minutes in the ADE group (P = .036).
   CONCLUSIONS: CMC 0.5\% provides a temporary yet significant improvement
   in the visual acuity of SDE and ADE patients. The effect of artificial
   tears on visual acuity may be of diagnostic value in detecting ocular
   surface abnormality in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.}},

Abstract = {{Although previous studies have identified several key transcription
   factors in the generation process of the vertebrate nervous system, the
   intracellular signalling pathways that function in this process have
   remained unclear. Here we identify the evolutionarily conserved
   mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 5 (MEK5)- extracellular
   signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) pathway as an essential regulator in
   neural differentiation. Knockdown of Xenopus ERK5 or Xenopus MEK5 with
   antisense morpholino oligonucleotides results in the reduced head
   structure and inhibition of neural differentiation. Moreover, forced
   activation of the MEK5 - ERK5 module on its own induces neural
   differentiation. In addition, we show that the MEK5 - ERK5 pathway is
   necessary for the neuralizing activity of SoxD, a regulator of neural
   differentiation, and is sufficient for the expression of Xngnr1, a
   proneural gene. These results show that the MEK5 ERK5 pathway has an
   essential role in the regulation of neural differentiation downstream of
   SoxD and upstream of Xngnr1.}},

   increases in muscle strength and flexibility are developed by specific
   training programs, 43 healthy young adults were tested before and after
   4 different interventions conducted twice a week for 12 weeks: (a)
   resistance training only (n = 13); (b) flexibility training only (n =
   11); (c) resistance and flexibility training (n = 9); and (d) no
   intervention (n = 10). There was no change in either strength or
   flexibility in the control group (p > 0.05). Resistance training
   improved muscle strength either alone (+ 14\%; effect size = 0.53; p <
   0.001) or in combination with flexibility training (+16\%; effect size =
   0.66; p = 0.032), but did not change flexibility (p = 0.610).
   Flexibility increased with specific training alone (+33\%; p < 0.001) or
   in combination with resistance training (+18\%; p < 0.001). In
   conclusion, in young, healthy subjects, resistance training alone did
   not increase flexibility, but resistance training did not interfere with
   the increase in joint range of motion during flexibility training. These
   results support the concept that specific training should be employed in
   order to increase either muscle strength or flexibility.}},

Abstract = {{Conclusion. Our findings suggest that Wolfram syndrome type 1 gene
   (WFS1) mutation is an important cause of autosomal dominant
   low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (LFSNHL) in Japan. Objective.
   DFNA6/14 is caused by a heterozygous mutation of WFS1 and is a common
   cause of autosomal dominant LFSNHL among populations in both Europe and
   the US. The purpose of this study was to investigate WFS1 mutations
   among Japanese patients whose phenotypes were consistent with those of
   DFNA6/14. Material and methods. Using audiometry and genetic analysis,
   we searched for WFS1 mutations in three unrelated Japanese patients with
   LFSNHL and a familial history of autosomal dominant hearing loss.
   Results. One patient carried a heterozygous G2700A mutation at codon 844
   in exon 8, resulting in substitution of a threonine for an alanine
   (A844T). Genetic analysis of the available members of the patient's
   family showed that the A844T mutation segregated with LFSNHL, but was
   not detected in any of 140 control chromosomes. It thus appears likely
   that the A844T mutation is causative for hearing loss in this group.
   Speech audiometry, self-recording audiometry and auditory brainstem
   responses showed the patient to have cochlear deafness without
   retrocochlear dysfunction. No mutation was found in the other two
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{The daily metabolizable energy intake of an animal is potentially
   limited by either the available feeding time or by its capacity to
   process energy. Animals are generally considered not to be time-limited
   but rather to be energy-processing-limited. This is concluded from the
   common observation that an animal's feeding time per day increases with
   a decrease in food density. We argue that such changes in feeding time
   are in theory also expected when no constraints are operating. Thus, a
   study of the constraints on energy intakes of free-living animals should
   be performed during demanding phases of the year. As an example, we
   collected data on time and energy budgets of Bewick's swan (Cygnus
   columbianus bewickii) refuelling during migration on fennel pondweed
   (Potamogeton pectinatus) tubers in two years differing two-fold in tuber
   biomass density. As predicted by time limitation, the feeding time
   (defined as the time with the head submerged) did not change in response
   to a change in food biomass density, both within and between years
   (averaging 12.2 h d(-1)). Contrary to energy-processing limitation, and
   again in line with time limitation, the daily metabolizable energy
   intake varied, being greater in the year with high than in the year with
   low food densities. We conclude that more studies are needed of animals
   operating under demanding conditions before it can be assessed whether
   free-living animals are generally energy-processing- or time-limited.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The incidence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy has
   resulted in marine collagen hydrolysate (low-molecular-weight gelatin)
   being sold as supplements and cosmetics in Japan. Shark skin collagen is
   one of the important sources of marine collagen. We examined the effect
   of shark skin gelatin in an osteoporosis model animal.
   Methods: Shark skin gelatin was orally administered to ovariectomized
   rats with a low-protein diet. Bone mineral density of the right femur
   was measured. Collagen and glycosaminoglycan in the tibial end were
   extracted and analyzed by western blotting and cellulose acetate
   membrane electrophoresis, respectively.
   Results: Administering collagen to the ovariectomized rats resulted in
   the bone mineral density of the femur epiphysis being higher than that
   in the sham-operated rats. The contents of type I collagen and
   glycosaminoglycan in the epiphysis were increased by administering shark
   skin gelatin.
   Conclusions: These results indicated that shark skin gelatin would be
   useful as a dietary supplement for treating osteoporosis. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Fibrin plays a major role in blood clotting and is important in wound
   healing. In the present study, physiologically clotted fibrin (PF) and
   calcined bone (CB) both of bovine origin were used in the preparation of
   a bone graft material with chitosan (C) as a binder. This bone graft
   (PF-CB) was characterized by stress-strain analysis, X-ray diffraction
   (XRD) studies, scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning
   calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, and FTIR spectroscopy. Thermal
   studies revealed that the incorporation of CB into PF did not alter the
   thermal stability of fibrin, although it affects the total loss
   percentage. The composition containing 24:1:15 (PF:C:CB) on dry weight
   basis exhibited maximum compressive strength, and the same composite was
   used for characterization studies. The XRD studies have shown the
   amorphous nature of the implant. SEM pictures revealed the heterogeneity
   and porous nature of the implant. PF in combination with CB is expected
   to exhibit osteoinductivity because fibrin, the osteoinductive protein,
   acts as an angiogenic factor, whereas CB provides; calcium and phosphate
   ions that are needed for new bone formation. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{This study presents an easy and fast stripping voltammetric detection
   technique for the determination of amikacin sulfate in a flow-injection
   system. For a very sensitive determination, the currents were integrated
   for a whole potential scan range including oxidation and reduction of
   the gold surface electrode. The potential waveform, which consisted of
   potential steps for cleaning, stripping and potential ramp, was
   continuously applied to a gold disk ultra-microelectrode (with a
   diameter of 50 mu m). The greatest advantages of the proposed detection
   method are a) very low detection limit (picomolar level), b) removing
   oxygen from the test solution is not necessary, c) very fast and
   appropriate for monitoring drug compounds in a wide variety of
   chromatographic analysis methods. The detection limit for amikacin
   sulfate was 2.0 x 10(-11) M (similar to 15 pg mL(-1)), and the relative
   standard deviation for 10 determinations of 1.0 ng mL(-1) of amikacin
   was 3.2\%. The effects of scan rate, accumulation potential,
   accumulation time and pH of eluent on the performance of the method were
   investigated. The results were used for the determination of amikacin

Abstract = {{The molecular background of the most frequent intersexuality syndrome in
   dogs (female-to-male sex reversal with the female karyotype and a lack
   of the SRY gene) is unknown. In this article, new cases of this syndrome
   are described in two unrelated American Staffordshire terrier dogs and
   one miniature pinscher dog subjected to cytogenetic and molecular
   analysis due to the presence of an enlarged clitoris. One dog was
   operated on and histological studies of the gonads revealed a testicular
   structure without signs of spermatogenesis, but the uterus wall appeared
   to be normal. All three dogs had female chromosome complements and
   lacked the Y-linked genes SRY and ZFY. Eight fragments, representing the
   vast majority of the coding sequence of the SOX9 gene, and two fragments
   of the 5' flanking region of this gene were analyzed. The studied
   fragments had identical DNA sequences when comparing the intersexual
   dogs with GenBank sequences (AY237827; NW139883). Thus a mutation in the
   coding sequence as well as the promoter region of the SOX9 gene might be
   excluded as a cause of this type of intersexuality. The importance of
   further studies of the 5' flanking region of this gene is discussed.}},

   In addition, the analysis includes a topotype of the morphologically

   Bight off the US east coast. The equally weighted matrix includes 132
   informative characters. All most-parsimonious trees unequivocally
   indicate that specimens belonging to the same form (pigmented or

Abstract = {{We characterized a movement disorder of Chinese Crested dogs clinically
   and pathologically indistinguishable from canine multiple system
   degeneration (CMSD) previously recognized in Kerry Blue Terriers. This
   fatal disease segregated as an autosomal recessive in a 51-dog pedigree
   of both breeds and their crosses. The occurrence of affected dogs among
   first-generation crosses demonstrated that the mutations causing
   multiple system degeneration in these breeds are allelic. The CMSD locus
   maps to CFA1 (LOD > 18) and haplotype analysis narrowed the CFA1 target
   region to a 15-Mb segment that contains orthologs of genes on HSA6,
   including PARK2, the gene for the ubiquitin ligase parkin. Mutations in
   human PARK2 cause the most common form of familial Parkinson's disease,
   autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism, which has clinical and
   pathological similarities to canine multiple system degeneration. A
   second phenotype, canine ectodermal dysplasia (CED), segregated in the
   pedigree as an autosomal dominant with homozygous lethality. Dogs with
   ectodermal dysplasia have a sparse hair coat and abnormal dentition that
   is characteristic of the ``hairless'' variety of Chinese Cresteds. CED
   mapped to a region of CFA17 (LOD > 14) containing orthologs from HSA2.
   EDAR, the gene for the ectodysplasin A1 receptor, occurs on HSA2 but was
   excluded as the cause of canine ectodermal dysplasia.}},

Abstract = {{The functional implication of molecular segregation within the
   immunological synapse remains uncertain. We recently reported that
   effector but not naive TCR transgenic murine CD8(+) T cells formed
   immunological synapses containing a central supramolecular activation
   cluster (cSAMC), suggesting that execution of effector functions such as
   cytolytic activity might be facilitated by the cSMAC structure. We have
   now explored this hypothesis using two approaches. First, by
   simultaneously imaging cSAMC formation and mobilization of cytotoxic
   granules to the synapse, we observed no correlation between the presence
   of a cSAMC and granule reorientation. Second, we took advantage of the
   observation that CD28 costimulation markedly enhances cSAMC formation.
   Granule polarization to the contact site was indistinguishable with
   B7-1(+) and B7-1(-) target cells, and cytolytic activity against B7-1(+)
   or B7-1(-) targets was similar and granule-dependent. Together, our
   results indicate that the formation of a cSAMC is not required for
   cytolytic activity in CD8(+) effector T cells.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Study Objective: Although some sedatives or analgesics are commonly used
   for premedication to reduce psychological tension before surgery or
   anesthesia, it remains unclear which drug is more suitable. Because
   salivary chromogranin A is a reliable index for estimating psychological
   tension, this variable was measured during the perioperative period
   after premedication.
   Design: Prospective, randomized control study.
   Setting: Operating room at a general hospital.
   Patients: Thirty adult female patients undergoing abdominal total
   hysterectomy were randomly assigned to 3 groups of 10 patients each.
   Interventions: On the day before surgery, saliva was collected, and 0.1
   mg/kg of midazolam (midazolam group) or 0.02 mg/kg of butorphanol
   (butorphanol group) was injected intramuscularly 30 minutes before
   entering the operating rooms. For the control group, no premedication
   was performed. Saliva was collected as the patient entered the operating
   room and then the patient received an epidural catheter insertion
   followed 5 minutes later by collection of the saliva.
   Measurements and Main Results: Salivary chromogranin A was assayed using
   a radioimmunoassay, and revised values calculated from the protein
   concentration of the saliva were regarded as data. Revised salivary
   chromogranin A levels increased in the control and butorphanol groups at
   the time of entrance to the operating room and after epidural treatment
   compared with the value of the day before surgery, whereas it did not
   change statistically in the midazolam group.
   Conclusions: From the standpoint of reducing psychological tension
   before surgery or anesthesia, midazolam as a sedative may be more
   suitable for premedication. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   enlargement of microspores during the first days in culture and the
   `star-like' organization of the cytoplasm inside the microspore are
   connected with reprogramming of the developmental pathway in maize
   microspores. Some differences were also found in the surface wall
   architecture of embryogenic microspores. Fertile plants were

   Components Axes and a morphological dendrogram were used to group the
   accessions. Genetic relatedness among accessions based on random
   amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) molecular marker data was also
   presented in form of a dendrogram using the Unweighted Pair Group Method
   with Arithmetic mean (UPGMA). Relative effectiveness of the RAPD markers
   and genetic diversity among accessions as revealed by botanical
   descriptors were compared. The single linkage cluster technique
   classified the 40 accessions into six morphological groups whereas the
   PCA re-ordered the accessions into four broad groups that had within
   cluster similarities and inter-cluster morphological variations. RAPDs
   were highly polymorphic, more discriminatory and informative as they
   were able to differentiate more pairs of accessions than the botanical
   descriptors. IITA rice accessions TOX 3052-46-3-3-2-1 and TOX

Abstract = {{The detailed crystal lography of natural pyrite framboids has been
   determined for the first time using electron backscatter diffraction
   techniques. The crystallographic ordering of microcrystals correlates
   positively with morphological ordering; the crystallographic
   orientations are random in morphologically disordered framboids and are
   almost ordered in morphologically ordered framboids. Morphologically
   ordered framboids involve two types of systematic misorientations across
   the microcrystal boundaries: low-an-le (ca. < 20 degrees) and high-angle
   (ca. 70-90 degrees) misorientations. The low-angle misorientation
   probably reflects slight physical misalignment of microcrystals in the
   packing structure, whereas the hi h-an le misorientation is considered
   to result from the dichotomy of the pyrite microcrystals having fourfold
   morphological symmetry but only twofold crystallographic symmetry about
   < 100 >. Thus, the crystallographic orientation of microcrystals is not
   uniform, even in highly ordered framboids. This suggests that the
   self-organization of microcrystals in pyrite framboids is not
   crystallographically controlled, for example by sequential replication
   of existing microcrystals, since this would not result in high lattice
   misorientation angles between adjacent microcrystals. Presumably, the
   self-organization process is a consequence of the aggregation of
   multiple equidimensional and equimorphic microcrystals that have
   nucleated in a fixed volume. We suggest that the regular arrangement of
   microcrystals occurs by the physical rotation (reorientation) of
   individual microcrystals, driven by the reduction in surface free energy
   between neighbors.}},

Abstract = {{The reduction of iron is an essential step in the transferrin (Tf)
   cycle, which is the dominant pathway for iron uptake by red blood cell
   precursors. A deficiency in iron acquisition by red blood cells leads to
   hypochromic, microcytic anemia. Using a positional cloning strategy, we
   identified a gene, six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate
   3 (Steap3), responsible for the iron deficiency anemia in the mouse
   mutant nm1054. Steap3 is expressed highly in hematopoietic tissues,
   colocalizes with the Tf cycle endosome and facilitates Tf-bound iron
   uptake. Steap3 shares homology with F420H2:NADP(+) oxidoreductases found
   in archaea and bacteria, as well as with the yeast FRE family of
   metalloreductases. Overexpression of Steap3 stimulates the reduction of
   iron, and mice lacking Steap3 are deficient in erythroid ferrireductase
   activity. Taken together, these findings indicate that Steap3 is an
   endosomal ferrireductase required for efficient Tf-dependent iron uptake

Abstract = {{A block-matching-based self-organizing map (BMSOM) is presented. Finding
   a winner is carried out for each block, which is a set of neurons
   arranged in square. The proposed learning process updates the reference
   vectors of all of the neurons in a winner block. Then, the degrees of
   vector modifications are mainly controlled by the size (i.e., the number
   of neurons) of the winner block. To prevent a single cluster with
   neurons from splitting into some disjointed clusters, the restriction of
   the block size is imposed in the beginning of learning. At the main
   stage, this restriction is canceled. In BMSOM learning, the size of a
   winner block does not always decrease monotonically. The formula used to
   update the reference vectors is basically uncontrolled by time.
   Therefore, even if a map is in a nonstationary environment, training the
   map is probably pursued without interruption to adjust time-controlled
   parameters such as learning rate. Numerical results demonstrate that the
   BMSOM makes it possible to improve the plasticity of maps in a
   nonstationary environment and incremental learning.}},

Title = {{Tympanic membrane changes in central tympanic membrane perforations}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The objective of this study was to evaluate the
   histopathological changes in central tympanic membrane perforations
   caused by chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma.
   Materials and methods: Twenty-nine temporal bones from 25 patients (13
   male patients and 12 female patients) with central tympanic membrane
   perforations-18 chronic otitis media with perforation and 11 chronic
   otitis media with perforation caused by ventilation tubes-and 30
   aged-matched normal temporal bones were included in this study. A scale
   was used to evaluate the extension of the migration of stratified
   squamous epithelium in the inner surface of the tympanic membrane. The
   thickness of tympanic membranes was measured halfway between the annular
   ligament and the perforation and compared with that of the normal bones.
   The presence of tympanosclerosis and papillary projections of squamous
   epithelium was also noted.
   Results: The extension of the migration of stratified squamous
   epithelium in the inner surface of the tympanic membrane was observed in
   11 of the 29 perforations (38\%). The thickness of tympanic membranes
   was significantly different between the perforation groups and the
   control group. Of the 29 tympanic membranes, 13 (44\%) had
   tympanosclerosis and 8 (28\%) revealed papillary projections of squamous
   epithelium.
   Conclusions: Our study shows that a central tympanic perforation should
   not merely be considered as a simple defect. Most of the tympanic
   membranes showed one or more signs of sequelae or persistent
   abnormalities such as tympanosclerosis, papillary projections,
   thickening, and ingrowth without significant differences between the 2
   central perforation groups. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{For the last four decades there has been sustained scientific interest
   in contemporary environmental change in the Sahel (the southern fringe
   of the Sahara). It suffered several devastating droughts and famines
   between the late 1960s and early 1990s. Speculation about the
   climatology of these droughts is unresolved, as is speculation about the
   effects of land clearance on rainfall and about land degradation in this
   zone. However, recent findings suggest a consistent trend of increasing
   vegetation greenness in much of the region. Increasing rainfall over the
   last few years is certainly one reason, but does not fully explain the
   change. Other factors, such as land use change and migration, may also
   contribute. This study investigates the nature of a secular vegetation
   trend across the Sahel and discusses several potential causative
   factors. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cerebral deposition of amyloid beta-peptide (A beta) is an invariant
   feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To answer why soluble A does not
   aggregate to beta-amyloid fibrils (fA beta) in the brain of normal
   humans, we examined the influence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained
   from AD and non-AD patients on the formation of fA beta(1-40)and fA
   beta(1-42) in vitro, by using fluorescence spectroscopy with thioflavin
   T and electron microscopy. Although the CSF obtained from both groups
   inhibited the formation of both fA beta(1-40) and fA beta (1-42), the
   CSF from non-AD patients inhibited the formation of fads more strongly
   than that from AD patients. In AD patients, the final levels of fA beta
   s formation showed a significant negative correlation with the A beta
   (1-42) level in CSF. These results indicate that fA beta deposition in
   the brain of AD may be enhanced by the decrease of specific inhibitory
   factors and/or by the increase of specific accelerating factors in CSF.

Abstract = {{Patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) have an increased
   car accident rate. Investigations on accident frequency are based on
   case history, insurance reports and driving simulator studies. The
   present study combines neuropsychological testing of different attention
   aspects engaged in driving a car and driving simulation to evaluate a
   suitable instrument for assessing therapeutic effects of continuous
   positive airway pressure (CPAP).
   Driving simulator investigation and neuropsychological testing of
   alertness, vigilance and divided attention were performed in 31 patients
   with polysomnographically confirmed I (apnoea-hypopnoea index 24.8 +/-
   21.5 center dot h(-1)) before, and 2 and 42 days after initiation of
   CPAP.
   Divided attention and alertness improved significantly during CPAP,
   whereas vigilance remained unchanged. However, accident frequency (OSAS
   before therapy: 2.7 +/- 2.0; 2 days after CPAP: 1.5 +/- 1.4; 42 days
   after CPAP: 0.9 +/- 1.3) and frequency of concentration faults (OSAS
   before therapy: 12.4 +/- 5.1; 2 days after CPAP: 6.5 +/- 3.9; 42 days
   after CPAP: 4.9 +/- 3.3) decreased in the simulated driving situation
   after 2 and 42 days of therapy. There was no relation between accident
   frequency, concentration faults and daytime sleepiness, as measured by
   the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and polysomnographic or neuropsychological
   findings, respectively.
   In conclusion, the present results suggest that driving simulation is a
   possible benchmark parameter of driving performance in obstructive sleep
   apnoea syndrome patients.}},
