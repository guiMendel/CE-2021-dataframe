Abstract = {{The diagnostic ability of optical spectroscopy techniques, including
   near-infrared (NIR) Raman spectroscopy, NIR autofluorescence
   spectroscopy and the composite Raman and NIR autofluorescence
   spectroscopy, for in vivo detection of malignant tumors was evaluated in
   this study. A murine tumor model, in which BALB/c mice were implanted
   with Meth-A fibrosarcoma cells into the subcutaneous region of the lower
   back, was used for this purpose. A rapid-acquisition dispersive-type NIR
   Raman system was employed for tissue Raman and NIR autofluorescence
   spectroscopic measurements at 785-nm laser excitation. High-quality in
   vivo NIR Raman spectra associated with an autofluorescence background
   from mouse skin and tumor tissue were acquired in 5 s. Multivariate
   statistical techniques, including principal component analysis (PCA) and
   linear discriminant analysis (LDA), were used to develop diagnostic
   algorithms for differentiating tumors from normal tissue based on their
   spectral features. Spectral classification of tumor tissue was tested
   using a leave-one-out, cross-validation method, and the receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to further evaluate the
   performance of diagnostic algorithms derived. Thirty-two in vivo Raman,
   NIR fluorescence and composite Raman and NIR fluorescence spectra were
   analyzed (16 normal, 16 tumors). Classification results obtained from
   cross-validation of the LDA model based on the three spectral data sets
   showed diagnostic sensitivities of 81.3\%, 93.8\% and 93.8\%;
   specificities of 100\%, 87.5\% and 100\%; and overall diagnostic
   accuracies of 90.6\%, 90.6\% and 96.9\% respectively, for tumor
   identification. ROC curves showed that the most effective diagnostic
   algorithms were from the composite Raman and NIR autofluorescence
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Surfaces from the habitat of adult Haliotis rubra were tested as

   coralline algae Amphiroa anceps and Corallina officinalis, and
   encrusting coralline algae (Rhodophyta). Biofilmed abiotic surfaces such
   as rocks, sand and shells did not induce settlement. Ulvella lens was
   also included as a control. Treatment of U. australis, A. anceps and C.
   officinalis with antibiotics to reduce bacterial films on the surface
   did not reduce the settlement response of H. rubra larvae. Similarly,
   treatment of these species and encrusting coralline algae with germanium
   dioxide to reduce diatom growth did not significantly reduce larval
   settlement. These results suggest that macroalgae, particularly green
   algal species, may play an important role in the recruitment of H. rubra
   larvae in the field and can be used to induce larval settlement in

Abstract = {{Biparental male hamsters, Phodopus campbelli, act as midwives during the
   birth of their litter and are highly responsive to an experimentally
   displaced pup. They also have high peripheral concentrations of
   estradiol, a hormone with known roles in maternal behavior. Surgical
   castration during the gestation of their first litter was used to
   investigate the source of that estradiol and the functional role of
   testicular sex steroids in paternal responsiveness. In Experiment I,
   castration reduced both testosterone and estradiol concentrations,
   confirming that the testes were the primary source of estradiol.
   However, neither paternal responsiveness nor multiple measures of
   reproductive success were altered by the castration. Aggression directed
   towards an intruder, however, was reduced by castration. In Experiment
   II, removal of prior experience with birth or pups also failed to alter
   paternal responsiveness in castrated males. Although the present results
   do not preclude a role for local estradiol synthesis in the brain,
   results do not support an association between high circulating estradiol
   in males and their paternal behavior. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Li2B4O7 (LTB) single crystals are grown from stoichiometric and
   B2O3-enriched (1.6 and 2.4 mol \%) melts. At large B2O3 excesses, the
   thermoluminescence intensity in the crystals is markedly higher,
   attesting to an increased density of structural defects. LTB crystals
   grown from B2O3-enriched melts may contain zones enriched in two types
   of defects. Defects of one type result from the breaking of bonds
   involving bridging oxygens, without significant changes in the position
   of neighboring atoms. Defects of the other type appear at large B2O3
   excesses in the melt, which enable more significant changes in the
   structure of the boron-oxygen framework, leading to the formation of
   nanoscale regions differing in composition from LTB. The present results
   may be helpful in assessing the quality of LTB single crystals and in
   optimizing the crystal growth of LTB.}},

Abstract = {{Brillouin spectra of lithium silicate glasses with various lithium oxide
   concentrations have been investigated over a wide temperature range. The
   room-temperature elastic constants increase significantly with
   increasing lithium oxide concentration. This indicates that rigidity
   increases with lithium oxide concentration. From the temperature
   dependence of the longitudinal elastic modulus, it was found that the
   rigidity decreases on heating, faster with a high lithium content. The
   rate of decrease becomes significantly larger above the glass transition
   temperature T-g. This is related to the disruption of network bonds,
   suppressing the rigidity of the melt structures on heating. The
   increased lithium oxide concentration leads to a faster degradation in
   the network structure. The T-g of lithium silicate glasses was
   determined. The increased fragility with increased lithium oxide
   concentration reflects the significant decrease in longitudinal elastic
   modulus with temperatures above T-g. Crystallization temperature
   decreases with increasing lithium oxide concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: Phylogenetic networks are becoming an important tool in
   molecular evolution, as the evolutionary role of reticulate events, such
   as hybridization, horizontal gene transfer and recombination, is
   becoming more evident, and as the available data is dramatically

   Results: This paper addresses the problem of computing a most
   parsimonious recombination network for an alignment of binary sequences
   that are assumed to have arisen under the `infinite sites' model of
   evolution with recombinations. Using the concept of a splits network as
   the underlying datastructure, this paper shows how a recent method
   designed for the computation of hybridization networks can be extended
   to also compute recombination networks. A robust implementation of the
   approach is provided and is illustrated using a number of real
   biological datasets.}},

   of the surfaces, the use of different materials might reveal new aspects
   of the Casimir force and suggest novel solutions for the design of
   micro- and nanofabricated devices. Following this approach, we have
   measured the Casimir force using Hydrogen Switchable Mirrors-a metallic
   mirror that switches from highly reflective to transparent when exposed
   to hydrogen. The comparison of the results obtained in air and in
   hydrogen sheds light on the relative contribution of visible and
   infrared wavelengths to the Casimir interaction. We have also studied
   the dependence of the Casimir force on the metallic film thickness and
   have shown the effect of the skin-depth. The final section of the paper
   discusses the torque induced by quantum fluctuations on two birefringent
   plates and describes an experiment that should allow us to observe this
   phenomenon. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The human constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3) is a member of
   the orphan nuclear receptor superfamily that plays an important role in
   the control of drug metabolism and disposition. In this study, we
   sequenced all the coding exons of the NR1I3 gene for 334 Japanese
   subjects. We identified three novel single nucleotide polymorphisms
   (SNPs) that induce non-synonymous alterations of amino acids (His246Arg,
   Leu308Pro, and Asn323Ser) residing in the ligand-binding domain of CAR,
   in addition to the Val133Gly variant, which was another CAR variant
   identified in our previous study. We performed functional analysis of
   these four naturally occurring CAR variants in COS-7 cells using a
   CYP3A4 promoter/enhancer reporter gene that includes the CAR responsive
   elements. The His246Arg variant caused marked reductions in both
   transactivation of the reporter gene and in the response to
   6-(4-chlorophenyl)imidazo{[}2,1-b]{[}1,3]thiazole-5-carbaldehyde
   O-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)oxime (CITCO), which is a human CAR-specific
   agonist. The transactivation ability of the Leu308Pro variant was also
   significantly decreased, but its responsiveness to CITCO was not
   abrogated. The transactivation ability and CITCO response of the
   Val133Gly and Asn323Ser variants did not change as compared to the
   wild-type CAR. These data suggest that the His246Arg and Leu308Pro
   variants, especially His246Arg, may influence the expression of
   drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters that are transactivated by
   CAR. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: Although a continuous interscalene nerve
   block (CISB) has been shown to provide potent analgesia after major
   shoulder surgery, its potential effects on postoperative rehabilitation
   remain uninvestigated. Therefore, this retrospective case-control study
   was undertaken to determine the association between CISB and joint
   range-of-motion after total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA).
   Methods: The medical records for patients who underwent TSA at our
   institution in the previous 3 years were examined. Each patient with a
   CISB (cases) was matched with a patient without a CISB (controls) for
   the following variables: age, gender, and TSA type (primary v revision).
   Data collected included maximum shoulder elevation and external rotation
   (primary endpoints), along with pre- and postoperative pain scores.
   Results: Of 134 charts reviewed, 25 cases were matched with an equal
   number of controls. On postoperative day 1, patients with or without a
   CISB achieved a median (5th-95th percentiles) of 85\% (51-100) and 33\%
   (11-56) of their surgeon-defined goal for elevation (P = .048),
   respectively, and attained 100\% (33-100) and 17\% (-81-68) for external
   rotation (P < .001), respectively. The median numeric rating pain score
   (NRS) during shoulder movement for patients with ClSB was 2.0 (0.0-8.7)
   versus 8.5 (1.8-10.0) for patients without CISB (P < .001). Least,
   median, and highest resting NRS for the 24 hours after surgery were 0.0
   (0.0-5.8), 1.0 (0.0-6.4), and 3.0 (0.0-9.0) for patients with CISB,
   respectively, versus 2.0 (0.0-7.7), 6.0 (0.3-9.6), and 8.0 (0.0-10.0)
   for patients without CISB (P = .030, P < .001, and P < .001 between
   groups, respectively).
   Conclusions: The day after TSA, a CISB is associated with increased
   shoulder range of motion, most likely resulting from the potent
   analgesia these nerve blocks provide.}},

   regions at finite temperatures in accordance with the recent results of
   Liebsch. We further find that a particularly interesting behavior
   emerges around the special conditions U = U' and J = 0, which includes a
   new type of coexistence region that has three distinct states. By

Abstract = {{Background Hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy (HJMD) is a
   rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sparse and short
   scalp hair from birth, followed within a few years by progressive
   macular degeneration leading to blindness. HJMD was shown to result from
   mutations in CDH3 encoding P-cadherin.
   Objectives In the present study, we attempted to identify the molecular
   basis of abnormal hair growth in two siblings of Arab Muslim origin with
   hypotrichosis but no visual symptoms.
   Methods Mutation analysis was performed using direct sequencing and
   polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism
   analysis.
   Results Patients displayed sparse and short hair since birth.
   Significant macular degenerative pigmentary changes were noticed in the
   face of normal visual acuity. Despite the fact that a single CDH3
   mutation had previously been described in several families of Israeli
   Arab Muslim origin, the two affected patients were found to be
   homozygous carriers of a novel nonsense mutation (Y615X) predicted to
   result in premature termination of P-cadherin translation.
   Conclusions The present results indicate that all patients with
   congenital hypotrichosis should undergo thorough fundus examination,
   which, when revealing pigmentary macular changes, can be considered as
   indicative of an underlying CDH3 causative mutation.}},

Abstract = {{Few studies have compared quantitative ultrasound with bone mineral
   density (BMD) in monitoring response to therapy in osteoporosis. The aim
   of our study was to compare finger ultrasound variables and BMD for
   monitoring alendronate and estradiol therapy in postmenopausal women. We
   recruited 26 women aged 50 to 79 yr (mean: 65 yr) with osteoporosis; 18
   patients received 10 mg/d of alendronate and 500 mg/d of calcium
   carbonate and 8 patients received 500 mg/d of calcium carbonate only. We
   recruited 21 hysterectornized postmenopausal women who were randomized
   to treatment or control. The treatment group received a 25-mg estradiol
   implant, which was replaced every 6 mo. The control group had a sham
   procedure. In the alendronate group, there were significant changes at I
   yr at the lumbar spine 3 < 0.05), bone transmission time Q), < 0.01),
   and pure speed of sound (p < 0.001) and the changes continued into the
   second year. In the estradiol implant group, there were significant
   changes at I yr at the lumbar spine (p < 0.001), the femoral neck (p <
   0.05), and the pure speed of sound (p < 0.01). For alendronate, the
   signal-to-noise ratio was similar between the lumbar spine and bone
   transmission time (1.8 and 1.4) and greater than for the pure speed of
   sound and femoral neck (0.8 and 0.7); for estradiol, the signal-to-noise
   ratio was similar between the lumbar spine and femoral neck (2.0 and
   1.5) and greater than for the pure speed of sound and bone transmission
   time (1.1 and 0.6). These results indicated that changes in finger
   ultrasound are similar in clinical utility to dual-energy X-ray
   absorptiometry measurements at the femoral neck for the monitoring of
   antiresorptive treatments for osteoporosis.}},

Abstract = {{I examined 6 yr (1993-98) of data on Northern Goshawk (Accipiter
   gentilis) reproductive performance in east-central Arizona. Forty-four
   breeding territories were monitored over the 6-yr period, yielding 109
   nesting attempts and 141 fledglings produced from 76 Successful broods.
   Among the 63 broods from which sex of nestlings could be determined by
   measurements, 29\% fledged one Young, 54\% fledged two young, and 17\%
   fledged three young. The mean sex ratio across years was 1.93 +/- 0.70 (
   95\% CI) males/females (annual range 1.1:1-3:1). When combining all
   fledglings of known sex (76 males and 43 females), a 1.77:1 male to
   female sex ratio was significantly different from 1:1 (P = 0.002). A
   male-biased fledgling sex ratio may be explained by one or more of the
   following hypotheses: (1) more males were produced due to nutritional
   stress resulting in minimization of investment in the larger sex
   (females) and (2) fewer females were produced because of differential
   mortality due to exposure to the elements during the nestling stage. I
   propose that environmental stress in the form of exposure to the
   elements during a critical life stage (e.g., rainfall during the
   nestling stage), combined with limited food availability, may be driving
   the skewed sex ratios observed in this local Northern Goshawk
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Using an in vivo intra-striatal microdialysis technique, we examined the
   effects of systemically administered beta-phenylethylamine (beta-PEA), a
   psychomotor stimulating trace amine, on striatal acetylcholine release
   in freely moving rats. Infusion of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA;
   10(-5) M) significantly increased acetylcholine release. In addition,
   locally applied amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisozasole-4-propionic acid
   (ANIPA; 10(-5) M) significantly increased acetylcholine release in the
   striatum. Intra-striatal application of
   6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX; 10(-5) M), an AMPA-type
   glutamatergic receptor antagonist, had little effect on acetylcholine
   release, while application of MK-801 (10(-5) M, 10(-6) M), an NMDA-type
   glutamatergic receptor antagonist, significantly reduced acetylcholine
   release. Acetylcholine within striatal perfusate was significantly
   increased by intraperitoneal administration of beta-PEA in a
   dose-dependent manner. This increase in acetylcholine release was
   completely blocked by application of CNQX (10(-5) M) through the
   microdialysis probe into the striatum. However, increased acetylcholine
   response to systemic beta-PEA was unaltered by addition of MK-801 to the
   perfusion medium. These results suggest a regulatory function of
   beta-PEA, mediated by AMPA-type glutamatergic receptors, on the release
   of acetylcholine in the rat striatum.}},

Abstract = {{Transgenic mouse models of cancer represent a powerful approach for
   exploring disease processes and testing potential therapeutic
   interventions. Currently, it is difficult to predict if a specific
   genetic manipulation will result in a desirable phenotype. The present
   study tests the idea that tissue recombinants recapitulate the
   pathologic features of the neoplastic prostate seen in transgenic mice,
   and would thus be suitable predictive models for new mouse design. The
   large probasin-large T-antigen (LPB-Tag) transgenic lines 12T-7f and
   12T-10 were used as a basis for this study. Tissue recombinants of
   bladder epithelium (BIE) and urogenital sinus mesenchyme (UGM) were
   implanted under the renal capsule of athymic mice. Recombinants composed
   of BIE from 12T-10 LPB-Tag and wild-type (wt) UGM faithfully
   recapitulated the histopathologic and temporal features of intact
   transgenic mice of this line. Tissue recombinants using BIE from 12T-7f
   mice and wt UGM developed epithelial proliferation with atypia that
   lacked the associated hypercellular stroma seen in the intact 12T-7f
   line. Recombinants using 12T-7f UGM demonstrated that the hypercellular
   stroma results from stromal cell expression of the SV40 large T antigen.
   Corresponding to the recombinant phenotypes, stromal Tag immunostaining
   was observed in prostate tissues from intact 12T-7f but not 12T-10 mice.
   Similar stromal expression of Tag was also noted in the hypercellular
   TRAMP prostatic stroma. Further analysis revealed a previously
   unreported pattern of SV40T expression in the LADY and TRAMP models
   including ductus deferens and seminal vesicle stroma as well as region
   and cell type-specific patterns in the epididymis. The present study
   demonstrates the utility of using tissue recombination to explore
   organ-specific phenotypes. Recombination strategies should enable quick
   and cost-effective screening for likely phenotypes in transgenic
   animals. This comparison of tissue recombination to existing models
   shows that this approach can elicit new information on
   well-characterized models.}},

Abstract = {{DNA microarrays can provide insight into genetic changes that
   characterize different stages of a disease process. Accurate
   identification of these changes has significant therapeutic and
   diagnostic implications. Statistical analysis for multistage
   (multigroup) data is challenging, however. ANOVA-based extensions of
   two-sample Z-tests, a popular method for detecting differentially
   expressed genes in two groups, do not work well in multigroup settings.
   False detection rates are high because of variability of the ordinary
   least squares estimators and because of regression to the mean induced
   by correlated parameter estimates. We develop a Bayesian resealed spike
   and slab hierarchical model specifically designed for the multigroup
   gene detection problem. Data preprocessing steps are introduced to deal
   with unique features of microarray data and to enhance selection
   performance. We show theoretically that spike and slab models naturally
   encourage sparse solutions through a process called selective shrinkage.
   This translates into oracle-like gene selection risk performance
   compared with ordinary least squares estimates. The methodology is
   illustrated on a large microarray repository of samples from different
   clinical stages of metastatic colon cancer. Through a functional
   analysis of selected genes, we show that spike and slab models identify
   important biological signals while minimizing biologically implausible
   false detections.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Enoxaparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin for which the
   degree of elimination through hemofilters during continuous renal
   replacement therapy (CRRT) is not well established.
   Objective: The elimination of enoxaparin by CRRT, using acrylonitrile
   (AN69) or polysulfone (PS) membranes, was studied in vitro and among
   critically ill patients.
   Methods: In vitro procedures were carried out using Ringer's lactate,
   bovine albumin containing Ringer's lactate, or fresh human plasma as
   enoxaparin vehicle, using AN69 or PS membranes, and following continuous
   veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) or continuous veno-venous hemodialysis
   (CVVHD). Prefilter and ultrafiltrate samples were collected over 60
   minutes. All procedures were carried out in triplicate. Patients
   undergoing CRRT entered the in vivo study. Enoxaparin was administered
   subcutaneously once daily. The sieving coefficient (Sc) and saturation
   coefficient (Sa) were calculated as the relation between anti-factor Xa
   activity in simultaneously collected dialysate/ultrafiltrate samples and
   plasma samples.
   Results: Mean Sc (for CVVH) or Sa (for CVVHD) values in the in vitro
   procedures ranged from 0.16 to 0.57. Sc values during CVVH were
   significantly higher than Sa values during CVVHD in the Ringer's lactate
   procedures for both membranes (AN69 membrane, P = 0.014; PS membrane, P
   < 0.001) and in the plasma procedures with the PS membrane (P < 0.001).
   Six male and 2 female patients (all white) participated in the in vivo
   study. Their mean body weight ranged from 55 to 80 kg, and their age
   ranged from 71 to 82 years. In patients, Sc or Sa achieved values
   between 0.26 and 0.67. No significant differences were found in vivo in
   the permeability of the 2 membranes to enoxaparin.
   Conclusions: In these studies, the Sc and Sa values suggested that
   enoxaparin passed through AN69 and PS membranes during CRRT. Further
   pharmacokinetic and clinical studies are needed to determine whether a
   dose adjustment for enoxaparin is needed for patients undergoing CRRT.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2005}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In a previous paper 1 we constructed wave functions of a D-instanton and
   vertex operators in type IIB matrix model by expanding supersymmetric
   Wilson line operators. They describe couplings of a D-instanton and type
   IIB matrix model to the massless closed string fields, respectively, and
   form a multiplet of D=10 N=2 supersymmetries. In this paper we consider
   fermionic backgrounds and condensation of supergravity fields in IIB
   matrix model by using these wave functions. We start from the type IIB
   matrix model in a flat background whose matrix size is (N+1)x(N+1), or
   equivalently the effective action for (N+1) D-instantons. We then
   calculate an effective action for N D-instantons by integrating out 1
   D-instanton (which we call a mean-field D-instanton) with an appropriate
   wave function and show that various terms can be induced corresponding
   to the choice of the wave functions. In particular, a Chern-Simons-like
   term is induced when the mean-field D-instanton has a wave function of
   the antisymmetric tensor field. A fuzzy sphere becomes a classical
   solution to the equation of motion for the effective action. We also
   give an interpretation of the above wave functions in the superstring
   theory side as overlaps of the D-instanton boundary state with the
   closed string massless states in the Green-Schwarz formalism.}},

Abstract = {{Loss of RUNX3 expression is suggested to be causally related to gastric
   cancer as 45\% to 60\% of gastric cancers do not express RUNX3 mainly
   due to hypermethylation of the RUNX3 promoter. Here, we examined for
   other defects in the properties of RUNX3 in gastric cancers that express
   RUNX3. Ninety-seven gastric cancer tumor specimens and 21 gastric cancer
   cell lines were examined by immunohistochemistry using novel anti-RUNX3
   monoclonal antibodies. In normal gastric mucosa, RUNX3 was expressed
   most strongly in the nuclei of chief cells as well as in surface
   epithelial cells. In chief cells, a significant portion of the protein
   was also found in the cytoplasm. RUNX3 was not detectable in 43 of 97
   (44\%) cases of gastric cancers tested and a further 38\% showed
   exclusive cytoplasmic localization, whereas only 18\% showed nuclear
   localization. Evidence is presented suggesting that transforming growth
   factor-beta is an inducer of nuclear translocation of RUNX3, and RUNX3
   in the cytoplasm of cancer cells is inactive as a tumor suppressor.
   RUNX3 was found to be inactive in 82\% of gastric cancers through either
   gene silencing or protein mislocalization to the cytoplasm. In addition
   to the deregulation of mechanisms controlling gene expression, there
   would also seem to be at least one other mechanism controlling nuclear
   translocation of RUNX3 that is impaired frequently in gastric cancer.}},

Abstract = {{We determined the effect of risedronate on the trabecular microstructure
   of ovariectomized rat tibiae, using micro-computed tomography, in order
   to investigate how changes in microstructure contribute to biomechanical
   properties. Fifty 18-week-old rats underwent sham operation (n=10) or
   ovariectomy (OVX) (n=40). The OVX rats were further divided into four
   groups (n=10 for each group) and treated with risedronate at doses of 0,
   0.1, 0.5 or 2.5 mg/kg for 9 months. OVX caused deterioration of
   three-dimensional trabecular microstructure, notably structure model
   index (SMI) and connectivity density, while treatment of OVX rats with
   risedronate at 0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg improved those deleterious
   microstructural changes. Biomechanical property, as assessed by finite
   element analysis (FEA), correlated significantly with trabecular bone
   volume fraction (BV/TV), and the correlation further increased
   substantially when microstructural parameters were added, especially SMI
   and connectivity density, with risedronate therapy. Thus, it is
   suggested that, in addition to increasing bone mass, risedronate
   improves biomechanical property by maintaining a plate-like structure as
   well as connectivity of trabeculae.}},

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{575-581}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: There are reports concerning the relationship between
   tonsillectomy and immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN). Two reports on
   the biochemical analysis of over-produced IgAl from IgAN patients were
   recently published. On the other hand, histochemical analysis of
   tonsillar tissue indicated the disordered balance in IgG and IgA
   producing cells and in the IgA subclass producing cells in IgAN
   patients.
   Methods: IgA in tonsillar extracts and serum was separated into passed
   fraction (IgA2) and bound fraction (IgAl) by a jacalin-agarose column.
   Isoelectric focusing (IEF) analysis was carried out using an IPGphor
   instrument. The IgA content in each sample was analyzed by enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
   Results: The IgA1/IgA2 ratio of the tonsillar extracts from controls and
   IgAN patients was compared. The ratio distribution indicated
   statistically significant differences. The mean ratio for the control
   tonsil was 61/39. However, the ratio from eight out of thirty-two IgAN
   patients exhibited a higher value than the mean + 2SD (standard
   deviation) of the controls. Among them, three patients exhibited 92/8.
   Meanwhile, the ratios for serum by this method were close to the
   previously reported 89/11. There were no differences in the IgA1 IEF
   profile between the representative low-and high-IgA1 producing patients.
   Conclusions: This is the first report concerning IgA subclass
   distribution in tonsillar tissue. The ratio 61/39 for tonsillar IgA
   differ from the value (> 90\% of IgA1) in the previous histochemical
   report. The value is similar to the previous report for colostrum, whole
   saliva, jejunal fluid and bronchial fluid. The IgA1/IgA2 ratio
   distribution in the tonsillar extracts from the patients with chronic
   tonsillitis is significantly different from that of the IgAN patients.}},

Abstract = {{Lomefloxacin (LFLX) is phototoxic and phototumorigenic, but the
   mechanisms of phototumorigenesis of quinolone drugs have not been fully
   elucidated. Formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) by UVB
   radiation is primarily involved in the carcinogenesis of ultraviolet
   (UV) radiation. On the other hand, UVA region is responsible to
   photobiologic reactions of quinolone drugs. To know if CPD can be formed
   by UVA radiation in the presence of LFLX and is involved in the
   phototumorigenesis, we used xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) group A
   gene-deficient (XPA(-/-)) mouse, which is defective in nucleotide
   excision repair. XPA(-/-) and XPA(+/+) mice were irradiated to 5 J per
   cm(2)-UVA with or without the administration of LFLX. In XPA(-/-) mice
   treated with LFLX, the first skin tumor appeared after exposures to 75 J
   per cm(2) in 5 wk. In XPA(+/+) mice treated with LFLX, the first tumor
   appeared after exposures to 345 J per cm2 in 23 wk.
   Immunohistochemically, CPD formation was observed after UVA-exposure in
   the skin of XPA(+/+) as well as XPA(-/-) mice which had been given LFLX.
   The CPD disappeared, however, earlier from XPA(+/+) mice than from
   XPA(-/-) mice. The acute inflammatory reaction after LFLX administration
   and exposure to UVA were greatly enhanced in XPA(-/-) mice. These
   results indicate that UVA exposure induces DNA damage in the form of CPD
   in the presence of LFLX, which exerts phototoxicity and
   phototumorigenesis.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: Elderly patients with colorectal cancer undergo surgery with
   curative intent less frequently than younger patients, and survival
   declines with increasing age. We compared relative survival of
   colorectal cancer among patients older than 75 years with that of
   younger patients in Denmark during the period 1977 to 1999. We also
   examined trends in choice of initial treatment. METHODS: From the files
   of the nationwide population-based Danish Cancer Registry, we identified
   all cases of colorectal cancer diagnosed between 1977 and 1999. We then
   linked this data to information on survival obtained from the Danish
   Register of Causes of Death and from the Central Population Register.
   RESULTS: During the entire study period, short-term and long-term
   relative survival improved for patients of all ages, but the improvement
   was more pronounced among elderly patients (> 75 years). Radical
   resection was increasingly chosen as the initial treatment for elderly
   patients; during the 1995 to 1999 period it was performed on
   approximately 50 percent of such patients, almost as frequently as among
   younger patients. CONCLUSIONS: Relative survival of elderly colorectal
   cancer patients (> 75 years) improved in Denmark between 1977 and 1999.
   In the most recent period studied, 1995 to 1997, only minor differences
   in five-year relative survival were observed among younger, middle-aged,
   and elderly patients. A simultaneous increase in the rate of radical
   resection among elderly patients, reflecting more effective treatment,
   may underlie this finding.}},

Abstract = {{Most of the surface patterning methods currently applied are based on
   lithography techniques and microfabrication onto silicon or glass
   substrates. Here we report a novel method to prepare patterned surfaces
   on polystyrene substrates by grafting ultrathin cell-repellent polymer
   layers utilising both electron beam (EB) polymerisation and local laser
   ablation techniques for microfabrication. Polyacrylamide was grafted
   onto tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) dishes using EB irradiation.
   Water contact angles for these PAAm-grafted TCPS surfaces were less than
   10 degrees (cos theta = 0.99) with PAAm grafted amounts of 1.6 mu
   g/cm(2) as determined by ATR/FT-IR. UV excimer laser (ArF: 193 nm)
   ablation resulted in the successful fabrication of micropatterned
   surfaces composed of hydrophilic PAAm and hydrophobic basal polystyrene
   layers. Bovine carotid artery endothelial cells adhered only to the
   ablated domains after pretreatment of the patterned surfaces with 15 mu
   g/mL fibronectin at 37 degrees C. The ablated domain sizes significantly
   influenced the number of cells occupying each domain. Cell patterning
   functionality of the patterned surfaces was maintained for more than 2
   months without loss of pattern fidelity, indicating that more durable
   cell arrays can be obtained compared to those prepared by self-assembled
   monolayers of alkanethiols, as described in previous reports. The
   surface fabrication techniques presented here can be utilised for the
   preparation of cell-based biosensors as well as tissue engineering
   constructs. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Drawing upon Lawton's ecological model of adaptation and old age, this
   study analyses the implications of the degree of adjustment (congruence)
   between the self-assessed functional capacity of 33 community-dwelling
   elderly care receivers and their functional capacity as assessed by
   their respective family caregivers (N = 33), for the adaptation of the
   elderly and for their caregivers' feelings of burden, defined as their
   perception of how the caregiving activity is affecting their physical,
   psychological and social well-being. Three groups were set up on the
   basis of the level of congruence between caregivers' and care receivers'
   reports: high capacity attribution, coincidental capacity attribution,
   and low capacity attribution groups. No group differences were found in
   the care receivers' level of functional independence as perceived by
   their caregivers and as assessed by the Katz Index and the Instrumental
   Activities of Daily Living scale. However, the results showed
   differences between the three groups in relation to both the care
   receivers' adaptation when viewed in terms of their psychological
   well-being and self-efficacy. Differences between the caregivers'
   perceived sense of burden and their perception of their relatives'
   independence were also found. As proposed by the Lawton model, the
   results support the psychological benefits, both for the caregiver and
   the care receiver, of an appropriate balance between the
   socio-environmental demands (caregivers' expectations regarding care
   receivers' competence) and the capacity of the individual. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification technique was
   used to detect Flavobacterium psychrophilum from washings of fish gill
   surfaces and benthic diatoms as environmental samples. Gill washing
   samples were prepared from kawamutsu, Zacco temminckii (Temminck \&
   Schlegel) and oikawa, Z. platypus (Temminck \& Schlegel). Benthic diatom
   samples were collected from stone surfaces. All samples were collected
   from rivers in Wakayama Prefecture, Japan from November 2003 to January
   2004. Following simple DNA extraction using a chelating resin, nested
   PCR techniques targeting 16S-rDNA and gyrB regions were performed, and
   PCR products were cloned and sequenced. With nested PCR amplification
   for the 16S-rDNA gene, ambiguous PCR products were detected from two of
   six samples, and by cloning and sequencing analysis were found not to be
   DNA fragments amplified from F. psychrophilum. Using nested PCR for the
   gyrB gene, however, five of six samples were clearly positive for F.
   psychrophilum in agarose gel electrophoresis, and were found to be
   identical with nucleotide sequences of F. psychrophilumgyrB deposited in
   DNA databases by sequencing analysis. Results indicate that nested PCR
   for the gyrB region is a useful technique to detect low levels of F.

Abstract = {{Single and multiple linear regression techniques were used to explain
   the capacity of initial seedling root volume (Rv) and first-order
   lateral roots (FOLR) relative to shoot height, diameter, and fresh mass
   to serve as important indicators of stock quality and predictors of
   first- and second-year height and diameter on an afforestation site in
   southern Indiana, USA. This was accomplished for northern red oak (
   Quercus rubra L.), white oak ( Quercus alba L.), and black cherry (
   Prunus serotina Ehrh) seedlings graded into four Rv categories at
   establishment. Field survival was high ( 85 - 97\%) for all species.
   Initial diameter, height, fresh mass, and Rv provided similar predictive
   ability of second-year field response for absolute height (R-2 = 0.59 -
   0.77) and diameter (R-2 = 0.50 - 0.73) for both oak species. Initial
   seedling Rv was a better predictor of field response than FOLR for both
   oak species, though not for cherry. Multiple-variable models accounted
   for a greater proportion of the total variation in seedling field height
   and diameter than did single-variable equations. The high R-2 ( up to
   0.95) of regression models suggests field performance of these species
   can be reliably predicted and confirms the importance of initial
   seedling morphology in dictating early plantation performance.}},

   of clarithromycin ER in AIDS patients with or at risk for dMAC has not
   been previously investigated. Method: We conducted a randomized,
   crossover trial in which 14 AIDS patients received clarithromycin ER,
   1000 mg once daily, and clarithromycin IR, 500 mg bid, each for 1 week,
   with pharmacokinetic sampling at the end of each week. Results: The mean
   of the individual AUC ratios for clarithromycin ER vs. IR was 1.09 (90\%
   CI, 0.94-1.24). Adverse events were no more severe or frequent with
   clarithromycin ER than IR. Conclusion: Clarithromycin ER is a once-daily
   regimen that is as well tolerated as standard bid IR clarithromycin
   dosing and has average bioequivalence to the IR formulation in patients
   with AIDS.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most common indication for
   liver transplantation (LTx) in the United States. Ribavirin with
   pegylated interferon is the only treatment option for HCV recurrence in
   post-LTx patients. In clinical practice, for more than 50\% of patients,
   ribavirin dose needs to be modified.
   Aim. The aim of this study was to examine the role of ribavirin level
   and its relevance in the management of post-LTx patients in terms of
   renal dysfunction, efficacy, toxicity, and potential drug interactions.
   Patients and methods. Thirty-four blood samples were available from 22
   post-LTx patients. Ribavirin concentrations in plasma (all samples) and
   whole blood concentrations (16 samples) were examined. The dose of
   ribavirin ranged from 400 mg/d to 1000 mg/d, but concentrations were
   normalized to 800 mg/d.
   Results. There was a wide variation in plasma concentration of
   ribavirin, ranging from 1.8 to 122.1 mg/mL. The concentrations were
   similar in whole blood and plasma. Dose-normalized concentration with
   creatinine clearance below 70 mL/min were significantly higher when
   compared with creatinine clearance above 70 mL/min (P =.015). Eleven
   patients required erythropoietin; their mean ribavirin dosage was higher
   but mean ribavirin concentration was lower compared to the 11 patients
   who did not require erythropoietin factor. There was no difference in
   mean ribavirin concentration in patients who cleared the virus (n = 7)
   compared and who did not clear the virus (n = 9). Three patients were on
   nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) had significantly
   higher concentration (mean 87.1 mu g/mL) compared to those who did not
   receive NRTI (mean 34.4 mu g/mL, P =.00)
   Conclusion. Ribavirin concentration in plasma and whole blood were
   similar, with a wide variation. Patients with impaired renal function
   and those who were on NRTI had significantly higher concentrations of
   ribavirin. The ribavirin concentrations did not predict either the
   clearance of HCV RNA or the need for erythropoitin factor.}},

Abstract = {{Single-chain Fv (scFv) antibody fragments exhibit improved
   pharmacokinetics and biodistribution compared with intact IgG. The tumor
   uptake of scFvs is rapid, and the serum half-life is shorter than IgG.
   However, scFvs exhibit lower net dose deposition in the tumor due to a
   shorter residence time that limits their use in radioimmunotherapy. To
   improve the tumor uptake and retention of scFvs, we investigated the
   utility of cell-penetrating peptides, penetratin and transactivator of
   transcription (TAT). Biodistribution studies were done in LS174T
   tumor-bearing mice with divalent scFv derived from anti-tumor-associated
   glycoprotein 72 monoclonal antibody (mAb) CC49. Penetratin increased the
   tumor retention of scFvs without affecting the peak dose accumulation.
   The percentage of doses retained in tumors at 24 hours
   postadministration with a control (no peptide), penetratin, and TAT were
   27.25\%, 79.84\%, and 48.55\%. respectively, of that accumulated at 8
   hours postinjection. The tumor-to-blood ratios at 24 hours
   postadministration were 7.14, 19.53, and 16.48 with control, penetratin,
   and TAT treatment, respectively, whereas the pharmacokinetics were
   unaltered. Coinjection with TAT, however, resulted in increased uptake
   of the radioconjugate by the lungs. Autoradiography of the excised
   tumors indicated a more homogenous distribution of the radiolabeled scFv
   with both penetratin and TAT in comparison with the control treatment.
   Real-time whole-body imaging of the live animals confirmed improved
   tumor localization with penetratin without any increase in the uptake by
   normal tissues. In conclusion, a significant improvement in the tumor
   retention of sc(Fv)(2) was achieved by administration of penetratin.
   Therefore, the combination of penetratin and scFvs has the potential of
   improving the utility of mAb-based radiopharmacenticals.}},

Abstract = {{This study proposes a non-destructive measurement method for determining
   the thickness of an optical wave plate. The measurement system comprises
   a laser interferometer to conduct optical path length measurement, a
   stepping motor to adjust the angle of the incident light on the wave

   difference is obtained by adjusting the angle of rotation of the wave
   plate using the stepping motor. The thickness of the optical wave plate
   can be obtained accurately and rapidly from the mathematical relations
   describing the optical path length difference. The proposed measurement
   method is capable of measuring large thicknesses (i.e., at the cm scale)
   with nano-scale precision. As such, the method provides a valuable
   contribution to the field of precision thickness measurement. (c) 2005

   Scope: The toxicity rates of 480 consecutive prostate cancer patients

   regression analyses were performed including the major demographic,
   disease, and treatment factors. Although no reduction in acute GI
   toxicity from HT use was observed (P=0.067), a lower rate of acute GU
   toxicity was observed (P=0.002). No factor reached statistical
   significance on regression analysis.
   Conclusions: Observed toxicity rates were similar or lower in patients

Abstract = {{Introduction: Cyclophotocoagulation and phacoemulsification procedures
   may be combined to treat patients with glaucoma and cataract. To the
   best of our knowledge data concerning this combination have not been
   published as yet.
   Patients and Methods: 28 eyes (23 patients, mean age 78.1 +/- 7.6 years)
   were operated upon between 9.04.2002 and 29.06.2004. Patients were
   compared to a group with phacoemulsification alone.
   Results: A median of 15 laser flashes (duration 2000 ms, power 1750 mW)
   were applied. Complications at discharge from hospital (and after 6
   weeks) were: corneal oedema 18 \% (4.0 \%), fibrinous reaction 25 \%
   (7.1 \%), hyphaema 7.1 \% (0 \%), 1 decentred IOL, 7.1 \% capsular tear.
   Visual acuity increased statistically significantly from 0.3 to 0.5.
   Mean intraocular pressure decreased statistically significantly from
   23.7 +/- 5.6 mmHg to 16.0 +/- 3.4 mmHg after 166 days. Success rate was
   76 \% after 6 weeks and 85.7 \% after 166 days. The mean number of
   antiglaucomatous drugs could be reduced from 1.6 to 1.1 after 166 days.
   In the control group there was a transient corneal edema in 14.3 \% (7.1
   \% cornea guttata), other complications were not found.
   Conclusion: The combination of cyclophotocoagulation and
   phacoemulsification is as successful as other combinations of cataract
   and glaucoma surgery with a similar or lower complication rates.
   Cyclophotocoagulation is cost efficient, can be repeated and is
   adaptable to the intraocular pressure.}},

Abstract = {{In light of palatability concerns with beef semtitendinosus (ST), its
   resistance to tenderization by more conventional methods, and its large
   content of elastin, investigation into the efficacy of enzyme injection
   was undertaken. Pancreatin, an enzyme cocktail for cheese making, was
   chosen for its content of elastase, amongst other enzymes, making it a
   suitable choice for use in the ST. To compare with uninjected controls,
   samples were prepared to contain a conservative level (0.01\% delivered)
   of pancreatin, salt/phosphate brine, or a combination of enzyme with
   brine, injected to 105 or 110\% green weight. Injection treatment
   significantly affected several meat quality attributes, while injection
   level did not. Where water alone was used as the enzyme carrier for
   injection, an excessive amount of drip loss was observed, with no
   improvement in tenderness. Salt/phosphate improved brine retention,
   increased pH, and resulted in darker meat colour. A significant
   reduction in shear was observed following injection with the
   enzyme/brine combination, results indicating that ST tenderness can be
   improved by 9-15\% with the modest level of pancreatin used in this
   injection treatment. Further investigation is recommended to evaluate
   the tenderization potential using higher enzyme levels, and to examine
   the safety and sensory aspects of pancreatin use.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the study was to test the hypothesis that infants with
   higher levels of prenatal exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   (PAHs) from fossil fuel combustion may be at greater risk of developing
   respiratory symptoms. The study was carried out in a cohort of 333
   newborns in Krakow, Poland, followed over the first year of life, for
   whom data from prenatal personal air monitoring of mothers in the second
   trimester of pregnancy were available. The relative risks of respiratory
   symptoms due to prenatal PAHs exposure were adjusted for potential
   confounders (gender of child, birth weight, maternal atopy, maternal
   education as a proxy for the socio-economic status, exposure to
   postnatal environmental tobacco smoke, and moulds in households) in the
   Poisson regression models. Increased risk related to prenatal PAH
   exposure was observed for various respiratory symptoms such as barking
   cough (RR = 4.80; 95\% CI: 2.73-8.44), wheezing without cold (RR = 3.83;
   95\% CI: 1.18-12.43), sore throat (RR = 1.96; 95\% CI: 1.38-2.78), ear
   infection (RR = 1.82; 95\% CI: 1.03-3.23), cough irrespective of
   respiratory infections (RR=1.27; 95\% CI: 1.07-1.52), and cough without
   cold (RR = 1.72; 95\% CI: 1.02-2.92). The exposure to PAHs also had
   impact on the duration of respiratory symptoms. The effect of PAHs
   exposure on the occurrence of such symptoms as runny nose or cough was
   partly modified by the simultaneous exposure to postnatal passive
   smoking. The analysis performed for the duration of respiratory symptoms
   confirmed significant interaction between PAHs exposure and postnatal
   ETS for runny or stuffy nose (RR = 1.82; 95\% CI: 1.57-2.10), cough (RR
   = 1.18; 95\% CI: 0.99-1.40), difficulty in breathing (RR = 1.39; 95\%
   CI: 1.01-1.92) and sore throat (RR = 1.74; 1.26-2.39). Obtained results
   support the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to immunotoxic PAHs may
   impair the immune function of the fetus and subsequently may be
   responsible for an increased susceptibility of newborns and young
   infants to respiratory infections.}},

Abstract = {{Although the last generally accepted concept of principles of teratology
   was issued more than 30 years ago, the cause of less than 50\% of all
   congenital anomalies is known and no substantial change in their
   incidence has been observed worldwide. In the meantime, powerful
   techniques of molecular biology as well as many sophisticated preventive
   measures have been introduced with marginal effects on the overall birth
   defects numbers. In this paper, we follow the history of basic concepts
   of teratology starting with Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and Dareste,
   followed in the 20th century by James Wilson. Since that time no bright
   and completely new idea, which would deserve the name principle, has
   emerged. The advanced molecular studies support the long-existing
   principles and disclose the great variability of individuals and their
   responses to adverse exposures. In this way, the future of teratology
   counseling may be seen in a deep analysis of any individual case. (c)

Title = {{Larval habitat selection, not larval supply, determines settlement
   patterns and adult distribution in two chthamalid barnacles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{74}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{1. Two common species of acorn barnacle, Chthamalus montagui and C.
   stellatus, with similar resource needs, occur together on rocky shores
   of NW Europe but differ in their adult distribution over two
   environmental gradients, wave exposure and vertical height on the shore.
   2. A sampling programme was undertaken over 2 years to determine the
   causal mechanisms of this differential distribution. Three alternative,
   although not mutually exclusive, models were tested: first, adult
   distribution is determined at settlement as a direct result of
   differential larval supply; secondly, adult distribution is determined
   at settlement as a result of larval choice rather than differential
   larval supply; and thirdly, settlement occurs homogeneously over the two
   gradients and the adult pattern is set by differential post-settlement
   mortality.
   3. Near-shore larval abundance in the water column over the gradient of
   wave exposure was determined at eight dates during the main settlement
   period in 2003. Larval production was assessed by quantifying
   early-stage larvae, while the supply of competent settlers to the adult
   habitat was determined by quantifying late-stage cyprid larvae.
   4. The pattern of settlement of the two species was determined over both
   environmental gradients by daily sampling of the proportional abundance
   of C. stellatus and C. montagui settled cyprids at three tidal heights
   at exposed and sheltered shores. Differential post-settlement mortality
   was determined by quantifying day-old, week-old and up to 3 months-old
   metamorphosed individuals.
   5. Larval production reflected the distribution of adults, with
   early-stage larvae of C. montagui predominating in shelter and C.
   stellatus in exposure. However, the supply of late-stage cyprid larvae
   to the near-shore area showed no difference in the proportion of each
   species over the wave-exposure gradient; differential larval supply was
   not responsible for dictating adult distribution.
   6. Despite no differential supply of larvae, the pattern of settlement
   of the two species differed over both environmental gradients, with C.
   stellatus settling in greater proportions low on the shore and in
   exposure and C. montagui settlement predominating higher on the shore
   and in shelter. This pattern directly matched the distribution of
   adults. Post-settlement mortality accentuated, but did not change, the
   pattern set at settlement.
   7. The implications of the results, and the usefulness of the technique
   employed, to understanding the degree of `openness' in populations of
   marine benthic invertebrates are discussed.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objectives. To explore the impact of students' financial circumstances
   on their mental and physical health.
   Design. The study employed a correlational design.
   Methods. An opportunity sample of 89 British students and 98 Finnish
   students completed a questionnaire which assessed their amount of debt,
   financial concerns, mental and physical health, smoking and drinking
   behaviours, work in addition to study, and perceptions of control.
   Results. British students reported greater levels of debt and financial
   concern than Finnish students. They also reported significantly worse
   mental and physical health on a variety of dimensions. Financial concern
   was a significant linear predictor of mental and physical health, with
   increased financial concern being consistently associated with worse
   health. There was no evidence that students' smoking or drinking
   behaviour, work in addition to study, or perceptions of control
   substantially mediated the relationship between financial concern and
   health.
   Conclusion. The results support the position that students' financial
   circumstances might have serious implications for their health. It is
   proposed, therefore, that recent changes in government funding policies
   for students could have a negative impact on student health and
   exacerbate finance-related health inequalities. Further research is
   required to identify factors that may mediate or moderate the impact of
   financial concern on health.}},

Title = {{Long-lasting antiepileptic effects of levetiracetam against epileptic
   seizures in the spontaneously epileptic rat (SER): Differentiation of
   levetiracetam from conventional antiepileptic drugs}},
Journal = {{EPILEPSIA}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{46}},

Pages = {{1362-1370}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Some evidence suggests that levetiracetam (LEV) possesses
   antiepileptogenic characteristics. The purpose of this study was to
   investigate the time course of seizure protection by LEV compared with
   that of phenytoin (PHT), phenobarbital (PB), valproate (VPA), and
   carbamazepine (CBZ) in the spontaneously epileptic rat (SER). The SER is
   a double mutant (tm/tm, zi/zi) showing both tonic convulsions and
   absence-like seizures.
   Methods: The effect of single (40, 80, and 160 mg/kg, i.p.) and 5-day
   (80 mg/kg/day, i.p.) administration of LEV on tonic convulsions and
   absence-like seizures in SERs were studied. Tonic convulsions induced by
   blowing air onto the animal's head at 5-min intervals for 30 min and
   spontaneous absence-like seizures characterized by 5- to 7-Hz
   spike-wave-like complexes in the cortical and hippocampal EEG were
   recorded for 30 min. In the single-administration study, observations
   for seizure activity were performed once before and 3 times (45, 75, and
   135 min) after drug administration. In the 5-day administration study,
   seizure observation was performed 4 times for 30 min (once before and 3
   times after drug administration) during the 5-day drug-administration
   period, and continued once a day until 8 days after the final
   administration. The antiepileptic effects of 5-day administration of
   conventional AEDs (PHT, PB, VPA, and CBZ) were examined by using similar
   methods.
   Results: Tonic convulsions and absence-like seizures were inhibited by a
   single administration of LEV at 80 and 160 mg/kg, i.p., but not
   significantly at 40 mg/kg, i.p. When LEV was repeatedly administered at
   80 mg/kg/day, i.p., for 5 days to SERs, the inhibitory effects on
   seizures increased with administration time. The number of tonic
   convulsions and absence-like seizures were significantly reduced to
   39.1\% and 38.4\% compared with previous values, respectively, after
   5-day LEV administration. Furthermore, significant inhibition of tonic
   convulsions was detected <= 3 days after the final administration, and
   significant inhibition of absence-like seizures was still observed 8
   days after the final injection of LEV. This demonstrates long-lasting
   seizure protection by LEV after cessation of treatment. PHT, PB, VPA,
   and CBZ inhibited tonic convulsions more potently compared with LEV in
   SERs. The maximal antiseizure effects of these drugs were reached after
   the initial administration, with almost the same antiseizure effects
   observed through day 5, despite continued drug administration. Moreover,
   a long-lasting treatment effect was not observed with any of these drugs
   except for PHT and CBZ, both of which showed moderately prolonged
   antiseizure effects.
   Conclusions: These results show that LEV is effective in the treatment
   of both convulsive and absence-like seizures in SERs after single- and
   multiple-dose administration. Interestingly, in the 5-day administration
   study, it was found that the antiepileptic effects for tonic convulsions
   and absence-like seizures were observed both during the
   drug-administration period and <= 8 days after the final administration
   of LEV. This long-lasting effect suggests that LEV may possess an
   antiepileptogenic effect that it does not share with PHT, PB, VPA, and
   CBZ.}},

Abstract = {{The potential capacity of soil to sequester carbon in response to global
   warming is strongly regulated by the ratio of rhizosphere respiration to
   respiration by soil microbial decomposers, because of their different
   temperature sensitivities. To quantify relative contributions of
   rhizosphere respiration to total soil respiration as influenced by
   forest stand development, we conducted a trenching study in two larch
   (Larix gmelini (Rupr.) Rupr.) plantations, aged 17 and 31 years, in
   northeastern China. Four plots in each plantation were randomly selected
   and trenched in early May 2001. Soil surface CO2 effluxes both inside
   and outside the plots were measured from May 2001 to August 2002. Soil
   respiration (i.e., the CO2 effluxes outside the trenched plots) varied
   similarly in the two plantations from 0.8 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in winter
   to 6.0 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in summer. Rhizosphere respiration (i.e., CO2
   efflux outside the trenched plots minus that inside the plots) varied
   from 0.2 to 2.0 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in the old forest and from 0.3 to 4.0
   mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in the young forest over the seasons. Rhizosphere
   respiration, on average, accounted for 25\% of soil respiration in the
   old forest and 65\% in the young forest. Rhizosphere and soil
   respiration were significantly correlated with soil temperature but not
   with soil water content. We conclude that the role forests play in
   regulating climate change may depend on their age.}},

Abstract = {{A top-down approach is known to be a useful and effective technique for
   the design and analysis of metabolic systems. In this study, we have
   constructed a grouped metabolic network for Lactococcus lactis under

   of grouping work, a non-grouped system and grouped systems were compared
   quantitatively with each other. Here, grouped systems were designed as
   two groups according to the extent of grouping. The overall simulated
   flux values in grouped and non-grouped models had pretty similar
   distribution trends, but the details on flux ratio at the pyruvate
   branch point showed a little difference. This result indicates that our
   grouping technique can be used as a good model for complicated metabolic
   networks, however, for detailed analysis of metabolic network, a more
   robust mechanism should be considered. In addition to the data for the
   pyruvate branch point analysis, some major flux control coefficients

Abstract = {{A directed search for QTL affecting carcass traits was carried out in
   the region of growth differentiation factor 8 (GDF8, also known as
   myostatin) on ovine chromosome 2 in seven Texel-sired half-sib families
   totaling 927 progeny. Weights were recorded at birth, weaning,
   ultrasound scanning, and slaughter. Ultrasonic measures of LM
   cross-sectional dimensions and s.c. fat above the LM were made, with the
   same measurements made on the LM after slaughter. Following slaughter,
   linear measurements of carcass length and width were made on all
   carcasses, and legs and loins from 540 lambs were dissected. Genotyping
   was carried out using eight microsatellite markers from FCB128 to RM356
   on OAR 2 and analyzed using Haley-Knott regression. There was no
   evidence for QTL for growth rates or linear carcass traits. There was
   some evidence for QTL affecting LM dimensions segregating in some sire
   families, although it was not consistent between ultrasound and carcass
   measures of the same traits. There was strong and consistent evidence
   for a QTL affecting muscle and fat traits in the leg that mapped between
   markers BM81124 and BULGE20 for the four sires that were heterozygous in
   this region, but not for the three sires that were homozygous. The size
   of the effect varied across the four sires, ranging from 0.5 to 0.9 of
   an adjusted SD for weight-adjusted leg muscle traits, and ranging from
   0.6 to 1.2 of an adjusted SD for weight-adjusted leg fat traits. The
   clearest effect shown was for multivariate analysis combining all leg
   muscle and fat traits analyzed across sires, where the -log(10)
   probability was 14. Animals carrying the favorable haplotype had 3.3\%
   more muscle and 9.9\% less fat in the leg relative to animals carrying
   other haplotypes. There was evidence for a second peak in the region of
   marker TEXAN2 for one sire group. It seems that a QTL affecting muscle
   and fat traits exists within the New Zealand Texel population, and it
   maps to the region of GDF8 on OAR2.}},

Title = {{Aerial monitoring of marine waterfowl in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{1-3}},
Pages = {{1-43}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to design and test a monitoring protocol
   for marine waterfowl in the central Alaskan Beaufort Sea. The study
   provides an important case-study of how a long-term monitoring program
   may be affected by unanticipated human disturbances.
   Because of its overwhelming and widespread abundance, relatively
   sedentary behavior, ease in counting, and the extensive historical
   database, the long-tailed duck (Clangula hyemalis) was selected as the
   focal species. Two null hypotheses were formulated concerning potential
   changes in the numbers and distribution of long-tailed ducks in relation
   to disturbance in an industrial study area, compared to a reference
   study area located about 50 km to the east.
   A 9-year historical database (1977-1984, 1989) of long-tailed duck
   densities and other important data recorded during systematic aerial
   surveys was analyzed retrospectively using multiple regression
   techniques. The retrospective analyses determined which of several
   predictor variables recorded were significantly related to long-tailed
   duck density. Separate analyses were conducted for two periods: (1) the
   overall period when long-tailed ducks were present in the lagoon study
   areas, and (2) the shorter adult male molt period. The results of the
   two analyses indicated that 57\% and 68\%, respectively, of the total
   variation in long-tailed duck density during the two periods could be
   explained by variables recorded during the surveys. Predictor variables
   representing habitat, day of the year, time of day, amount of ice, and
   wave height recorded on-transect during surveys were most closely
   associated with long-tailed duck density. Measurement error during the
   surveys, and influences outside the study area such as nesting success
   in tundra habitats and mortality during migration and in over-wintering
   areas likely also had strong influences on the results, but these
   factors were not measurable in our study.
   Based on results of the retrospective analyses, a long-term monitoring
   protocol consisting of a program of systematic aerial surveys and an
   analyses of variance and covariance (ANOVA and ANCOVA) statistical
   procedure was designed and initially tested in 1990 and 1991. This
   2-year testing phase resulted in several revisions to the monitoring
   protocol. Refinements were made to the original sampling procedures, to
   the survey schedule, and to the recommended statistical analysis
   procedures. Results of the ANOVA and ANCOVA indicated that there was no
   evidence of a change in long-tailed duck densities that could be
   attributable to disturbance (from any source) in the industrial study
   area relative to a reference area with no industrial development. Other
   analyses indicated that the sampling and analysis procedures would be
   adequate to detect long-term trends in long-tailed duck density and
   localized disturbance effects, but that the monitoring program should be
   continued well beyond two years to detect statistically significant
   changes. As a result, additional aerial surveys of both study areas were
   conducted again during 1999-2001.
   Results of the revised ANOVA and ANCOVA of the 1990-1991 and 1999-2001
   survey data indicated that the density of long-tailed ducks had
   significantly declined in coastal lagoons along the central Alaskan
   Beaufort Sea coast during the study period. In addition, disturbances
   throughout the barrier island-lagoon systems used by these ducks,
   including both the industrial and the reference study areas, had
   significantly increased over the same period. However, because
   unanticipated disturbances from a variety of anthropogenic sources, and
   not just industry sources, increased in both study areas, the reference
   study area was not an effective statistical control. As a result, the
   decline in long-tailed duck density in both study areas was not
   attributable to industry-related activities. Although the monitoring
   protocol described here is an effective method to detect statistically
   significant changes in long-tailed duck distribution and abundance in
   the nearshore Alaskan Beaufort Sea, many more years of sampling would be
   necessary to attribute observed changes to industry-related
   disturbances.}},

   illustrative scenarios for this sector. The results of the scenarios
   suggest that it may be technically easier, using currently available
   technology, to achieve CO2 emission reductions in excess of 80\% within
   the UK housing stock by the middle of this century. However, achieving

Abstract = {{The clinical signs of Rett syndrome, as well as neuropathology and brain
   imaging, suggest that the disorder disrupts neuronal circuits. Studies
   using receptor autoradiography demonstrate abnormalities in the density
   of excitatory glutamate and inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
   synaptic receptors in postmortem brain from young female subjects with
   Rett syndrome. MeCP2, the protein that is abnormal in most female
   individuals with Rett syndrome, is expressed predominantly in neurons
   and appears during development at the time of synapse formation. Studies
   of nasal epithelium from patients with Rett syndrome show that the
   maturation of olfactory receptor neurons is impeded prior to the time of
   synapse formation. Recent reports indicate that MeCP2 controls the
   expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and the DNA-binding
   homeobox protein Dlx5. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor enhances
   glutamate neurotransmission at excitatory synapses, whereas Dlx5 is
   expressed in most GABAergic neurons and stimulates the synthesis of
   GABA. Taken together, this information supports the hypothesis that Rett
   syndrome is a genetic disorder of synapse development, especially
   synapses that use glutamate and GABA as neurotransmitters.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To extend previous observations regarding the prognostic
   value of analyzing lymph node DNA from patients with cutaneous T-cell
   lymphoma for the presence of a monoclonal T-cell population by Southern
   blot vs polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods.
   Design: Inception cohort study from 1982 to 1998. Recruitment of new
   patients ended in 1994.
   Setting: A tertiary care referral center in Seattle, Wash.
   Patients: Fifty-five uniformly staged patients with the diagnosis of
   cutaneous T-cell lymphoma who underwent a lymph node biopsy, 21 with
   clinically abnormal nodes and 34 with normal nodes.
   Interventions: Lymph nodes were evaluated for T-cell receptor (TCR)
   gamma-chain gene rearrangement by 2 PCR methods: capillary
   electrophoresis and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The same
   lymph nodes were evaluated by Southern blot analysis for TCR P-chain
   gene rearrangement and examined histopathologically on the basis of the
   National Cancer Institute lymph node classification system. Patients
   were observed clinically for a mean of 9.5 years.
   Main Outcome Measures: Skin stage, clinical lymph node examination,
   lymph node histologic examination, Southern blot analysis, and PCR
   analyses were evaluated as potential prognostic predictors by univariate
   and multivariate analyses. The statistical association of TCR analysis
   and clinical outcome was determined among all patients. Hazard ratios
   (HRs) by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis were used to
   estimate the risk of a poor clinical outcome. Cumulative survival rates
   were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method.
   Results: A skin stage of T3 (tumors) or T4 (erythroderma) was the most
   powerful predictor of a poor clinical outcome (HR, 31.3 vs T1; P <.001).
   Patients with detectable TCR gamma-chain gene rearrangement in lymph
   node DNA by PCR also were more likely to have a poor outcome (HR, 5.1; P
   <.001), but it was a less powerful predictor than skin stage. Even when
   the skin stage, presence or absence of lymphadenopathy, and histologic
   lymph node score were known for the patient, Southern blot analysis
   still added to prediction of a poor outcome (HR, 9.3; P=.007), whereas
   PCR provided no statistically significant additional information on
   outcome.
   Conclusions: Detection of a monoclonal T-cell population by PCR in lymph
   nodes of patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma does not enhance
   prediction of clinical outcome and probability of survival beyond what
   can be determined from clinical examination and histologic lymph node
   scores. Skin stage and the presence or absence of lymphadenopathy remain
   the most important determinants of clinical outcome.}},

Abstract = {{The Southeast Asia rainfall (SEAR) anomalies depend strongly on phases
   of El Nino (La Nina). Using an extended empirical orthogonal function
   (EEOF) analysis, it is shown that the dominant EEOF mode of SEAR
   anomalies evolves northeastward throughout a period from the summer when
   El Nino develops to spring the following year when the event weakens.
   This evolution is consistent with northeastward migration of the
   ENSO-related anomalous out going radiation field. During boreal summer
   (winter), the strong ENSO-related anomaly tends to reside in regions
   south (north) of the equator. The evolution of dominant mode of SEAR
   anomalies is in tandem with the evolution of ENSO-related sea surface
   temperature (SST) anomalies. The strengthening and weakening of
   ``boomerang-shaped{''} SST in western Pacific, the changing sign of
   anomalous SST in Java Sea and the warming in Indian Ocean and South
   China Sea are all part of ENSO-related changes and all are linked to
   SEAR anomaly. The anomalous low-level circulation associated with
   ENSO-related SEAR anomaly indicates the strengthening and weakening of
   two off-equatorial anticyclones, one over the Southern Indian Ocean and
   the other over the western North Pacific. Together with patterns of El
   Nino minus La Nina composites of various fields, it is proposed that the
   northeastward evolution of SEAR anomaly is basically part of the
   large-scale eastward evolution of ENSO-related signal in the
   Indo-Pacific sector. The atmosphere-ocean interaction plays an important
   role in this evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the optimal interval of ejaculatory abstinence

   Design: Retrospective analysis.
   Setting: Reproductive endocrinology and infertility center.
   Patient(s): Infertile couples undergoing ovulation induction and IUI
   with partner's semen.
   Intervention(s): Ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate and a
   single IUI procedure per cycle.
   Main Outcome Measures(s): Clinical pregnancy rates as a function of
   abstinence intervals.
   Result(s): Four hundred seventeen women underwent 929 cycles from June
   1999 to October 2002 for a median of 4 M attempts per couple. The median
   ejaculatory abstinence interval was 4 days (range 0-30) with an overall
   pregnancy rate of 12\% per cycle. Abstinence correlated positively with
   inseminate sperm count but negatively with motility, Variations in
   inseminate parameters did not correlate with pregnancy rates. However,
   abstinence intervals significantly affected pregnancy rates. The highest
   pregnancy rate was observed with an abstinence interval of 3 days or
   less (14\%) and the lowest pregnancy rate seen with an abstinence
   interval of 10 days or more (3\%).
   Conclusion(s): An abstinence interval of 3 days or less was associated
   with higher pregnancy rates following IUI. Prolonged,abstinence
   decreases pregnancy rates, independent of other sperm parameters,
   perhaps as a result of sperm senescence and functional damage not
   readily identified by standard semen analysis. Abstinence intervals
   should be controlled for in studies examining pregnancy outcome in
   assisted reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Plants need some kind of stored resources to
   resprout after shoot destruction. The aim of this study was to determine
   the relative importance of carbohydrate and nitrogen (N) storage levels
   for their ability to resprout.
   Methods A shoot clipping experiment was conducted on Quercus crispula
   seedlings, which were grown in a factorial experimental design, with two
   light levels (40 \% and 3 \% of full light) and three nutrient
   concentrations (low, medium and high).
   Key Results At the time of shoot clipping (the end of spring leaf
   expansion), seedlings exposed to 40 \% light had an average total
   non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) concentration of 17.0 \% in their
   roots compared with 4.9 \% in the roots of seedlings exposed to 3 \%
   light, and the average amount of TNC (TNC pools) in the roots was 203.8
   mg and 20.0 mg at 40 \% light and 3 \% light, respectively. In contrast,
   root N concentration averaged 2.3 \% in the 3 \% light treatment
   compared with 1.2 \% in the 40 \% light treatment, and it increased with
   successive rises in nutrient concentrations at both light levels.
   Regardless of the nutrient status, at the 40 \% light level > 80 \% of
   the seedlings resprouted after shoot clipping. Few seedlings, however,
   resprouted at the 3 \% light level, particularly in the medium- and
   high-nutrient treatments. Furthermore, both root TNC concentrations and
   TNC pools decreased after resprouting, but the amount of root N remained
   constant.
   Conclusions These results suggest that carbohydrate storage has a
   stronger influence on resprouting in Quercus crispula than N storage.
   However, the size of the resprouting shoot was positively correlated
   with the amount of both N and TNC in roots. The level of N storage is,
   therefore, also important for the growth of resprouting shoots.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this article is to verify the effectiveness of CHO
   products (mixtures of esters) and their compositions with a lactam-type
   CHNO compound applied at the concentration <= 1 wt\% as antiwear
   additives to white oils. The research was performed using a ball-on-disk
   tester and a special four-ball apparatus. The tested CHO and CHNO
   additives show very good antiwear properties under boundary lubrication
   conditions. They provide the highest wear reduction when they are
   introduced at 0.1 wt\%. The wear reduction synergism for mixtures
   comprising 20 wt\% of the CHNO compound and 80 wt\% of the selected
   esters is not observed. Additionally, the limiting pressure of seizure,
   p, was determined. It was found that p is not improved by esters and the
   CHNO additive if they are added at 0.1 wt\%; the positive influence of
   some mixtures comprising 20 wt\% of the CHNO compound and 80 wt\% of the
   chosen esters is revealed. it was also proved that the oil viscosity
   influences the tribological properties of applied additives under
   boundary lubrication and extreme pressure conditions.}},

Title = {{The threshold of bone mineral density for vertebral fractures in female

Abstract = {{Background and objective: Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is one of
   the causal diseases that induce secondary osteoporosis. Although
   patients with pHPT have reduced bone mineral density (MM) especially at
   the cortical bone, there have been controversies about risk of fracture.
   Moreover, no reports have been available about the threshold of BMD for
   fractures in pHPT patients.
   Methods: BMD values were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at
   lumbar spine, femoral neck and distal one third of radius. Various
   indices were compared in 116 female pHPT patients and 716 control
   subjects. Moreover, we analyzed relationship between the cut-off values
   of BMD and the prevalence of vertebral fractures in pHPT and control
   subjects.
   Results: The prevalence of subjects with vertebral fractures was lower
   in pHPT patients, compared with that of control subjects. Age and body
   height were significantly higher and lower in pHPT women with vertebral
   fractures, respectively. Lumbar spine BMD was significantly lower in
   pHPT women with vertebral fractures, presumably due to their increased
   age. There were no differences in femoral neck and radius BMD or in bone
   metabolic indices between pHPT women with and without vertebral
   fractures. On the other hand, age-matched BMD was not significantly
   different between both groups at any measured site. Cut-off values of
   BMD at lumbar spine and femoral neck were lower in postmenopausal pHPT
   patients, compared with those of the postmenopausal control group.
   Moreover, cut-off values of BMD at radius was much lower in
   postmenopausal pHPT patients, compared with those of the postmenopausal
   control group (pHPT vs control (g/cm(2)): 0.670 vs 0.706 at lumbar
   spine; 0.549 vs 0.570 at femoral; 0.394 vs 0.474 at radius). Sensitivity
   and specificity of vertebral fractures was lower in pHPT patients,
   compared with those in control group.
   Conclusions: The present cross-sectional study demonstrated that
   thresholds of BMD for vertebral fractures were lower especially at
   radial bone in female patients with pHPT, compared with those in the
   control group.}},

Abstract = {{Drying kinetics of red chillies in a rotary dryer was determined within
   a temperature range of 50-65 degrees C. The time required to dry 10.5kg
   chillies (loaded to 75\% of dryer volume) from an initial moisture
   content of around 330\% dry basis (db) to the final moisture content of
   around 10.5\% db was 32,27,23 and 20 h at 50, 55, 60 and 65 degrees C of
   drying air temperature, respectively. The average capsaicin content and
   value for the red/green chromaticity coordinate a{*} of dried chillies
   decreased from 0.54\% to 0.28\% and 22.83 to 12.31, respectively, as the
   drying air temperature increased from 50 to 65 degrees C. The overall
   performance of the chillies dried at 55 degrees C was the best, when the
   quality attributes viz., drying time, capsacin content and red colour,
   were considered. Suitable models are identified to predict the moisture
   ratio of chillies at different drying air temperature of a rotary dryer.
   The effective moisture diffusivity D-eff of chillies increased from
   13.635 to 19.949mm(2) h(-1) as the drying air temperature of a rotary
   dryer increased from 50 to 65 degrees C. The activation energy of
   diffusion E-a was calculated as 24.476MJkgmol(-1). (c) 2005 Silsoe

Abstract = {{Although stem cells are believed to divide infinitely by self-renewal
   division, there is little evidence that demonstrates their infinite
   replicative potential. Spermatogonial stem cells are the founder cell
   population for spermatogenesis. Recently, in vitro culture of
   spermatogonial stem cells was described. Spermatogonial stem cells can
   be expanded in vitro in the presence of glial cell line-derived
   neurotrophic factor (GDNF), maintaining the capacity to produce
   spermatogenesis after transplantation into testis. Here, we examined the
   stability and proliferative capacity of spermatogonial stem cells using
   cultured cells. Spermatogonial stem cells were cultured over 2 years and
   achieved similar to 10(85)-fold expansion. Unlike other germline cells
   that often acquire genetic and epigenetic changes in vitro,
   spermatogonial stem cells retained the euploid karyotype and
   androgenetic imprint during the 2-year experimental period, and produced
   normal spermatogenesis and fertile offspring. However, the telomeres in
   spermatogonial stem cells gradually shortened during culture, suggesting
   that they are not immortal. Nevertheless, the remarkable stability and
   proliferative potential of spermatogonial stem cells suggest that they
   have a unique machinery to prevent transmission of genetic and
   epigenetic damages to the offspring, and these characteristics make them
   an attractive target for germline modification.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Rotaviruses cause acute viral gastroenteritis worldwide. It
   has been estimated that, each year, 440,000 deaths that occur among
   children are attributed to rotavirus infection, mainly in developing
   countries. In India, the diversity of rotaviruses reported during the
   1980s and 1990s emphasizes the need for surveillance of cocirculating
   strains, to follow the rapid changes in circulation and to detect novel
   strains.
   Methods. We analyzed data from published epidemiological studies, to
   collate available information on serotyping and genotyping of
   rotaviruses before the initiation of a national rotavirus surveillance
   program. The studies included 18 Indian cities and were performed during
   1996 - 2001.
   Results. Rotaviruses were detected in 23.4\% of patients with diarrhea
   who presented to the hospital. There were marked geographic differences
   in virus circulation, with G1 being the single most common G type
   identified in all parts of India, except for western India. Group B
   rotaviruses were reported from Kolkata and Pune. Human infections with
   strains G6, G8, G10, and G9P{[}19], which may occur as a result of
   zoonotic transmission of bovine and porcine rotaviruses, were reported
   from western, southern, and eastern India.
   Conclusions. The remarkable diversity of rotaviruses circulating in
   India highlights the need for uniform, widespread surveillance for
   rotaviruses before the initiation and during the implementation of
   immunization programs.}},

Title = {{Effect of free radical scavengers on myocardial function and Na+,
   K+-ATPase activity in stunned rabbit myocardium}},
Journal = {{SCANDINAVIAN CARDIOVASCULAR JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2005}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objectives. The role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mechanism
   of myocardial stunning was investigated. Material and methods. Isolated
   Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts were subjected to 15 min normothermic
   ischemia followed by 10 min reperfusion with Krebs-Henseleit solution
   +/- mannitol or histidine. Results. In hearts reperfused without free
   radical scavenger the left ventricular developed pressure as well as its
   maximal positive and negative first derivatives (+dP/dt, -dP/dt) was
   significantly depressed, whereas end diastolic pressure (LVEDP)
   increased when compared to preischemic values. Treatment with mannitol
   had little protective effects, whereas singlet oxygen scavenger
   histidine significantly improved the recovery of LVEDP and -dP/dt.
   Sarcolemmal Na+, K+-ATPase activity (control, 400 +/- 41 nmol
   P(i)(.)min(-1).mg(-1)) was depressed in untreated stunned hearts (260
   +/- 27 nmol P(i)(.)min(-1).mg(-1)), but was almost completely recovered
   in hearts pretreated with histidine (364 +/- 27 nmol
   P(i)(.)min(-1).mg(-1)). The inhibition of Na+, K+-ATPase was only
   slightly prevented by mannitol (302 +/- 29 nmol P(i)(.)min(-1).mg(-1)l).
   Conclusions. The results suggest that ROS-induced inhibition of Na+,
   K+-ATPase activity is involved in the mechanism of postischemic
   contractile dysfunction and support the view that singlet oxygen may be
   one of the major causes of oxidative injury during ischemia and
   reperfusion.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, organisations have begun to realise the importance of
   knowing their customers better. Customer relationship management (CRM)
   is an approach to managing customer related knowledge of increasing
   strategic significance. The successful adoption of IT-enabled CRM
   redefines the traditional models of interaction between businesses and
   their customers, both nationally and globally. It is regarded as a
   source for competitive advantage because it enables organisations to
   explore and use knowledge of their customers and to foster profitable
   and long-lasting one-to-one relationships. This paper discusses the
   results of an exploratory survey conducted in the UK financial services
   sector; it discusses CRM practice and expectations, the motives for
   implementing it, and evaluates post-implementation experiences. It also
   investigates the CRM tools functionality in the strategic, process,
   communication, and business-to-customer (B2C) organisational context and
   reports the extent of their use. 16 The results show that despite the
   anticipated potential, the benefits from such tools are rather small.

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of dietary fat,
   carnitine supplementation, and exercise on oxidative damage and
   antioxidant status. Male Wistar rats (60 days old) were fed diets
   containing either hydrogenated fat (HF) or peanut oil (PO) with or
   without 0.5 mg \% (of dry diet) carnitine. The rats were given exercise,
   i.e. swimming for 60 minutes, for 6 days/week for 6 months under each
   dietary condition. The blood malondialdehyde (MDA) level was higher in
   PO-fed rats, more so in exercising ones, while the same was not altered
   in carnitine-supplemented rats irrespective of the dietary fat or
   physical activity. The MDA level was significantly decreased in muscle,
   while increased in liver, of carnitine-fed rats. The blood glutathione
   (GSH) level also significantly increased in exercising rats as compared
   to sedentary ones, while carnitine supplementation elevated it in all
   the groups. Exercise and carnitine supplementation significantly lowered
   GSH levels in liver while increasing it in muscle. The glutathione
   peroxidase (GPX) activity was significantly increased in blood and
   muscle from PO-fed exercising rats as compared to sedentary ones, while
   carnitine supplementation elevated GPX activity in all the groups. The
   liver and muscle catalase (CAT) activities were significantly increased
   in PO-fed exercising rats, while carnitine did not have any effect. The
   pro-oxidative effect of the monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)-rich PO
   diet and prolonged regular exercise was less pronounced due to augmented
   antioxidant enzymes, GPX and CAT, induced by training to protect against
   the oxidative stress, while carnitine supplementation could help to
   counter lipid peroxidation due to exercise through redistribution of GSH
   from liver to blood and muscle.}},

Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{There is an ongoing interest on the photoluminescence (PL) and related
   properties of doped nano ZnS since there is a large change in their PL
   properties with particle size reduction. Such PL properties are
   theoretically predicted to be much enhanced with ZnS particle sizes
   below the Bohr radius, i.e., in ZnS for particle sizes less than 5 nm or
   so. We start this discussion by first suggesting some nanoparticle
   formation mechanisms. The type of capping mechanism used dictates the
   temporal PL stability under different ambient conditions and other
   post-processing device requirements. We then describe results on PL of
   our different doped nanocrystalline ZnS and compare our interpretation
   of results with those available in literature. We have used 3-D plots
   featuring the effect of different excitation wavelengths on the PL
   emission profile and its intensity variation on nanocrystalline ZnS
   doped with different ions. Reported results and our own data suggests
   that the nanoparticle formation leads to drastic change in PL emission
   peaks-such that they are often greatly different from those of similar
   bulk samples. These features are seen in cases where PL is due to
   electron recombination from dopant and codopant sites, e.g., during Cu
   and Ag doping. Such results are explained due to greatly modified band
   structure with nanoparticle formation and bandgap enhancement where
   dopant and codopant levels have also greatly changed. However, in
   nanocrystalline samples where the PL mechanism is due to intraion
   transitions of dopants (e.g., in Mn doping), the luminescence properties
   remain similar to those of the bulk-this is because as long as the host
   material and its related crystal field is the same, such electron
   transition levels remain similar.}},

Abstract = {{Fluid secretion by mosquito Malpighian tubules is critical to
   maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance after a blood meal. Endogenous
   cAMP levels increase in Malpighian tubules after a blood meal. Here, we
   determined if corresponding changes in intracellular actin distribution
   occur after a blood meal or dibutyryl-cAMP (db-cAMP) stimulation and
   whether altering actin turnover inhibits secretion. In untreated
   Malpighian tubules, beta-actin immunostaining was more intense in the
   apical region of adult Malpighian tubules than in the cytoplasm.
   Stimulation by a blood meal or db-cAMP significantly decreased
   beta-actin immunostaining in the non-apical region of the cell. Db-cAMP
   had similar effects in larvae and pupae Malpighian tubules. In contrast,
   no detectable shift in F-actin distribution was detected; however,
   F-actin bundles within the cytoplasm increased in size after treatment
   with db-cAMP. Pretreatment of Malpighian tubules with agents perturbing
   actin fiber assembly and disassembly decreased basal secretion rates and
   inhibited the stimulatory effects of db-cAMP. Our results show (1)
   beta-actin redistributes toward the apical membrane after a blood meal
   and this correlates temporally with increase urine flow rate and
   intracellular cAMP levels, (2) Malpighian tubules from all developmental
   stages exhibit this same response to db-cAMP-stimulation, and (3)
   dynamic assembly and disassembly of beta-actin is required for
   db-cAMP-stimulated secretion. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to use variable temperature X-ray powder
   diffraction (VT-XRPD) to understand the solid-state changes in the
   pharmaceutical materials during heating. The model compounds studied
   were sulfathiazole, theophylline and nitrofurantoin. This study showed
   that the polymorph form of sulfathiazole SUTHAZ01 was very stable and
   SUTHAZ02 changed as a function of temperature to SUTHAZ01. Theophylline
   monohydrate changed via its metastable form to its anhydrous form during
   heating and nitrofurantoin monohydrate changed via amorphous form to its
   anhydrous form during heating. The crystallinity of SUTHAZ01, SUTHAZ02
   and theophylline monohydrate were very high and stable. Nitrofurantoin
   monohydrate was also very crystalline at room temperature but during
   heating at lower temperatures the crystallinity decreased and started to
   increase strongly at the temperature where the sample had changed to the
   anhydrous form. The average crystallite size of sulfathiazole samples
   varied only a little during heating. The average crystallite size of
   both theophylline and nitrofurantoin monohydrate decreased during
   heating. However, the average crystallite size of nitrofurantoin
   monohydrate returned back to starting size at higher temperatures. These
   analyses showed that VT-XRPD can be used to effectively characterize
   polymorphic changes during heating. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{When the brain interacts with the environment it constantly adapts by
   representing the environment in a form that is called an internal model.
   The neurobiological basis for internal models is provided by the
   connectivity and the dynamical properties of neurons. Thus, the
   interactions between neural tissues and external devices provide a
   fundamental means for investigating the connectivity and dynamical
   properties of neural populations. We developed this idea, suggested in
   the 1980s by Valentino Braitenberg, for investigating and representing
   the dynamical behavior of neuronal populations in the brainstem of the
   lamprey. The brainstem was maintained in vitro and connected in a closed
   loop with two types of artificial device: (a) a simulated dynamical
   system and (b) a small mobile robot. In both cases, the device was
   controlled by recorded extracellular signals and its output was
   translated into electrical stimuli delivered to the neural system. The
   goal of the first study was to estimate the dynamical dimension of
   neural preparation in a single-input/single-output configuration. The
   dynamical dimension is the number of state variables that together with
   the applied input determine the output of a system. The results indicate
   that while this neural system has significant dynamical properties, its
   effective complexity, as established by the dynamical dimension, is
   rather moderate. In the second study, we considered a more specific
   situation, in which the same portion of the nervous system controls a
   robotic device in a two-input/two-output configuration. We fitted the
   input-output data from the neuro-robotic preparation to neural network
   models having different internal dynamics and we observed the
   generalization error of each model. Consistent with the first study,
   this second experiment showed that a simple recurrent dynamical model
   was able to capture the behavior of the hybrid system. This experimental
   and computational framework provides the means for investigating neural
   plasticity and internal representations in the context of brain-machine
   interfaces.}},

Title = {{Determinants of lumbar artery occlusion among patients with sciatica: A
   three-year follow-up with magnetic resonance angiography}},

Abstract = {{We showed previously that chronic Chlamydia pneumoniae infection
   increases the risk of lumbar artery occlusion. We did not evaluate,
   however, the effect of other risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in
   combination with this chronic infection. The purpose of this study was
   to investigate the combined effect of chronic C. pneumoniae infection
   and other known determinants of artery occlusion in a population of
   sciatica patients. Two-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance
   angiography (MRA) was used to evaluate lumbar arteries at baseline and
   three years. The arteries on both sides (L1-L4) were evaluated visually
   and scored as normal, narrowed or occluded. Logistic regression analysis
   was performed separately for baseline total arterial stenosis and each
   L1-L4 segmental artery pair, and for incident new stenosis during the
   follow-up period. The determinants analyzed included age, body mass
   index (BMI, kg/m(2)), education, gender, and smoking, in addition to
   presence of chronic C. pneumoniae infection. MRA was obtained at
   baseline for 147 patients and at 3 years for 134 patients. Sixty-four
   (47.8\%) of 134 patients had new arterial stenosis. Total incidence of
   new arterial stenosis was distributed quite evenly between the
   individual segmental levels, varying from 12.7 to 18.6\%. BMI was the
   only predictor of new arterial stenosis (odds ratio (OR) 1.13). A
   reasonable logistic model could be established only for baseline L4 and
   total arterial scores. At L4, education was a protective factor (OR
   0.07), whereas age (OR for the oldest age group 6.7) and BMI (OR 1.17)
   were associated with increased risk of occlusion. For total arterial
   score, chronic C. pneumoniae infection was an independent determinant of
   arterial occlusion, increasing the risk to almost eightfold.
   Additionally, BMI (OR 1.16), and age (for the oldest age group OR 11.4)
   were significant determinants for stenosis. Smoking was not
   statistically significant. As chronic C. pneumoniae infection was an
   independent determinant of lumbar artery occlusion, treatments of this
   chronic infection may have an impact on lumbar diseases. The importance
   of BMI for new arterial stenosis suggests that weight reduction may also
   have a beneficial effect in lumbar artery disease.}},

Abstract = {{In this study artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been applied to
   predict faecal coliform concentration levels at compliance points along
   bathing water zones situated in the south west of Scotland, UK.
   Hydrological parameters, such as river discharges, sunshine, rainfall
   and tidal conditions, were used as the input data for these networks.
   Data collected at seven locations during the period 1990-2000 were used
   to train and verify the neural networks. A novel technique called the
   gamma test was used for data analysis to aid in the construction of ANN
   models. In general, the river discharges and tidal range were found to
   be the most important variables affecting the level of bacteria
   concentration at the compliance points. For compliance points close to
   the meteorological station, the amount of rainfall was found to be
   relatively significant in the model results. Relatively good correlation
   coefficients were obtained for the learning and verifying process for
   all of the ANNs and these networks confirmed that the samples failed to
   comply with the standard values specified in the European Union Bathing
   Water Directive in 57.4\% of the cases.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the performance of proxy measures of acculturation
   and to examine the association between acculturation and selected
   health-risk behaviors.
   Methods: Participants were 1062 Latina pregnant women who received

   and 2001. We used the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve to
   characterize the sensitivity and specificity of proxy measures and

   Results: Using the ARSMA-II short version scale as a reference, age at
   immigration had the highest percentage of correctly classified
   individuals. Acculturation was significantly associated with a lifetime
   history of substance use, risky sexual behavior, low fruit consumption,
   and high fast-food meal consumption.
   Conclusions: Acculturation is an important predictor of health-risk
   behavior among women. Further research is needed to better understand
   the phenomenon and to avert associated adverse health consequences.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant
   disorder caused by mutation of either of 2 tumor suppressor genes, TSC1
   or TSC2, which encode hamartin and tuberin, respectively. Several
   studies have shown that tuberin functions independently of hamartin and
   inhibits signaling pathways via the mammalian target of rapamycin, a
   critical regulator of cell proliferation. Recent studies have revealed
   that the signaling pathways regulating the mammalian target of rapamycin
   such as Akt and S6K1 are frequently activated in pancreatic cancer. We
   hypothesized that tuberin might be involved in the proliferation and
   Survival of pancreatic cancer cells.
   Methods. We immunohistochemically examined the expression of tuberin in
   42 pancreatic cancerous and noncancerous pancreatic tissue specimens
   using an antituberin antibody. The correlations between tuberin
   expression and various clinicopathologic features, including survival,
   were evaluated. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was
   performed to evaluate the level of tuberin expression in paired samples
   of pancreatic cancer and noncancerous tissue.
   Results. Twenty-four of the 42 pancreatic cancer samples (57 \%) were
   negative for tuberin expression. The patients with tuberin-negative
   tumors had a significantly higher incidence of pT3 or pT4 disease
   (primary tumor extent by the TNM classification) than those with
   tuberin-positive tumors (P = .024). Female patients had a significantly
   higher incidence of tuberin-positive tumors than male patients (P =
   .014). The survival rate of the tuberin-positive group tended to be
   better than that of the tuberin-negative group, but there was no
   significant difference (P = .4). Expression of TSC2 in cancer tissue was
   lower than in the corresponding noncancerous tissue for 7 of the 9
   samples examined.
   Conclusions. This study demonstrates that reduced expression of tuberin
   might be involved in the Progression of pancreatic cancer. Accordingly,
   tuberin may provide a new therapeutic target in patients with this type
   of cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To prospectively evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of spiral
   computed tomography (CT) versus ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scanning in
   the examination of patients clinically suspected of having pulmonary
   embolism (PE). Patients and Methods: Sixty-three patients, presenting to
   the emergency department and departments of radiology and nuclear
   medicine of a large hospital, highly suspected of having PE, underwent
   sequential imaging testing with V/Q scanning and contrast-enhanced
   spiral CT, in addition to other clinical and laboratory tests. Results:
   PE was diagnosed in 42 (66.7\%) of the 63 patients. Thirty-nine of these
   42 patients had positive findings in their CT scans, while 18 of the
   remaining 21 patients without PE had negative findings in their spiral
   CT {[}sensitivity, 92.9\%, specificity, 85.7\% Positive Predictive Value
   (PPV), 92.9\%, Negative Predictive Value (NPV), 85.7\%]. V/Q scans
   showed high-probability of PE in 24 of the 42 patients with PE and were
   negative in 9 of the remaining 21 patients without PE (sensitivity,
   57.1\%, specificity, 42.9\%, PPV, 66.7\%, NPV, 33.3\%). There were
   statistically significant differences in specificity and sensitivity
   favoring spiral CT among men and women patients or patients > 50 years
   old. Fifty-four patients (85.7\%) rated their satisfaction towards
   spiral CT as `good' or `very good, whereas the respective rate for V/Q
   scanning was on 14.3\%. Conclusion: Spiral CT has an excellent
   sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for the diagnosis of PE and it
   could be used as the first-line imaging modality in patients suspected

Abstract = {{A novel Ferrimonas species is described on the basis of phenotypic,
   chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic studies. Four halophilic organisms were
   isolated from marine sand and marine macroalgae samples by using high-pH
   marine agar 2216. An analysis of the nearly complete 16S rRNA gene
   sequences of these new isolates indicated that they were
   phylogenetically close (16S rRNA gene sequence similarity > 99(.)5\%,
   gyrB gene sequence similarity > 97(.)8\%), and were most closely related
   to Ferrimonas balearica (16S rRNA gene sequence similarity
   97(.)1-97(.)3\%, gyrB gene sequence similarity 84(.)4-85(.)0\%).
   Chemotaxonomic data (major menaquinone MK7; major fatty acids C-16:0 and
   C-18:1(omega 9c) supported the affiliation of the new isolates to the
   genus Ferrimonas. The results of physiological and biochemical tests
   allowed phenotypic differentiation of the isolates from F balearica. It
   is therefore proposed that the new isolates represent a novel species
   with the name Ferrimonas marina sp. nov. and type strain A4D-4(T)

Abstract = {{Ketamine and xylazine are routinely used for measurement of hemodynamics
   of mice and rats by echocardiography. The anesthetic agents produce low
   heart rate (HR) in the animals, which may result in misleading data in
   the hemodynamic profiles of the small animals. The purpose of the
   present study was to select an appropriate anesthetic condition in the
   evaluation of mouse and rat cardiac function by echocardiography.
   Echocardiographic measurement was performed in male C57BL6 mice
   anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 30 or 40 mg/kg
   pentobarbital (P30 or P40) or a combination of 60 mg/kg ketamine and 6
   mg/kg xylazine (KX) and in male Wistar rats with an intraperitoneal
   injection of 40 or 50 mg/kg pentobarbital (P40 or P50) or a combination
   of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine (KX). Basal HR of
   P30-anesthetized mice and P40-anesthetized were comparable to those in
   the conscious state, whereas KX-anesthetized mice and rats were 38\% and
   74\% of those of the conscious animals, respectively. Fractional
   shortening (FS) and cardiac output index (COI) of the P30-anesthetized
   mice or the P40-anesthetized rats were greater than those of
   KX-anesthetized animals. Intraperitoneal injection of dobutamine at 0.3
   and 1 mg/kg increased HR, FS, and COI of the P30-anesthetized mice and
   the P40-anesthetized rats, respectively, whereas the percent responses
   of these parameters in KX animals were greater than those in
   pentobarbital-anesthetized ones due to the lower basal values for the
   cardiac functional parameters. Anesthesia with P30 for the mouse and P40
   for the rat rather than ketamine/xylazine may be relevant to the
   evaluation of cardiac function using echocardiography.}},

   Preservation of cumulus-oocyte complexes with NCSU-37 medium containing
   10\% follicular fluid, 1 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP, and follicular shell
   pieces for 24-96 h at 39 degrees C did not affect oocyte maturation

   in meiotic arrest for 24-48 h to develop into blastocysts was not
   significantly different from that of controls (20-25\% vs. 18\% and

Abstract = {{The Volga-Ural region, like many others in the territory of Eastern
   Europe, experienced repeated waves of migrating peoples during the
   Middle Ages. One result of the migratory process was the appearance in
   this region of numerous sites, many of which shared significant
   similarities, belonging to the Imen'kovo and Turbaslino cultures. The
   ethno-cultural and chronological features of these cultures has remained
   a point of controversy for quite some time. In recent years, a series of
   settlements and cemeteries located in Turkestan have been the focus of
   study, The materials from these sites suggests that their dating was
   contemporary with the First (Great) Turk Kaghanate and the late
   Sarmatian period. Many elements of the Turbaslino-Imen'kovo cemeteries
   (Kushnarenkovo, II Kominternovo burial fields, the late burials of the
   Birska burial fields, among others) are related to the antiquities of
   the Dzhyetyasarskovo culture of the Aral Sea region. These elements
   include, but are not limited to, the following: lined pits, the
   intentional deformation of skulls found in graves, a variety of items of
   clothing and ornaments (Fig. 2; Fig. 3, 6-25, 28, 29; Fig. 4, 1-8, 11,
   19). Other especially remarkable finds are two chalices of greenish and
   bluish glass from the Birska and 11 Kominternovo burial fields (Fig. IS,
   1; Fig. 4, 14; Photos I and 2). Their similar sizes, form, and fluted
   ornamentation would suggest common origin - probably Near Eastern
   (Syrian?) imports, most likely used originally for administrating
   communion wine by Christians. The appearance of these finds in the
   Volga-Ural region is best explained by the migratory process which
   occurred in the area during the second half of the sixth century A.D.
   which was connected with the creation of the First Turk Kaghanate.}},

   college students' PA has been seriously neglected as a research topic,
   (2) there is a lack of multiple-level approaches (ie, personal,

Abstract = {{Purpose of review Postoperative deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary
   embolism are serious and potentially life-threatening complications that
   frequently occur after major surgery. for thromboprophylaxis use
   advancing age as a key component to estimate thromboembolic risk. The
   reported effect of age on postoperative venous thromboembolism varies
   widely, making it unclear whether age alone is a significant risk
   factor. This article reviews the recent literature on the effect of age
   on the incidence of postoperative venous thromboembolism.
   Recent findings Between 2003 and 2005, several cohort studies assessed
   the risk factors for postoperative venous thromboembolism, showing A
   variable. effect of age on its incidence in the 2- to 3-month period
   after major surgery. Studies also revealed a significant difference in
   the effect of age on the incidence of venous thromboembolism depending
   on the type of surgery. Obesity, postoperative immobilization, the use
   of thromboprophylaxis, the nature of the surgery, and underlying
   comorbid conditions such as heart failure seem to have a greater
   influence on the risk of venous thromboembolism than does age.
   Summary The, variation in the effect of age on postoperative venous
   thromboembolism likely depends on whether or not other comorbid
   conditions or age-related changes in functional status are considered as
   risk factors. When these other risk factor's are taken into account, the
   effect of advanced age decreases. More research is needed to develop
   validated venous thromboembolism risk-prediction tools for specific
   types of surgery. By use of this information, the intensity and duration
   of postoperative thromboprophylaxis can be tailored to the level of
   risk, not just age alone.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To describe coalition membership, examine associations between
   coalition processes and short-term coalition outcomes, and assess the
   relative contribution of key coalition processes to perceived
   accomplishments in teen pregnancy prevention coalitions.
   Methods: A self-administered survey was distributed to active members of
   21 teen pregnancy prevention coalitions in 13 communities. The overall
   response rate was 67\%, with 471 surveys returned. Process measures
   included staff competence, member influence in decision making, and
   coalition functioning. Short-term outcome measures included perceived
   accomplishments, member satisfaction, member participation, and
   coalition viability.
   Results: About 50\% of coalition members represented health or teen
   pregnancy prevention or youth development service organizations, with
   13\% participating primarily as residents or youth. None of the process
   measures were associated with coalition viability (defined as active 2
   years post-survey). Many bivariate associations between coalition
   processes and other short-term outcomes were significant at the
   individual and coalition levels of analysis. In a multivariate random
   coefficients model, coalition functioning (p < .001) and member
   influence in decision making (p = .019) were significantly associated
   with perceived coalition accomplishments.
   Conclusion: Consistent with research on coalitions that have addressed
   other health issues, good coalition processes were associated with
   short-term indicators of effectiveness in these teen pregnancy
   prevention coalitions. Coalition processes were not associated with
   coalition viability 2 years post-survey, however, suggesting that other
   factors influence coalition survival. (c) 2005 Society for Adolescent

Title = {{A novel nonsense mutation in the SCN5A gene leads to Brugada syndrome

Journal = {{CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{11}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Brugada syndrome (BS) is an electrical cardiac disorder with
   a right bundle branch block and ST segment elevation in leads V1 to V3
   on surface electrocardiograms (ECGs), and is a syndrome that may lead to
   sudden cardiac death.
   PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to screen for mutations in the
   SCN5A gene in a family with BS, and to characterize the consequences of
   the mutation on channel function.
   RESULTS: A heterozygous nonsense SCN5A mutation (W822X) was identified
   in the index patient. The mutation was confirmed in the patient's
   asymptomatic 16-year-old brother and 48-year-old father. The mutation
   was absent in the index patient's sister and mother. The ECG of the
   index patient showed a BS type 2 ECO phenotype, which converted into a
   type 1 ECG phenotype in the presence of flecainide. The ECG of the
   patient's brother was not typical for BS, but ajmaline treatment
   unmasked a type 1 ECG phenotype. The ECG of the asymptomatic father was
   normal at baseline and in the presence of ajmaline. No Na+ currents
   could be measured in tsA201 cells transfected with W822X mutant
   channels. Heterozygote expression showed a nearly 50\% reduction in Na+
   current amplitude with no significant alterations of biophysical
   properties, indicating a loss of functional Na+ channels, obviously
   without any dominant-negative activity on wild type channels.
   CONCLUSIONS: The haploinsufficiency of the Na(V)1.5 protein is the
   plausible explanation for the clinical BS phenotype in this family.
   Because the heterozygous W822X mutation theoretically leads to channel
   expression at one-half of the normal level, the authors suggest that a
   modifier gene may influence or rescue the phenotype in the asymptomatic
   family members.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers doses from radon and decay products when inhaled or
   ingested by one year old infants and by ten year old children. Doses
   from decay products deposited on skin are also discussed. For inhalation
   and ingestion, the general pattern of doses to organs is broadly similar
   to that in adults. Much the largest doses are received by the organ of
   intake (respiratory tract and stomach respectively). Otherwise, tissues
   with higher fat content tend to receive somewhat higher doses from radon
   gas than other tissues. Dose coefficients (dose per unit intake factors)
   for children are generally larger than those for adults. However, total
   annual doses are more similar across the age groups because of smaller
   intakes of air and water by children. Radon decay products deposited on
   skin may be able to induce skin cancer. However, the location of the
   sensitive cells is not known with certainty and they may lie too deep to
   receive significant dose. If they are irradiated, it is likely that
   doses to children would be larger than for adults. The radiological
   significance of doses to children is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. Penile duplex Doppler ultrasound (PDDU) is currently the
   preferred method for the functional evaluation of penile hemodynamics.
   PDDU may be used to monitor objectively changes in penile vascular
   parameters in men who undergo treatment for Peyronie's disease (PD),
   including intralesional interferon alpha-2b (IFN alpha-2b).
   Aim. To investigate the impact of intralesional IFN alpha-2b therapy for
   PD on penile hemodynamics by using PDDU and to assess the objective role
   of PDDU in monitoring treatment outcomes.
   Materials and Methods. Thirty-nine patients (20 in the placebo and 19 in
   the IFN alpha-2b treatment arm) were enrolled in this prospective,
   placebo-controlled, parallel study. Patients received either 10 mL
   saline or 5 x 10(6) units of IFN alpha-2b intralesional injections every
   other week for a total of six injections. Patients in each group were
   evaluated at baseline and after completion of treatment regarding
   changes in penile hemodynamic parameters, penile curvature, plaque size
   and density, pain on erection, and erectile function. Specific published
   criteria were used for PDDU measurements. Outcomes were statistically
   compared between each group by using Mann-Whitney U and chi-square
   tests.
   Results. The mean age of the patients and the duration of PD were
   similar in both groups. The improvement in penile blood flow was
   significantly greater in IFN (alpha-2b-treated patients than those in
   the placebo group. The number with the nonvascular classification
   increased significantly in the IFN alpha-2b arm from 31.5\% to 57.8\%.
   Additionally, improvements in penile curvature, plaque size and density,
   and pain on erection were better in the IFN alpha-2b group compared with
   the control. No significant improvement was observed in the erectile
   function domain in either group.
   Conclusion. This study reveals that intralesional IFN a-2b injections
   have a significant benefit on penile hemodynamic parameters. Moreover,
   intralesional IFN alpha-2b is an effective, minimally invasive treatment
   for PD, and PDDU is a useful adjunct to monitor objectively changes in
   penile vascular parameters.}},

Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Translocation of messenger RNAs through the nuclear pore complex (NPC)
   requires coordinated physical interactions between stable NPC
   components, shuttling transport factors, and mRNA-binding proteins. In
   budding yeast (y) and human (h) cells, Gle1 is an essential mRNA export
   factor. Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of hGle1 is required for mRNA
   export; however, the mechanism by which hGle1 associates with the NPC is
   unknown. We have previously shown that the interaction of hGle1 with the
   nucleoporin hNup155 is necessary but not sufficient for targeting hGle1
   to NPCs. Here, we report that the unique C-terminal 43 amino acid region
   of the hGle1B isoform mediates binding to the C-terminal non-FG region
   of the nucleoporin hCG1/NPL1. Moreover, hNup155, hGle1B, and hCG1 formed
   a heterotrimeric complex in vitro. This suggested that these two
   nucleoporins were required for the NPC localization of hGle1. Using an
   siRNA-based approach, decreased levels of hCG1 resulted in hGle1
   accumulation in cytoplasmic foci. This was coincident with inhibition of
   heat shock-induced production of Hsp70 protein and export of the Hsp70
   mRNA in HeLa cells. Because this closely parallels the role of the hCG1
   orthologue yNup42/Rip1, we speculate that hGle1-hCG1 function in the
   mRNA export mechanism is highly conserved.}},

Abstract = {{A vibrant centre of cultural and artistic production, interwar Paris
   attracted many photographers from central Europe. Bringing with them
   inherited traditions and visual lexicons from their countries of origin,
   this heterogeneous group of photographers, which included Ilse Bing,
   Andre Kertesz and Germaine Krull, put their acquired skills and habits
   to use in new contexts, drawing inspiration from each other, from their
   engagement with the vibrant culture of France, and most of all from a
   widespread fascination with Paris as photographic topos. Responding to
   nostalgia for images of a `popular Paris' in the illustrated press,
   these photographers accomplished an alchemical transformation of Paris
   into a city in which past and present were poignantly reconciled. At the
   same time, many of their photographs, shot through with themes of exile
   and homelessness, reveal the fragility of the myth of a `popular Paris',
   particularly after the advent of economic and social crises in the
   1930s.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic cell
   transplantation (HCT) in 43 patients with chronic myelomonocytic
   leukemia. Patients were classified according to the
   French-American-British and World Health Organization classifications,
   as well as the International Prognostic Scoring System and the M.D.
   Anderson prognostic score. Comorbidity scores were assessed by using an
   HCT-specific comorbidity index. Patients were aged 1 to 66 years
   (median, 48 years). Twenty-one patients received transplants from
   related donors (18 HLA-identical siblings and 3 HLA-nonidentical family
   members), and 22 received transplants from unrelated donors (18 HLA
   matched and 4 HLA nonidentical). Several busulfan or total body
   irradiation-based conditioning regimens were used. Sustained engraftment
   was achieved in 41 patients. Eighteen are alive at 1.9 to 14.1 years,
   for an estimated relapse-free survival of 41\% at 4 years. Ten patients
   have relapsed, thus leading to a cumulative incidence of 23\% at 4
   years. Risk category by International Prognostic Scoring System, World
   Health Organization, M.D. Anderson prognostic score, or
   proliferative/dysplastic status had no statistically significant
   association with outcomes. However, patients with higher comorbidity
   scores had worse overall survival than patients with lower scores (P
   =.01). There was a trend for a higher relapse incidence among patients
   at higher risk by the M.D. Anderson prognostic score. The data suggest
   that patients with few or no comorbidities and those who undergo
   transplantation earlier in the disease course have the highest
   probability of successful outcome after allogeneic HCT. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Abnormal activation of CXCR4 during inflammatory/infectious states may
   lead to neuronal dysfunction or damage. The major goal of this study was
   to determine the coupling of CXCR4 to p53-dependent survival pathways in
   primary neurons. Neurons were stimulated with the HIV envelope protein
   gp120(IIIB) or the endogenous CXCR4 agonist, SDF-1 alpha. We found that
   gp120 stimulates p53 activity and induces expression of the p53
   pro-apoptotic target Apaf-1 in cultured neurons. Inhibition of CXCR4 by
   AMD3100 abrogates the effect of gp120 on both p53 and Apaf-1. Moreover,
   gp120 neurotoxicity is markedly reduced by the p53-inhibitor,
   pifithrin-alpha. The viral protein also regulates p53 phosphorylation
   and expression of other p53-responsive genes, such as MDM2 and p21.
   Conversely, SDF-1 alpha, which can promote neuronal survival, increases
   p53 acetylation and p21 expression in neurons. Thus, the stimulation of
   different p53 targets could be instrumental in determining the outcome
   of CXCR4 activation on neuronal survival in neuroinflammatory disorders.

Abstract = {{Introduction. We prospectively evaluated an immunosuppressive regimen
   consisting of rapamycin (Rapa), low-dose cyclosporine (CsA), low-dose
   mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and prednisone (group 1) versus a regimen
   of CsA, MMF, and prednisone (group 2) in mismatched living related donor
   (LRD) and living unrelated donor (LUD) kidney transplantation.
   Methods. Group 1 included 24 transplant recipients of eight mismatched
   LRD and 16 LUD, treated with Rapa, low-dose MMF, CsA, and prednisone.
   Group 2 included 53 transplant recipients (25 LRD, 27 LUD, and one
   cadaveric donor), treated with MMF, CsA, and prednisone. All patients in
   group 1 received a single bolus of rabbit-anti-human T-lymphocyte immune
   serum (ATG-Fresenius 4 to 6 mg/kg). In group 2, patients received either
   a single ATG or an extended ATG course (3 to 5 days postoperatively).
   Results. Acute rejection occurred in one patient in group 1 (4.2\%) and
   in five patients (9.4\%) in group 2, all of which resulted in graft
   loss. Serum creatinine was not significantly different between the two
   groups.
   Conclusion. The immunosuppressive protocol of Rapa, CsA, MMF, and
   prednisone with single-bolus induction ATG achieves excellent
   immunosuppression and graft survival with no apparent risks in the short
   and intermediate term.}},

Abstract = {{Flood frequency analysis (FFA) is a form of risk analysis, yet a risk
   analysis of the activity of FFA itself is rarely undertaken. The recent
   literature of FFA has been characterized by: ( 1) a proliferation of
   mathematical models, lacking theoretical hydrologic justification, but
   used to extrapolate the return periods of floods beyond the gauged
   record; ( 2) official mandating of particular models, which has resulted
   in ( 3) research focused on increasingly reductionist and statistically
   sophisticated procedures for parameter fitting to these models from the
   limited gauged data. These trends have evolved to such a refined state
   that FFA may be approaching the `limits of splitting'; at the very
   least, the emphasis was shifted early in the history of FFA from
   predicting and explaining extreme flood events to the more soluble issue
   of fitting distributions to the bulk of the data. However, recent
   evidence indicates that the very modelling basis itself may be ripe for
   revision. Self-similar ( power law) models are not only analytically
   simpler than conventional models, but they also offer a plausible
   theoretical basis in complexity theory. Of most significance, however,
   is the empirical evidence for self-similarity in flood behaviour.
   Self-similarity is difficult to detect in gauged records of limited
   length; however, one positive aspect of the application of statistics to
   FFA has been the refinement of techniques for the incorporation of
   historical and palaeoflood data. It is these data types, even over
   modest timescales such as 100 years, which offer the best promise for
   testing alternative models of extreme flood behaviour across a wider
   range of basins. At stake is the accurate estimation of flood magnitude,
   used widely for design purposes: the power law model produces far more
   conservative estimates of return period of large floods compared to
   conventional models, and deserves closer study.}},

Abstract = {{The object of the study was to ascertain the protective measures
   according to the ordinance on biological agents in use of an effluent
   sludge/ coal mixture at a coal-fired power plant. The effluent
   sludge/coal mixture consisted of 5\% dehumidified effluent sludge
   pellets and 95\% coal. The quantitative and qualitative bacteria and
   fungi content of the effluent sludge pellets, the ground coal and the
   effluent sludge/coal mixture was analysed during different seasons. In
   winter (March) the concentration for enterococci found in the coal was
   about 10(2) cfu/g, in the effluent sludge pellets the concentration was
   about 3 (.) 10(2) cfu/g and in the effluent sludge/coal mixture the
   concentration of enterococci varied from 10(2) cfu/g up to 10(4) cfu/g.
   Coliforms were found in three samples of effluent sludge/coal mixture.
   In the summertime (June) the conditions of storage were studied
   essentially. During three days the number of fungi at the effluent
   sludge/coal mixture increased from 2.2 (.) 10(3) cfu/g up to 1.9 (.)
   10(6) cfu/g. The number of bacteria increased from 1.7 (.) 10(7) cfu/g
   up to 8.5 (.) 10(8) cfu/g. At almost all samples of the effluent
   sludge/coal mixture enterococci, enterobacteriaceae and coliforms (which
   are partly pathogens of risc group 2 according to the biological agents
   ordinance) were found after storage at a number of 10(3) cfu/g up to 104
   cfu/g. Even after one day of open-air storage at temperatures of 19
   degrees C there appeared verifiable numbers of risc group 2-organisms.}},

Abstract = {{The late Campanian djadochtatherioid multi tuberculate Catopsbaatar
   catopsaloides was originally known from three skulls from Hermiin Tsav
   in the Gobi Desert (Mongolia). Three more skulls from Hermiin Tsav are
   now available, associated with parts of the previously unknown
   postcranial skeleton, which will be described separately. We describe
   herein the skull and dentition of C. catopsaloides, based on all
   available material, housed in PIN, PM, and ZPAL collections. The genera
   Catopsbaatar, Djadochtatherium, and Kryptobaatar share several
   characters, unknown in Tombaatar, such as very long postorbital
   processes directed postero-laterally and downwards, parietal ridges
   extending from the posterior margins of the postorbital processes
   postero-medially, and nuchal crests with prominent lateral wings,
   incurved anteriorly in the middle, so that the skull in dorsal view is
   shorter in the middle than laterally. Catopsbaatar shares with
   Djadochtatherium a very high and prominent anterior zygomatic ridge, and
   presence of the masseteric protuberance, but differs from it and from
   other djadochtatherioid genera in having the orbit situated more
   posteriorly, the intermediate zygomatic ridge adhering to the anterior
   ridge, and a smaller trapezoidal (rather than crescent-shaped) p4
   without ridges; it differs from Kryptobaatar and Djadochtatherium in
   having three upper premolars (P2 being lost) and shares this last
   character with Tombaatar. Catopsbaatar is known not only from Hermiin
   Tsav, but also from Baruungoyot Formation of Khulsan, represented there
   by a single m2. We demonstrate that the separation of the masseter
   superficialis into two parts, the origins of which leave scars on the
   lateral wall of the zygomatic arch surrounded by zygomatic ridges,
   occurs in all the multi tuberculates (beginning with Paulchoffatiidae),
   and is regarded as a multituberculate autapomorphy.}},

   ontology-based search engine. The ontology-based search engine is a tool
   used to query the information that has been loaded into the database.
   Last, to evaluate the system, an experiment was conducted to compare the
   performance of the proposed system with that of Internet search engines
   in terms of relevance and search time. This study shows that ontologies
   can be used not only to improve precision, but also to reduce the search

Abstract = {{Intracranial aneurysms (W), abnormal bulging of one of arteries in the
   brain, are caused by many environmental and genetic factors. One of the
   major causes leading to complex diseases are known to be genetic
   factors. In an attempt to elucidate the genetic factor contributing the
   etiology of IAs, several genetic loci for IA have been reported
   recently. Among them, 7q11 locus was supposed to be a disease-related
   locus for lAs in Asia, and the locus was further confirmed in the United
   States. By careful investigation of the inheritance pattern of 315 IA
   patients at Chonbuk National University Hospital, we recruited 4
   families inheriting IAs dominantly. Thorough linkage analysis on
   chromosome 7 was conducted to confirm whether 7q11 locus of IAs are
   present in Korean population. We employed a parametric method for
   linkage analyses and calculated two-point and multipoint LOD scores
   using LINKAGE package (v5.1). Total two-point LOD scores (theta=0) for
   D7S502 and D7S669 markers on 7q11 region were -5.282 and -5.141,
   respectively. And a maximum multipoint LOD score was also negative on
   7q11 locus. Our results clearly imply that Korean and Japanese have
   different genetic locus for IA, even though it is widely believed that
   Japanese and Korean are genetically homogenous in many aspects.}},

Abstract = {{The North-South military talks in June 2004 were a turning point that
   introduced a new phase of psychological warfare as both parties agreed
   to the removal of all forms of propaganda materials. While North Korea
   has not given up its political objective to unify the entire Korean
   peninsula through spreading revolutionary spirit, it has prepared for
   the next round of psychological warfare by establishing the basic
   infrastructure needed to conduct psychological warfare in cyberspace
   since 2000. ``Uriminzokkiri,{''} which means ``our nation alone{''} is a
   new term created by Pyongyang and also its official website, a tool to
   foment anti-Americanism, project a peaceful image of itself, and evoke
   national consciousness in order to create favorable conditions during
   the period of terse exchanges between the United States and North Korea
   and to achieve its political objectives regarding South Korea. Some of
   the findings include: First, the scope of influence of North Korea's
   propaganda is widening, exerting greater influence on more South Korean
   people who are familiar with the use of the Internet. Second, North
   Korea's propaganda might be transmitted implicitly and inculcated as an
   accepted fact as the Internet provides people with a forum to spread
   opinions and organize protests. Third, there is no entity that can
   effectively control North Korea's psychological operation as it is
   technically impossible to police the web comprehensively. Lastly, it is
   difficult to verify whether any material posted on the Web sites is
   related to North Korea's psychological warfare because its message is
   very obscure and sources are seldom identified. As long as people are
   exposed to media coverage on DPRK, it should be recognized that North
   Korea's endless game is still going on.}},

Abstract = {{SK1306X was previously reported to have good anti-inflammatory and
   analgesic efficacy in various studies. To determine its mode of action,
   an investigation was carried out for some representative mediators.
   Arachidonic acid metabolism and its products are particularly important
   in inflammation and pain. The pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially
   interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), and induced
   nitric oxide (NO) appear to be most involved in the inflammatory process
   such as osteoarthritis (OA). Thus SK1306X was tested to determine the
   effects on enzymes related to arachidonic acid metabolism and the
   release or synthesis of inflammatory mediators. SK1306X did inhibit the
   expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme without affecting COX-1
   and COX-2 activity. Leukotriene B-4 (LTB4) production also was inhibited
   by SK1306X (IC50 = 98.7 +/- 4.26 mu g/ml). SK1306X inhibited
   significantly TNF-alpha release (IC50 = 97.6 +/- 17.8 mu g/ml) and NO
   production (IC50 = 280 +/- 17.8 mu g/mi). But IL-1 alpha release was not
   attenuated by SK1306X. This study suggests that inhibition of these
   mediators by SK1306X may be one of the mechanisms responsible for its

Abstract = {{Objective: To identify the range of the terminal motor points of the
   triceps surae muscles in relation to bony landmarks.
   Design: Eight limbs of four male cadavers were anatomically dissected.
   The range of terminal motor points from the tibial nerve to each triceps
   surae muscle was identified related to the bony landmarks. Bony
   landmarks were medial and lateral epicondyles of the femur and medial
   and lateral malleoli of the tibia. The length of the lower leg was
   defined as the distance from the intercondylar line of the femur to the
   intermalleolar line of the tibia. The locations of the motor points were
   expressed as the percentage of the length of the lower leg.
   Results: The motor points of the medial gastrocnemius, lateral
   gastrocnemius, and soleus muscles were diffusely distributed along the
   muscle longitudinal bulk. The highest motor points of the medial
   gastrocnemius, lateral gastrocnemius, and soleus were located in 9.6\%
   +/- 3.5\%, 12.0\% +/- 3.4\%, and 20.5\% +/- 3.9\%, respectively, of the
   length of the lower leg. The lowest motor points were located in 37.5\%
   +/- 5.5\%, 37.9\% +/- 2.3\%, and 46.7\% +/- 3.6\%, respectively, of the
   length of the lower leg.
   Conclusions: The present study defined the longitudinal distribution
   pattern of terminal motor points in the triceps surae muscles. This
   concept can be helpful for further studies evaluating the effectiveness
   of the botulinum toxin injection method.}},

Abstract = {{We report a 76-year-old Caucasian man who presented with a 3-week
   history of progressive confusion. His past medical history included a
   left nephro-uretectomy for poorly differentiated transitional cell
   carcinoma 9 years previously. Besides his confusion, his clinical and
   neurological examination was unremarkable. Extensive investigation
   revealed only isolated hypoglycorrachia and mildly elevated CSF protein.
   Cerebral CT and MRI scans without contrast did not reveal any
   abnormalities. As his condition continued to decline, an MRI scan of the
   brain with gadolinium was performed which revealed extensive nodular
   enhancement of the surface of the cerebellum and brainstem and both
   temporal lobe convexities. Repeat lumbar puncture showed malignant cells
   in the CSF and confirmed the diagnosis of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.
   This case illustrates that leptomeningeal carcinomatosis should be
   considered in the differential diagnosis of cognitive decline in the
   elderly, after other common aetiologies have been excluded. The index of
   suspicion should be increased in patients with a prior history of

   array techniques to further increase the channel capacity has been
   discussed. In this paper, a new model of locally scattered signals in
   the vicinity of mobiles is proposed by defining the mean steering vector

Abstract = {{Objective: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize microbial ligands and
   host products released during tissue damage, the so-called ``danger
   signals.{''} This study was conducted to determine whether changes in
   TLR-4 and TLR-2 expression can be detected in the trophoblasts at the
   placental bed of women with and without preeclampsia.
   Study design: Placental bed biopsies were obtained from women with: (1)
   normal term pregnancies with and without labor (each n = 20); (2)
   preeclampsia who delivered preterm (n = 15); and (3) preterm labor and
   intact membranes (PTL) with and without chorioamnionitis (each n = 15).
   The expression pattern of TLR-4 and TLR-2 in the trophoblasts was
   analyzed by double immunohistochemistry.
   Results: (1) The median percentage of TLR-4 positive interstitial
   trophoblasts was significantly higher in preeclamptic patients than in
   patients with PTL without or with histologic chorioamnionitis (P =.0002
   and P =.02, respectively). (2) The median percentage of TLR-2 positive
   interstitial trophoblasts was not different among study groups (P >.05).
   (3) TLR-4 positive trophoblasts were also frequently immunoreactive to
   activated nuclear factor-kappa B, tumor. necrosis factor-alpha, and M30
   (a specific apoptosis antigen for trophoblast). (4) Lipopolysaccharide
   treatment inhibited migration of trophoblast cell lines in vitro.
   Conclusion: TLR-4 protein expression is increased in interstitial
   trophoblasts of patients with preeclampsia. We propose that ``danger
   signals{''} at the feto-maternal interface, recognized by trophoblasts
   through TLR-4, may play a key role in creating a local abnormal cytokine
   milieu. This suggests a novel mechanism that links activation of the
   innate immune system through TLR-4 and preeclampsia. (C) 2005 Mosby,

Abstract = {{Little research has been done on the optimal mix of supply in service
   businesses that maximizes revenue. Our research context is the
   full-service restaurant table mix problem. This problem, which is quite
   new to the literature, finds the optimal number of different size tables
   for a restaurant to maximize its value (revenue or contribution)
   generating potential. Specifically, we examine the effectiveness of
   eight heuristic techniques for the problem using two experiments. The
   first experiment uses data from a 240-seat full-service restaurant to
   evaluate all eight heuristics, while the second experiment investigates
   the performance of selected heuristics under a broader set of
   environmental factors. The results of our first experiment showed that
   the better of the simulated annealing heuristic variants yielded the
   optimal solution in seven of eight test problems, averaging within 0.1\%
   of optimal. Our second experiment showed that the simplest of the models
   we investigated yielded solutions within 1\% of the simulated annealing
   solution. Finally, we observed that altering the table mix on a daily
   basis increased performance by over 1\% compared to maintaining the
   optimal weekly table mix. (c) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   spherical cavities called multiple reflection expansion (MRE). The
   thermodynamic potential for the 2SC strangelets is derived in the
   mean-field approximation with the help of the MRE. We found that 2SC

   the 2SC phases are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{When studying either qualitative or quantitative traits, tests of
   association in the presence of linkage are necessary for fine-mapping.
   In a previous report (Kistner and Weinberg {[}2004] Genet Epidemiol
   27:33-42), we suggested a polytomous logistic approach to testing
   linkage and association between a di-allelic marker and a quantitative
   trait locus, using genotyped triads, consisting of an individual whose
   quantitative trait has been measured and his or her two parents. Here we
   extend that approach to incorporate marker information from entire
   nuclear families. By computing a weighted score function instead of a
   maximum likelihood test, we allow for both an unspecified correlation
   structure between siblings and ``informative{''} family size (Williamson
   et al. {[}2003] Biometrics 59:36-42). Both this approach and our
   original approach allow for population admixture by conditioning on
   parental genotypes. The proposed method allows for missing parental
   genotype data through a multiple imputation procedure. We use
   simulations based on a population with admixture to compare our method
   to a popular non-parametric family-based association test (FBAT),
   testing the null of no association in the presence of linkage.}},

Abstract = {{Recessively inherited early-onset parkinsonism (EOP) has been associated
   with mutations in the Parkin, DJ-1, and PINK1 genes. We studied the
   prevalence of mutations in all three genes in 65 Italian patients ( mean
   age of onset: 43.2 +/- 5.4 years, 62 sporadic, three familial), selected
   by age at onset equal or younger than 51 years. Clinical features were
   compatible with idiopathic Parkinson's disease in all cases. To detect
   small sequence alterations in Parkin, DJ-1, and PINK1, we performed a
   conventional mutational analysis (SSCP/dHPLC/sequencing) of all coding
   exons of these genes. To test for the presence of exon rearrangements in
   PINK1, we established a new quantitative duplex PCR assay. Gene dosage
   alterations in Parkin and DJ-1 were excluded using previously reported
   protocols. Five patients (8\%; one woman/four men; mean age at onset:
   38.2 +/- 9.7 (range 25-49) years) carried mutations in one of the genes
   studied: three cases had novel PINK1 mutations, one of which occurred
   twice (homozygous c. 1602-1603insCAA; heterozygous c. 1602-1603insCAA;
   heterozygous c. 836G4A), and two patients had known Parkin mutations (
   heterozygous c. 734A > T and c. 924C > T; heterozygous c. 924C > T).
   Family history was negative for all mutation carriers, but one with a
   history of tremor. Additionally, we detected one novel polymorphism
   (c.344A > T) and four novel PINK1 changes of unknown pathogenic
   significance (-21G/A; IVS1+97A/G; IVS3+38-40delTTT; c.852C > T), but no
   exon rearrangements. No mutations were found in the DJ-1 gene. The
   number of mutation carriers in both the Parkin and the PINK1 gene in our
   cohort is low but comparable, suggesting that PINK1 has to be considered
   in EOP.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine the effectiveness of a sexuality education program
   designed to help parents become more confident and competent in
   communicating with their children about sex and sexuality.
   Methods: Parents attending a four- to five-part workshop series between
   February 2001 and April 2002 were recruited to participate. A total of
   27 workshop series were conducted at various sites in neighborhoods with
   high teen pregnancy and STD rates. For each series, program staff
   administered written pre- and post-workshop surveys to parents and
   parent surrogates. A follow-up telephone survey was conducted with
   participants 10 weeks after the last workshop. Matched pre-workshop and
   follow-up surveys were obtained from 174 participants.
   Results: Comparison of follow-up to pre-workshop responses revealed that
   more participants thought discussing sexuality with their children was
   very important (83\% vs. 75\%; p < .01). More participants also reported
   that they often initiate conversations with their children on a variety
   of topics including sex/intercourse, human immunodeficiency
   virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), pregnancy,
   sexuality and gender issues, and their personal standards for sexual
   behavior. Participants also became more comfortable discussing sensitive
   topics with their children. At follow-up, more participants responded
   that they were very comfortable answering their children's questions on
   the above topics. (All p values < .01.)
   Conclusions: The Parents as Primary Sexuality Educators program may be
   an effective way to increase parent-child communication about health,
   sexuality, and values. Enhancing parents' ability to communicate
   expectations and values about sexuality may help support children in
   making healthy decisions about sexual behavior as adolescents. 2005

Abstract = {{Grease burns occur commonly in the home during food preparation. It has
   been our observation that grease burns follow a particular pattern of
   injury. The purpose of this study was to review our institutional
   experience in the management of these burns to develop a classification
   scheme.
   We performed a retrospective review of patients admitted to our burn
   center with grease burns. Subjects were identified through our database
   and their charts were reviewed with particular attention to burn
   distribution, TBSA and need for grafting. We excluded workplace burns
   and children under the age of six.
   A total of 249 patients who fit the above criteria were admitted with
   grease burns to our burn center from 1993 to 2003. The sequence of
   events leading to burn and its distribution followed a consistent
   pattern. The majority of patients (86\%) had an isolated upper extremity
   burn or upper extremity burn in combination with a face, trunk or lower
   extremity burn. Forty percent of patients required at least one excision
   and grafting procedure.
   Grease burns associated with cooking at home follow predictable patterns
   of injury. Based on these patterns we proposed a classification system
   for domestic grease burns. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights

Abstract = {{The activation and entry of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells into the
   central nervous system is an essential step towards clearance of West
   Nile virus (WNV) from infected neurons. The molecular signals
   responsible for the directed migration of virus-specific T cells and
   their cellular sources are presently unknown. Here we demonstrate that
   in response to WNV infection, neurons secrete the chemokine CXCL10,
   which recruits effector T cells via the chemokine receptor CXCR3.
   Neutralization or a genetic deficiency of CXCL10 leads to a decrease in
   CXCR3(+) CD8(+) T-cell trafficking, an increase in viral burden in the
   brain, and enhanced morbidity and mortality. These data support a new
   paradigm in chemokine neurobiology, as neurons are not generally
   considered to generate antiviral immune responses, and CXCL10 may
   represent a novel neuroprotective agent in response to WNV infection in
   the central nervous system.}},

   airway responses in a sensitized mouse model, and (2) the magnitude of
   allergic airway disease responses will decrease with increasing distance
   from the roadway. A particle concentrator and a mobile exposure facility
   were used to expose ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized BALB/c mice to purified
   air and concentrated fine and concentrated ultrafine ambient particles
   at 50 m and 150 m downwind from a roadway that was heavily impacted by
   emissions from heavy duty diesel-powered vehicles. After exposure, we
   assessed interleukin (IL)-5, IL-13, OVA-specific immunoglobulin E,
   OVA-specific immunoglobulin G1, and eosinophil influx as biomarkers of
   allergic responses and numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes as a
   marker of inflammation. The study was performed over a two-year period,
   and there were differences in the concentrations and compositions of
   ambient particulate matter across those years that could have influenced
   our results. However, averaged over the two-year period, exposure to
   concentrated ambient particles (CAPs) increased the biomarkers
   associated with airway allergies (IL-5, immunoglobulin E, immunoglobulin
   G1 and eosinophils). In addition, mice exposed to CAPs 50 m downwind of
   the roadway had, on the average, greater allergic responses and showed
   greater indications of inflammation than did mice exposed to CAPs 150 m
   downwind. This study is consistent with the hypothesis that exposure to
   CAPs close to a heavily trafficked roadway influenced allergic airway
   responses.}},

Abstract = {{Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) such as heparan sulfate and chondroitin
   sulfate are polysaccharide chains that are attached to core proteins to
   form proteoglycans. The biosynthesis of GAGs is a multistep process that
   includes the attachment of sulfate groups to specific positions of the
   polysaccharide chains by sulfotransferases. Heparan-sulfate and heparan
   sulfate-sulfotransferases play important roles in growth factor
   signaling and animal development. However, the biological importance of
   chondroitin sulfation during mammalian development and growth factor
   signaling is poorly understood. We show that a gene trap mutation in the
   BMP-induced chondroitin-4sulfotransferase 1 (C4stl) gene (also called
   carbohydrate sulfotransferase 11 - Chst11), which encodes an enzyme
   specific for the transfer of sulfate groups to the 4-O-position in
   chondroitin, causes severe chondrodysplasia characterized by a
   disorganized cartilage growth plate as well as specific alterations in
   the orientation of chondrocyte columns. This phenotype is associated
   with a chondroitin sulfation imbalance, mislocalization of chondroitin
   sulfate in the growth plate and an imbalance of apoptotic signals.
   Analysis of several growth factor signaling pathways that are important
   in cartilage growth plate development showed that the C4st1(gt/gt)
   mutation led to strong upregulation of TGF beta signaling with
   concomitant downregulation of BMP signaling, while Indian hedgehog (Ihh)
   signaling was unaffected. These results show that chondroitin
   4-O-sulfation by C4st1 is required for proper chondroitin sulfate
   localization, modulation of distinct signaling pathways and cartilage
   growth plate morphogenesis. Our study demonstrates an important
   biological role of differential chondroitin sulfation in mammalian
   development.}},

Abstract = {{Electrical cell uncoupling via gap junction closure is assumed to cause
   characteristic changes of the passive dielectric spectrum of ischemic
   heart tissue. In order to find an independent evidence for this
   assumption, we analysed heart tissue during ischemia, measured the open
   state of gap junctions by means of dye transfer and correlated this
   parameter with the time course of the dielectric permittivity. The
   hearts were preischemically arrested by perfusion with Ringer solution
   containing 20 mmol/L of potassium (group KCL, n=10). This solution was
   also used with the addition of two gap junction blockers, either 3
   mmol/L heptanol (group HEP, n=4) or 20 mu\textbackslash{}mol/L
   palmitoleic acid (group PA, n=7). During subsequent ischemia at 21.0 +/-
   0.5 degrees C, we monitored the passive dielectric permittivity spectrum
   and the spread of dye.
   After a sigmoidal increase the dielectric permittivity reached an upper
   plateau at 61 +/- 22 min of ischemia in KCL, at 45 +/- 7 min in PA, and
   already during perfusion at 2 1 min in group HER At the beginning of
   ischemia, dye migrated to neighbouring cells in groups KCL and PA but
   not in HER In KCL and PA, the intercellular diffusion of dye stopped
   after 64 +/- 26 and 40 +/- 11 min of ischemia, respectively.
   Our results suggest that the sigmoidal increase in dielectric
   permittivity and the reduction of dye diffusion depend on a common
   mechanism, namely gap junction closure. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Host-pathogen interactions that alter virulence are influenced by
   critical nutrients such as iron. In humans, free iron is unavailable,
   being present only in high-affinity iron binding proteins such as
   transferrin. The fungal pathogen Candida albicans grows as a saprophyte
   on mucosal surfaces. Occasionally it invades systemically, and in this
   circumstance it will encounter transferrin iron. Here we report that C
   albicans is able to acquire iron from transferrin. Iron-loaded
   transferrin restored growth to cultures arrested by iron deprivation,
   whereas apotransferrin was unable to promote growth. By using congenic
   strains, we have been able to show that iron uptake by C. albicans from
   transferrin was mediated by the reductive pathway (via FTR1). The
   genetically separate siderophore and heme uptake systems were not
   involved. FRE10 was required for a surface reductase activity and for
   efficient transferrin iron uptake activity in unbuffered medium. Other
   reductase genes were apparently up-regulated in medium buffered at pH
   6.3 to 6.4, and the fre10(-/-) mutant had no effect under these
   conditions. Experiments in which transferrin was sequestered in a
   dialysis bag demonstrated that cell contact with the substrate was
   required for iron reduction and release. The requirement of FTR1 for
   virulence in a systemic infection model and its role in transferrin iron
   uptake raise the possibility that transferrin is a source of iron during
   systemic C. albicans infections.}},

   bone around the implants was studied by histological examination,
   contact micro-radiography (CMR), and fluorescent bone labeling. In the
   dogs receiving osteotomized vascularized tibial grafts, bone bridging
   was confirmed at both the medial and distal junctions of the bone
   segments after 4 weeks. Additional newly formed bone was observed after
   8 weeks, and bone union at the surface of the segments was completed
   after 12 weeks. In contrast, bone formation was clearly delayed in dogs
   receiving simple (non-vascularized) tibial grafts. Histologically, no
   difference in bone union was evident between limbs with dental implants
   in tibial bone and control limbs without implants, suggesting that
   implant placement does not negatively affect revascularization.
   Fluorescent bone labeling technique confirmed high vascularity of the
   vascularized tibial bone grafts but not of the simple (non-vascularized)
   tibial bone grafts early after the procedure. Our results suggest that
   osseointegration occurred around dental implants placed at the same time
   as reconstruction with osteotornized vascularized bone grafts in this
   animal model.}},

Abstract = {{An empirical regularity in the price-promotion behavior of retailers of
   homogenous goods is explained theoretically. Based on this, a model is
   proposed for price competition in a market for a homogenous good with
   many asymmetrically positioned retailers. Asymmetry in this context
   refers to firms having potentially dissimilar loyal and switcher
   customer numbers that shape their pricing behavior in on-line markets.
   Incomplete information on the size of these segments results in
   distinguishable clusters of indistinguishable firms. To analyze these
   markets, a static game of price competition is developed and solved in
   an asymmetric oligopoly with numerous clusters of firms. The firms with
   the smallest ratio of switcher segment size to loyal segment size engage
   in fierce price competition, whereas the members of all other groups
   price their goods at reservation price points with no price promotions.
   This observation is a unique contribution and challenges the perception
   that all firms in markets for homogenous goods adopt mixed pricing
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the content of adipokinetic hormone (AKH), the adipokinetic
   response and the walking activity of 10-day-old adult macropterous
   females of the firebug, Pyrrhocoris apterus (L.), reared under long-day
   (LD) photoperiod (LD 18 : 6 h) are compared with those exposed for 3
   days to constant darkness (DD). Diel changes of all the parameters
   studied in LD females persist in females kept in constant dark. A
   positive correlation exists between diel changes of AKH content in the
   central nervous system (CNS) in the LD and DD females, and a negative
   correlation in the AKH level in haemolymph and walking activity. In
   addition, there is a positive correlation between diel changes of AKH
   level in haemolymph and walking activity in macropterous females reared
   under LD conditions, as well as in those transferred to constant
   darkness. The data suggest that there is some feedback between the
   release of AKH from CNS into the haemolymph and walking activity in
   macropterous females. Preliminary studies on the simultaneous expression
   of mRNA for the period gene and a positive reaction to an antibody
   against AKH in the same corpus cardiacum cells suggest that the period

Abstract = {{We consider the first law of black hole thermodynamics in an
   asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime in the class of gravitational
   theories whose gravitational Lagrangian is an arbitrary function of the
   Ricci scalar. We first show that the conserved quantities in this class
   of gravitational theories constructed through conformal completion
   remain unchanged under the conformal transformation into the Einstein
   frame. We then prove that the mass and the angular momenta defined by
   these conserved quantities, along with the entropy defined by the
   Noether charge, satisfy the first law of black hole thermodynamics, not
   only in Einstein gravity but also in the higher curvature gravity within
   the class under consideration. We also point out that it is naturally
   understood in the symplectic formalism that the mass satisfying the
   first law should be necessarily defined associated with the timelike
   Killing vector nonrotating at infinity. Finally, a possible
   generalization into a wider class of gravitational theories is
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{High-resolution nuclear resonance fluorescence experiments (NRF) were
   performed on Cd-110,Cd-111,Cd-112,Cd-114,Cd-116 at the bremsstrahlung
   facility of the 4.3-MV Dynamitron accelerator in Stuttgart to study the
   low-lying dipole strength distributions in these vibrational nuclei.
   Numerous excited states, most of them previously unknown, were observed
   in the excitation energy range up to 4 MeV. Detailed spectroscopic
   information has been obtained on excitation energies, spins, decay
   widths, decay branchings, and transition probabilities. For states in
   the even-even isotopes Cd-110,Cd-112,Cd-114,Cd-116, parities could be
   assigned from linear polarization measurements. Together with our
   previous results for Cd-108,Cd-112,Cd-113,Cd-114 from NRF studies
   without polarization measurements, systematics was established for the
   dipole strength distributions of the stable nuclei within the Cd
   isotopic chain. The results are discussed with respect to the
   systematics of E1 two-phonon excitations and mixed-symmetry states in
   even-even nuclei near the Z=50 shell closure and the fragmentation of
   these excitation modes in the odd-mass Cd isotopes.}},

Abstract = {{Pulse energy conversion systems are characterized by the potential
   possibility of operational motion stability loss during fractions of
   seconds because of control high frequency effect and dynamics
   nonlinearity of these systems. In the case of a priori information
   absence, identification and forecasting in real-time mode become
   practically impossible. On the other hand, a priori information, mapped
   in the phase and parametric spaces, does not allow one-to-one decision
   making about the present system state even in the case of small (2-D)
   dimensionality of these spaces, because of impossibility of their
   one-to-one treatment. The principles of dynamics data structurization,
   based on the use of fractal regularities, are offered in the paper.
   These principles are general for systems with different
   dimensionalities, moreover structurization is realized independently for
   every motion type considered. As a result, 2-D projections of the
   special spaces are formed in which one-to-one treatment of the acting
   system state becomes possible in the real-time mode. As an example 4-D
   mathematical model of pulse system and random variation of 2-D
   parametric vector are considered. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a new method to simulate human gait motion
   when muscles are weakened. The method is based on the enhanced version
   of three-dimensional linear inverted pendulum model that is used for
   generation of gait in robotics. After the normal gait motion is
   generated by setting the initial posture and the parameters that decide
   the trajectories of the center of mass and angular momentum, the muscle
   to be weakened is specified. By minimizing an. objective function based
   on the force exerted by the specified muscle during the motion, the set
   of parameters that represent the pathological gait was calculated. Since
   the number of parameters to describe the motion is small in our method,
   the optimization process converges much more quickly than in previous
   methods. The effects of weakening the gluteus medialis, the gluteus
   maximus, and vastus were analyzed. Important similarities were noted
   when comparing the predicted pendulum motion with data obtained from an
   actual patient.}},

Abstract = {{The study goal was to determine the technical feasibility and outcomes
   associated with pancreaticoduodenectomy for periampullary malignancies
   with near (> 80\%) or complete (100\%) superior mesenteric venous (SAM
   obstruction. A retrospective examination of 11 patients with high-grade
   or complete SMV obstruction who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy at
   five academic medical centers is reviewed. Pancreaticoduodenectomy for
   locally advanced periampullary malignancies causing high-grade or
   complete SMV obstruction is technically feasible. Operative approaches
   and outcomes are presented. One 30-day death was observed. Median
   survival of the cohort is 18 months. Survivals exceeding 2 years
   post-resection have been observed. In a number of cases, significant
   palliation of pain and of biliary and duodenal obstruction were
   achieved. Based on this initial series, pancreaticoduodenectomy in the
   presence of near or total SMV obstruction is feasible, may result in an
   R0 resection, and may be beneficial in select patients with a
   periampullary malignancy. We suggest such an approach be considered
   particularly following completion of neoadjuvant therapy without
   systemic progression. Further studies and more long-term follow-up at
   high-volume centers are required, however, to better determine the
   indications and potential benefit of such an undertaking.}},

   calculation. In the canted antiferromagnetic phase (H < H-c), a low

   oscillation is not interpreted by the simple FS reconstruction due to
   the long range order of the Fe 3d spins and implies that the strong

Abstract = {{The 22q13 deletion syndrome is associated with global developmental
   delay, absent or delayed speech, and generalised hypotonia. In this
   study, the size and nature of 22q13 deletions (n = 9) were studied in
   detail by high-resolution chromosome specific array-based comparative
   genomic hybridisation ( array CGH). The deletion sizes varied
   considerably between the different patients, that is, the largest
   deletion spanning 8.4Mb with the breakpoint mapping to 22q13.2 and the
   smallest deletion spanning 3.3Mb with the breakpoint mapping to
   22q13.31. In one case, a unique subtelomeric 3.9Mb deletion associated
   with a 2.0Mb duplication of 22q13 was observed, adding to a growing
   number of similar cases identified for other chromosome ends.
   Remarkably, this patient had signs suggestive of retinitis pigmentosa,
   which has never been reported before in the 22q13 deletion syndrome. The
   identification of two pairs of recurrent proximal breakpoints on 22q13
   suggests that these specific regions may be prone to recombination, due
   to yet unknown genome architectural features. In addition to the copy
   number changes on 22q13, a duplication of similar to 330 kb on 22q11.1
   was observed and shown to be a genetic large-scale copy number variation
   without clinical consequences. The current study failed to reveal
   relationships between the clinical features and the deletion sizes.
   Global developmental delay and absent or severely delayed speech were
   observed in all patients, whereas hypotonia was present in 89\% of the
   cases (8/9). This study underscores the utility of array CGH for
   characterising the size and nature of subtelomeric deletions, such as
   monosomy 22q13, and underlines the considerable variability in deletion
   size in the 22q13 deletion syndrome regardless of the clinical
   phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The epithelial rests of Malassez (ERM) are derived from the
   Hertwig's epithelial root sheath during tooth development. The ERM
   contain endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), but the existence of
   phosphorylation site/s of eNOS in the ERM is unclear.
   Methods: Rat molars with periodontium were perfusion- and post-fixed,
   decalcified, and frozen-sectioned. Free-floating sections were incubated
   using antisera against total eNOS, eNOS phosphorylated at serine
   (Ser)(1177), Ser(116), and threonine (Thr)(495). The signal intensities
   of t-eNOS, p-eNOS at Ser(1177) and Ser(116) in the ERM were measured by
   densitometry and statistically analyzed.
   Results: In the ERM, localization of total eNOS and the phosphorylation
   sites of eNOS at Ser(1177) and Ser(116) were detected, while a basal
   localization of eNOS phosphorylated at Thr(495) in the ERM was
   undetectable. For p-eNOS at Ser(116) regional differences in
   phosphorylation were detected.
   Conclusions: The basal production of NO by eNOS in the ERM is modulated
   by phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser(1177) and Ser(116) residues, while the
   basal activity of the eNOS is not influenced by phosphorylation of eNOS
   at Thr(495) residue. This provides evidence that phosphorylation plays a
   key role for regulation of the catalytic activity of eNOS.}},

   visions of curriculum and teaching in the literature, and describe the
   responses of a group of middle school students to a unit that examined

   addresses student experiences in school can help students make sense of

   teaching and schooling that they otherwise might never have considered.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Sauna-related burns are rare, even in Finland where sauna bathing is a
   popular leisure pastime. Burns induced by hot air are even more rare and
   constitute a very small subgroup of all sauna burns. Hot air burns are
   characterised by a combination of full thickness skin damage with deep
   tissue destruction. We report here on six consecutive patients suffering
   from hot air sauna burns with rhabdomyolysis.
   All six patients were middle-aged, the majority of them men. Acute
   excessive consumption of alcohol exacerbated by a hot environment
   resulted in dehydration and loss of consciousness. Immobility and
   prolonged exposure to hot, dry air resulted in third degree regional
   burns with 5-32\% TBSA. Rhabdomyolysis was evident on admission. The
   laboratory values of plasma creatine kinase (P-CK), plasma myoglobin
   (PM), blood pH, and serum potassium (S-K) during the first five days
   were evaluated. Aggressive fluid management and correction of acidosis
   and myoglobinuria were started on admission. Surgical management
   consisted of early, aggressive excision at fascial level, in some
   patients involving sacrifice of the upper layers of muscle. Even so,
   mortality in this small series was 50\%. The best indicator of poor
   prognosis was a highly elevated CK value on the second post-injury day.

Abstract = {{Objective: To establish normative data on the single-subject variation
   of resting motor thresholds and silent periods over 10 h using
   transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).
   Methods: Seventeen neurologically normal volunteers aged 18-36 underwent
   a series of seven TMS sessions conducted over the course of a single
   10-h period. During each session, resting motor threshold and cortical
   silent period were recorded for the first dorsal interosseus muscle of
   each hand during focal TMS of the contralateral motor area.
   Results: We provide data on the normal limits of variability in these
   measures for averaged group data and for single subjects. Specifically,
   we report intersession, intrasession, and interhemispheric variability
   of data for each subject individually.
   Conclusions: Although group averages are highly reliable, individual
   subjects showed substantial variability over time, especially for silent
   periods. Interhemispheric asymmetry was a less stable indicator than
   previously reported.
   Significance: These norms may guide the interpretation of changes in TMS
   measures within groups or within an individual patient over brief
   periods of time or as an immediate response to intervention. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{The magneto-transport properties of thick relaxed A-site deficient films
   having the composition Pr-0.6 square 0.1Sr0.3MnO3(P square SMO with the
   square symbol for the Pr vacancy) and Pr0.7Sr0.2 square 0.1MnO3(PS
   square MO) are studied. A direct comparison with a Pr0.7Sr0.3MnO3(PSMO)
   completely relaxed film, deposited under the same growth conditions,
   shows a reduction of the in-plane parameter a(100) associated to an
   enhancement of the out-plane parameter. The strains ( bulk strain
   epsilon(B) and biaxial Jahn- Teller strain epsilon(J-T)) do vary with
   the nature of the cationic vacancy. For example, an enhancement of
   epsilon(B) of 9\% in the PS square MO film (Sr deficient) produces a
   decrease of T-C of 30 K, whereas the Pr deficient P square SMO film
   exhibits a large reduction of both epsilon(B)(- 16\%) and epsilon(J-T) (
   divided by a factor of 5), which enhances T-C of 12 K, similarly to
   previous observations on bulk ceramics. With a reduced resistivity (rho
   < 0.02 Omega cm), the obtained Pr-deficient film, P square SMO, exhibits
   the best magneto-transport properties with a decreasing
   magnetoresistance sensitivity at low field.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate regional air-ways obstruction in patients with
   cystic fibrosis (CF) with quantitative analysis of dynamic
   hyperpolarized (HP) He-3 MRI.
   Materials and Methods: Dynamic radial projection MRI of Hp He-3 gas was
   used to study respiratory dynamics in a group of eight children with CF.
   Signal kinetics in a total of seven regions of interest (ROIs; three in
   each lung, and one in the trachea) were compared with the results of
   spirometric pulmonary function tests (PFTs). The tracheal signal
   intensity was used as a form of ``input function{''} to normalize for
   input flow effects.
   Results: A pattern of low flow rate in the upper lobes was observed.
   When the flow measurements from the peripheral ROls were averaged to
   obtain an index of flow in the peripheral lung, a good correlation was
   found (P = 3.74 X 10(-5)) with the forced expired volume in one second
   (FEV1).
   Conclusion: These results suggest that a quantitative measurement of
   localized airways obstruction in the early stages of CF may be obtained
   from dynamic He-3 MRI by using the slope of the signal rise as a measure
   of air flow into the peripheral lung. This study also demonstrates that
   children can cooperate well with the He-3 MRI technique.}},

Abstract = {{Because fruits and vegetables are rich in bioactive compounds with
   potential cancer-preventive actions, increased consumption may reduce
   the risk of ovarian cancer. Evidence on the association between fruit
   and vegetable intake and ovarian cancer risk has not been consistent. We
   analyzed and pooled the primary data from 12 prospective studies in
   North America and Europe. Fruit and vegetable intake was measured at
   baseline in each study using a validated food frequency questionnaire.
   To summarize the association between fruit and vegetable intake and
   ovarian cancer, study-specific relative risks (RR) were estimated using
   the Cox proportional hazards model, and then combined using a
   random-effects model. Among 560,441 women, 2,130 cases of invasive
   epithelial ovarian cancer occurred during a maximum follow-up of 7 to 22
   years across studies. Total fruit intake was not associated with ovarian
   cancer risk-the pooled multivariate RR for the highest versus the lowest
   quartile of intake was 1.06 {[}95\% confidence interval (95\% CI),
   0.92-1.21; P value, test for trend = 0.73; P value, test for
   between-studies heterogeneity = 0.741. Similarly, results for total
   vegetable intake indicated no significant association (pooled
   multivariate RR, 0.90; 95\% Cl, 0.78-1.04, for the highest versus the
   lowest quartile; P value, test for trend = 0.06; P value, test for
   between-studies heterogeneity = 0.31). Intakes of botanically defined
   fruit and vegetable groups and individual fruits and vegetables were
   also not associated with ovarian cancer risk. Associations for total
   fruits and vegetables were similar for different histologic types. These
   results suggest that fruit and vegetable consumption in adulthood has no
   important association with the risk of ovarian cancer.}},

   this study, we evaluated the outcome of patients with LAM who underwent
   lung transplantation with the aim of making some recommendations
   regarding patient management.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of 79 patients who
   underwent primary lung transplantation for end-stage pulmonary LAM at 31
   US transplant centers between January 1987 and December 2002 and were
   reported to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS).
   Results: All patients were women with a mean age of 41.1 years (range,
   24 - 65 years). Thirty-four patients (43\%) received single-lung
   transplants. Bilateral lung transplantation was performed in 45 patients
   (57\%). The mean cold ischemia time was 4.7 hours. There were 2
   intra-operative deaths. the 30-day mortality was 5\% (4 patients). The
   causes of early death were primary graft failure in 2 patients,
   hyperacute rejection in I patient, and a cardiac event in I patient.
   Twenty late deaths (> 30 days post-transplant) occurred. Of those, 5
   were from multisystem organ failure, 5 from pulmonary complications, and
   2 from fungal infection. Rejection and bronchiolitis obliterans
   accounted for 2 deaths each. The cause of death was a cardiac event in 1
   patient and was not recorded in the remaining. Four patients were
   re-transplanted. Fifty-five patients (70\%) were alive at a mean
   follow-up of 37 months (range 0-128 months). The actuarial Kaplan-Meier
   survival was 85.75\% at 1 year, 76.35\% at 3 years, and 64.91\% at
   5-years. Log-rank analysis showed a statistically significant difference
   in the survival rate of LAM patients compared with a historical group of
   patients who had transplantation for all lung conditions during the same
   period (45.12\%, p. = 0.0012). Transplant era, type of transplant, donor
   gender, ischemia time of more than 4 hours, age more than 40 years, and
   donor/recipient cytomegalovirus did not impact survival.
   Conclusions: Lung transplantation is a valuable therapeutic option for
   patients with end-stage pulmonary LAM. Transplantation offers survival
   rates that are equivalent to or better than those of patients who
   received a lung transplant for other indications.}},

Abstract = {{Gas dispersion is one of the key factors in the mineral flotation
   process. It can be expressed by many variables such as bubble size, gas
   holdup, gas superficial velocity and bubble surface area flux (S-b), In
   particular, Sb has been found to have a strong correlation with the
   flotation rate constant (K). Bubble size is important because it is
   related with the transport capacity and with the flotation probability.
   It also affects the gas holdup and the bubble surface area flux. In this
   work bubble sizes are measured using image analysis. An empirical rate
   constant model is developed to relate K with Sb and other dispersion
   variables. This model is found to be able to predict K for two different
   batch flotation cells.}},

Abstract = {{LC-ESI-MS is applied frequently in pharmaceutical analysis. The sample
   amount is generally not restricted, however with LC-ESI-MS, a lack of
   sensitivity may still be observed with standard-bore LC columns in
   isocratic mode. Therefore, it was investigated whether increased
   sensitivity could be achieved by using miniaturized LC-ESI-MS. Seven
   columns ranging from 0.1 to 4.6 mm ID were tested using several
   instrument setups. For proper comparison, a sensitivity gain factor
   (SGF) was introduced. The SGF expresses the extra sensitivity that may
   be obtained on top of the normal increase of peak concentration, which
   can be expected when the column ID is reduced. Desogestrel, mirtazapine,
   and sugammadex sodium were used as test compounds. For desogestrel and
   sugammadex sodium, the SGF increased up to a factor of 5-13 when the
   column ID was reduced, indicating enhanced ionization efficiencies at
   lower flow rates. Optimum sensitivity was found for the 0.3 mm column
   coupled in combination with a microinjection valve and a dedicated low
   flow rate interface. For mirtazapine, no increase of SGF was observed
   when the column ID was decreased. Apparently, the ionization efficiency
   of this compound is not affected by the flow rate and the spray quality.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. To assess the usefulness of measuring testosterone, free
   testosterone, and the free/total (f/t) prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
   ratio with the intention of reducing the number of unnecessary biopsies
   in the patients with PSA values between 2.0 and 4.0 ng/mL. Cancer
   detection is not rare among patients with PSA values between 2.0 and 4.0
   ng/mL.
   Methods. A total of 171 men with serum PSA levels of 2.0 to 4.0 ng/mL
   were enrolled in this study. The f/t PSA ratio and total and free
   testosterone levels were quantified. All patients underwent transrectal
   ultrasound-guided biopsy. The cancer detection rate, clinical and
   pathologic features of the cancers detected, and the probability of
   cancer detection in relation to the f/t PSA ratio and total and free
   testosterone levels were estimated. Two-step statistical analysis was
   used for descriptive purposes and in the detection of cancer predictors.
   Statistical significance was set at P <= 0.05.
   Results. The mean patient age was 63.3 years. Cancer was detected in 39
   (22.8\%) of the 171 patients. Only 15.4\% of our patients had
   insignificant cancer. The f/t PSA ratio and total and free testosterone
   levels were significantly lower in the patients with prostate cancer
   (19.3\%, 13.68 nmol/L, and 28.4 pmol/L, respectively; P <0.001). The f/t
   PSA ratio and free testosterone were the strongest predictors of cancer
   detection (P <0.001).
   Conclusions. The results of our study have shown that an important
   number of cancers could be detected in the PSA range of 2.0 to 4.0
   ng/mL. The great majority of cancers detected have the features of
   medically significant tumors. The combination of the f/t PSA ratio and
   free testosterone measurements may reveal those patients who require
   biopsy.}},

Abstract = {{Polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) is a polybiguanide (PBG) oligomer
   with antimicrobial activity that is used extensively and safely as a
   disinfectant. The reported mechanism of PHMB antimicrobial activity,
   which involves interactions with cell membrane components, suggested
   that PHMB or other PBG-based compounds might also have antiviral or
   virucidal activity against the human immunodeficiency virus type 1
   (HIV-1). PHMB had modest in vitro activity against both cell-free and
   cell-associated HIV-1, as well as the ability to interfere with viral
   binding and entry. However, PHMB was comparable in cytotoxicity to the
   spermicidal agent nonoxynol-9 (N-9), a compound that has been
   characterized in previous studies as generally cytotoxic and detrimental
   to cervicovaginal epithelial integrity. To identify structural variants
   of PHMB with greater anti-HIV-1 activity and/or less cytotoxicity,
   modified versions of PHMB incorporating length changes in the
   hydrocarbon linker units were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro
   cytotoxicity and inhibition of HIV-1 infectivity. These experiments
   demonstrated that the PHMB variant polyethylene hexamethylene biguanide
   (PEHMB) was just as active against HIV-1 as PHMB, yet was much less
   cytotoxic than either N-9 or PHMB, resulting in an in vitro therapeutic
   index (TI) approximately 114-fold greater than the TI of N-9. PEHMB,
   which has been identified in these studies as a promising microbicidal
   candidate in this family of compounds, will be the focus of further in
   vitro and in vivo evaluations of anti-HIV-1 activity, toxicity, and
   mechanisms of action. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Large, long-term databases are needed in order to provide
   information on the safety and efficacy (if new agents used in the
   treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA).
   These databases can provide data which is well beyond what is available
   from industry-sponsored investigations.
   Methods. The structure, governance, content, context and developmental
   plan of the CORRONA database is described.
   Results. The CORRONA database has grown from start tip in 2002 to the
   largest independent database in North America which collects data from
   both rheumatologists and patients at the time of a clinical encounter.
   Data are collected as often as every 3 months in RA and ever), 6 months
   in PsA. As of the time of this writing, the CORRONA database consists of
   approximately 9, 000 patients with RA and 1, 000 with PsA. Data can be
   used to elucidate toxicities found in frequencies which would be
   considerably less common than can be uncovered in industry sponsored
   investigations. In addition, actual prescribing patterns and responses
   in clinical practice can be investigated and described.
   Conclusion. After 3 years of data collection, the CORRONA database is
   now appropriately able to make significant contributions to our
   understanding of the safety, efficacy of drugs, as well as demographic,
   and socioeconomic profiles of patients with RA and PsA. It has evolved
   from a nascent database to a mature one poised to make significant

Abstract = {{MAX1 is a 20 amino acid peptide that undergoes triggered self-assembly

   folding into beta-hairpin conformation. This folded structure undergoes
   rapid assembly into a highly crosslinked hydrogel network. DMEM cell
   culture media is one stimulus able to initiate folding and consequent
   self-assembly of MAX1. The cytocompatibility of this gel towards NIH 3T3
   murine fibroblasts is demonstrated. Gels were shown to be non-toxic to
   the fibroblast cells. MAX1 hydrogels also foster the ability of the
   cells to attach to the hydrogel scaffold in the absence or presence of

Abstract = {{Introduction: Cryoenergy has evolved as a safe and effective alternative
   for ablation of arrhythmia substrates in adult patients. Due to two
   specific features, cryomapping and cryoadhesion, this technique appears
   very attractive for pediatric patients minimizing complications and
   fluoroscopy time. The aim of the study was to investigate efficacy and
   safety of cryoenergy in the ablation of supraventricular tachycardia
   (SVT) substrates in pediatric patients.
   Patients and Methods: Thirty-two patients (mean age: 10.1 +/- 3.5 years)
   with SVT (accessory pathways: n = 19; atrioventricular nodal reentrant
   tachycardia (AVNRT): n = 13) underwent electrophysiological study under
   the guidance of the LocaLisa((R)) system. Cryomapping at -30 degrees C
   was performed to predict cryoablation outcome and to ascertain AV
   conduction. Cryoenergy was delivered subsequently at the same spot
   (cryoablation at -70 degrees C) as verified by the LocaLisa((R)) system.
   Results: Successful cryoablation was achieved in 24 of 32 patients
   (75\%). A median of two (1-10) cryoablations were delivered. In the
   remaining 8 patients, radiofrequency (RF) current application was
   effective in 5 resulting in an overall success rate of 90.6\%. In 4
   patients with an accessory pathway cryomapping was not predictive for
   successful cryoablation (negative predictive value 66.6\%). In 3
   additional patients with AVNRT transient high-grade AV block occurred
   during cryoablation despite previous ``safe{''} cryomapping at the same
   location. No other major complications were noted.
   Conclusion: Cryoablation of SVT substrates in pediatric patients was
   associated with a lower success rate compared to RF catheter ablation.
   Cryomapping decreased the number of permanent lesions but did not
   predict cryoablation outcome in all tachycardia substrates.}},

Abstract = {{Caution must be taken when designing circuits so that noise injected to
   and transmitted through the substrate does not reach and degrade the
   performance of sensitive circuitry present on the chip. In this paper we
   present a simple analytic substrate model for evaluating substrate noise
   coupling. The model can handle an arbitrary number of aggressor and
   victim devices on a multi-layered substrate with either biased or
   floating backside. The model has been validated by finite element
   calculations and measurements on test structures manufactured in a 0.35
   mu m CMOS process, and it is shown that the model gives an accurate
   description of the substrate noise coupling. For example, the noise
   suppressing properties of guard rings have been evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{The Cf-4 and Cf-9 genes originate from the wild tomato species
   Lycopersicon hirsutum and L. pimpinellifolium and confer resistance to
   strains of the leaf mold fungus Cladosporium fulvum that secrete the
   Avr4 and Avr9 elicitor proteins, respectively. Homologs of Cf-4 and Cf-9
   (Hcr9s) are located in several clusters and evolve mainly through
   sequence exchange between homologs. To study the evolution of Cf genes,
   we set out to identify functional Hcr9s that mediate recognition of Avr4
   and Avr9 (designated Hcr9-Avr4s and Hcr9-Avr9s) in all wild tomato
   species. Plants responsive to the Avr4 and Avr9 elicitor proteins were
   identified throughout the genus Lycopersicon. Open reading frames of
   Hcr9s from Avr4- and Avr9-responsive tomato plants were polymerase chain
   reaction-amplified. Several Hcr9s that mediate Avr4 or Avr9 recognition
   were identified in diverged tomato species by agroinfiltration assays.
   These Hcr9-Avr4s and Hcr9-Avr9s are highly identical to Cf-4 and Cf-9,
   respectively. Therefore, we conclude that both Cf-4 and Cf-9 predate
   Lycopersicon speciation. These results further suggest that C fulvum is
   an ancient pathogen of the genus Lycopersicon, in which Cf-4 and Cf-9
   have been maintained by selection pressure imposed by C fulvum.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of
   high-resolution computed tomography (CT) images to distinguish between
   benign and malignant vertebral compression fractures.
   Methods: Computed tomography images of 45 benign compression fractures
   in 40 patients and 33 malignant compression fractures in 33 patients
   were evaluated. A 16-slice multidetector-row CT scanner was used for
   data acquisition, and axial images with a slice thickness of 1 mm and
   sagittal and coronal multiplanar reconstruction images with a slice
   thickness of 0.7 to 1 mm were used for interpretation.
   Results: The following findings were significantly more frequent in
   malignant fractures: destruction of the anterolateral and/or posterior
   cortex of the vertebral body, destruction of the cancellous bone of the
   vertebral body, destruction of the end plate, destruction of the
   pedicle, a paraspinal soft tissue mass, and an epidural mass. The
   extremely reliable signs of malignancy were destruction of the
   anterolateral and/or posterior cortex of vertebral body (100\% accuracy)
   and destruction of the cancellous bone of the vertebral body (97.4\%
   accuracy).
   Conclusion: High-resolution CT can provide many useful signs for
   differentiating between benign and malignant vertebral compression
   fractures, and its diagnostic ability is sufficient for clinical use.}},

Abstract = {{Letter- or semantically-cued verbal fluency tests (VFT) induce
   different, but overlapping activities in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in
   healthy subjects. Functional differences between letter and semantic VFT
   may be important in elucidating the nature of language-related problems
   in schizophrenia since more profound impairment in semantically-cued
   retrieval may be suggestive of semantic system dysfunction specific to
   this disorder. However, the functional differences between the letter
   vs. semantic VFT on prefrontal metabolism in the subjects with
   schizophrenia have not been described. In the present study, we used
   near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to assess hemoglobin concentration
   changes in the bilateral PFCs in subjects and controls. Sixteen subjects
   with schizophrenia and 19 healthy controls performed letter and semantic
   VFTs. Prefrontal hemodynamic changes were simultaneously monitored by
   NIRS. While healthy subjects performed both tasks equivalently, the
   subjects with schizophrenia showed more compromised performance in the
   semantic VFTs compared to the letter VFTs. NIRS measurement revealed
   that the pattern of PFC activation was greater during the letter VFT
   when compared to the semantic VFT in the healthy subjects, suggesting
   more prominent PFC involvement in letter-cued retrieval. In contrast,
   the subjects with schizophrenia showed the opposite pattern of
   activation, implying that the semantic mode of lexical access might
   impose greater cognitive demands on the PFC. The present study is the
   first to detect abnormal patterns of PFC activation in adults with
   schizophrenia in response to the distinct cognitive demands associated
   with letter and semantic VFT. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Bfl-1/A1 is generally recognized as a Bcl-2-related inhibitor of
   apoptosis. We show that Bfl-1 undergoes constitutive
   ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated turnover. Moreover, while Bfl-1 suppresses
   apoptosis induced by staurosporine or cytokine withdrawal, it is
   proapoptotic in response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor
   activation in FL5.12 pro-B cells. Its anti-versus proapoptotic effect is
   regulated by two proteolytic events: (1) its constitutive
   proteasome-mediated turnover and (2) its TNF/cycloheximide (CHX)-induced
   cleavage by mu-calpain, or a calpain-like activity, coincident with
   acquisition of a proapoptotic phenotype. In vitro studies suggest that
   calpain-mediated cleavage of Bfl-1 occurs between its Bcl-2 homology
   (BH) 4 and BH3 domains. This would be consistent with the generation of
   a proapoptotic Bax-like BH1-3 molecule. Overall, our studies uncovered
   two new regulatory mechanisms that play a decisive role in determining
   Bfl-1's prosurvival versus prodeath activities. These findings might
   provide important clues to counteract chemoresistance in tumor cells
   that highly express Bfl-1.}},

Abstract = {{The Taguchi method was used to determine optimum conditions for the
   dissolution of ulexite in water saturated with SO2 to produce monosodium
   pentaborate (NaB5O8) in a new process. Experiments were carried out in
   two stages. In the first stage of the experiments, the ranges of
   experimental parameters were between 14 and 50 degrees C for reaction
   temperature, 0.05-0.20 g mL(-1) for solid-to-liquid ratio, 5-30 min for
   reaction time, 200-500 rpm for stirring speed and (1440-181)mu m for
   particle size. The optimum conditions for these parameters were found to
   be 50 degrees C, 0.1 g mL(-1), 10 min, 400 rpm and 725 mu m,
   respectively. Under these conditions, the dissolution percentage of
   ulexite in water saturated with SO2 was 91.98. According to the results
   of this optimization, it was seen that temperature and solid-to-liquid
   ratio were the effective parameters. Thus, in the second stage, a new
   experimental design was prepared to obtain a higher dissolution
   percentage by using a higher solid-to-liquid ratio and a higher
   temperature. In this design, the optimum conditions were found as 0.25 g
   mL(-1) for solid-to-liquid ratio, 725 mu m for particle size, 400 rpm
   for stirring speed and 30 min for reaction time at 92 degrees C reaction
   temperature and a conversion of 100\% was reached under these
   conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Haemoglobin disorders are among the most frequent indications for
   preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), introduced as an important
   option to couples at risk for producing offspring with thalassaemia and
   sickle cell disease. Previous experience mainly included PGD for
   beta-thalassaemia, while PGD for alpha-thalassaemia resulting in an
   unaffected pregnancy has not been reported. This study presents the
   results of the world's largest experience of 197 PGD cycles for
   haemoglobin disorders, which includes PGD for alpha-thalassaemia,
   resulting in 53 clinical pregnancies and birth of 45 healthy children,
   with five still ongoing. Fifty-four of these cycles were performed in
   combination with HLA typing, allowing the birth of thalassaemia-free
   children who were also HLA identical to the affected sibling, with
   successful stem cell transplantation in one case. As an increasing
   proportion of patients requesting PGD with HLA typing are of advanced
   reproductive age, aneuploidy testing was performed simultaneously with
   PGD. The results show that PGD has now become a practical approach for
   prevention of haemoglobin disorders, and is gradually being used also
   for improving access to HLA compatible stem cell transplantation for
   this group of diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Performance optimization is a critical step in the design of integrated

   becomes more pronounced. Changing the relative signal arrival times
   (RSATs) alters the victim line delay due to the varying coupling noise
   on the victim line. The authors propose a sensitivity-based method to
   analyze delay uncertainties of coupled interconnects due to uncertain
   signal arrival times at its inputs. Compared to existing methods of
   analyzing delay uncertainties of coupled interconnects, the simulation
   results show that the proposed method strikes a good balance between

Abstract = {{Background: The deficiency of factor VIII, a co-factor in the intrinsic
   coagulation pathway results in hemophilia A. Although FVIII is
   synthesized largely in the liver, the specific liver cell type(s)
   responsible for FVIII production is controversial. Objective: This study
   aimed to determine the cellular origin of FVIII synthesis and release in
   mouse models. Methods: We transplanted cells into the peritoneal cavity
   of hemophilia A knockout mice. Plasma FVIII activity was measured using
   a Chromogenix assay 2-7 days after cell transplantation, and phenotypic
   correction was determined with tail-clip challenge 7 days following cell
   transplantation. Transplanted cells were identified by histologic and
   molecular assays. Results: Untreated hemophilia A mice, as well as mice
   treated with the hepatocyte-enriched fraction, showed extensive
   mortality following tail-clip challenge. In contrast, recipients of
   unfractionated liver cells (mixture of hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal
   endothelial cells (LSEC), Kupffer cells, and hepatic stellate cells) or
   of the cell fraction enriched in LSECs survived tail-clip challenge (P <
   0.001). FVIII was secreted in the blood stream in recipients of
   unfractionated liver cells, LSECs and pancreatic islet-derived MILE SVEN
   1 (MS 1) endothelial cells. Although transplanted hepatocytes maintained
   functional integrity in the peritoneal cavity, these cells did not
   produce detectable plasma FVIII activity. Conclusions: The assay of cell
   transplantation in the peritoneal cavity showed that endothelial cells
   but not hepatocytes produced phenotypic correction in hemophilia A mice.
   Therefore, endothelial cells should be suitable additional targets for
   cell and gene therapy in hemophilia A.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To explore the utility of end-tidal capnography for
   predicting hospitalization in acute childhood asthma.
   Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective cohort study of a
   convenience sample of children 5 to 17 years of age presenting to a
   pediatric emergency department with an acute asthma exacerbation.
   Capnography was performed at baseline. The length of the plateau portion
   of the baseline capnograph waveform was measured in millimeters and
   divided by the respiratory rate at the time of the measurement to create
   a ratio. The sensitivity and specificity of the baseline capnography
   ratio for predicting hospitalization were assessed.
   Main Outcome Measures: Hospitalization versus discharge from, the
   pediatric emergency department.
   Results: Thirty-seven patients were enrolled. The hospitalized (n=12)
   and discharged (n = 25) groups did not differ in terms of any
   demographic or baseline characteristics except for pulmonary score and
   the median baseline capnography ratio. The median ratio was 0.15. Ten
   (83.3\%) of 12 of patients who were hospitalized had a baseline ratio
   less than 0.15 compared with 8 (32\%) of 25 of patients who were
   discharged from pediatric emergency department (P < 0.05). Controlling
   for baseline asthma severity, the odds of being hospitalized if the
   baseline capnography ratio was less than 0.15 were 18.77 (95\%
   confidence interval, 1.91-184.69).
   Conclusion: This pilot study suggests that baseline capnography may be
   useful as an objective effort-independent tool for identifying children
   with an asthma exacerbation who are at risk for hospitalization.}},

Abstract = {{Tropical ecosystems have a great organismal diversity. However, the
   trophic relations of many components are poorly understood and this is
   particularly the case for caecilian amphibians. We analysed spatial and
   temporal aspects of the diet of a caecilian (Ichthyophis cf.
   kohtaoensis) at a field site in North-eastern Thailand (Mekong valley,
   Khemmarat District, Ubon Ratchathani Province). This is the first study
   to include both aquatic larvae and terrestrial adult stages of any
   caecilian. Larval L cf. kohtaoensis feed exclusively on aquatic
   invertebrates (e.g., dragonfly larvae, water beetles and clam shrimps).
   A comparison of potential prey taxa available indicates that larval L
   cf. kohtoensis prefer benthic prey. Terrestrial L cf. kohtaoensis
   consume mostly soil invertebrates such as megascolecid earthworms, ants
   and termites (soil ecosystem engineers). Numerically and in terms of
   their frequency of occurrence, these major prey groups varied strongly
   between seasons. Scarabaeid beetle larvae, oribatid and mesostigmatid
   mites and occasionally microhylid frogs were also recorded in the diet.
   During ontogeny, L cf. kohtaoensis move from an aquatic to terrestrial
   existence. Despite this, accompanying changes in trophic position are
   superficial because both stages are carnivorous generalists. In this
   regard, they are more similar to salamanders than frogs with biphasic
   life history cycles. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{One major objective of this work is to experimentally estimate the
   following kinetic parameters on the IPEN/MB-01 research reactor at Sao
   Paulo: the effective neutron delayed fraction, beta(efj), the prompt
   neutron generation time, A, and the ratio beta(efj)/Lambda. In order to
   achieve our goal, we will use a microscopic noise technique called
   Rossi-alpha method. This method is based on the statistical nature of
   the fission-chain process. Using a coincidence acquisition system, the
   rationale is to experimentally determine the probability distribution of
   detecting neutrons from the same chain. Through a least-squares fit of
   this distribution we estimate the prompt neutron decay constant alpha =
   (beta(efj) - rho)/Lambda. The alpha parameter will be measured for three
   sub-critical levels using three different source configurations, and the
   ratio beta(efj)/Lambda is obtained via a extrapolation to rho = 0. A
   specific acquisition system for Rossi-alpha measurements has been
   developed in order to achieve our objective. This system is based on a
   multichannel scaler controlled by virtual instruments that records the
   timing of all neutron events, allowing data analysis during the
   acquisition. The first measurements were performed using two BF3
   detectors positioned at the center of IPEN/MB-01 reactor core. In the
   future the same measurements described above will be performed using
   He-3 and photodiode detectors. The photodiode detectors have been
   developed by the Reactor Physics Division of IPEN. In this work we will
   present a preliminary set of Rossi-alpha measurements performed on the

Abstract = {{Results from a model of wind-driven circulation are analyzed to study
   spatial and temporal variability in the bottom mixed layer (BML) on the
   mid-Oregon shelf in summer 2001. The model assimilates acoustic Doppler
   profiler velocities from two cross-shore lines of moorings 90 km apart
   to provide improved accuracy of near-bottom velocities and turbulence
   variables in the area between the mooring lines. Model results suggest
   that the response of the BML thickness to upwelling- and
   downwelling-favorable winds differs qualitatively between an area of
   ``simple{''} bathymetric slope at 45 degrees N and a wider shelf area
   east of Stonewall Bank (44.5 degrees N). At 45 degrees N, the BML grows
   in response to downwelling-favorable conditions, in agreement with known
   theories. East of Stonewall Bank, the BML thickness is increased
   following upwelling events. In this area, the southward upwelling jet
   detaches from the coast and flows over a wider part of the Oregon shelf,
   creating conditions for Ekman pumping near the bottom. Based on
   computations of bottom stress curl, the vertical pumping velocity in
   this area may reach 15 m day(-1) following periods of intensified
   upwelling-favorable winds. A column of denser, near-bottom water
   upwelled over the Ekman flow convergence area is tilted as a result of
   vertical shear in horizontal velocities, causing unstable stratification
   and convective overturning. As a result of this process, BML thickness
   values east of Stonewall Bank can be in excess of 20 m following
   upwelling, comparable to maximum values at 45 degrees N following
   downwelling.}},

Abstract = {{Proteolytic cleavage of extracellular matrix (ECM) is a critical feature
   of tumor cell invasion, and affects cancer cell growth, differentiation,
   apoptosis, and migration. Malignant cells secrete most proteases as
   inactive proenzymes that undergo proteolytic cleavage for activation,
   and proteolytic activity is elevated in close proximity to these cells.
   Therefore, local activity rather than protease concentration determines
   ECM proteolysis. Precise quantification of local proteolytic activity,
   functional investigation, and high resolution imaging of morphological
   ECM alterations have proven difficult. In this study, we present a novel
   approach for measuring proteolytic activity in the microenvironment of
   cells by using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Amelanotic melanoma cells
   W-clone) were seeded on fluorescent gelatin or collagen-IV coatings.
   Proteolysis reduced fluorescence of these coatings. Fluorescence
   microscopy (FM) in combination with AFM was used to maneuver the AFM-tip
   to tumor cell induced proteolytic spots. AFM enabled nanoscale volume
   measurement, three-dimensional reconstruction of single proteins and
   demonstrated that ECM cleavage is restricted to the proteolytic
   microenvironment of cancer cells. This method detected significant
   decreases in molecular weight of protein clusters (-76.6\%),
   matrixvolume (-46.6\%), and height (-38.1\%) between intactand
   proteolyzed gelatin. Similar parameter changes were demonstrated without
   FM, by AFM-scanning gelatin in close proximity to invasive cells.
   Furthermore, AFM depicted significantly stronger local degradation of
   gelatin than collagen-IV by A7-cells. Taken together, AFM allows
   specific quantification and imaging of local proteolytic processes at a
   nanometer level, thus providing a unique method for the functional
   evaluation of invasiveness and metastatic potential of tumor cells in
   small scale samples.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and
   efficacy of thoracoscopic sympathectomy for the treatment of
   hyperhidrosis, blushing, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, and digital
   ischemia.
   Methods. We conducted a retrospective review of 202 patients who
   underwent thoracoscopic sympathectomy at the University of Maryland from
   March 1992 to April 2003.
   Results. Three hundred ninety-seven procedures were performed on 202
   patients (105 women, 97 men). Mean age was 29 years (range, 9 to 65).
   Indications for surgery included hyperhidrosis, facial blushing, digital
   ischemia, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Synchronous bilateral
   sympathectomies were performed in 194 patients; right side alone (n =
   6); left side alone (n = 1); 1 patient had staged bilateral
   sympathectomies. Single incision with lung isolation technique was used.
   There was no mortality. Preoperative symptoms resolved completely or
   significantly improved in greater than 90\% of patients. One patient
   with reflex sympathetic dystrophy recurred and 1 patient with
   hyperhidrosis complained of significant compensatory sweating.
   Compensatory sweating to a lesser degree occurred in approximately one
   third of patients. Complications included asymptomatic pleural effusion
   (n = 1), pneumothorax (n = 1), and reoperation for chylothorax that was
   identified early (n = 1). In 2 patients treated for facial blushing,
   Horner's syndrome developed postoperatively; 1 of them subsequently
   underwent blepharoplasty. In 3 patients, hyperesthesias developed at the
   incision.
   Conclusions. Thoracoscopic sympathectomy can be performed safely and
   with excellent results. Compensatory sweating is the main side effect,
   although significant complaints from this are rare. Horner's syndrome
   remains an extremely uncommon complication as a result of thoracoscopic
   sympathectomy at our institution.}},

Abstract = {{Aqueous Laponite dispersions containing a sodium polyacrylate were
   analyzed, at fixed ionic strength and pH, by rheometric and
   electroacoustic (for zeta-potential determinations) techniques at 7 days
   after their preparation. The rheological behavior of these dispersions
   was determined by oscillatory and flow experiments. Addition of sodium
   polyacrylate modifies the interactions between Laponite particles and
   therefore the physical state of the dispersion. The phase diagram of
   Laponite dispersion as a function of sodium polyacrylate concentration
   shows different sol-gel transitions for a specific Laponite
   concentration as a function of the polyacrylate concentration. Under
   equilibrium flow conditions the Laponite dispersions fit the
   pseudoplastic Oswald-de Waele power law model. At the same time, these
   dispersions show thixotropy, which was analyzed using a second-order
   kinetic equation. The kinetic processes were characterized by breakdown
   and build-up parameters, which were found to depend on shear rate. This
   kinetic equation was modified by a power law exponent of viscosity with
   shear rate that takes into account the viscosity variations when the
   shear rates are suddenly changed, in order to fit the hysteresis loops.

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{222}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{91-97}},

Abstract = {{Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs, EC 2.5.1.18) are a family of
   multi-functional enzymes involved in biodegradation of several herbicide
   classes. The ability of the maize isoenzyme GST I to detoxify from the
   acetanilide herbicide alachlor was investigated by steady-state kinetics
   and site-directed mutagenesis studies. Steady-state kinetics fit well to
   a rapid equilibrium random sequential bi-bi mechanism with intrasubunit
   modulation between GSH binding site (G-site) and electrophile binding
   site (H-site). The rate-limiting step of the reaction is
   viscosity-dependent and thermodynamic data suggest that product release
   is rate-limiting. Three residues of GST I (Trp12, Phe35 and Ile118),
   which build up the xenobiotic binding site, were mutated and their
   functional and structural roles during alachlor conjugation were
   investigated. These residues are not conserved, hence may affect
   substrate specificity and/or product dissociation. The work showed that
   the key amino acid residue Phe35 modulates xenobiotic substrate binding
   and specificity, and participates in k(cat) regulation by affecting the
   rate-limiting step of the catalytic reaction. Trp12 and Ile118 do not
   seem to carry out such functions but instead, regulate the K-m for
   alachlor by contributing to its productive orientation in the H-site.
   The results of the present work have practical significance since this
   may provide the basis for the rational design of new engineered GSTs
   with altered substrate specificity towards herbicides and may facilitate
   the design of new, more selective herbicides.}},

Abstract = {{Enterobacter sp. strain D1 is a facultative anaerobic, Gram-negative
   heterotrophic bacterium isolated from toxaphene-contaminated soil. This
   organism was identified and characterized through phylogenetic and
   taxonomic studies. Based on 16S rDNA analysis, the strain D1 was
   clustered closely with the species Enterobacter cloacae subsp.
   dissolvens (LMG 2683) and E cloacae (ATCC 13047(T)). Strain D1 resembled
   these E cloacae strains with respect to various biochemical and
   nutritional characteristics, but also exhibited differences. Moreover,
   strain D1 is able to grow and survive with toxaphene supplied in the
   medium in the range 3-96mg/L. Amongst the chemical components of
   toxaphene, octachlorocamphenes, nonachlorobornanes and
   decachlorobornanes were seen to be rapidly metabolized, although levels
   of hexachlorocamphenes and heptachlorobornanes were found to be slowly
   degraded, and subsequently accumulated during the last stage of the
   cultivation. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A large dataset of aircraft cloud traverses from the Small Cumulus
   Microphysics Study (SCMS) was used to add to the existing knowledge of
   humidity halo characteristics for small cumulus clouds in a tropical

   the radial direction with respect to shear, humidity halos were observed
   with a frequency of 77\%-90\%. The difference in frequency of halo
   occurrences between upshear and downshear regions was much smaller than
   previously reported observations. These findings likely resulted from
   the absence of a strong vertical wind shear environment.
   SCMS cumuli had a mean cloud diameter (i.e., in-cloud traverse distance)
   of 1.1 km and mean halo lengths of about 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 cloud radii
   for upshear, cross-shear, and downshear regions, respectively. Humidity
   halos of less than one cloud radius were observed during about 70\% of
   SCMS aircraft traverses. Approximately 98\% of humidity halos had radial
   lengths of less than four cloud radii. Although considerable differences
   were not observed between upshear and downshear halo lengths for clouds
   of similar age, large increases in the frequency and length of halos
   occurred with an increase in cloud age.}},

Abstract = {{Dementia with argyroprinic grains (AG) is a neuropatholically defined
   potentially dementing disease of advanced age which was first described
   by H. and E. Braak in 1987. It is often combined with histopathological
   signs of Alzheimer's disease but has nevertheless to be considered as a
   distinct entity since pure bona fide cases have been reported.
   Clinically it may resemble either Alzheimer's or Pick's disease; it is
   almost exclusively confined to patients older than 60 years and
   progresses slowly but relentlessly. Repeatedly prominent behavioral
   disorders were pointed out. Useful therapeutic regimens are not
   available at present but acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have proven
   effective in some cases and amantadines as well as dopamine agonists
   hold some promise from a theoretical perspective, too. The diagnosis can
   be ascertained only by histopathological examination. For the clinician
   it is important to know that this disease is to be considered as an
   additional and differential diagnosis of both Alzheimer's disease and
   the frontotemporal dementias. It must be counted among the tauopathies.
   This review is supplemented by a detailed case report.}},

Abstract = {{The mid to late-Holocene climates of most of Scotland have been
   reconstructed from seven peat bogs located across north-south and
   east-west geographical and climatological gradients. The main techniques
   used for palaeoclimatic reconstruction were plant macrofossil,
   colorimetric humification, and testate amoebae analyses, which were
   supported by a radiocarbon-based chronology, aided by markers such as
   tephra isochrons and recent rises in pine pollen and in spheroidal
   carbonaceous particles (SCPs). Field stratigraphy was undertaken at each
   site in order to show that the changes detected within the peat profiles
   were replicable. Proxy climate records were reconstructed using
   detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) of the plant rnacrofossil data
   and a mean water table depth transfer function on the testate amoebae
   data. These reconstructions, coupled with the humification data, were
   standardised for each site and used to produce a composite record of bog
   surface wetness (BSW) from each site. The results show coherent wet and
   dry phases over the last 5000 years and suggest regional differences in
   climate across Scotland, specifically between northern and southern
   Scotland. Distinct climatic cycles are identified, all of which record a
   millennial-scale periodicity which can be correlated with previously
   identified marine and ice core Holocene cycles. The key role of the
   macrofossil remains of Sphagnum imbricatum, a taxon now extinct on many
   sites, is discussed in relation to the identified climatic shifts.

Abstract = {{Dielectrophoresis (DEP), the motion of a particle caused by an applied
   electric field gradient, can concentrate microorganisms
   non-destructively. In insulator-based dielectrophoresis (iDEP)
   insulating microstructurres produce non-uniform electric fields to drive
   DEP in microsystems. This article describes the performance of an iDEP
   device in removing and concentrating bacterial cells, spores and viruses
   while operated with a DC applied electric field and pressure gradient.
   Such a device can selectively trap particles when dielectrophoresis
   overcomes electrokinesis or advection. The dielectrophoretic trapping
   behavior of labeled microorganisms in a glass-etched DEP device was
   observed over a wide range of DC applied electric fields. When fields
   higher than a particle-specific threshold are applied, particles are
   reversibly trapped in the device. Experiments with Bacillus subtilis
   spores and the Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) exhibited higher trapping
   thresholds than those of bacterial cells. The iDEP device was
   characterized in terms of concentration factor and removal efficiency.
   Under the experimental conditions used in this study with an initial
   dilution of I X 105 cells/ml, concentration factors of the order of
   3000x and removal efficiencies approaching 100\% were observed with
   Escherichia coli cells. These results are the first characterization of
   an DEP device for the concentration and removal of microbes in water.

Abstract = {{To better explain resistance to information technology implementation,
   we used a multilevel, longitudinal approach. We first assessed extant
   models of resistance to IT Using semantic analysis, we identified five
   basic components of resistance: behaviors, object, subject, threats, and
   initial conditions. We further examined extant models to (1) carry out a
   preliminary specification of the nature of the relationships between
   these components and (2) refine our understanding of the multilevel
   nature of the phenomenon. Using analytic induction, we examined data
   from three case studies of clinical information systems implementations
   in hospital settings, focusing on physicians' resistance behaviors. The
   resulting mixed determinants model suggests that group resistance
   behaviors vary during implementation. When a system is introduced, users
   in a group will first assess it in terms of the interplay between its
   features and individual and/or organizational-level initial conditions.
   They then make projections about the consequences of its use. If
   expected consequences are threatening, resistance behaviors will result
   During implementation, should some trigger occur to either modify or
   activate an initial condition involving the balance of power between the
   group and other user groups, it will also Modify the object of
   resistance, from system to system significance. If the relevant initial
   conditions pertain, to the power of the resisting group vis-a-Vis the
   system advocates, the object of resistance will also be modified, from
   system significance to system advocates. Resistance behaviors will
   follow if threats are perceived from the interaction between the object
   of resistance and initial conditions. We also found that the bottom-up
   process by which group resistance behaviors emerge from individual
   behaviors is not the same in early versus late implementation. In early
   implementation, the emergence process is one of compilation, described

Abstract = {{Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) has become the
   technology of choice for bioanalysis, due to its high selectivity and
   high sample throughput. However, concerns have grown that this technique
   may be subject to errors due to ``invisible{''} interferences, in
   particular ion-suppression. Investigations on ion-suppression from
   formulation agents have only been published to a limited extent. Such
   effects can be of particular importance in pre-clinical discovery
   studies where drugs may be formulated with large amount of solubilisers
   and bioanalysis may use fast generic methods. In a preliminary
   pharmacokinetic study we observed strong ion-suppression from a
   polysorbate co-solvent, which, if undetected, would have given highly
   erroneous pharmacokinetic results and possibly could have led to the
   inappropriate elimination of a promising drug candidate. Different
   chromatographic methods were tested indicating that the separation step
   was essential in controlling these effects. A method based on matrix
   dilution is proposed to check for these effects during the use of
   discovery support methods, where full validation is not practical. Some
   excipients commonly used in formulations are polydispersed polymers, for
   which very limited pharmacokinetic information is available. Further
   investigation is needed to better understand the mechanisms of
   ion-suppression and the kinetics of the suppressing species to allow the
   development of new LC/MS/MS based analytical strategies, which will not
   be subject to such ionisation interferences. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{During embryogenesis, vascular and hemopoietic cells originate from a
   common precursor, the hemangioblast. Recent evidence suggests the
   existence of endothelial precursors in adult bone marrow cells, but it
   is unclear whether those precursors have a role in tumor
   neovascularization. In this report, we demonstrate that murine bone
   marrow contains endothelial progenitors, which arise from a cell with
   self-renewing capacity, and can integrate into tumor microvasculature,
   albeit at a very low frequency. A transgenic double-reporter strategy
   allowed us to demonstrate definitively that tumor bone marrow-derived
   endothelial cells arise by transdifferentiation of marrow progenitors
   rather than by cell fusion. Single cell transplants showed that a common
   precursor contributes to both the hemopoietic and endothelial lineages,
   thus demonstrating the presence of an adult hemangioblast. Furthermore,
   we demonstrate that increased vascular endothelial growth factor
   (VEGF)-A secretion by tumor cells, as well as activation of VEGF
   receptor-2 in bone marrow cells does not alter the mobilization and
   incorporation of marrow-derived endothelial progenitors into tumor
   vasculature. Finally, in human umbilical cord blood cells, we show that
   endothelial precursors make up only similar to 1 in 10(7) mononuclear
   cells but are highly enriched in the CD133(+) cell population. By ruling
   out cell fusion, we clearly demonstrate the existence of an adult
   hemangioblast, but the differentiation of marrow stem cells toward the
   endothelial lineage is an extremely rare event. Furthermore, we show
   that VEGF-A stimulation of hemopoietic cells does not significantly
   alter this process.}},

Abstract = {{Familial tumoral calcinosis (TC, OMIM 211900) is a heritable disorder
   characterized by hyperphosphatemia, normal or elevated serum
   1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and often severe ectopic calcifications. Two
   recessive mutations in fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23), serine
   71/glycine (S71G) and serine 129/phenylalanine (S129F), were identified
   as causing TC. Herein, we undertook comprehensive biochemical analyses
   of an extended TC family carrying the S71G FGF23 mutation, which
   revealed that heterozygous (serine/ glycine, S/G) individuals had
   elevated serum FGF23 C-terminal fragments compared with wild-type
   (serine/serine, S/S) family members (P < 0.025). To understand the
   differential processing of FGF23 in TC patients, we transiently
   expressed S71G as well as S129F FGF23. FGF23 ELISA in tandem with
   Western analyses revealed increased proteolytic cleavage of mutant FGF23
   and a limited secretion of intact protein. Furthermore, S71G and S129F
   FGF23 carrying mutations that disrupt the furin-like protease RXXR motif
   in FGF23 rescued the secretion of the intact protein, and both TC mutant
   proteins harboring the R176Q mutation revealed no altered sensitivity to
   trypsin compared with the native (R176Q) FGF23. Finally, S71G, but not
   S129F mutant FGF23, is rescued by temperature. In summary, FGF23
   mutations causing TC lead to increased intracellular proteolysis of
   FGF23, most likely by furin-like proteases, due to conformational
   changes of the mutant protein. The destabilizing nature of these
   mutations provides new insight into the pathophysiology of TC and
   exemplifies the physiological importance of FGF23 in phosphate and
   vitamin D metabolism.}},

Abstract = {{Resting oxygen consumption and energy expenditure is sensitive to slight
   alterations in thyroid function. This means that timing and magnitude of
   cold adaptation would to some extent depend on thyroid function. Local
   thyroid hormone metabolism is important for energy expenditure and
   dissipation of heat in special tissues. Recruitment of brown adipocytes
   and upregulation of uncoupling protein 1 in mitochondria depends on high
   tissue T-3 concentrations. Most of this T-3 is derived from local 5'
   deiodination of T-4. Brown fat is vital for cold exposed mice and rats,
   and may be important for temperature adaptation in human neonates. The
   role of thyroid hormone metabolism in adult human cold adaptation has
   not been finally clarified. Hypothetically, cold exposure may enhance
   T-3 production by deiodination of T-4 in skeletal muscle, which may
   enhance heat production in muscle via a change in muscle fiber type.
   Another hypothetical possibility is recruitment of brown adipocytes
   embedded in white adipose tissue in human adults. Understanding cold
   adaptation in human adults may lead to development of new drugs against

   spectrometry (MALDI MS) can detect substantial changes in expression of
   proteins in tissues, such as cancer cells. A more challenging problem is
   detecting the smaller changes expected in normal development or complex
   diseases. Here we address methodological issues regarding the
   acquisition and analysis of MALDI MS data from tissue sections, in a
   study of mouse cerebellum at different stages of development. Sections
   of the cerebellar cortex were analyzed at the peak of granule neuron
   production {[}postnatal day (P) 7], during synapse formation (P14), and
   in adults. Data were acquired (VoyagerDE (TM) STR Biospectrometry
   Workstation; seven acquisitions of 50 shots per section, 3.5-50 kDa),
   preprocessed (Data Explorer 4.3), and averaged. Among 846 peaks
   detected, in at least 50\% of at least one group, 122 showed significant
   group differences (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA) after Bonferroni correction.
   Factor analyses revealed two age-related factors, possibly reflecting
   gradients of expression during development. Predictive analysis of
   microarrays generated a model from half of the sample that correctly
   predicted developmental groups for the second half. Intraclass
   correlation coefficients, measuring within-mouse consistency of peak
   heights from three tissue sections, were acceptable at lower m/z and for
   larger peaks at higher m/z. Low mass was the best predictor of
   significant group differences. The analysis demonstrates that MALDI MS
   of normal tissue sections at different ages can detect consistent,
   significant group differences. Further work is needed to increase the
   sensitivity of the methods and to apply them reliably to brain regions
   and to subproteomes with relevance to diverse brain functions and
   diseases. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The case of conversions in Assembly of God churches in Burkina Faso is
   typical of the identity tinkering which is now going on in West African
   societies. Through individual conversion experiences, this particular
   variant of Christianity ends up playing the role of the group that makes
   one leave one's original group. Conversion thus constitutes a break
   which allows one to dare to transgress normal boundaries. In the context
   of a modernity beset by unaccastomed fears and doubts, religious
   allegiances often prove to be complex acts of identity bricolage, (1)
   which even involve a second level of construction, that of an identity
   which is specifically constructed to defend me against another who is
   persecuting me.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{24}},

Pages = {{519-533}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the notion of the probability of bit error (PBE)
   and its distribution in chaos-based communication systems; these are
   seen as being the fundamental quantities to both the well-known bit
   error rate (BER) and the new concept in chaos communications of bit
   outage rate (BOR). The form of the distribution illustrates the degree
   to which bit error rate is a stable representation of performance. Bit
   outage rate is another measure of performance which gives practically
   helpful information about bit error. For a simple coherent
   chaos-shift-keying system the distribution of bit error probability is
   derived exactly, and theoretically exact formulas for the bit outage
   rate and bit error rate are presented. Two specific cases are developed
   to obtain useful qualitative and quantitative information. The cases
   concern independent Gaussian spreading, as a lower benchmark and
   logistic map spreading, as typical of effective chaotic spreading.
   Comparisons are obtained between these spreading distributions and
   between different extents of their spreading, calibrated against per bit
   signal to noise ratio. A general conclusion is that bit outage and bit
   error rates are complementary measures of performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the evolution of the clustering of the main
   population of galaxies from z similar or equal to 2 to z = 0.2, from the
   first epoch VIMOS VLT Deep Survey (VVDS), a magnitude limited sample
   with 17.5 <= I-AB <= 24. The sample allows a direct estimate of
   evolution from within the same survey over the time base sampled. We
   have computed the correlation functions xi(r(p), pi) and w(p)(r(p)), and
   the correlation length r(0)(z), for the VVDS-02h and VVDS-CDFS fields,
   for a total of 7155 galaxies in a 0.61 deg(2) area. We find that the
   correlation length in this sample slightly increases from z = 0.5 to z =
   1.1, with r0( z) = 2.2-2.9 h(-1) Mpc (comoving), for galaxies comparable
   in luminosity to the local 2dFGRS and SDSS samples, indicating that the
   amplitude of the correlation function was similar or equal to 2.5 times
   lower at z similar or equal to 1 than observed locally. The correlation
   length in our lowest redshift bin z = {[}0.2, 0.5] is r(0) = 2.2 h(-1)
   Mpc, lower than for any other population at the same redshift,
   indicating the low clustering of very low luminosity galaxies, 1.5 mag
   fainter than in the 2dFGRS or SDSS. The correlation length increases to
   r(0) similar to 3.6 h(-1) Mpc at higher redshifts z = {[}1.3, 2.1], as
   we are observing increasingly brighter galaxies, comparable to galaxies
   with MBAB = - 20.5 locally. We compare our measurement to the DEEP2
   measurements in the range z = {[}0.7, 1.35] (Coil et al. 2004, ApJ, in
   press) and find comparable results when applying the same magnitude and
   color selection criteria as in their survey. The slowly varying
   clustering of VVDS galaxies as redshift increases is markedly different
   from the predicted evolution of the clustering of dark matter,
   indicating that bright galaxies traced higher density peaks when the
   large scale structures were emerging from the dark matter distribution 9
   - 10 billion years ago, being supporting evidence for a strong evolution
   of the galaxy vs. dark matter bias.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Multiple pituitary hormone deficiency (MPHD) may result from
   defects of transcription factors that govern early pituitary
   development. We aimed to establish the prevalence of HESX1, PROP 1, and
   POU1F1 gene defects in a population-based cohort of patients with MPHD
   and to analyse the phenotype of affected individuals.
   Design and methods: Genomic analysis was carried out on 74 children and
   adults with MPHD from the Czech Republic (including four sibling pairs).
   Phenotypic data were collected from medical records and referring
   physicians.
   Results: One patient carried a heterozygous mutation of POU1F1 (71C >
   T), and 18 patients (including three sibling pairs) had a PROP1 mutation
   (genotypes 150delA/30ldelGA/9/, 301delGA/301delGA/8/, or 301delGA/349T >
   A/1/). A detailed longitudinal phenotypic analysis was performed for
   patients with PROP1 mutations (n = 17). The mean (+/- S.D.) birth length
   SDS of these patients (0.12 +/- 0.76) was lower than expected based on
   their mean (+/-S.D.) birth weight SDS (0.63+/- 1.27; P=0.01). Parental
   heights were normal. The patients' mean (+/-S.D.) height SDS declined to
   - 1.5+/-0.9, - 3.6+/- 1.3 and -4.1 +/- 1.2 at 1.5, 3 and 5 years of age,
   respectively. GH therapy, initiated at 6.8 +/- 3.2 years of age (mean
   dose: 0.022 mg/kg per day), led to substantial growth acceleration in
   all patients. Mean adult height (n = 7) was normal when adjusted for
   mid-parental height. ACTH deficiency developed in two out of seven young
   adult patients.
   Conclusions: PROP1 defects are a prevalent cause of MPHD. We suggest
   that testing for PROP1 mutations in patients with MPHD might become
   standard practice in order to predict risk of additional pituitary
   hormone deficiencies.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To determine and define the beneficial effects of
   heliox-driven albuterol therapy on severe asthma exacerbation and
   clinical factors that affect greater response. Methods: The authors
   conducted two randomized, double-blinded, controlled trials in patients
   with severe asthma exacerbation. The first trial recruited 80 patients
   in the emergency department (ED). They received three consecutive doses
   of albuterol delivered by a nebulizer powered by either 02 (02 group) or
   heliox (He/O-2 = 80:20; heliox group). Changes in peak expiratory flow
   rate (PEF) were compared, and factors influencing the response to
   heliox-driven albuterol therapy were identified. The second trial of 80
   patients was conducted in older patients, a subpopulation associated
   with greater response in the first trial. Results: In the first trial,
   the heliox group had more rapid and greater improvement in PEF compared
   with the 02 group. There tended to be more patients in the heliox group
   reaching the predetermined dischargeable PEF (> 60\% predicted) after
   three albuterol treatments (odds ratio, 2.58; 95\% confidence interval =
   1.03 to 6.46; p = 0.069). For patients eventually discharged from the
   ED, the ED stay was shorter by 10 minutes per patient in the heliox
   group compared with the 02 group (p = 0.007). Logistic regression showed
   older age and lower pretreatment PEF to be associated with favorable
   heliox responses. The second trial, which recruited older patients
   (older than 40 years), showed greater improvement in PEF and dyspnea
   score with heliox-driven albuterol therapy in patients with lower
   pretreatment PEF. Conclusions: Heliox-driven albuterol may be a useful
   adjunct therapy for older asthmatic patients with severe asthma
   exacerbation.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine the benefits and risks of
   humeral lengthening procedures. Distraction osteogenesis was performed
   in 19 humeri on 16 patients (9 males, 7 females). The mean age at the
   time of lengthening was 11.5 years (range 3-24 years) and average
   follow-up was 8.7 years (range 2-21 years). Etiologies for short humeri
   included infection in six patients, congenital anomaly in six patients,
   unicameral bone cysts involving the physis in five patients, and
   posttraumatic growth disturbance in two patients. The average
   lengthening was 5 cm. The benefits from humeral lengthening include
   increased performance in daily activities, improved sports performance,
   and significantly better self-image. Complications included temporary
   radial nerve palsy in three cases, drainage from the pin tracts in two
   cases, elbow flexion contracture in three cases, and late humerus
   fracture in two cases. All the complications resolved over time and did
   not affect the outcome. Eleven lengthening procedures were not
   associated with any complications. Although the humerus is surrounded by
   complex neurovascular structures and muscles, humerus lengthening
   provided satisfactory results with temporary minor complications.}},

Abstract = {{The antioxidative capacity of two lactic acid bacteria isolated from
   Kimchi, a Korean fermented food, was evaluated by measuring the
   resistance to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and compared with that of
   Lactobacillits rhamnosus GG as a positive control. Both intact cells and
   cell-free extracts of Lactobacillus plantartan KCTC 3099 exhibited
   higher antioxidative activity in inhibiting lipid peroxidation among the
   strains evaluated with an inhibitory level of 38.6\% and 48.5\%,
   respectively. To evaluate the resistance of the two lactic acid bacteria
   to ROS, we tested their survival in the presence of I mM hydrogen
   peroxide, 0.4 mM hydroxyl radicals, and superoxide anions induced by 10
   mM paraquat. L. plantarum KCTC 3099 was viable even after 8 hours in the
   presence of both I mM hydrogen peroxide and 0.4 mM hydroxyl radicals.
   Moreover. the survival of L. plantarum KCTC 3099 was not affected by
   superoxide anions generated by using paraquat, indicating that it has
   resistance to superoxide anions. To define the antioxidative mechanism,
   superoxide dismutase (SOD) and metal ion chelating activities were
   determined. L. plantarton KCTC 3099 presented little SOD activity, but
   had the higher level of chelatinc, activity for both Fe2+ CU2+ C and
   metal ions at 13.6 ppm and 23.9 ppm, respectively. These results
   suggested that the antioxidative capacity of L. plantarton KCTC 3099 is
   apparently caused by chelating metal ions rather than by SOD activation.}},

Abstract = {{In 1998 we installed five creepmeters across the Chihshang Fault, the
   active plate suture in eastern Taiwan. Daily creepmeter data indicated
   decreasing creeping rate from 1999 to 2003, suggesting increasing
   seismic hazard. The fault was ruptured by the Chengkung earthquake (Mw =
   6.6) on 10 December 2003. Through extrapolation of our earlier creep
   data of 1986-1991 and 1992-1997, we evaluate the minimum deficit in
   aseismic creep shortening as 106 or 46 mm (respectively) before this
   earthquake. The near-surface co-seismic shortening was limited, but the
   total shortening resulting from the earthquake, including post-seismic
   creep, was about 97 mm. This suggests that near the surface most of the
   detectable deficit has been absorbed by this earthquake and subsequent
   creep. We thus point out that creepmeter installation and monitoring
   bring a powerful tool in seismic hazard mitigation.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To survey UK urologists and radiation oncologists in the
   evaluation and treatment of localised prostate cancer in the adjuvant
   and salvage setting.
   Methods: Postal questionnaires were mailed to 292 urologists and 98
   radiation oncologists in the UK.
   Results: In all, 188 (48\%) questionnaires were returned. In total,
   72/128 (56\%) of the urologist respondents and 58/60 (97\%) of the
   oncologist respondents perform routine radical prostate treatment. Among
   43 (60\%) of the urologist, 40 (69\%) recommended adjuvant treatment,
   which could be radiotherapy, hormonal treatment or combined hormonal and
   radiation treatment. There is no significant difference between the
   modality of treatment recommended. The poor prognostic factors that
   would influence the decision to offer adjuvant treatment include a
   detectable postoperative PSA, seminal vesicle involvement, positive
   margins, Gleason score >8 and pathological T3. With regard to the choice
   of hormonal treatment, most urologists preferred antiandrogens, whereas
   most oncologists prefer lutienising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH)
   analogue (P=0.03). Regarding salvage treatment, there is a wide
   variation in the PSA threshold and number of PSA rises before initiation
   of investigations and treatment. Significantly more urologists
   recommended salvage radiotherapy (P=0.02), whereas oncologists
   recommended combined hormonal radiation therapy (P=0.03). There is a
   wide variation of practice regarding the duration of hormonal treatment,
   the type of investigations initiated, range of radiotherapy doses and
   treatment volumes.
   Conclusion: There is a wide variation in practice among UK clinicians.}},

Abstract = {{Angiogenesis plays a key role in promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis.
   Several antiangiogenic factors have been shown to inhibit tumor growth
   in animal models. Understanding their mechanism of action would allow
   for better therapeutic application. 16-kDa prolactin (PRL), a
   NH2-terminal natural breakdown fragment of the intact 23-kDa PRL, exerts
   potent antiangiogenic and antitumor activities. The signaling mechanism
   involved in 16-kDa PRL action in endothelial cells remains unclear. One
   of the actions of 16-kDa PRL is to attenuate the production of nitric
   oxide (NO) through the inhibition of inducible NO synthase (iNOS)
   expression in endothelial cells. To delineate the signaling mechanism
   from 16-kDa PRL, we examined the effect of 16-kDa PRL on interleukin
   IL-1 beta-inducible iNOS expression, which is regulated by two parallel
   pathways, one involving IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) and the other
   nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B). Our studies showed that 16-kDa PRL
   specifically blocked IRF-1 but not NF-kappa B signaling to the iNOS
   promoter. We found that IL-1 beta regulated IRF-1 gene expression
   through stimulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),
   which mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1
   (Statl) serine phosphorylation and Stati nuclear translocation to
   activate the IRF-1 promoter. 16-kDa PRL effectively inhibited lL-1 beta
   inducible p38 MAPK phosphorylation, resulting in blocking Statl serine

Abstract = {{The inhibition of the hydraulic conductivity of individual cortical
   cells (Lp) of young roots of cucumber and figleaf gourd by low root
   temperature (8 degrees C, LRT) was measured using a cell pressure probe.
   When LRT was imposed, the Lp of the two species responded differently.
   Water permeability of cortical cells of chilling-sensitive cucumber
   decreased by a factor of 10, but there was only a small effect in the
   chilling-resistant figleaf gourd. Mechanical stresses (pulses of cell
   turgor pressure) resulted in a similar inhibition for both species by a
   factor of 6.5. When applied at LRT, abscisic acid (ABA) partially or
   even completely reversed the effects of chilling and mechanical stresses
   of both species. At the control temperature of 22 degrees C, 50 mu M of
   the aquaporin (AQP) inhibitor HgCl2 acted on root cells of both species,
   although the effect on root cells of figleaf gourd was small. There was
   no effect of HgCl2, when AQPs were already closed either by LRT or by
   mechanical stress. The effect of mechanical stress (pressure pulses) was
   substantially bigger than that of HgCl2. When AQPs were closed by big
   pulses in the presence of 50 mu M HgCl2, they could be partially
   re-opened in the presence of the inhibitor by applying small pulses,
   suggesting that there are at least two different types of channels
   present, which respond differently to mechanical stress or to the heavy
   metal. The presence of 1 mu M ABA in the root medium prevented the
   effects of LRT and mechanical stress, namely an increase in the
   half-times of water exchange (T-1/2(w) proportional to 1/Lp). In the
   absence of stresses at short T-1/2(w), there was no effect of ABA. It is
   concluded that the responsiveness of AQPs of the two species differs in
   the presence of LRT but not under conditions of mechanical stress. In
   both cases, however, ABA has an ameliorative effect. The results suggest
   that the presence of ABA reduces the activation energy of changes of the
   conformation of AQPs, when switching between open and closed states.
   Mechanisms of the gating of AQP activity by LRT and mechanical stresses
   and the possible role of the stress hormone ABA are discussed.}},

   aneurysm treatment}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1902-1908}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Publication bias and/or true heterogeneity can skew
   aggregate impressions from scientific literature. To better determine
   aggregate measures for unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA) treatment,
   we analyzed adverse outcome rates of surgical clipping and endovascular
   coil embolization.
   METHODS: Two independent reviewers searched MEDLINE for studies
   publishing adverse outcome rates for endovascular coiling and surgical
   clipping between January 1990 and July 2003. Studies were classified as
   single-center, multicenter, or community-based. We defined adverse
   outcome rates as combined all-cause early or in-hospital morbidity and
   mortality. We determined cumulative adverse outcome rates by plotting
   precision measure (sample size) against trial-specific effect (adverse
   outcome rate).
   FINDINGS: We included 4 endovascular coiling multicenter/community-based
   studies (1019 patients) and 13 single-center studies (810 patients) and
   5 surgical clipping multicenter/ community-based studies (10,541
   patients) and 23 single-center studies (1759 patients). Cumulative
   adverse outcome rates for endovascular coiling and surgical clipping
   were 8.8\% (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 7.60\%-10.1\%) and 17.8\%
   (95\% CI 17.2\%-18.6\%).
   INTERPRETATION: Scattergram distribution illustrated the magnitude of
   bias in current literature reporting UIAs. Major parts of the literature
   may have underestimated surgical clipping morbidity and mortality, which
   can be attributed to bias from smaller retrospective studies.
   Neuroradiologic coiling studies were less likely to include factors
   contributing to inaccurate adverse outcome rates.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A recent experimental measurement of the width of a twin wall suggests
   that the wall width can vary considerably as a function of position.
   This contradicts the previously held assumption that the wall width was
   a constant, taking the same value in adjacent walls and in different
   parts of the same wall. We explore the possibility that this variation
   in wall width is the result of the interaction of the order parameter
   with point defects. We do this in the context of a two-dimensional model
   on a square grid in which a continuous order parameter interacts with a
   lattice of Ising spins representing the presence or absence of point
   defects. We show that the key to reproducing the experimentally observed
   range of wall widths lies in two interactions. First, an interaction
   between the order parameter and the point defects causing the
   accumulation of point defects within the wall. Secondly, an interaction
   between point defects causing them to form clusters. When both these
   effects are included, simulations produce distributions of wall widths
   similar to those observed experimentally.}},

Abstract = {{Aims/hypothesis: Obesity increases the risk of developing major diseases
   such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Adipose tissue,
   particularly adipocytes, may play a major role in the development of
   obesity and its comorbidities. The aim of this study was to
   characterise, in adipocytes from obese people, the most differentially
   expressed genes that might be relevant to the development of obesity.
   Methods: We carried out microarray gene profiling of isolated abdominal
   subcutaneous adipocytes from 20 non-obese (BMI 25 +/- 3 kg/m(2)) and 19
   obese (BMI 55 +/- 8 kg/m(2)) non-diabetic Pima Indians using Affymetrix
   HG-U95 GeneChip arrays. After data analyses, we measured the transcript
   levels of selected genes based on their biological functions and
   chromosomal positions using quantitative real-time PCR. Results: The
   most differentially expressed genes in adipocytes of obese individuals
   consisted of 433 upregulated and 244 downregulated genes. Of these, 410
   genes could be classified into 20 functional Gene Ontology categories.
   The analyses indicated that the inflammation/ immune response category
   was over-represented, and that most inflammation-related genes were
   upregulated in adipocytes of obese subjects. Quantitative real-time PCR
   confirmed the transcriptional upregulation of representative
   inflammation-related genes (CCL2 and CCL3) encoding the chemokines
   monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein 1
   alpha. The differential expression levels of eight positional candidate
   genes, including inflammation-related THY1 and C1QTNF5, were also
   confirmed. These genes are located on chromosome 11q22 - q24, a region
   with linkage to obesity in the Pima Indians. Conclusions/interpretation:
   This study provides evidence supporting the active role of mature
   adipocytes in obesity-related inflammation. It also provides potential
   candidate genes for susceptibility to obesity.}},

Abstract = {{Rice grain breakage during milling is a problem in many parts of Asia.
   It has been suggested that nitrogen (N) fertilizer can improve the
   milling quality of rice. Therefore, this study investigates effects of N
   fertilization on grain N concentration, endosperm storage protein
   distribution, and milling quality of rice. Four Thai extra long grain
   commercial rice cultivars (KDML105, KLG1, PTT1, and CNT1) were grown at
   Chiang Mai University in the wet season of 2001 with 0 or 120 kg of N/ha
   at flowering. Anatomical sections showed that there was more storage
   protein accumulated in the lateral regions of polished grain of high N
   concentration than in grain of low N concentration. Percent ( \%)
   unbroken rice was positively correlated with relative abundance of
   storage protein in the Cereal Chem. 82(5): lateral region of the
   endosperm in all cultivars. Applying N increased head rice N
   concentration in all cultivars, whereas \% unbroken rice was increased
   in KLG1 and CNT1. KDML105 cultivar, on the other hand, already had high
   \% unbroken rice and more abundant storage protein in the lateral region
   with the grain of low N concentration. It is hypothesized that high
   density of storage protein in the lateral region of the endosperm
   provides resilience and lessens grain breakage during milling. The
   additional protein may increase hardness in rice grains and thus could
   make the rice more resistant to breakage during milling. Furthermore, N
   fertilization may enhance the nutritional quality of rice grain by
   increasing the glutelin content, which is rich in lysine.}},

Abstract = {{Free monomers including triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) are
   released by resin composite. Recent studies in vitro have demonstrated
   that TEGDMA induced GSH depletion and production of radical oxygen
   species (ROS) in human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) but the exact
   mechanism of these events remains unclear. Our purpose is to investigate
   the origin of ROS production. TEGDMA induces a rapid (within 30 min) and
   drastic depletion of ATP concomitant with the GSH depletion. After 3 It
   incubation, TEGDMA induced an increase of lipid peroxidation associated
   with LDH leakage. Our data also showed that TEGDMA produced damage at
   mitochondrial level. This is demonstrated by the collapse of
   mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in HGF treated with TEGDMA. The
   protective effect of carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), an
   uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation on lipid peroxidation and LDH
   leakage suggests that mitochondria can be implicated in these events.
   Trolox, a soluble derivative of Tocopherol, weakly prevents ATP but not
   GSH depletion and totally protects the cells against lipid peroxidation,
   MMP collapse and cell death. Thus, the present results suggest that
   TEGDMA induces lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial damage, which
   contribute to cell death. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorus (P) leaching from soils with elevated P levels due to manure
   applications is increasingly becoming a concern as a source of
   eutrophication of streams and lakes. This study investigates the
   relationship between organic and inorganic P in soil pools and
   equilibrium leachate along a chronosequence of poultry and dairy manure
   additions in New York state. Resin-extractable P (molybdate-reactive P,
   RP) and total soil P reached very high levels of 2330 and 7343 mg of P
   kg(-1), respectively, after more than 25 years of continuous manure
   applications. After long-term manuring, the ability of these soils to
   retain additional P was low (Langmuir maximum sorption potential of 5159
   g of P kg-1) and equilibrium leachate concentrations of total dissolved
   P (TDP) were high (5.5-7.6 mg L-1; saturated conditions, 0.15-m
   lysimeters in closed loop). Total dissolved P concentrations in
   equilibrium leachate increased linearly (r = 0.737) to a total soil P of
   4500 mg kg-1 and increased to a greater extent above 4500-5500 g kg-1
   (change point equivalerit to about 1500 mg kg(-1) Mehlich 3-extractable
   RP). The proportion of dissolved unreactive P (DUP) in equilibrium
   leachate decreased from 90\% of TOP in fields with a short manure
   application history to 2\% of TOP where mainly poultry manure had been
   applied for > 25 years, while unreactive P (UP) in soil decreased from
   44\% to 6\%. Dissolved RP (DRP) was less mobile than DUP in soils with
   short duration of manure applications (p < 0.05), while differences
   between DUP and DRP mobility disappeared with longer duration of manure
   application and greater total soil P. Organic P forms in NaOH/NaF
   extracts determined by P-31 NMR did not change with manure history, but
   sequential fractionation showed that the relative distribution of RP
   pools in soils changed. Dilute acid Pi increased from 10\% to 62\% with
   longer poultry manure additions, suggesting the formation of calcium
   phosphates as the soil pH increased from 4.1 to 6.0-7.2. The
   precipitation of P as calcium phosphates appeared to influence leachable
   P upon high and long-term applications of manure dominated by poultry
   litter.}},

Abstract = {{This study tests a method to identify and map the spatial distribution
   of general farming system types in five districts of the northern
   mountain region (NMR) of Vietnam. Over the last 50 years the NMR has
   suffered from a large loss of forest cover, often blamed on the swidden
   farming systems that are found in the mountains. As a result different
   programs have been put forward to change local land use practices: to
   decrease the amount of swidden land, ``sedentarize{''} farmers
   responsible for practicing swidden agriculture, and introduce new
   farming systems. However, some researchers have identified one type of
   swidden farming system, composite swiddening, as ecologically more
   stable, causing little net deforestation and less environmental
   degradation than other farming systems in the NMR. To date no study has
   identified how widespread this or other types of farming systems are in
   the NMR. This study makes use of geographic data for five districts in
   the NMR within a GIS, combined with field checking, to characterize,
   identify and map the spatial distribution of the general farming system
   types, including composite swiddening, by commune for these districts.
   The results of the mapping indicate that there are few communes where a
   single farming system type is found. As these districts are spread over
   five provinces, the results reinforce the view that in Vietnam's NMR,
   farming system types vary down to below the commune level. An 80\%
   agreement between the results shown on the map and field checking
   resulted from an examination of 19 communes in the districts mapped. A
   comparison was done of 2000 data to 1992 data for one district. An
   analysis of the communes' farming systems for 1992 and for 2000 indicate
   that permanent agriculture farming systems of both rice paddy
   agriculture and permanent upland agriculture are appearing and replacing
   swiddening systems. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Hereditary multiple exostosis (HME) is an autosomal dominant
   disorder characterized by the development of benign cartilage-capped
   tumors at the juxta-epiphyseal regions of long bones. HME is usually
   caused by mutations of EXT1 or EXT2.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate a
   three-generation Austrian kindred with HME for EXT1 and EXT2 mutations
   and for abnormalities of bone mineral density (BMD).
   Methods: DNA sequence and mRNA analyses were used to identify the
   mutation and its associated consequences. Serum biochemical and
   radiological investigations assessed bone metabolism and BMD.
   Results: HME-affected members had a lower femoral neck BMD compared with
   nonaffected members ( z-scores, -2.98 vs. -1.30; P = 0.011), and in
   those less than 30 yr of age, the lumbar spine BMD was also low
   (z-scores, -2.68 vs. -1.42; P = 0.005). However, they had normal
   mobility and normal serum concentrations of calcium, phosphate, alkaline
   phosphatase activity, creatinine, PTH, 25-hydroxyvitamin D,
   1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, osteocalcin, and beta-crosslaps. DNA sequence
   analysis of EXT1 revealed a heterozygous g -> c transversion that
   altered the invariant ag dinucleotide of the intron 8 acceptor splice
   site. RT-PCR analysis using lymphoblastoid RNA showed that the mutation
   resulted in skipping of exon 9 with a premature termination at codon
   599. DNA sequence abnormalities of the osteoprotegerin gene, which is in
   close proximity to the EXT1 gene, were not detected.
   Conclusions: A novel heterozygous acceptor splice site mutation of EXT1
   results in HME that is associated with a low peak bone mass, indicating
   a possible additional role for EXT1 in bone biology and in regulating
   BMD.}},

Abstract = {{Derived from the inner cell mass of blastocysts, embryonic stem cells
   (ESCs) retain the pluripotent features of early embryonic epiblast
   cells. In vitro, ESCs undergo spontaneous differentiation into a
   multitude of tissues, and thus are a powerful tool for the study of
   early developmental processes and a promising resource for cell-based
   therapies. We have pursued the derivation of functional, multipotent and
   engraftable hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from ESCs in order to
   investigate the genetic pathways specifying blood formation, as well as
   to lay the foundation for hematopoietic cell replacement therapies based
   on engineered ESCs. Theoretically, the generation of HSCs from
   patient-specific ESCs derived by nuclear transfer could provide for
   autologous hematopoietic therapies for the treatment of malignant and
   genetic bone marrow disorders. Although significant progress has been
   made in achieving hematopoietic differentiation from both murine and
   human ESCs, we have only a primitive understanding of the underlying
   mechanisms that specify hematopoietic cell fate, and a very limited
   capacity to direct the differentiation of the definitive HSC that would
   be suitable for clinical engraftment studies. Here we will review the
   progress to date and the significant problems that remain, and outline a
   strategy to achieve the directed differentiation of HSCs under
   conditions that might be appropriate for clinical scale-up and disease
   applications. (c) 2005 International Society for Experimental

Abstract = {{Episodes of acute rejection may represent an important risk factor for
   the development of chronic allograft nephropathy. Various studies have
   shown that pretransplant cytokine profiles in recipient blood are
   associated with transplant outcome. Serum samples were collected 24
   hours before transplantation from 57 patients (38 men and 19 women of
   age 36 +/- 5 years) receiving kidneys from unrelated living donors.
   Additional samples were collected at 1 and 2 weeks after
   transplantation, as well as during every rejection episode. The
   immunosuppression consisted of a cyclosporine, prednisolone, and
   mycophenolate mofetil. Among the transplanted patients, 19 (33.3\%)
   individuals experienced an acute rejection episode based on an increased
   level of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen during the first 14
   days after transplantation. TGF-beta, IL-2 and IFN-gamma serum levels
   were determined by an ELISA method using Bindermed system kits.
   The mean concentration of TGF-beta before transplantation tended to be
   lower among patients with acute rejection episodes compared to those
   with stable graft (75,265 versus 85,394 pg/mL; P =.34) and at 1 week
   after transplantation (77,558 versus 84,390 pg/mL), although the
   differences were not significant. Among patients with rejection the mean
   IL-2 concentration was significantly higher before, at 1 week, and at 2
   weeks after transplantation (15.0 versus 6.8 pg/mL, P =.005; 19.0 versus
   4.9 pg/mL, P =.001; and 21.1 versus 4.7 pg/mL, P =.0001). The mean
   concentration of IFN-gamma was significantly higher pre- and at 1 and 2
   weeks posttransplantation in patients with acute rejection episodes
   (161.1 versus 65.2, 175.6 versus 66.5 and 173.7 versus 77.1 pg/mL, all P
   <.001).
   In conclusion, evaluation of Th1 cytokines before transplantation may
   represent valuable predictive marker for an acute rejection episode.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of the present study was to determine the effects of inhibiting
   prolactin (PRL) synthesis for three consecutive 20-d periods during the
   second half of gestation, on the immune status of gilts and their
   foetuses. Crossbred gilts were randomly assigned as controls (n = 12) or
   received 10 mg of bromocriptine orally three times daily from days 50 to
   69 (BR50, n = 12), days 70 to 89 (BR70, n = 12), or days 90 to 109
   (BR90, n = 12) of gestation. All gilts were injected subcutaneously with
   ovalbumin (OVA) on days 53 and 72 of gestation. Blood samples were
   collected on days 50, 60, 70, 90 and 109 of gestation to evaluate the
   antibody response. Cellular immunity, as measured by lymphocyte
   proliferative response and production of interferon-gamma, was
   characterized on controls and BR50 gilts until the end of gestation. Six
   foetuses from five litters per treatment were selected and their thymus
   and spleen were excised and weighed. Splenocytes and thymocytes were
   assayed to characterize lymphocyte sub-populations and to evaluate
   splenocyte responses to mitogenic stimulation. Average spleen weight in
   foetuses from BR90 gilts was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that of
   foetuses from control or BR70 gilts. In all gilts treated with
   bromocriptine, percentages of CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocyte populations
   in foetus spleens were numerically reduced compared with those obtained
   in foetus from control gilts but the differences were not significant.
   In BR50 gilts, inhibition of PRL synthesis did not affect the
   proliferative response of lymphocytes to mitogenic stimulations compared
   with control group, but tended (P = 0.13) to increase the production of
   interferon-gamma. A time effect showed that production of
   interferon-gamma by leukocytes was reduced (P < 0.02) on days 80 and 100
   compared with days 50 and 70, regardless of bromocriptine treatment. The
   antibody response of gilts to OVA was not affected by bromocriptine
   treatments. In conclusion, inhibition of PRL synthesis by bromocriptine
   did not significantly affect immune response of pregnant gilts. In
   foetuses, although the differences between treatments were not
   significant, data suggest that the foetal development of immune tissues
   seems to be impaired by bromocriptine treatment.}},

Title = {{Effect of storage conditions on dispersal and short-term survival of

Abstract = {{Restocking is a widespread management practice used to support wild
   populations of European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus which are
   jeopardised by habitat loss and disease outbreaks. However, rabbits are
   known to experience a high mortality just after release, which might be
   due to the handling stress induced by translocation, and particularly to
   storage condition between capture and release. In our study, we tested
   two soft treatments of storage in boxes, where rabbits were stored
   either alone or in groups of four or five, and we assessed both survival
   rates and maximum dispersal distances by radio-tracking 43 individuals
   during eight weeks after release. We also recorded data about the
   survival at the time of release for 11 other rabbits that either died
   before release or were not radio-equipped. Our study involved two
   similar experimental releases in 2001 and 2002 in distinct nearby study
   areas to assess the effect of storage condition. Rabbits were released
   in two subsequent batches at a few days interval. Overall cumulated
   survival over the first 10 days after capture was 61\%, and 96\% during
   the subsequent 46 days. There was no clear overall effect of the storage
   method used on early survival: all individuals stored in groups survived
   in the second experiment, but not in the first experiment, whereas early
   mortality was equal for individually stored rabbits in both experiments.
   Otherwise, there was no effect of sex and batch on survival. Maximum
   dispersal distances from the release sites ranged within 20-280 in,
   except for two rabbits that moved 1.1-1.4 km away. Dispersal after
   release depended on both experiment and batch, but neither on sex nor on
   storage condition. It is not possible to conclude from our results that
   storage condition is a critical factor determining release success in
   wild rabbit, at least not the soft treatments that we tested.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To investigate tumour tissue and non-malignant
   tumour-surrounding bladder mucosa (NTSBM) for expression of human
   telomerase RNA (hTR) as a possible marker for premalignant
   transformation of urothelial cells.
   Material and Methods From 67 patients with superficial transitional cell
   carcinoma (TCC), sections with representative tumour tissue and NTSBM
   were selected for evaluation. Sections with moderate or severe dysplasia
   were omitted from evaluation. hTR expression was detected with in situ
   hybridization using a S-35-UTP-labelled riboprobe, and analysed
   semiquantitatively by counting the hybridization signals.
   Results In 45 of the 67 patients hTR expression was moderate or strong
   in tumour tissue, and in 20 hTR expression was moderate or strong in
   NTSBM. Moderate or strong hTR expression was detected in the NTSBM from
   19 of 60 patients with pTa/pT1 tumours. Of the 56 patients who were
   treated conservatively, eight had tumour recurrence, of whom five had
   moderate or strong hTR expression in the TSBM, compared with only 14 of
   48 patients without tumour recurrence.
   Conclusion Detecting hTR expression and the morphological distribution
   of hTR hybridization signals in NTSBM by in situ hybridization might
   indicate premalignant alterations involved in tumour recurrence.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To evaluate the effect on survival and quality of life of
   maintaining hemoglobin (Hb) in the range of 12 to 14 g/dL with epoetin
   alfa versus placebo in women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC)
   receiving first-line chemotherapy.
   Patients and Methods Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive
   epoetin alfa 40,000 U once weekly or placebo for 12 months. Study drug
   was initiated if baseline Hb was <= 13 g/dL or when Hb decreased to <=
   13 g/dL during the study. The primary end point was 12-month overall
   survival (OS).
   Results The study drug administration was stopped early in accordance
   with a recommendation from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee
   because of higher mortality in the group treated with epoetin alfa.
   Enrollment had been completed, with 939 patients enrolled (epoetin alfa,
   n = 469; placebo, n = 470). Most patients had Hb more than 12 g/dL at
   baseline (median Hb, 12.8 g/dL) or during the study. From the final
   analysis, 12-month OS was 70\% for epoetin alfa recipients and 76\% for
   placebo recipients (P =.01). Optimal tumor response and time to disease
   progression were similar between groups. The reason for the difference
   in mortality between groups could not be determined from additional
   subsequent analyses involving both study data and chart review.
   Conclusion In this trial, the use of epoetin alfa to maintain high Hb
   targets in women with MBC, most of whom did not have anemia at the start
   of treatment, was associated with decreased Survival. Additional
   research is required to clarify the potential impact of erythropoietic
   agents on survival when the Hb target range is 10 to 12 g/dL.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1319-1326}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Physiological oxygen (O-2) tensions in brain tissues vary widely, from
   approximate to 5 to 40 Torr (1-6\%), encompassing levels of moderate
   hypoxia that have often been considered neurotoxic in vitro. The effects
   of such hypoxia were examined in embryonic murine cortical neurons
   cultured continuously from plating in an atmosphere of 1\% O-2.
   Remarkably, cortical neurons thrived in 1\% O-2, with survival at 7-14
   days significantly greater than that of neurons cultured in ambient
   conditions (20\% O-2). Immunostaining for microtubule-associated
   protein-2 (MAP-2) and NeuN confirmed the neuronal identity of surviving
   cells, and demonstrated robust development of dendritic structures and
   MAP-2 expression in hypoxia. Survival of neurons in 20\% O-2 could be
   promoted by transfer of medium conditioned by neurons in 1\% O-2, or by
   pharmacological induction of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1
   alpha), suggesting a possible role for secreted factors under
   transcriptional regulation by HIF-1 in the trophic effects of hypoxia.
   Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a factor regulated by HIF-1,
   was strongly stimulated in neurons cultured in 1\% O-2. Treatment of
   neurons with exogenous VEGF partially improved survival in 20\% O-2, and
   inhibitors of VEGF action reduced survival of neurons in 1\% O-2. These
   data point to the dynamic role played by hypoxia, associated with HIF-1
   up-regulation, in promoting survival of cortical neurons, in part
   through stimulation of VEGF expression and release.}},

   Bose-Einstein condensates}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2005}},

Abstract = {{We find one-, two-, and three-component solitons of the polar and
   ferromagnetic (FM) types in the general (nonintegrable) model of a
   spinor (three-component) model of the Bose-Einstein condensate, based on
   a system of three nonlinearly coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. The
   stability of the solitons is studied by means of direct simulations and,
   in a part, analytically, using linearized equations for small
   perturbations. Global stability of the solitons is considered by means
   of an energy comparison. As a result, ground-state and metastable
   soliton states of the FM and polar types are identified. For the special
   integrable version of the model, we develop the Darboux transformation
   (DT). As an application of the DT, analytical solutions are obtained
   that display full nonlinear evolution of the modulational instability of
   a continuous-wave state seeded by a small spatially periodic
   perturbation. Additionally, by dint of direct simulations, we
   demonstrate that solitons of both the polar and FM types, found in the
   integrable system, are structurally stable; i.e., they are robust under
   random changes of the relevant nonlinear coefficient in time.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To examine the relationship between hypertension and
   health-related quality of life in patients attending hospital clinics in
   China.
   Design and methods A cross-sectional survey. Patients over the age of 35
   years attending outpatient clinics in 18 hospitals of eight major cities
   of northern and southern China were interviewed between June and July,
   1999. Trained fieldworkers completed questionnaires regarding
   demographics, hypertension knowledge and awareness, treatment history
   and quality of life issues. Qualified physicians performed blood
   pressure assessments.
   Results A total of 9703 volunteers were enrolled; 4510 (46.5\%) had
   hypertension. The results showed that hypertensive subjects scored lower
   in the multiple linear regression analyses in most questions on the
   quality of life questionnaire than those without hypertension after
   controlling for age, sex, sociodemographic factors, and comorbidity.
   There was a strikingly high prevalence of physical complaints or
   symptoms. Among the variables considered, age, sex, hypertension, body
   mass index, educational level, smoking, history of cholesterol, family
   history of cardiovascular diseases and history of diabetes were
   statistically significantly correlated with health-related quality of
   life. Subjects aware of having high blood pressure had a lower
   health-related quality of life score than subjects with high blood
   pressure but unaware of the diagnosis. Among treated subjects, those
   with controlled hypertension had higher health-related quality of life
   scores than those with poorly controlled hypertension.
   Conclusions Hypertensive individuals represent a vulnerable population
   that merits special attention from healthcare providers and systems.
   This is especially important given that low health-related quality of
   life can be a risk factor for subsequent cardiovascular events or
   complications. (c) 2005 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.}},

Abstract = {{The Zr41Ti14Cu12.5Ni10Be22.5 bulk metallic glass (BMG) is investigated

   temperature T-c and the temperature gradient (-dH(c2)/dT)(Tc) of the

   Some superconducting properties of the BMG are based on the electrical

   electron-phonon coupling constant gimel indicates that the
   Zr41Ti14CU12.5Ni10Be22.5 BMG is a weak-coupling superconductor with

Abstract = {{in order to organise and manage geospatial and georeferenced information
   on the Web making them convenient for searching and browsing, a digital
   portal known as G-Portal has been designed and implemented. Compared to
   other digital libraries, G-Portal is unique for several of its features.
   It maintains metadata resources in XML with flexible resource schemas.
   Logical groupings of metadata resources as projects and layers are
   possible to allow the entire metadata collection to be partitioned
   differently for users with different information needs. These metadata
   resources can be displayed in both the classification-based and
   map-based interfaces provided by G-Portal. G-Portal further incorporates
   both a query module and an annotation module for users to search
   metadata and to create additional knowledge for sharing respectively.
   G-Portal also includes a resource classification module that categorizes
   resources into one or more hierarchical category trees based on
   user-defined classification schemas. This paper gives an overview of the
   G-Portal design and implementation. The portal features will be
   illustrated using a collection of high school geography

Abstract = {{Water quality and public health impacts of mass produced poultry manure
   have prompted the need for viable conversion and reuse solutions.
   Conversion of poultry manure to value-added granular activated carbons
   for environmental remediation can be such a solution. The objective of
   this study was to compare the effectiveness of poultry manure-based
   carbons for the adsorption of selected metal ions (copper, cadmium,
   nickel, zinc) from solutions containing individual ions or the four
   metal ions present together. Adsorption properties for poultry
   manure-based carbons were compared with those of two commercial carbons,
   P (U) over barR RF and Minotaur, and carbons from three traditional
   precursors, coal, coconut and wood. Pelletized samples were pyrolyzed at
   700 degrees C for 1 h followed by 800 degrees C steam activation at 1, 3
   and 5 mL min(-1) water flow rate, for 30 and 45 min, under nitrogen. The
   carbon's ability to adsorb the metals was influenced by the activation
   strategy, increasing for longer activation times and higher water flow
   rates, in the presence of a single metal solution. Saturation conditions
   were achieved at 20 mm and, at 5 mm, almost all metal ion in solution
   was adsorbed, except for nickel. Carbons showed similar affinity towards
   copper, cadmium and zinc, individually. However, when in competition, at
   5 mm of each metal, manure-based carbons showed a preference for Cu2+
   followed by Zn2+ and Cd2+. Poultry manure-based carbons outperformed all
   reference carbons and P (U) over barR RF, and, except for Ni2+, Minotaur
   was also outperformed. Experiments showed that the highest removal rate
   in a competition situation was obtained for broiler-cake carbon
   activated for 45 min at 3 mL min(-1), with 93.1\%, 50.9\% and 85.2\% for
   copper, cadmium and zinc ions, respectively. Published in 2005 for SCI

   facilitate the development of branch-and-bound algorithms for the
   minimization of total completion time in a two-machine flowshop. The
   studied problem is known to be strongly NP-hard. In the literature,
   several lower bounds have been proposed. The bounding technique
   addressed in this paper is based upon a concept about rearrangement of
   the parameters of the input instance. The technique is intrinsically
   simple for computer implementations. We conduct computational
   experiments for problems with 10-65 jobs. Numerical results from our
   computational study indicate that the new scheme is very effective in

Abstract = {{A novel single-stage isolated high power factor correction (HPFC)
   converter operating in the discontinuous conduction mode is proposed in
   this paper. It is an integration of a buck-boost converter with a
   flyback converter by means of components placement and synchronous
   switching technology. It can achieve HPFC, tight output voltage
   regulation and lower voltage stress of the bulk capacitor, which is
   independent of the loads. The small-signal mathematical model for the
   proposed converter is derived separately by the averaging method and the
   current injected equivalent circuit approach. The IsSpice simulations
   and experimental results successfully verify the dynamics and
   performances of the proposed converter.}},

   Smad3/4-activated transcription and profibrogenic effects of connective
   tissue growth factor}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Pentoxifylline (PTX) is a potent inhibitor of connective tissue growth
   factor (CTGF), but its underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here,
   it was demonstrated that PTX inhibited not only TGF-beta 1-induced CTGF
   expression but also CTGF-induced collagen I (alpha 1) {[}Col I (alpha
   1)] expression in normal rat kidney fibroblasts (NRK-49F) and
   alpha-smooth muscle actin expression in normal rat kidney proximal
   tubular epithelial cells (NRK-52E). Furthermore, PTX attenuated
   tubulointerstitial fibrosis, myofibroblasts accumulation, and expression
   of CTGF and Col I (alpha 1) in unilateral ureteral obstruction kidneys.
   The mechanism by which PTX reduced CTGF in NRK-49F and NRK-52E was
   investigated. Activation of Smad3/4 was essential for TGF-beta 1-induced
   CTGF transcription, but PTX did not interfere with TGF-beta 1 signaling
   to Smad2/3 activation and association with Smad4 and their nuclear
   translocation. However, PTX was capable of blocking activation of
   TGF-beta 1-induced Smad3/4-dependent reporter as well as CTGF promoter,
   suggesting that PTX affects a factor that acts cooperatively with
   Smad3/4 to execute transcriptional activation. It was found that PTX
   increased intracellular cAMP and caused cAMP response element binding
   protein phosphorylation. The protein kinase A antagonist H89 abolished
   the inhibitory effect of PTX on Smad3/4-dependent CTGF transcription,
   whereas dibutyryl cAMP and forskolin recapitulated the inhibitory
   effect. In conclusion, these results indicate that PTX inhibits CTGF
   expression by interfering with Smad3/4-dependent CTGF transcription
   through protein kinase A and blocks the profibrogenic effects of CTGF on
   renal cells. Because of the dual blockade, PTX potently attenuates the
   tubulointerstitial fibrosis in unilateral ureteral obstruction kidneys.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies demonstrated that the variable sampling interval (VSI) X
   charts are quicker than the traditional fixed sampling interval (FSI) X
   charts in detecting process shifts. The usual assumption for designing a
   control chart is that the data are normally distributed. However, this
   assumption may not be true. When process data are not normally
   distributed, the effect on the false alarm rate and the detection
   ability of process shifts may be inappropriate. The Burr distribution
   has been used in the literature to represent various non-normal
   distributions. In this paper, the Burr distribution will be employed to
   evaluate and design the VSI X charts under non-normality. Equations for
   determining the performance of the VSI X charts are derived, and then
   the method of designing VSI X charts for non-normal distributions is
   provided. A numerical example is given for illustration of practical
   applications.
   Significance: When process data are not normally distributed, the
   performance of the VSI X chart may be unreasonable. In this paper the
   Burr distribution to is used evaluate and design the VSI X charts under
   non-normality.}},

   laser irradiation, the incorporation of O-2(2-) peroxo species or the
   dissolution of oxygen species near the ITO surface leads to the
   reduction of the surface roughness and an increase in the SWF. In

   excellent stability in the SWF. (c) 2005 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{The society of today is characterized by a change rate higher than ever
   before caused by an enormous amount of information. To be able to handle
   this situation in our professional life as well as in our spare time, it
   is necessary to have efficient computer-based information systems to
   store and process information. More and more complex information systems
   are therefore developed and implemented but instead of reaching the
   intended facilitation and making the business more efficient, the
   complexity has become so high that users sometimes experience increased
   difficulty and reduced efficiency. The nature of information in a
   context of system development is discussed from a theoretical point of
   view. An empirical study concerning different perceptions of information
   of 376 respondents is presented. The results are subdivided into
   categories found in the theoretical study. As a result of our study,
   models are created to illuminate important factors to consider in the
   interaction between computer-based information systems and human
   information systems represented by developers and end-users. We conclude
   that it is very important to be aware of the differences between
   different perceptions of information, and to work consciously to unite
   user and developer practices into one integrated view as a basis for
   system development. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores the development of post-World War I allied medical
   professions in the United States, and more specifically the rise of
   physiotherapy as it was used to rehabilitate maimed soldiers. Unlike
   other female health care professionals of the time, physiotherapists
   engaged in intra-gender conflicts with white-collar women rather than
   attempting to gain independence from medical men. Driven to be distinct
   from other female professionals, physiotherapists created a unique
   post-Victorian identity, defining their practice as requiring both
   strength and science, which challenged the convention of seeing women as
   the weaker, more nurturing sex. Their story, however, is not one of
   simple triumph. Eager to medicalize and professionalize their field, by
   1935 they subordinated themselves to physician supervision, losing what
   little professional autonomy they had acquired during the 1920s. Yet, by
   extending their professional sphere of influence over disabled soldiers,
   these therapists became physical manipulators of the male body and
   purveyors of knowledge regarding the definition and treatment of
   disability.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the optical properties of Cr3+ ions in an alkali
   gallium silicate glass system and in two glass-based nanocomposites with
   nucleated beta-Ga2O3 nanocrystals. The nucleation and growth of the
   nanocrystalline phase in the host glass matrix were monitored by Raman
   scattering spectroscopy and angle-dispersive x-ray diffraction. A
   broadband luminescence, associated with the T-4(2)-(4)A(2) transition
   from the weak crystal field of octahedral Cr3+ sites, dominated the
   emission of the precursor as-quenched glass. The luminescence spectra of
   the synthesized glass-ceramic nanocomposites revealed a crystal-like
   E-2-(4)A(2) strong emission and indicated that the major fraction of
   Cr3+ ions was located within the nanocrystalline environment. The
   variable-temperature studies of the nanocomposites demonstrated that the
   fluorescence of Cr3+ ions can be transformed from sharp R lines of the
   E-2-(4)A(2) transition to a combination of R lines and of the broad band
   of the T-4(2)-(4)A(2) transition. We propose a simple distribution model
   where the major part of Cr3+ ions is located in the nanocrystalline
   phase of the glass-ceramic composites in the octahedral environment,
   substituting the gallium atoms in the beta-Ga2O3 crystal structure. The
   developed nanocrystalline glass-ceramics are a promising class of
   Cr3+-doped oxide glass-based optically active composite materials.(c)

   cm/s while looking at flashing white light. Mean MBFV value in the tight
   PCA was 41.7 +/- 8.9 cm/s with eyes open, 28.2 +/- 9.1 cm/s with eyes
   closed, 42.4 +/- 8.8 cm/s while looking at constant white light, and
   43.4 +/- 9.2 while looking at flashing white light. Value differences
   for the left PCA, between eyes open and closed and between looking at
   constant white light and looking at flashing white light, were
   statistically significant (p < 0.001, z= -6.2146, and p < 0.001, z=
   -3.4836, respectively). For the right PCA, a value difference between
   eyes open and closed, and between looking at constant and flashing white
   tight was statistically significant (p < 0.001, z= - 6.2146 and p <
   0.001, z= -3.6928), but there was no significant difference between eyes
   open and constant white light (p=0.03, z= -2.1693). The results showed
   that simple visual stimulation had an effect on blood flow velocities in
   PCA and that it could be measured with TCD.}},

Abstract = {{The correlation between hereditary thrombophilia and fetal loss is
   supported by several observations. In murine models, the protein C
   system has been shown to be essential for the maintenance of pregnancy,
   as it indirectly acts as a growth factor for trophoblast cells and
   protects them from apoptosis. In humans, it has been shown that the
   placenta replaces the yolk sac as an essential source of blood supply to
   the embryo during the 8th and 9th weeks of gestation. Furthermore,
   meta-analysis of epidemiological data demonstrates a correlation between
   thrombophilic polymorphisms such as factor V Leiden and prothrombin
   20210G -> A and isolated or recurrent fetal losses. Finally, therapeutic
   non-controlled trials indicate the benefits and safety of low-molecular
   weight heparins as secondary prophylaxis. However, it is still necessary
   to further clarify the association between thrombophilia and fetal loss,
   especially during a first pregnancy, with regard to the type of
   pregnancy loss and with respect to other related factors.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the paper is to describe food and drinks
   available in food stands or cantina at Danish schools and food and
   drinks provided at after school care institutions in Denmark.
   MATERIAL AND METHODS: The survey was performed in 1999 and
   self-administered postal questionnaires were sent to all private and
   public schools and all after school care institutions in Denmark. The
   participation rate was 70 at schools and 66 at after school care
   institutions.
   RESULTS: In total, 3\% of schools and 4\% of after school care
   institutions have a written policy on nutrition. All Danish children
   have access to milk at school and they can choose between milk with low
   and high content of fat. Vending machines are rare at schools and are
   not present at all at after school care institutions. Only 10\% of
   schools offer children sugared carbonated drinks at food stands. Fruit
   is available daily in 35\% of schools, at food stands, and in 18\% of
   the schools, fruit is available on prescription. In after school care
   institutions, sweets and sugared carbonated drinks are rare. However,
   juice is served daily in 47\% of after school care institutions. Most
   schools run the food stand at school for profit.
   CONCLUSION: The paper highlights the important aspects of the
   institutional level as one of six important levels as regards the
   prevention of obesity and an important level at which to act to increase
   nutrition habits in school children.}},

Abstract = {{TiO2 films were prepared by dc reactive magnetron sputtering. The UV-Vis

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Environment-gene interaction in oral carcinogenesis is well
   demonstrated by phase I and II enzymes that are involved in the
   metabolism of carcinogens. This study investigated the association of
   glutathione S-transferase (GST)T1 and GSTM1 genotypes of phase II enzyme
   genes with risk for, age of onset, and neck lymph node metastasis (LNM)
   in areca-associated oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
   METHODS: A total of 114 OSCC male patients and 100 male controls were
   recruited. All subjects were areca users and tobacco smokers. DNA was
   obtained from peripheral blood samples. Genotyping of GSTT1
   (non-null/null) and GSTM1 (non-null/null) was determined by polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR) analysis using specific primers that only amplify
   non-null alleles.
   RESULTS: No association was found between GST genotype and the risk of
   OSCC based on case-controls. Patients with the GSTT1 null genotype were
   older at onset (P = 0.03). Those with the GSTM1 null genotype had a
   higher incidence of neck LNM than those with the GSTM1 non-null genotype
   (P = 0.01). Patients with the GSTM1/GSTT1 null genotype appeared to have
   later onset and a higher incidence of neck LNM than those carrying the
   opposite genotype.
   CONCLUSION: The GST genotypes may be important markers for the age of
   onset and risk of metastasis in OSCC. The data also suggest that the
   various GST isoforms may be differentially involved in development or
   progression of OSCC.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the creation of a novel fluorescent probe of
   europium-complex hybridized T7 phage. It was made by filling a
   ligand-displayed T7 ghost phage with a fluorescent europium complex
   particle. The structure of the hybridized phage, which contains a
   fluorescent inorganic core surrounded by a ligand-displayed capsid
   shell, was confirmed by electron microscope, energy-dispersive X-ray
   analysis (EDX), bioassays, and fluorescence spectrometer. More
   importantly, as a benefit of the phage display technology, the
   hybridized phage has the capability to integrate an affinity reagent
   against virtually any target molecules. The approach provides an
   original method to fluorescently ``tag{''} a bioligand and/or to
   ``biofunctionalize{''} a fluorophore particle. By using other types of
   materials such as radioactive or magnetic particles to fill the ghost
   phage, we envision that the hybridized phages represent a new class of
   fluorescent, magnetic, or radioprobes for imaging and bioassays and
   could be used both in vitro and in vivo.}},

   inherently support unique network applications for the wireless

   propose an efficient distributed coordination function on the media
   access control protocol to enhance the power conservation of mobile
   hosts by using a power control algorithm and the network throughput of
   an ad hoc network by using an algorithm for simultaneous frame
   transmissions. Extensive simulation is studied to evaluate the
   improvement of the proposed method. The results of the simulation
   exhibit significant improvement to the standard access control protocol.
   With slight improvement of network throughput, up to 85\% of the
   consumed energy was able to be saved in compared to the standard
   protocol and up to 7 times of the energy efficiency Vas enhanced with
   the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. The purpose of this study was to enhance the weak echoes of
   low reflective vitreous opacities on ophthalmic sonography. Methods. A
   simulation study on a vitreous enhancement algorithm based on coded
   excitation was performed, with the analysis of the transmit efficiency
   and motion effects. On the basis of the simulation results, we have
   implemented a 10-MHz B-mode experimental sonographic platform with coded
   excitation. In the experimental platform, a field programmable gated
   array is used to apply a real-time signal-processing and imaging
   algorithm. Results. A high-frequency ophthalmic sonographic imaging
   system based on Golay complementary sequence coded excitation is
   presented. The images of human eyes show appreciable improvement of the
   contrast resolution of low reflective vitreous opacities while
   suppressing the noise level. Conclusions. The images show the
   effectiveness of the vitreous enhancement algorithm and its potential

Abstract = {{Abnormal phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein tau plays a
   critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), together with a distinct
   decrease of energy metabolism in the affected brain regions. To explore
   the effect of acute energy crisis on tau phosphorylation and the
   underlying mechanisms, we incubated rat brain slices in artificial
   cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) at 37 degrees C with or without an oxygen
   supply, or in aCSF with low glucose concentrations. Then, the levels of
   total, phosphorylated and unphosphorylated tau, as well as the
   activities and levels of protein phosphatase (PP)-1, PP-2A, glycogen
   synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase
   (ERK) and C-jun amino terminal kinase (JNK), were measured. It was
   found, unexpectedly, that tau was significantly dephosphorylated at
   Ser396/Ser404 (PHF-1), Ser422 (R145), Ser199/Ser202 (Tau-1), Thr181
   (AT270), Ser202/Thr205 (AT8) and Thr231 (AT180) by acute anoxia for 30
   min or 120 min. The activity of PP-2A and the level of dephosphorylated
   PP-2A catalytic subunit at tyrosine 307 (Tyr307) were simultaneously
   increased. The active forms of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 were decreased under
   anoxic incubation. The PP-2A inhibitor, okadaic acid (OA, 0.75 mu m),
   completely prevented tau from acute anoxia-induced dephosphorylation and
   restored the active forms of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 to the control level. The
   activities and protein levels of GSK-3 and PP-1 showed no change during
   acute anoxia. These data suggest that acute anoxia induces tau
   dephosphorylation, and that PP-2A may play a key role in tau
   dephosphorylation induced by acute anoxia.}},

   represent the filter coefficients. We first formulate the problem as a
   constrained shortest path problem and discuss how an efficient dynamic
   programming algorithm can be used to obtain the optimal quantized
   representation for arbitrary quantization sets. We then develop a greedy
   algorithm which has even lower computational complexity and is shown to
   be optimal when the quantization levels and their associated costs
   satisfy a certain, easily checkable criterion. For the special case of
   the quantization set that involves levels that are sums of signed
   powers-of-two and whose cost is captured by the number of powers of two
   used in their representation, the total integer cost relates to the cost
   of the very large-scale integration implementation of the given FIR
   filter and our analysis clarifies the optimality of previously proposed
   algorithms in this setting.}},

   K{[}H2B(btZ)(2)], or K{[}HB(btZ)(3)] (Hbtz = 1,2,3-benzotriazole). When
   the reaction between K{[}H2B(btZ)(2)] and AgNO3 was carried out in the

   properties of all complexes have been investigated through analytical
   and spectroscopic measurements (IR, H-1, P-31 NMR), the H-1 and P-31 NMR

   characterised by single crystal X-ray studies. In the former, the
   HB(btZ)(3) is unidentate in an NAgP3 coordination environment; the
   latter is a dimer, the dppf bridging the two silver atoms, while the
   H2B(btZ)(2) ligand, which chelates one silver, bridges to the second
   also, the array having 2-symmetry. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Iron- and zinc-enrichment experiments were carried out at Ocean Station
   Papa in the subarctic North Pacific. In iron-enriched treatments,
   phytoplankton chlorophyll a (Chl a) increased 20-fold (9.7 mu g L-1)
   above the concentration on day zero. No stimulation of Chl a production
   or nitrate drawdown was observed on addition of zinc alone compared to
   the control. In the iron-enriched treatment, bioavailable zinc
   concentration decreased to 0.2 pmol L-1 lower than that which is known
   in culture experiments to limit some phytoplankton growth. Theoretical
   analyses suggest that this zinc concentration would cause
   diffusion-limited growth of large diatom cells present at the end of the
   incubation. Direct measurements of zinc-binding ligands indicate that
   the natural microbial planktonic assemblages have the ability to respond
   rapidly to conditions of high dissolved zinc concentrations. Rapid
   ligand production may be a mechanism by which certain phytoplankton
   reduce zinc toxicity or for maintaining zinc concentrations in the upper
   water column. Zinc-binding ligands were observed to be both produced and
   removed on the timescale of 1 d. We suggest that these zinc-binding
   ligands are produced to assist assimilation, particularly under
   iron-enriched conditions when concentrations of bioavailable zinc were
   extremely low, thereby alleviating the effects of zinc limitation.}},

Abstract = {{Isaac D'Israeli's contributions to the formation of literary history in
   the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries remain unexplored,
   his voluminous writings mined for apt quotations rather than considered
   as significant in their own right. This article argues that his
   questioning of genre hierarchies and period distinctions grew out of an
   attempt to correct what he saw as the limitations of contemporary
   historiographic and literary critical representations. Following his
   renunciation of revolutionary ideals, these inquiries were framed by a
   ``conservative iconoclasm{''} that was fostered by the need to adjust
   loyalist sympathies to fit his own peripheral status. Committed both
   professionally and temperamentally to a pluralist understanding of
   history writing, D'Israeli integrated into his work from the 1790s
   through to the 1840s biographical, political, social, and psychological
   elements that led him ultimately to a distinctively literary historical
   mode of thought. Drawing on the resources of opinion, anecdote, and
   secret history, he articulates possibilities for historicist inquiry
   that continue to stand as powerful alternatives to the romantic
   ideology.}},

Abstract = {{Escherichia coli O157 is an important cause of food-borne illness. The

   increases as the proportion of cattle carrying E. coli O157 within a pen
   increases. Pre-harvest reduction of E coli O157 colonization will
   require targeted intervention strategies and should reduce contamination
   of carcasses thereby enhancing public health. Several pre-harvest
   interventions show substantial promise, such as specific strains of
   direct-fed microbials, vaccine technology, sodium chlorate, and neomycin
   sulfate, whereas others such as Brown Seaweed or chlorination of water
   have little or no detectable benefit. Selection of validated

Abstract = {{On January 9th 2004, the journal `Science' confirmed that farmed salmon
   is higher in industrial pollutants called polychlorinated biphenyls
   (PCBs) and other toxins than wild salmon. The fishmeal component of the
   farmed salmon feed was cited as the likely source of these contaminants.
   One way to avoid this toxin loading is to use a salmon feed that
   contains genetically engineered (GE) ingredients. This new feed would
   substitute wild South American fish meal for transgenic canola as its
   main protein component. Although this option has many environmental,
   social, and economic benefits for Canadian consumers, it will also
   likely be met with opposition from certain special interest groups, and
   become a popular target of the media. The Canadian salmon aquaculture
   industry has in some cases been vilified by the popular media and
   certain environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs). Whether
   this portrayal is justified or not is debatable. What we do know is that
   an excessive amount of conflicting information makes effective decision
   making extremely difficult for Canadian consumers. Information
   concerning transgenic feeds can be highly complex and unfamiliar to many
   laypeople. Our research demonstrates that the public already holds
   misconceptions regarding the salmon aquaculture industry. These
   misconceptions hinder an individual's ability to make good decisions
   about salmon aquaculture food products, and must be addressed before
   this industry attempts to disseminate additional information concerning
   new controversial technologies (i.e., transgenic feeds). We have found
   that it is possible to effectively communicate the risks and benefits of
   controversial issues while addressing misconceptions through a process
   known as the mental models approach to risk communication, as described
   by Morgan et al., 2002. This paper discusses the results of our risk
   communication experiment and shows how this process affected our
   respondents' understanding of factual information, their confidence as
   consumers, their acceptance of this issue, and their purchasing
   decisions.}},

   conductive nanocomposites the SWNTs are homogeneously dispersed within
   the polymer matrix and form a network. Beside fairly straight SWNTs,
   strongly bended SWNTs have been observed. However, for samples with SWNT
   concentrations below the percolation threshold, the common overall

Abstract = {{Germination of Acacia tortilis seeds strongly depends on micro-site
   conditions. In Lake Manyara National Park, Tanzania, Acacia tortilis
   occurs abundantly in recently abandoned arable fields and in
   elephant-mediated gaps in acacia woodland, but does not regenerate in
   grass swards or beneath canopies. We examined the germination of Acacia
   tortilis using field and laboratory experiments. Seeds placed on top of
   the soil rarely germinated, while seeds covered with elephant dung or
   buried under the soil surface had a germination success between
   23-43\%,. On bare soil 39\% of both the dung-covered and buried seeds
   germinated, in perennial grass swards 24-43\%, and under tree canopies
   10-24\% respectively. In laboratory experiments, seed water absorption
   correlated positively with temperature up to 41 degrees C, while
   subsequent germination was optimal at lower (21-23 degrees C)
   temperatures. Seeds that had absorbed water lost their viability when
   kept above 35.5 degrees C. The absence of light did not significantly
   influence germination success. Acacia tortilis does not actively
   disperse its seeds, but regeneration outside tree canopies was
   substantial. The regeneration potential thus strongly depends on the
   physiognomy of the vegetation.}},

   parameters of fine calcite samples from Brandenburg using a pressure
   filter machine. The filtration parameters were optimised according to
   the filtration time, the cake thickness, the filtrate density and the

Abstract = {{Objective: This study was undertaken to determine clinical
   characteristics and factors associated with suboptimal viral suppression
   at delivery in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women.
   Study design: All HIV-infected women who delivered at a single urban
   tertiary care center from January 1999 to June 2004 were studied. Women
   were divided into 2 groups based on HIV viral load (VL) proximate to
   delivery: VL < 1000 copies per milliliter and VL >= 1000 copies per
   milliliter. Demographic and clinical factors were analyzed and compared
   between the 2 groups.
   Results: A total of 146 women had adequate data available for analysis:
   102 (69.9\%) had VL < 1000 copies per milliliter and 44 (30.1 \%) had VL
   >= 1000 copies per milliliter at delivery. Women with a viral load 1000
   copies per milliliter at delivery were more likely to have a baseline
   viral load VL >= 10,000 copies per milliliter (66.7\% vs 32\%, P <.001)
   and less likely to report medication adherence, (50\% vs 87.8\%, P
   <.001).
   Conclusion: Our findings support the concept that in addition to
   antiviral medical therapy, intervention to improve adherence and
   maintaining a low baseline VL are key components to VL suppression in
   pregnancy. (C) 2005 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{KIDNEY INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{68}},

Abstract = {{Background. Recent advances enable the direct measurement of small
   molecule clearance, Kecn, during each dialysis. Average Kecn and
   treatment length, t, are multiplied giving total clearance, Kt. The body
   surface area (BSA) is a fixed transformation of height and weight and is
   a well recognized measure of body size. This project was conceived to
   search for clinical outcome-based functions for measured Kt in terms of
   BSA to enable simple Kt prescription guidelines for clinicians who are
   able to measure Kecn, and to provide foundations for future clinical
   research.
   Methods. The data came from Fresenius Medical Care (NA) files and
   included more than 32,000 patients with height, weight, and paired Kecn
   and t measurements during December 2002. Measurements were averaged for
   the month and used as predictor measures in Cox models of survival time
   during 2003. Candidate Kt values from 30 L/treatment through 70 were
   examined to determine the best statistical fit for quintile and decile
   delimited BSA groups evaluating the best fit Kt treatment target for
   each group. Functional forms representing the relationship between
   target Kt values and mean BSA of the groups were then evaluated to
   determine the best fit.
   Results. Kt targets increased with BSA in a curvilinear way such that
   the rate of increase is greater at low BSA than high. The best
   statistical fit was a double reciprocal form, Kt = 1/(a + b/BSA);
   ``a{''} and ``b{''} are statistically derived coefficients. The form has
   an appealing mathematical property; Kt approaches 0 as BSA approaches 0.
   Other forms fit the data nearly as well, however, and can be used to
   estimate Kt targets for patients with different BSA.
   Conclusion. Empirical, outcome-based functions of measured Kt in terms
   of BSA exist and can be used as aids for prescribing and judging
   hemodialysis treatment.}},

Abstract = {{In observational studies with a time-dependent treatment and

   balanced distribution of the covariates in both treated and control
   groups. Optimal matching with various designs is conducted and compared
   in a study of a surgical treatment, cystoscopy and hydrodistention,
   given in response to a chronic bladder disease, interstitial cystitis.
   Simulation studies also suggest that the statistical analysis after

   PD patients. Total RNA from single neurons of both neuronal
   subpopulations was obtained by immuno-laser capture microdissection.
   Subsequently, RNA arbitrarily primed PCR was employed to generate
   expression profiles from the extracted RNA. Differentially displayed
   polymorphic fragments were dissected from silver-stained polyacrylamide
   gels. Most of these expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were homologous to
   known human sequences (56/64, 87.5\%). Based on the potential
   significance of individual ESTs in neurodegenerative disorders, 5 ESTs
   of interest were selected for further quantitative expression analysis
   by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (rtq RT-PCR). DA
   neurons without LBs preferentially expressed molecules beneficial for
   cell survival, whereas genes preferentially expressed in DA neurons
   containing LBs may support a cytotoxic role of LBs. Thus, we favor the
   view that LB-positive DA neurons are sicker than their LB-negative
   counterparts, and that inhibition of LB formation may indeed represent a
   therapeutic strategy in PD. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We combined the external noise paradigm, the Perceptual Template Model
   approach, and transfer tests to investigate the mechanisms and
   eye-specificity of perceptual learning of Gabor orientation in visual
   periphery. Coupled with a fixation task, discriminating a 5 from an S in
   a rapid small character string at fixation, contrast thresholds were
   estimated for each of eight external noise levels at two performance
   criteria using 3/1 and 2/1 staircases. Perceptual learning in one eye
   was measured over 10 practice sessions, followed by five sessions of
   practice in the new eye to assess transfer. We found that monocular
   learning improved performance (reduced contrast thresholds) with
   virtually equal magnitude across a wide range of external noise levels
   with no significant change in central task performance. Based on
   measurements of learning effects at two performance criterion levels, we
   identified a mixture of stimulus enhancement and external noise
   exclusion as the mechanism of perceptual learning underlying the
   observed improvements. Perceptual learning in the trained eye
   generalized completely to the untrained eye. We related the transfer
   patterns to known physiology and psychophysics on orientation direction
   coding. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The increased incidence of morbid obesity has resulted in an
   increase in bariatric surgery. The gastrojejunostomy performed during
   Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) operations has technical variability
   with different outcomes and complication-rates immediate postoperatively
   and at long-term follow-up.
   Methods: Between Jan 2000 and Feb 2005, 350 laparoscopic RYGBP
   procedures were performed. We present our immediate and follow-up rate
   of complications with total intraabdominal gastrojejunostomy, performed
   with the circular stapler.
   Results: Complications of gastrojejunostomy were detected in 24 patients
   (6.8\%): 3 anastornotic leaks (0.8\%); 6 bleeding (1.7\%) immediately
   postoperatively, and 4 stenoses (1.1\%), 10 ulcers (2.8\%) and 1
   stenosis plus ulcer (0.3\%) during long-term follow-up. There was no
   mortality related to the gastrojejunostomy.
   Conclusions: The gastrojejunostomy with circular stapler is an easily
   reproducible procedure. The rate of complications has been low. Surgeons
   who perform laparoscopic RYGBP should have a careful learning curve, and
   should be aware of the potential complications and their management.}},

Abstract = {{Many anesthetics evoke electroencephalogram (EEG) burst suppression
   activity in humans and animals during anesthesia, and the mechanisms
   underlying this activity remain unclear. The present study used a rat
   neocortical brain slice EEG preparation to investigate excitatory
   synaptic mechanisms underlying anesthetic-induced burst suppression
   activity. Excitatory synaptic mechanisms associated with burst
   suppression activity were probed using glutamate receptor antagonists
   (CNQX and APV), GABA receptor antagonists, and simultaneous whole cell
   patch clamp and microelectrode EEG recordings. Clinically relevant
   concentrations of thiopental (50-70 mu M), propofol (5-10 mu M) or
   isoflurane (0.7-2.1 vol\%, 0.5-1.5 rat minimum aveolar concentration
   (MAC), 200-700 mu M) evoked delta slow wave activity and burst
   suppression EEG patterns similar to in vivo responses. These effects on
   EEG signals were blocked by glutamate receptor antagonists CNQX (8.6 mu
   M) or APV (50 mu M). Depolarizing intracellular bursts (amplitude = 34.7
   +/- 4.5 mV; half width = 132 +/- 60 ms) always accompanied EEG bursts,
   and hyperpolarization increased intracellular burst amplitudes. Barrages
   of glutamate-mediated excitatory events initiated EEG bursting activity.
   Glutamate-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents were significantly
   depressed by higher anesthetic concentrations that depressed burst
   suppression EEG activity. A GABA(A) agonist produced a similar EEG
   effect to the anesthetics. It appears that anesthetic effects at both
   glutamate and GABA synapses contribute to EEG patterns seen during
   anesthesia.}},

Abstract = {{GABA(C) (p) receptors are members of the Cys-loop superfamily of
   neurotransmitter receptors, which includes nicotinic acetylcholine
   (nACh), 5-HT3, and glycine receptors. As in other members of this
   family, the agonist binding site of GABA(C) receptors is rich in
   aromatic amino acids, but while other receptors bind agonist through a
   cation-pi interaction to a tryptophan, the GABA(C) binding site has
   tyrosine at the aligning positions. Incorporating a series of tyrosine
   derivatives at position 198 using unnatural amino acid mutagenesis
   reveals a clear correlation between the cation-pi binding ability of the
   side chain and EC50 for receptor activation, thus demonstrating a
   cation-pi interaction between a tyrosine side chain and a
   neurotransmitter. Comparisons among four homologous receptors show
   variations in cation-pi binding energies that reflect the nature of the
   cationic center of the agonist.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty children (11 females; age range 8y 2mo to 14y 7mo, mean 10y 6mo,
   SD 1y 8mo) with electroclinically typical rolandic epilepsy (RE), were
   investigated to demonstrate possible occurrence of abnormal oromotor
   functions and oral sensibility, linguistic problems, and impaired
   auditory discrimination. Twelve children were treated with an
   antiepileptic drug (carbamazepine, valproate, or sulthiame). They were
   compared with an age- and sex-matched control group of 24 children (14
   females; age range 8y 2mo to 14y 5mo, mean 11y, SD 1y 8mo). The test
   battery included tests for facial expressions, lip and tongue movements,
   repeated syllables, and articulation using nonsense and tongue-twisting
   words. Sensibility on tongue and lips was tested with two-point
   discrimination. As language tests, Rapid Confrontation Naming,
   orthographic, and phonologic decoding tests were used. A dichotic
   listening test was performed in 13 children with RE and in 14 controls.
   Compared to control children, those with RE had significantly greater
   problems concerning tongue movements (p < 0.05) and articulation
   (nonsense words and tongue-twisting words;p < 0.01), and worse
   performance on dichotic listening (p < 0.05). Oro-lingual sensibility
   and results of language tests did not differ between those with RE and

Abstract = {{In 1988, our group initiated the Douglas Hospital Longitudinal Study of
   Normal and Pathological Aging to assess the association between
   secretion of the stress hormone cortisol and cognitive performance in a
   group of 51 older adults. In this paper, we summarize the data obtained
   in this study to date. We have found that long-term exposure to high
   endogenous levels of cortisol is associated with both memory impairments
   and a 14\% smaller volume of the hippocampus. We also report on studies
   showing that in older adults with moderate levels of cortisol over time,
   memory performance can be acutely modulated by pharmacologic
   manipulations of cortisol. We describe one participant who was included
   in the group of older adults presenting with increased cortisol levels
   over time, memory impairments and reduced hippocampal volume and in whom
   major depression, followed by Alzheimer's disease, developed during the
   course of the study. Together, the results of the Douglas Hospital
   Longitudinal Study of Normal and Pathological Aging show that increased
   secretion of cortisol in the older human population is significantly
   associated with impairment of cognitive function during aging.}},

   features of the composites remained qualitatively indistinguishable,
   with equiaxed Ap nanocrystals distributed randomly throughout a matrix

Abstract = {{X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis during the oxygen plasma
   assisted molecular beam epitaxy, combined with atomic force microscopy
   and scanning Auger microscopy have been used to evaluate the mechanism
   of single-phase Cu2O nanodot formation on the SrTiO3(1 00) surface.
   Formation of pure crystalline Cu2O nanodots occurs rather in a narrow
   growth parameter window, outside which a coexistence of the multiple
   phases has been observed. Cuprous oxide nanodots on the SrTiO3(1 0 0)
   substrate follow a growth mechanism which differs significantly from the
   growth modes observed for the majority of semiconductor quantum dots.
   Growth starts without wetting layer formation with appearance of
   well-ordered truncated square-based nanodots at submonolayer coverages.
   At the initial stages of growth, the nanodot size is only weakly changes
   with coverage and exponentially scales with temperature. After reaching
   a critical, temperature dependent dot density (similar to 10(13) cm(-2)
   for 760 K growth temperature), growth of mid-sized nanoclusters starts
   through coalescence, which is eventually followed by large dome-shaped
   cluster formation at higher coverages. The coexistence of the different
   types of the clusters at high coverages results in a multimodal
   distribution of sizes and shapes. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Background The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence
   and distribution of hypertension and to determine the status of
   hypertension awareness, treatment and control in the Portuguese adult
   population.
   Methods This study was conducted in 2003, and a multistage cluster
   sampling method was used to select a national representative sample. A
   total of 5023 adults, age 18-90 years, were examined. Three blood
   pressure measurements were obtained by trained observers using an OMROM
   M4-I sphygmomanometer after a 5-min sifting rest Information on the
   history of hypertension and the use of antihypertensive medications was
   obtained by use of a standard questionnaire.
   Results Hypertension was defined as a mean systolic blood pressure >=
   140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure >= 90 mmHg, or the use of
   antihypertensive medications. Overall, 42.1\% of the Portuguese adult
   population aged 18-90 years, representing 3 311 830 people, had
   hypertension. The age-specific prevalence of hypertension in the three
   age groups studied - younger than 35 years, 35-64 years old and older
   than 64 years was 26.2, 54.7 and 79\% in men and 12.4, 41.1 and 78.7\%
   in women, respectively. Among hypertensive patients, only 46.1\% were
   aware of their high blood pressure, 39.0\% were taking antihypertensive
   medication and 11.2\% achieved blood pressure control (<140/90 mmHg).
   Conclusions Our results indicate that hypertension is highly prevalent
   in Portugal. The percentages of those with hypertension that are aware,
   treated and controlled are unacceptably low. These results underscore
   the urgent need to develop national strategies to improve prevention,
   detection and treatment of hypertension in Portugal. (c) 2005 Lippincott

Abstract = {{Cyanobacteria acclimate to environmental inorganic carbon (C-i)
   concentrations through re-organisations of photosynthetic function and
   the induction of carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs), which alter and
   constrain their subsequent acclimation to changing light. We grew cells
   acclimated to high C-i (4 mM) or low C-i (0.02 mM), shifted them from 50
   mu mol m(-2) s(-1) to 500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), and quantified their
   photosynthetic performance in parallel with quantitation of allocations
   to key indicator macromolecules. Pigments cell(-1) declined, PsbA (PS
   II), AtpB (ATP Synthase), RbcL (Rubisco) and GlnA (Glutamine Synthetase)
   increased, and PsaC (PS I) remained stable through the light shift. The
   increase in these protein pools was slower and smaller in low C-i cells,
   but acted in both cell types to re-normalise the electron fluxes through
   the catalytic complexes back toward values before the light shift (for
   PsbA and GlnA) or even below the initial flux per complex (for RbcL). In
   contrast, an increased electron flux per PsaC was sustained for at least
   6 h after the increase in light. Initially, high levels of PS II
   cell(-1) and PS II connectivity in high C-i cells caused a more rapid
   net photoinactivation of PS II in high C-i cells than in low C-i cells,
   depressing the rate of PS II-specific electron transport (PS II ETR) to
   levels similar to linear ETR (net O-2 evolution minus respiration). In
   low C-i cells, PS II ETR remained in excess of linear ETR and may have
   helped maintain CCM activity. The pool sizes of PsbA, AtpB and GlnA
   correlated with cellular growth rate, and changed at similar rates in
   high C-i and low C-i cells when expressed on a generational rather than
   chronological timescale, which has implications for differing ecology of
   high and low C-i cells under variable natural light.}},

   monitoring stations in the Northern Hemisphere. We demonstrate the use
   of the model as a tool for understanding global pollutant dynamics by
   examining the hypothesis that variability in global-scale climate
   conditions, as reflected by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO),
   influences atmospheric PCB concentrations in the Northern Hemisphere. We
   estimate that the maximum variability in atmospheric PCB concentrations
   attributable to NAO variability is approximately a factor of 2. The
   influence of variability in the NAO on PCB concentrations in air is most
   likely to be observed in the winter and spring at monitoring sites in
   Northern Europe and the Arctic. Analysis of long-term monitoring data
   from 11 sites shows some statistically significant relationships between
   NAO indices and atmospheric PCB concentrations during the winter and
   spring. Giving consideration to competing factors that influence
   atmospheric PCB concentrations, longer time series of monitoring data
   are required to fully evaluate the modeling results and to improve our
   understanding of the role of climate variability on the long-term fate
   of persistent semivolatile pollutants.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To determine relative detection rates and detection limits for
   6 published polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays used for detection of
   feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1) DNA.
   Sample Population-5 vaccines licensed for use in preventing
   FHV-1-associated disease; 15 conjunctival biopsy specimens collected
   from cats with keratitis, conjunctivitis, or both; and a plaque-purified
   field isolate of FHV-1 cultured in vitro.
   Procedure-Vaccines and clinical samples were assessed for FHV-1 DNA by
   use of all 6 assays. Detection rates were calculated by assuming that
   any sample in which FHV-1 DNA was detected was a true-positive result.
   Detection limits were estimated by use of serial dilutions of DNA
   extracted from cultured FHV-1 and 1 clinical sample.
   Results-Testing by use of all 6 assays resulted in detection of FHV-1
   DNA in all 5 vaccines. Testing by use of all 6 assays yielded concordant
   results for 9 of 15 conjunctival biopsy specimens (8 with negative
   results and 1 with a positive result). Calculated detection rates for
   clinical samples ranged from 29\% to 86\%. Assay sensitivity was ranked
   similarly by use of detection rate or detection limit.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Testing by use of all assays was
   equally likely to detect vaccine virus. Therefore, a positive PCR result
   in a cat may reflect vaccine virus rather than wild-type virus. Test
   sensitivity as assessed by detection limits and detection rates varied
   greatly. Because FHV-1 can be shed in clinically normal animals, high
   detection rate will not necessarily correlate with high diagnostic
   sensitivity.}},

   overall (6.4\%), the majority of which (44) were among children under 5
   years of age. Except for burn incidence, there were no significant

   was significantly larger for nonsurvivors than survivors (50.3\% versus
   16.8\%; P < 0.001). Inhalation injuries were strongly associated with
   large burns, and were present in all flame-burn fatalities. Scalds were
   the most common type of burn among children under 5 years of age; flame
   burns predominated in older children. There were 39 deaths related to
   scalds. Large burn size was the strongest predictor of mortality
   followed by the presence of inhalation injury and the length of time to

Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{Background: Studying populations with low cesarean delivery rates can
   identify strategies for reducing unnecessary cesareans in other patient
   populations. Native American women have among the lowest cesarean
   delivery rates of all United States populations, yet few studies have
   focused on Native Americans. The study purpose was to determine the rate
   and risk factors for cesarean delivery in a Native American population.
   Methods: We used a case-control design nested within a cohort of Native
   American live births, >= 35 weeks of gestation (n = 789), occurring at
   an Indian Health Service hospital during 1996-1999. Data were abstracted
   from the labor and delivery logbook, the hospital's primary source of
   birth certificate data. Univariate and multivariate analyses examined
   demographic, prenatal, obstetric, intrapartum, and fetal factors
   associated with cesarean versus vaginal delivery. Results: The total
   cesarean rate was 9.6 percent (95\% CI 7.2-12.0). Nulliparity, a medical
   diagnosis, malpresentation, induction, labor length > 12.1 hours,
   arrested labor, fetal distress, meconium, and gestations < 37 weeks were
   each significantly associated with cesarean delivery in unadjusted
   analyses. The final multivariate model included a significant
   interaction between induction and arrested labor (p < 0.001); the effect
   of arrested labor was far greater among induced (OR 161.9) than
   noninduced (OR 6.0) labors. Other factors significantly associated with
   cesarean delivery in the final logistic model were an obstetrician labor
   attendant (OR 2.4; p = 0.02) and presence of meconium (OR 2.3; p =
   0.03). Conclusions: Despite a higher prevalence of medical risk factors
   for cesarean delivery, the rate at this hospital was well below New
   Mexico (16.4\%, all races) and national (21.2\%, all races) cesarean
   rates for 1998. Medical and practice-related factors were the only
   observed independent correlates of cesarean delivery. Implementation of
   institutional and practitioner policies common to the Indian Health
   Service may reduce cesarean deliveries in other populations.}},

   ball-in-vortex flow-meter designed to work on the principle of a
   rotating sphere in and due to a vortex flow. The comparison of this
   flow-meter reading with the standard flow-meter indicates the existence
   of different calibration regimes, bifurcated by a sharp change in slope
   of the calibration curve. Based on the governing mechanics of this
   flow-meter this paper explains this nonlinearity, and proposes its
   mathematical form. In. particular the bifurcation in calibration
   characteristics is attributed to the change in the surface contact
   frictional force, due to translation of the ball. The mathematical model
   captures the various calibration regimes associated with this
   translation, from one plane of rotation in the flowmeter to another or
   from one periphery to another Thus, calibration nonlinearity of this
   flow-meter can be fully comprehended through its governing mechanics,

Abstract = {{Gross community production (GCP) and dark community respiration (DCR)
   rates were measured in the N.E. Atlantic Basin (38-45 degrees N and 15
   degrees 20'-21 degrees 20'W) during the Programme Oceanographique
   Multidisciplinaire Meso-Echelle (POMME). Three cruises were conducted
   over a one-year period (2001), and GCP and DCR were measured at 20
   stations using seawater taken from 5 m. In winter, GCP is light limited
   whereas DCR, which is mainly due to bacteria, is limited by substrate
   availability. GCP and DCR were under the influence of mesoscale
   features, with the cyclonic structure enhancing the autotrophy. In
   spring, light and resource availability remain the major controlling
   parameters, which are constrained by north-south zonation, rather than
   mesoscale features. The most productive area is south of 41 degrees N at
   the start of the bloom and is associated with greater DCR as autotrophs
   contribute to community respiration. The late-summer period is
   oligotrophic, which contrasts with the previous winter and spring
   period, characterised by a large quantity of TOC accumulated (+ 13.2 mu
   M C from spring to late-summer) and with greater DCR in the southern
   area. The GCP/DCR ratio greatly varied seasonally, ranging from 0.6 in
   late summer to 1.3 in winter and 2.4 in spring. These results, even
   restricted to surface ecosystem metabolism (5 in), strongly suggest that
   the trophic status of a regional system in the open ocean should be
   determined over a seasonal cycle. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Understanding phosphorus (P) accumulation and stratification in surface
   soil following manure application is critical for runoff P loss
   abatement. The objectives of this study were to predict soil P
   stratification and assess its effects on runoff P losses following
   long-term manure application. A two-step approach was developed to use
   field data and predict P stratification and runoff over time. First,
   extractable soil P in 0 to 5, 5 to 10, and 10 to 15-cm (0 to 2, 2 to 4,
   and 4 to 6-in) depths were measured in a 2.5 ha (6.2 ac) watershed,
   where cattle and swine manure were applied for four consecutive years.
   Second, the measured P and management practices were used to calibrate
   input parameters of the Groundwater Loading Effects of Agricultural
   Management System (GLEAMS) simulation. The calibrated parameters were
   used to estimate soil P stratification and runoff P losses following 25
   years of simulated annual manure application. The Iowa P index rating
   was calculated for the same scenarios. Correlation among extractable P
   fractions were high (r(2) > 0.88). The GLEAMS simulation predicted
   reasonably well the exacerbation of soil P stratification following
   manure application. The simulation estimated a 5.3 mg L-1 and 7.4 mg L-1
   runoff P increase for each 1 mg kg(-1) soil labile-P increase in the 0
   to 1-cm and 1 to 5-cm depths (0.4 and 2 in), respectively. Soil Bray-P
   in 0 to 5-cm vs. 0 to 15-cm depth increases P-index risk towards manure
   application rates. Prediction of P stratification with models is useful
   for improving P loss risk assessment when combined with the P-index and
   thus provisions should be made for P stratification in comprehensive
   nutrient management programs.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENDOUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{797-802}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To critically assess the safety profile and complications of
   the transperitoneal approach to laparoscopic pyeloplasty at our center.
   Patients and Methods: From January 2002 to January 2004, 92 patients
   with a mean age of 22.78 +/- 15.15 years (range 14 months-65 years) with
   primary (N = 90) or secondary (N = 2) ureteropelvic junction obstruction
   were treated by transperitoneal laparoscopic pyeloplasty and were
   evaluated for this study. Renal stones were present in eight patients. A
   double-J stent was placed antegrade in 50 patients and in the rest
   through cystoscopy. All patients were followed up clinically and by
   renal scan.
   Results: Of the 92 cases (93 renal units), 6 were converted to open
   pyeloplasty. Dismembered pyeloplasty was performed in 59, Fengerplasty
   in 8, and Foley Y-V-plasty in 20 units. A crossing vessel was present in
   15 units (16.12\%). The mean estimated blood loss was 63.6 mL (range,
   30-200 mL). The mean operative time was 179.4 minutes (range 80-350
   minutes). Overall, 17 patients (18.4\%) had complications. Six patients
   had paralytic ileus and another six had increased drain output, which
   delayed the hospital stay to 7 days. Pyelonephritis and port-site hernia
   occurred in-one patient each. Four patients required ancillary
   procedures: ureteroscopy for a migrating stent (1), percutaneous
   antegrade stenting (1), and SWL for residual stone (2). The mean
   hospital stay was 4 days (range 2-7 days). Of the 87 units (86
   patients), 81 (93.3\%) have shown improvement in symptoms and drainage
   pattern on renal scan at a mean follow-up of 12 (3-27) months.
   Conclusion: The transperitoneal approach to pyeloplasty is safe and
   effective, although patients with large stone bulk and multiple stones
   should be considered for an alternative approach. The double-J stent
   should be checked carefully for proper placement. Hemostasis of the cut
   margin of the renal pelvis, watertight anastomosis, and adequate
   drainage should also be ensured.}},

Abstract = {{Previous methods for estimating observer motion in a rigid 3D scene
   assume that image velocities can be measured at isolated points. When
   the observer is moving through a cluttered 3D scene such as a forest,
   however, pointwise measurements of image velocity are more challenging
   to obtain because multiple depths, and hence multiple velocities, are
   present in most local image regions. We introduce a method for
   estimating egomotion that avoids pointwise image velocity estimation as
   a first step. In its place, the direction of motion parallax in local
   image regions is estimated, using a spectrum-based method, and these
   directions are then combined to directly estimate 3D observer motion.
   There are two advantages to this approach. First, the method can be
   applied to a wide range of 3D cluttered scenes, including those for
   which pointwise image velocities cannot be measured because only normal
   velocity information is available. Second, the egomotion estimates can
   be used as a posterior constraint on estimating pointwise image
   velocities, since known egomotion parameters constrain the candidate
   image velocities at each point to a one-dimensional rather than a
   two-dimensional space. (c) 2005 Optical Society of America.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this article is to describe the development, validation
   and use of the Constructivist Multimedia Learning Environment Survey (
   CMLES). This questionnaire assesses teachers' and students' perceptions
   of the learning environment when students use online multimedia programs
   while teachers use constructivism as a referent for their teaching. The
   design of the questionnaire was based on a constructivist approach to
   learning and focused on the process of learning with the multimedia
   program and on the nature of that program. Before the use of the CMLES
   becomes widespread, it was important to determine whether it is valid
   and reliable. Therefore, a study involving 221 students in 12 high
   school classrooms into statistical validation and interpretive
   validation of the questionnaire was undertaken. For this sample of Grade
   10 and 11 students who completed the actual and preferred forms of the
   questionnaire, the CMLES scales demonstrated a high degree of internal
   consistency reliability ( with alpha reliability coefficients ranging
   from.73 to.82), as well as satisfactory factorial validity and
   discriminant validity. Therefore, the study supports the reliability and
   validity of the CMLES for assessing students' and teachers' perceptions
   of one important aspect in evaluating learning environments which
   promote the use of multimedia programs and constructivist learning
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess long-term outcome of
   Orr-Loygue rectopexy and Delorme's procedures in total rectal prolapse
   management. METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively from 1978 to
   2001. Statistical analysis was performed by chi-squared test and
   Student's t-test. RESULTS: One hundred nine patients underwent either a
   Orr-Loygue rectopexy (49 patients) or a Delorme's procedure (60
   patients). Mean follow-up was 88 (range, 1-300) months. In the rectopexy
   group, the overall complication rate and the recurrence rate were 33
   percent and 4 percent, respectively. In patients with preoperative
   constipation, this symptom was improved or completely resolved in 33
   percent and worsened in 58 percent postoperatively. Seventy-three
   percent of patients with preoperative incontinence were continent or had
   continence improvement postoperatively. In Delorme's group, overall
   complication and recurrence rates were 15 percent and 23 percent,
   respectively. Mortality was 7 percent. In patients with preoperative
   constipation, this symtom was improved or completely resolved in 54
   percent and worsened in 12.5 percent of patients postoperatively.
   Forty-two percent of patients with preoperative incontinence were
   continent or had continence improvement postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: In
   this study, Orr-Loygue rectopexy had a lower long-term recurrence rate.
   However, this surgical procedure is associated with a higher
   complication rate. We believe that Delorme's procedure is still a
   valuable option in selected patients with postoperative minimal
   morbidity but higher recurrence rate.}},

Abstract = {{Jorge Lobo's disease is a cutaneous/subcutaneous mycosis with a chronic
   course, caused by the fungus Lacazia loboi. Considering its epidemiology
   and the few studies on immunological aspects of this disease, the
   objective of the present study was to investigate a possible association
   between HLA class H specificities in 21 Jorge Lobo's disease patients,
   by comparing them with healthy individual of the same ethnic group. HLA
   typing was performed using PCR-SSP method. The result did not show any
   association between HLA antigens and Jorge Lobo's disease. Although not
   statistically significant, a decreased frequency of HLA-DR7 was observed
   in the patients compared to the controls (0\% x 18\%). This suggests a
   negative association (protective) between HLA-DR7 and Jorge Lobo's
   disease. Further studies, however, are needed for a better understanding
   of the susceptibility and/or protection mechanisms involved.}},

Abstract = {{The alpha(2) adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan enhances antipsychotic
   efficacy of classical dopamine D-2 antagonists in treatment-resistant
   schizophrenia. The mechanisms are not fully understood, but we have
   previously shown that the combination of idazoxan with the D-2/3
   receptor antagonist raclopride, similarly to clozapine but not classical
   antipsychotic drugs, augments dopamine efflux in the prefrontal cortex,
   and also generates an enhanced suppression of the conditioned avoidance
   response. We have now investigated the effects of clozapine, raclopride,
   idazoxan and the combination of raclopride and idazoxan on (i)
   electrically evoked excitatory post-synaptic potentials and currents in
   pyramidal cells of the rat medial prefrontal cortex, using intracellular
   electrophysiological recording in vitro, (ii) the impaired cognitive
   function induced by the selective N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
   antagonist MK-801, using the 8-arm radial maze test, (iii) the in-vivo
   D-2, alpha(2A) and alpha(2C) receptor occupancies of these
   pharmacological treatments, using ex-vivo autoradiography. Whereas
   neither idazoxan nor raclopride alone had any effect, the combination
   exerted the same facilitation of glutamatergic transmission in rat
   prefrontal pyramidal neurons as clozapine, and this effect was found to
   be mediated by dopamine acting at D, receptors. Similarly to clozapine,
   the combination of idazoxan and raclopride also completely reversed the
   working-memory impairment in rats induced by MK-801. Moreover, these
   effects of the two treatment regimes were obtained at similar
   occupancies at D-2 alpha(2A) and alpha(2C) receptors respectively. Our
   results provide novel neurobiological and behavioural support for a
   pro-cognitive effect of adjunctive use of idazoxan with antipsychotic
   drugs that lack appreciable alpha(2) adrenoceptor-blocking properties,
   and define presynaptic alpha(2) adrenoceptors as major targets in
   antipsychotic drug development.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Signaling through adrenergic receptors (ARs) by
   norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (Epi) regulates weight gain when
   mice are fed a high-fat diet (HFD) by controlling diet-induced
   thermogenesis. Thus, one would predict that mice unable to make NE/Epi
   because of inactivation of the dopamine beta-hydroxylase gene (Dbh-null
   mice) would have a propensity to become obese. We characterized the
   response of Dbh-null and control mice to a HFD.
   Research Methods and Procedures: Dbh-null and control mice were fed an
   HFD or a regular diet (RD) for 2 months. Body weight, adiposity, muscle
   triglyceride levels, and adipocyte size were measured, as were
   circulating leptin, adiponectin, triglyceride, glucose, and insulin
   levels. A glucose tolerance test was also preformed.
   Results: Dbh-null mice gain weight normally on an HFD and have the same
   adiposity. Their serum triglyceride and leptin levels are normal, but
   adipocytes are similar to 30\% smaller than controls. Dbh-null mice
   maintain low blood glucose levels and glucose tolerance when exposed to
   the HFD in contrast to controls.
   Discussion: Complete lack of NE/Epi does not predispose to obesity.
   Because mice lacking all three PARS become obese on an HFD, an imbalance
   of signaling through alpha- and PARS seems to be responsible for
   obesity. Surprisingly, Dbh-null mice maintain glucose tolerance.}},

   improvement in function after surgery. The goal of the present study was
   to evaluate the ability of health-status instruments to measure early

   Methods: Four hundred and six patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty
   and 266 patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty completed
   health-status questionnaires preoperatively and six months
   postoperatively to determine the standardized response mean. In the
   second phase of the study, a group of patients undergoing knee and hip
   arthroplasty were evaluated with several instruments before and after
   surgery to test for postoperative ceiling effects.
   Results: The standardized response mean at six months was 1.7 for the
   MODEMS Hip Core, 1.2 for the MODEMS Knee Core, and 1.5 and 1.1 for the
   Physical Component Summary of the SF-36 for patients managed with hip
   and knee replacement, respectively. A standardized response mean of 1.0
   is generally satisfactory for measuring improvement in orthopaedic
   surgery. In Phase 2 of the study, the vast majority of patients who had
   a score of 95 to 100 (that is, a maximum or near-maximum score) on the
   joint-specific scales generally believed that the hip or knee was normal
   and could not be better.
   Conclusions: The MODEMS, Oxford, and WOMAC scales all demonstrated a
   ceiling effect following total knee and total hip arthroplasty. These
   scores likely reflected the patients' perception of the status of the
   knee or hip rather than an inability to measure their improvement beyond
   the highest possible score. The Physical Component Summary score of the
   SF-36 had similar standardized response means when compared with hip and
   knee-specific instruments, and, therefore, consideration should be given
   to using this scale without a joint-specific scale for the measurement
   of improvement following total knee and total hip replacement, as a way
   to decrease responder burden (that is, the time required to complete the
   questionnaires).}},

Abstract = {{Metissage, bricolage, or hybridizing-the argument continues over the
   appropriateness of metaphors in the stud-v of contemporary religious
   Productions, and we are invited to question and confront the dialectical
   or ``dialogical{''} processes which are tit work in the appropriation of
   differences, and the handling of disputes which are part of these
   processes. A detour by way of all that is involved in the Christian
   invention of African identities, all that individuals and groups have
   invested in that invention, the remnant of the colonial encounter, all
   this contributes to the comparisons which are made in the present
   writing, and to its conclusions. When we speak of the post-modern
   re-enchantment with metissage, with its subversive transgressions
   exemplified by hybridization, or of our fascination with a vanishing
   bricolage which now is breaking lip into simple collage, we may regret
   the way in which the fecundity of misunderstandings inherent in any
   encounter has been cancelled, and especially the ambivalent postures
   which beset the worlds of cultural mixture, and which contribute to

   Based on the investigation and simulated predictions, device design
   guidelines for 4T-XMOSFETs are proposed. Decreasing the workfunction of
   the DGs and increasing the oxide thickness of the second gate (T,,2) are
   preferable for improving the performance of the 4T-XMOSFET. The optimum

Journal = {{EQUINE VETERINARY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{468-472}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Reasons for performing study: Clinicians are often asked to guide owners
   and trainers over the relative advantages and disadvantages of equine
   castration performed in either the standing horse with an open unsutured
   scrotal wound with healing by second intention, or a recumbent horse
   under general anaesthesia in aseptic conditions, with sutured scrotal
   skin allowing primary wound closure.
   Objectives: To identify types and frequency of complications following
   the 2 differing approaches, and to compare the financial cost associated
   with each procedure, based on practice charges.
   Methods: Veterinary expenses of 217 horses castrated by a Newmarket
   equine veterinary practice over an 18-month period were analysed. Of
   these, Group I (n = 121) were castrated standing and nonsutured by one
   of 2 ambulatory clinicians and Group 2 (n = 96) castrated in recumbency,
   in aseptic equine hospital conditions.
   Results: Group I had a complication prevalence of 22\% with no
   mortalities, and Group 2 a significantly lower complication prevalence
   of 6\% (P = 0.001) with a mortality rate of 1\%. The financial cost of
   Group 1, without complications, was approximately one-third of the cost
   of uncomplicated Group 2. However, the cost of Group I with
   complications increased to approximately two-thirds of the cost of an
   uncomplicated Group 2 castration.
   Conclusions: Even though the complication prevalence for Group I
   castrations leaving an open scrotal wound was significantly higher than
   for a recumbent horse with a sutured scrotal wound in a hospital, the
   average cost of Group I was still less, even taking into account the
   additional follow-up costs associated with treating such complications.
   Potential relevance: This report provides a benchmark for the outcome of
   2 methods of castration based on a database obtained from particular
   circumstances within the practice involved. Further studies are required
   to corroborate and take into account future development in surgical and
   anaesthetic techniques.}},

Abstract = {{About 80\% of female patients with Rett syndrome (RTT) display a
   mutation in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene, but most
   males with MECP2 mutation experience severe fatal encephalopathy or
   non-specific X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). The existence of male
   RTT has been extensively discussed. We report herein a boy with classic
   RTT in a family with a missense mutation in MECP2. The mother exhibited
   slight mental retardation and was a carrier for R133C. The patient could
   stand with support at 12-months-old, and stereotypic hand movements
   appeared at 3-years-old. He became bed-ridden by 8-years-old. The R133C
   mutation was present in MECP2 without somatic mosaicism. A sister with
   R133C displayed classic RTT. The R133C mutation has been detected in
   female patients with classic and preserved speech variant RTT, but not
   in males with non-specific XLMR. These results suggest that clinical
   phenotypes caused by DNA mutation in MECP2 are determined by position of
   the mutation in the gene, and R133 represents a critical amino acid
   residue in the induction of RTT symptoms in humans. (c) 2004 Elsevier

Abstract = {{On the basis of the observation of depressive patients in hospital, the
   article critically scrutinizes existing psychoanalytic concepts of
   depression. While depression requires a specific psychic disposition on
   the part of the individual, it only manifests itself in object
   relations. It is an inhibition of psychic functions, probably on an
   organic basis, which is triggered by a psychic conflict. The effect of
   this inhibition is to restrict psychic functions to a regressive level.
   Observations in hospital indicate that every instance of depression has
   a regressive functional level at which psychic processes can unfold more
   freely. As a result, the suffering caused by the depression is
   mitigated, if not suspended altogether. Depression is triggered by a
   relational conflict that withdraws narcissistic support from the
   patient. The question of how this is to be properly understood is
   examined here in the light of recent developmental psychology of an
   analytic persuasion and of research on attachment. Much that appears to
   hinge on contradictions between conflicting theories can thus be
   understood as different aspects of the processes taking place in
   depression.}},

Abstract = {{VSH-1 is a mitomycin C-inducible prophage of the anaerobic spirochete
   Brachyspira hyodysenteriae. Purified VSH-1 virions are noninfectious,
   contain random 7.5-kb fragments of the bacterial genome, and mediate
   generalized transduction of B. hyodysenteriae cells. In order to
   identify and sequence genes of this novel gene transfer agent (GTA),
   proteins associated either with VSH-1 capsids or with tails were
   purified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
   The N-terminal amino acid sequences of 11 proteins were determined.
   Degenerate PCR primers were designed from the amino acid sequences and
   used to amplify several VSH-1 genes from B. hyodysenteriae strain B204
   DNA. A lambda clone library of B. hyodysenteriae B204 DNA was
   subsequently screened by Southern hybridization methods and used to
   identify and sequence overlapping DNA inserts containing additional
   VSH-1 genes. VSH-1 genes spanned 16.3 kb of the B. hyodysenteriae
   chromosome and were flanked by bacterial genes. VSH-1 identified genes
   and unidentified, intervening open reading frames were consecutively
   organized in head (seven genes), tail (seven genes), and lysis (four
   genes) clusters in the same transcriptional direction. Putative lysis
   genes encoding endolysin (Lys) and holin proteins were identified from
   sequence and structural similarities of their translated protein
   products with GenBank bacteriophage proteins. Recombinant Lys protein
   hydrolyzed peptidoglycan purified from B. hyodysenteriae cells. The
   identified VSH-1 genes exceed the DNA capacity of VSH-1 virions and do
   not encode traditional bacteriophage early functions involved in DNA
   replication. These genome properties explain the noninfectious nature of
   VSH-1 virions and further confirm its resemblance to known
   prophage-like, GTAs of other bacterial species, such as the GTA from
   Rhodobacter capsulatus. The identification of VSH-1 genes will enable
   analysis of the regulation of this GTA and should facilitate
   investigations of VSH-1-like prophages from other Brachyspira species.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy Ion Telescope (HIT) is an instrument onboard the Japanese
   satellite ``TSUBASA{''}, which was launched in February 2002 for the
   observation of heavy ions in radiation belts. The HIT instrument, based
   on the Delta E x E particle identification method, consists of two
   position-sensitive silicon detectors and 16 PIN-type Si detectors with
   420 mu m in thickness. The geometric factor varies from 12 to 18 cm(2)
   sr being dependent on the energy of ions. This instrument was designed
   to measure the fluxes of heavy ions from He to Fe nuclei in the energy
   range from 18 to 179 MeV/n, though dependent on the nuclear species to
   be measured. The nuclear charge separation in this instrument was highly
   sophisticated as 0.06 charge units for nuclei such as C and 0, for
   instances, in observing energetic ions from He to Fe. Furthermore,
   isotopic separation was sufficient for the observations of nuclei such
   as He, Ne, Mg and Si. The observation of energetic ions in radiation
   belts was successfully achieved during both quiet and disturbed periods
   of solar activity. The detector system and observational results of ions
   in the radiation belts are described as the performance of the HIT
   instrument in space.}},

Abstract = {{5-Fluorouracil (FU) is a chemotherapeutic agent commonly used against
   esophageal cancer. Recently, interferons (IFNs) have been administered
   together with cytotoxic chemotherapy to patients with this cancer,
   although the mechanisms of synergy are unknown. We reconsidered the
   mechanisms for the effects of 5-FU in this context, aiming to refine
   combination therapy. After three cell lines (T.T, TE-2, and TE-6),
   derived from human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), were
   exposed to 5-FU, the expression profiles were analyzed using
   high-density oligonucleotide microarrays representing about 12,000
   genes. Among them, three IFN-related genes, an IFN receptor gene
   (IFNAR2) and two IFN-stimulated genes (ISG15K, ISG-54K), that were
   up-regulated following addition of 5-FU, were investigated. Upregulation
   was confirmed by RT-PCR. Based on these results, the antitumor effects
   of exposure to 5-FU simultaneously with IFN-alpha, -beta and -gamma were
   investigated. The growth of esophageal SCC cells with 5-FU was
   suppressed synergistically or semi-additively by IFN-alpha and -beta,
   but not by IFN-gamma. These findings indicated that 5-FU stimulated IFN
   pathways in esophageal SCC cells following tip-regulation of the IFN
   type I receptor. A combination of 5-FU and an IFN, therefore, may be
   particularly efficacious in esophageal cancer.}},

   she had felt more irritable, sad, anxious, or depressed since the birth,
   but not to her current mood as rated by her score on the Edinburgh
   Postnatal Depression Scale (Cox, Holden \& Sagovsky, 1987). The

   comparison with A9+1. The latter is derived from A9 cells by
   introduction of human chromosome 1. In spite of the telomerase presence,
   a great decrease in telomere lengths was noticed in A9+1 compared to A9
   cells. Behavior of individual human and mouse telomeres was also

   Human chromosome I followed the overall telomere length in hybrid cells.

Abstract = {{The essence of dermatology is morphology. The most important instrument
   in the practice of dermatology has always been, and still is, the naked
   eye; however, ``We see only what we are ready to see, what we have been
   taught to see{''} (Jean Martin Charcot). Although most practitioners
   will easily correctly diagnose common bacterial skin diseases (such as
   cellulitis, erysipelas, impetigo, etc), only a trained and updated
   dermatologist will recognize the unusual forms and rare variants of
   these diseases. Bacterial skin diseases are sometimes acute and
   life-threatening. The mortality rates from necrotizing fasciitis range
   from 20\% to 40\%, to name just one example. It is not unreasonable to
   expect that dermatologists, whether in clinical practice or in referral
   centers, will be the first physicians to be confronted with unusual
   variants of bacterial skin diseases that have been unrecognized by
   nondermatologists. Some of these cases might even be life-threatening,
   and only prompt and early recognition, diagnosis, and treatment can make
   the difference between losing and saving a patient's life. In short, we
   dermatologists should hone our clinical diagnostic skills and expand our
   knowledge of the rare forms and unusual and atypical variants of skin
   diseases: the textbook variants will probably be recognized and treated
   by general practitioners. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Diabetes mellitus is common among elderly persons, with
   several potential complications that could contribute to falls. However,
   diabetes mellitus is not widely recognized as an important risk factor
   for falls among elderly persons. Accordingly, the purpose of the current
   study was to determine whether diabetes is an independent risk factor
   for falls in elderly residents of a long-term care facility.
   Methods. Ours was a prospective cohort study of 139 elderly (88 7 years,
   range 70-105 years), Caucasian (97\%) residents (women, 84\%) of a
   long-term care facility. Inclusion criteria were age >= 60 years,
   ability to rise from a seated position, informed consent obtained from
   participant or guardian. Multiple domains were assessed for the
   association with falls including: clinical diagnoses; medication use;
   orthostatic changes in blood pressure, gait. or balance:
   cognitive/mental status; general well being; activities of daily living;
   affect/behavior range of motion and/or ambulation: and communication.
   Diabetes mellitus was determined by use of hypoglycemic agents. Time to
   first fall was determined by review of daily New York State mandated
   ``Incident and Accident{''} reports.
   Results. Over the follow-up period (mean 299 days), 49 participants
   (35\%) experienced a fall. The fall incidence rate for the participants
   with and without diabetes mellitus was 78\% and 30\%, respectively (p
   <.001). The significant unadjusted hazard ratios of fall risk factors
   included diabetes mellitus, Berg Balance Scale score <45, number of
   medications, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,
   hypertension, use of assistive device. inability to independently move a
   wheelchair, and use of antidepressants. with the latter two factors
   being protective. In multivariate analysis, only diabetes (adjusted
   hazard ratio 4.03; 95\% confidence interval, 1.96-8.28) and gait and
   balance (adjusted hazard ratio 5.26; 95\% confidence interval,
   1.26-22.02) were significantly and independently associated with an
   increased risk of falls.
   Conclusions. Our results suggest that diabetes mellitus is an
   independent fall risk factor among elderly nursing home residents.}},

Abstract = {{A universal response to changes in cellular oxygen tension is governed
   by a family of heterodimeric transcription factors called
   hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). Tumor hypoxia, as well as various
   cancer-causing mutations, has been shown to elevate the level of HIF-1
   alpha, signifying a critical role of the HIF pathway in cancer
   development. The recently identified third member of the human HIF-alpha
   family, HIF-3 alpha, produces multiple splice variants that contain
   extra DNA binding elements and protein-protein interaction motifs not
   found in HIF-1 alpha or HIF-2 alpha. Here we report the molecular
   cloning of the alternatively spliced human HIF-3 alpha variant HIF-3
   alpha 4 and show that it attenuates the ability of HIF-1 to bind
   hypoxia-responsive elements located within the enhancer/promoter of HIF
   target genes. The overexpression of HIF-3 alpha 4 suppresses the
   transcriptional activity of HIF-1 and siRNA-mediated knockdown of the
   endogenous HIF-3 alpha 4 increases transcription by hypoxia-inducible
   genes. HIF3 alpha 4 itself is oxygen-regulated, suggesting a novel
   feedback mechanism of controlling HIF-1 activity. Furthermore, the
   expression of HIF-3 alpha 4 is dramatically down-regulated in the
   majority of primary renal carcinomas. These results demonstrate an
   important dominant-negative regulation of HIF-1-mediated gene
   transcription by HIF-3 alpha 4 in vivo and underscore its potential
   significance in renal epithelial oncogenesis.}},

Title = {{A performance-based structural policy for conflict-free routing of

Volume = {{56}},

Abstract = {{Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) play an important role in flexible
   manufacturing systems. One of the key issues of using AGVs is the
   conflict-free routing especially when the AGV system is bi-directional.
   Two classes of routing algorithms have been proposed in the literature:
   Optimised pre-planning algorithms, and Real-time routing algorithms.
   Pre-planning algorithm present the advantage of producing optimal
   conflict-free routes, but do not deal with changing situations such as
   vehicle delays and failures. Real-time algorithms present the advantage
   of being reactive, but are non-optimal. In this paper, we propose to
   combine the advantages of both. We use a two-stage approach: In the
   first control stage, a pre-planning method to establish the fastest
   conflict-free routes for AGVs. In the second stage, conflicts are
   avoided in a real-time manner when needed. The objective of this last is
   the avoidance of deadlocks in presence of interruptions while
   maintaining the established AGVs' routes. Two robust routing algorithms
   are presented. The efficiency of our approach is analysed using
   developed simulations. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is present in abundance in serum resulting
   from platelet activation and is also found in other biological fluids.
   LPA controls numerous cellular responses and plays a role in specific
   functions such as wound healing, especially in the skin. Nevertheless,
   its presence in the skin has never been investigated. Since
   reepithelialization occurs after blister rupture, we tested the presence
   of endogenous LPA in blister fluid and investigated a possible mechanism
   for its biosynthesis and biological functions. Using a radioenzymatic
   assay, LPA was detected in 33 blister fluids originating from 24 bullous
   dermatoses, and at higher concentrations than in plasma. In parallel,
   blister fluids contained a lysophospholipase D (LPLD) activity but no
   detectable phospholipase A(2) activity. The expressions of the LPLD
   autotaxin (ATX) and of LPA1-receptor (LPA1-R) were greatly increased in
   blister skin when compared with normal skin. Finally, LPA was found to
   have a positive effect on the migration of cultured keratinocytes. These
   results show that LPA is present in blister fluid synthesized by the
   LPLD ATX. Due to its ability to enhance keratinocyte migration, LPA in
   blister fluid could, via the LPA1-R, play an important role in
   re-epithelialization occurring after blister rupture.}},

Abstract = {{We retrospectively reviewed 183 consecutive patients diagnosed with
   giant cell tumor at the three most common sites (distal femur, proximal
   tibia, and distal radius) to determine the pattern of local tumor
   recurrence and the impact severity of the recurrence on adjacent joint
   function. The primary tumor was treated in all patients with
   intralesional excision of tumor by curettage. Forty-five patients
   developed locally recurrent disease. Twenty-three of the patients had
   their first surgery at our institution, and 22 had been referred from
   other institutions after the development of local recurrence. The
   intrainstitutional recurrences were salvaged by a repeat curettage (n =
   12) or en bloc osteoarticular resection (n = 10) for bone recurrences
   and wide local excision for soft tissue recurrence (n = 1). The
   prereferral recurrences were salvaged by a repeat curettage (n = 7) and
   en bloc osteoarticular resection (n = 15) for bone recurrences.
   Incomplete initial surgery, a delay in diagnosis of the recurrence of
   greater than 6 months, and subchondral recurrence of tumor were
   contributing factors in the failure to salvage the joint. Despite its
   benign histology, giant cell tumor of bone is an aggressive tumor that
   demands meticulous attention to surgical detail and close postoperative
   surveillance for successful local tumor control and durable,
   joint-preserving function.}},

Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{547-559}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: Birth weight is known to fluctuate with month of birth and
   with latitude-, however the mechanisms underlying these gradients remain
   unclear.
   Aim: The study examined within-year fluctuations in birth weight across
   four regions in Australia.
   Subjects and methods: We obtained the birth weight of singleton births
   of at least 37 weeks gestation from four regions: (a) southeast
   Queensland, (b) Sydney and surrounding districts, (c) Victoria, and (d)
   Tasmania. Seasonal fluctuations were examined after long-term trends had
   been removed. The amplitude, timing and variability of seasonal
   fluctuations were examined and compared across regions.
   Results: Each of the four regions had prominent annual periodicity with
   the peak birth weight occurring in spring. The amplitude of this signal
   ranged from 1.4g (Victoria) to 7.7g (southeast Queensland). There was no
   significant correlation between the amplitude of these fluctuations and
   the latitude of four regions. In addition, a second smaller autumn peak
   was identified.
   Conclusion: Environmental factors that have regular within-year
   variation influence birth weight in Australia. The evidence suggests
   that at least two distinguishable seasonal processes contribute to the
   findings. Identifying the factors underlying these seasonal fluctuations
   could have implications from a public health perspective.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To evaluate the dehydroascorbate (DHA) transport mechanisms
   in human chondrocytes.
   Methods. The transport of L- C-14-DRA in human chondrocytes was analyzed
   under various conditions, including the use of RNA interference (RNAi),
   to determine kthe role of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) and GLUT-3 in
   L- C-14-DRA transport and to evaluate the effects of physiologically
   relevant oxygen tensions on L-C-14-DRA transport. In order to estimate
   the contributions of reduced ascorbic acid (AA) and DHA to intracellular
   ascorbic acid (Asc), the quantities of AA and DHA were measured in
   synovial fluid samples from osteoarthritis (OA) patients and compared
   with the reported levels in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.
   Results. DHA transport in human chondrocytes was glucose-sensitive,
   temperature-dependent, cytochalasin B-inhibitable, modestly
   stereoselective for L-DHA, and up-regulated by low oxygen tension. Based
   on the RNAi results, GLUT-1 mediated, at least in part, the uptake of
   DHA, whereas GLUT-3 had a minimal effect on DHA transport. DHA
   constituted a mean 8\% of the total Asc in the synovial fluid of OA
   joints, in contrast to 80\% of the reported total Asc in RA joints.
   Conclusion. We provide the first evidence that chondrocytes transport
   DHA via the GLUTs and that this transport mechanism is modestly
   selective for L-DRA. In the setting of up-regulated DHA transport at low
   oxygen tensions, DHA would contribute 26\% of the total intracellular
   Asc in OA chondrocytes and 94\% of that in RA chondrocytes. These
   results demonstrate that DHA is a physiologically relevant source of Asc
   for chondrocytes, particularly in the setting of an inflammatory
   arthritis, such as RA.}},

Abstract = {{Ultra low frequency (ULF) waves incident on the Earth are produced by
   processes in the magnetosphere and solar wind. These processes produce a
   wide variety of ULF hydromagnetic wave types that are classified on the
   ground as either Pi or Pc pulsations (irregular or continuous). Waves of
   different frequencies and polarizations originate in different regions
   of the magnetosphere. The location of the projections of these regions
   onto the Earth depends on the solar wind dynamic pressure and magnetic
   field. The occurrence of various waves also depends on conditions in the
   solar wind and in the magnetosphere. Changes in orientation of the
   interplanetary magnetic field or an increase in solar wind velocity can
   have dramatic effects on the type of waves seen at a particular location
   on the Earth. Similarly, the occurrence of a magnetospheric substorm or
   magnetic storm will affect which waves are seen. The magnetosphere is a
   resonant cavity and waveguide for waves that either originate within or
   propagate through the system. These cavities respond to broadband
   sources by resonating at discrete frequencies. These cavity modes couple
   to field line resonances that drive currents in the ionosphere. These
   currents reradiate the energy as electromagnetic waves that propagate to
   the ground. Because these ionospheric currents are localized in latitude
   there are very rapid variations in wave phase at the Earth's surface.
   Thus it is almost never correct to assume that plane ULF waves are
   incident on the Earth from outer space. The properties of ULF waves seen
   at the ground contain information about the processes that generate them
   and the regions through which they have propagated. The properties also
   depend on the conductivity of the Earth underneath the observer.
   Information about the state of the solar wind and the magnetosphere
   distributed by the NOAA Space Disturbance Forecast Center can be used to
   help predict when certain types and frequencies of waves will be
   observed. The study of ULF waves is a very active field of space
   research and much has yet to be learned about the processes that
   generate these waves.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background. Liver enzymes fluctuate in chronic hepatitis C virus
   infection. However, the range that can be attributed to the course of
   hepatitis C virus (versus an intercurrent cause of hepatitis) is
   unknown.
   Aims. To characterise the range of liver enzyme values as a function of
   the upper limit of normal (ULN) of the assay among persons chronically
   infected with hepatitis C virus.
   Patients. One thousand and fifty-nine hepatitis C virus chronically
   infected individuals with >= 5 semi-annual evaluations.
   Methods. Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels
   were prospectively obtained. Potential causes of elevations were
   examined using serologic testing.
   Results. Among 1059 individuals, 11,463 enzyme measurements were
   obtained over 6.5 years, of which 63.5\% were < 1.25 x ULN, 26.5\% were
   1.25-2.5x ULN, 8.3\% were 2.5-5x ULN, and 1.6\% were 5-10x ULN; only
   0.2\% were > 10x ULN. Elevations > 10x ULN were transient, the alanine
   aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase ratio tended to be different
   at the time of the elevation compared to before and after and 24\% were
   associated with acute viral hepatitis. On the other hand, subjects with
   elevations 5-10x ULN tended to have elevated levels throughout follow-up
   and only 8\% were associated with acute viral hepatitis.
   Conclusions. Liver enzymes fluctuate up to 5 x ULN in most hepatitis C
   virus-infected persons; clinicians should seek alternate explanations
   for those with higher alanine aminotransferase or aspartate
   aminotransferase levels, especially among hepatitis C virus-infected
   persons with greater than 10-fold elevations. (c) 2005 Editrice

Abstract = {{Preeclampsia and diabetes are complications of pregnancy that contribute
   to maternal and perinatal mortality worldwide. Results emerging from
   molecular studies of placentae may elucidate etiologically important
   genomic alterations. Appropriate application of real time reverse
   transcription (RT) PCR in comparative gene expression studies requires
   endogenous housekeeping genes to normalize between sample variations.
   Ideal housekeeping genes must have stable tissue expression, but few
   have been specifically studied in the placenta. We sought to identify
   candidate control genes by analyzing seven functionally distinct
   housekeeping genes (B2M, GAPDH, HMBS, HPRT, SDHA, TBP, YWHAZ) for their
   expression stability and level in the placenta. mRNA isolated from 20
   placentae was analyzed for gene expression using RT-PCR. Expression
   stability (M) was assessed using normalization strategies previously
   used for other tissues. TBP and SDHA were the most stable, with an
   average expression stability of M = 0.43, followed by YWHAZ (M = 0.44) >
   HPRT (M = 0.53) > HMBS (M = 0.57) > GAPDH (M = 0.61) > B2M (M = 0.69).
   The genes tested ranged in abundance, with an approximately 300-fold
   increase from the lowest (HMBS) to the highest (B2M). By using TBP, SDHA
   and YWHAZ, with greater expression stability than those housekeeping
   genes commonly used in placenta studies, gene expression profile
   comparisons will have more sensitivity and specificity.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose. There is increasing evidence for gender differences in the
   pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anaesthetic drugs and
   neuromuscular blocking agents, e.g. rocuronium (Roc). Females require
   30\% less Roc than males to achieve the same degree of neuromuscular
   block and onset times are shorter. However, whether this leads to an
   improvement of the intubation conditions in females is unclear.
   Methods. After approval of the ethics committee 60 female and 60 male
   patients were each randomised into 2 groups to receive 0.6 mg/kg body
   weight Roc or 1.0 mg/kg succinylcholine (Sux; control group). Induction:
   thiopentone (5 mg/kg), fentanyl (3 mu g/kg) then Roc (Roc groups) or Sux
   (Sux groups) and tracheal intubation after 60 s. Time to intubation,
   glottic exposure and intubating conditions were assessed.
   Results. Men were significantly larger and heavier (p < 0.001) than
   women, but the body mass index was comparable (ns). Number of attempts,
   time to intubation, and Cormack grades were comparable (ns). However,
   the rate of clinically acceptable intubation conditions was
   significantly higher in the female compared to the male Roc group: 80\%
   vs 47\%, p < 0.05. The incidence of clinically acceptable intubation
   conditions in the female Roc and Sux groups were similar (80\%).
   Conclusion. The intubation conditions after Roc were significantly
   better in women than in men. The differences were Roc-related and did
   not occur in the control groups.}},

Abstract = {{Suicide is one of the leading causes of death today in the Western
   world, and most people have had suicidal ideation at some time during
   their life. In the population of persons with intellectual disability,
   some researchers have thought that impaired intellectual capacity could
   act as a buffer to suicidal behavior, but the fact is that the few
   studies conducted in that population contest this assumption and show
   that the characteristics of suicidality in this population are very
   similar to persons without intellectual disability. This paper reviews
   the studies conducted and describe the symptomatology in this
   population. Professionals working with this population should,
   therefore, be aware of and assess for this behavior. Sadness, or
   depression, are symptoms that could indicate later suicidal behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Animals are often confronted with environmental challenges and the way
   in which they cope with these challenges can have important fitness
   consequences. There is increasing evidence that individuals differ
   consistently in their reaction to the environment (personality traits).
   However, little is known about whether different life-styles (e.g.,
   resident or migratory) influence personality traits and if so, in what
   manner.
   We compared neophobic and exploratory behaviours, both of which play an
   important role in personality traits, between two closely related
   species, the resident Sardinian warblers and the migratory garden
   warblers, at two different times during the year. Neophobia was tested
   by placing it novel object, a mop, beside the feeding dish and measuring
   the latency to feed (neophobia score). Exploration was tested by
   offering another novel object, a tube, attached to a perch at it neutral
   location and measuring latency to approach and investigate the tube
   (exploration score). Both tests were carried out at the end of the
   breeding season and repeated ten months later in spring. The Sardinian
   warblers showed consistent behavioural reactions over time. Furthermore,
   neophobia and exploration scores were negatively related. The garden
   warblers neither behaved consistently over time nor was there it
   correlation between neophobia and exploration. Overall, Sardinian
   warblers were less neophobic and more explorative than garden warblers.
   The different reactivity may be due to a different frequency
   distribution of the individuals of the two species along a reactivity
   axis.
   It can be concluded that the Sardinian warblers have personality traits.
   The situation is less clear in the garden warblers. Possibly, different
   life-styles require different organisation of behaviours.}},

Abstract = {{In patients with severe asymptornatic aortic stenosis (AS), the decision

   mortality from sudden death is low (about 0.4\% per year).
   The aim of the stress test is to detect patients who are falsely
   asymptomatic (due to subconscious self limitation of daily physical
   activity) for whom aortic valvular replacement should be proposed
   because of the risk of sudden death. On the other hand, if the stress
   test is negative (normal blood pressure elevation on effort, absence of
   either any symptoms, ST segment depression of more than 2mm, or severe
   ventricular rhythm disorders linked to effort), surgical intervention
   could (and probably should) be postponed.
   This article presents the studies which as an aid to the decision of

Abstract = {{The Agricultural Engineering Section of the International Society of
   Sugar Cane Technologists (ISSCT) held a workshop between 12 and 17
   October 2003 in Thibodaux, Louisiana, United States of America. The
   papers presented at the workshop were grouped under the following
   general headings: burnt versus green cane harvesting, land preparation
   and planting, trash management, crop maintenance and machinery costing
   and benchmarking. The five-day workshop program included two field tours
   in Louisiana as well as a post-workshop one-day tour of the Florida
   sugar industry. In this paper, the main issues emerging from the
   deliberations are discussed, and the issues that remain to be resolved
   are highlighted. The conclusions drawn were that modern chopper
   harvesters, under normal field and crop conditions, are capable of
   handling all but very heavy green cane crops. It was generally accepted
   that losses and extraneous matter levels are higher in green cane for
   both manual and mechanical harvesting systems. Furthermore, both manual
   and mechanical harvesting costs are higher in green cane compared to
   burnt cane. Best management practices for mechanical cane harvesting and
   planting were presented. While there are clear agronomic and
   environmental benefits in many environments from green cane harvesting,
   further research is required to study the impact that crop residues have
   on ratoon crops under cool or wet conditions. Alternative post harvest
   residue handling equipment and systems also need further evaluation,
   particularly as residues are a potentially important energy source. The
   principles and standards for a uniform machinery costing protocol based
   on the classical costing approach were presented and accepted. This
   would be beneficial when reporting machinery costs at workshops and
   congresses.}},

Abstract = {{Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) causes an immunosuppressive
   disease in chickens and leads to severe economic losses in the poultry
   industry. Vaccination may not be effective if there is exposure of the
   vaccinated flock to a different antigenic subtype, which reinforces the
   importance of identification of new IBDV variants. The virus outer
   capsid is constituted of VP2, in which the major neutralizing epitopes
   are located. Forty-eight bursa samples collected from IBDV infected
   commercial broiler flocks in the US were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR
   using probes designed for two epitope regions of VP2 denominated minor
   peak 1 and peak B. It was observed that 23, 48 and 44 samples tested
   with the minor peak probes Del-E, STC and F15, respectively, had a lower
   melting temperature (T-m) than expected. Furthermore, 44, 41 and 48
   samples tested with the Del-E, STC and F15 peak B probes, respectively,
   had a lower T-m compared to the control, which indicates the presence of
   one or more nucleotide mutations in the samples. This fact was confirmed
   by nucleotide sequencing which also demonstrated that most mutations
   resulted in amino acid substitutions. Real-time RT-PCR can be a useful
   tool to assist in the development of more effective vaccination
   strategies. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although it is commonly held that accessibility plays a role in house
   price determination, there is less explicit recognition that it is
   transportation infrastructure that is primarily delivering that
   accessibility. Large additions to the transportation infrastructure tend
   to be well studied, but there is a dearth of empirical research that
   investigates the house price impacts when local transportation
   infrastructure is incrementally invested in. If these smaller
   investments also impact accessibility, then there should be a measurable
   impact in the housing market. Although results show that this is in fact
   the case for Cuyahoga County, Ohio, over the years 1995-2000, the price
   impact is not universally positive. The nature of the price impact
   depends on the location of the investment, relative to the house and
   regional accessibility points, and on how long ago the investment was
   completed.}},

Abstract = {{Data from two inland Palaeo-Eskimo sites on southern Baffin Island are
   evidence for novice flintknapping. The interior of the island boasts a
   rich and reliable supply of lithic raw material, and the two sites were
   occupied during the Arctic warm season when access to it was
   unrestricted. The use of a direct procurement strategy to acquire the
   material at this time of year from such a localized source suggests that
   acquisition activities were structured exploitation strategies of the
   Palaco-Eskimos on southern as part of the seasonal resource ex e in
   Baffin Island. The incidence of novice flintknapping appears to be
   directly linked to this procurement. By drawing on data from published
   replicative studies and archaeological remains, socially meaningful
   patterns of idiosyncratic assemblage variability can be identified,
   providing greater insights into the social components of lithic tool
   production and skill apprenticeship.}},

Abstract = {{A 56-year-old man presented with a meningioma associated with
   hyperostotic bone containing little tumor cell infiltration. The patient
   presented with a growing mass on his right forehead and exophthalmos.
   Computed tomography (CT) taken 4 years previously revealed only
   hyperostosis without intracranial lesion. Repeat CT revealed an enhanced
   intracranial mass with overlying diffuse hyperostosis extending
   extracranially. The tumor and affected bone were widely removed.
   Histological examination confirmed rhabdoid meningioma in the
   intracranial and extracranial lesion. However, most of the hyperostotic
   bone showed no tumor cell infiltration. The cause of hyperostosis
   associated with meningioma is unclear, but tumor invasion is the
   generally accepted cause. In this case, hyperostosis occurred without
   tumor cell infiltration so another mechanism was probably involved. The
   extracranial extension occurred despite the disproportionately small
   tumor without global tumor cell infiltration of the bone or bony
   erosion.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{263-282}},
Month = {{FAL}},
Abstract = {{This paper systematically examines the extent to which Korean Protestant
   immigrants in the United States have transmitted their religion and
   cultural traditions through religion. It is based on a survey of 1.5-
   and 2nd-generation Korean American adults and a survey of Korean
   English-language congregations in the New York-New Jersey metropolitan
   area. Previous studies reveal that the majority of Korean immigrants are
   affiliated with a Korean Protestant church and that their frequent
   Participation in it enables them to preserve Korean cultural traditions.
   Results of our survey show that Korean Protestant immigrants are highly
   successful in transmitting their church-oriented style of Protestantism
   to the second generation. Approximately two-thirds of 1.5- and
   2nd-generation Korean American adults who attended a Protestant church
   during their childhood were found to participate in a Protestant
   congregation regularly, with more than two-thirds of them going to a
   Korean congregation. Moreover, they also participate in a congregation
   as frequently as Korean immigrants. However, our study shows that Korean
   Protestant immigrants have failed to transmit their cultural traditions
   through religion. Korean English-language congregations for 1.5- and
   2nd-generation Korean American Protestants have almost entirely
   eliminated Korean cultural components from worship services and other
   socio-cultural activities. Transmitting Korean cultural traditions
   through religion is difficult for Korean Protestant immigrants partly
   because there is a great dissociation between Korean Protestantism and
   Korean secular culture and partly because second-generation Korean
   American Protestants have embraced the white American evangelical
   subculture. Based on these findings, we argue that transmitting a
   religion does not necessarily help to transmit ethnic culture and ethnic
   identity unless there is a strong correlation between the two.}},

   Conclusion(s): Up-regulation of VEGF-A and receptors VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2
   in capillaries in menorrhagia could be involved in abnormal endometrial

Abstract = {{Three infants with infant botulism are presented to illustrate how
   atypical, early, and severe features may obscure or delay diagnosis. Two
   boys aged 6 weeks and 20 days, respectively, presented with rapid
   deterioration after brief periods of poor feeding, one with an apparent
   life- threatening event at home and the other with a full
   cardiopulmonary arrest. Initial abnormal laboratory findings of
   coagulopathy suggested sepsis in the first infant. In the second infant,
   severe acidosis and hypoglycemia suggested an underlying metabolic
   disorder. A third infant, aged 1 month, was hospitalized originally with
   an admitting diagnosis of `` pharyngitis{''} resulting from his
   inability to take adequate feedings. He received intravenous fluids and
   antibiotics. One week later he suffered a respiratory arrest. Laboratory
   findings of severe hyponatremia and acidosis at the time of his arrest
   suggested a metabolic etiology. Even retrospectively, none of these
   infants had the typical initial complaint of constipation, and none were
   noted to have ptosis or facial weakness before catastrophic collapse.
   However, in each case, the parent had initially brought the child to the
   physician for `` poor feeding{''} or `` poor suck,{''} which was not
   recognized by medical personnel as a result of bulbar weakness.
   Ultimately, all 3 infants were found to have infant botulism. All 3 had
   received antibiotics before catastrophic collapse, possibly contributing
   to the rapidity of the deterioration. Each recovered, although the delay
   in diagnosis made them ineligible for treatment with botulism
   immunoglobulin.}},

   RBSA-1 showed weak adsorption to raw corn starch over the wide pH range

   On the other hand, a liquefying type alpha-amylase (RBLA), purified from
   Bacillus sp., exhibited remarkable adsorption to raw starches tested
   over a wide pH range (5.0-9.0). This pH range corresponded to that
   suitable for the digestion of raw starches. The adsorption of RBSA-1 and

   of adsorption of RBSA-1 (70-85\%) was, much greater than that of RBLA
   (30-45\%). The hydrolysis of raw corn starch was specifically inhibited

Abstract = {{Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) participate in signaling
   initiated by a wide variety of extracellular stimuli. MAPKs are most
   commonly activated by a series of phosphorylation events in which one
   kinase phosphorylates another, the ``MAPK cascade{''}. The cascade
   concludes with the dual phosphorylation of MAPKs on a conserved
   Thr-X-Tyr motif. In the case of the p38 MAPK, an exception to this
   paradigm has been found when signaling via the T cell antigen receptor
   (TCR). Rather than trigger the MAPK cascade, TCR-mediated stimulation
   activates proximal tyrosine kinases, which results in the
   phosphorylation of p38 on a noncanonical activating residue, Tyr-323.
   This phosphorylation activates p38 to phosphorylate third party
   substrates as well as its own Thr-Gyl-Tyr motif. Here we discuss the
   structural and functional implications of this alternative p38
   activation pathway, which may provide a new target for tissue-specific
   pharmacologic inhibition.}},

   comparison of the human sodium/iodide symporter gene and HSV1-tk as the
   reporter gene}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{32}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Genes encoding for intracellular enzymes or transmembrane
   proteins are suitable as reporters, but may differ in terms of
   applicability for cardiac imaging. The aim of this study was to compare
   the human sodium iodide symporter gene (hNIS) with the herpes simplex
   virus type 1 thymidine kinase gene (HSV1-tk) as the reporter gene in
   non-invasive imaging of cardiac transgene expression with positron
   emission tomography ( PET).
   Methods: Equal doses of adenoviral vectors encoding for hNIS, wild-type
   HSV1-tk, mutant HSV1-sr39tk or LacZ as the control gene were directly
   injected into the myocardium of 34 animals. Two days later, dynamic PET
   was formed with a clinical scanner, using reporter probes specific for
   the respective reporter gene. Imaging with N-13-ammonia was also
   performed to identify cardiac regions of interest.
   Results: Kinetics differed significantly: I-124 as the probe for hNIS
   showed rapid early uptake, remaining stable overtime. Maximal myocardial
   concentration was 3.61 +/- 1.15\%. The nucleoside F-18-FHBG, as the
   specific probe for HSV1-sr39tk, showed increasing uptake over time, but
   maximal accumulation was significantly lower (1.45 +/- 0.54\%, P=
   0.0009). I-124-FIAU, as the specific probe for wild- type HSV1-tk,
   showed early uptake with subsequent washout. Maximal accumulation was
   lowest (0.63 +/- 0.23\%, P< 0.0001). Post-mortem analysis by
   autoradiography and gamma counting confirmed the in vivo data.
   Conclusion: Reporter genes encoding for transporter proteins such as
   hNIS are an attractive alternative to overexpression of intracellular
   enzymes for cardiac gene product imaging. hNIS yielded higher signal
   intensity and imaging contrast for PET than did HSV1-tk and HSV1-sr39tk.
   Therefore, this approach may be preferable for the future monitoring of
   cardiac gene- or cell-based therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Prograde eclogites occur in the Tonaru epidote amphibolite mass in the
   Sambagawa Metamorphic Belt of central Shikoku. The Tonaru mass is
   considered to be a metamorphosed layered gabbro, and occurs as a large
   tectonic block (approximately 6.5 km x 1 km) in a high-grade portion of
   the Sambagawa schists. The Tonaru mass experienced high-P/low-T prograde
   metamorphism from the epidote-blueschist facies to the eclogite facies
   prior to its emplacement into the Sambagawa schists. The estimated P-T
   conditions are T = 300-450 degrees C and P = 0.7-1.1 GPa for the
   epidote-blueschist facies, and the peak P-T conditions for the eclogite
   facies are T = 700-730 degrees C and P >= 1.5 GPa. Following the
   eclogite facies metamorphism, the Tonaru mass was retrograded to the
   epidote amphibolite facies. It subsequently underwent additional
   prograde Sambagawa metamorphism, together with the surrounding Sambagawa
   schists, until the conditions of the oligoclase-biotite zone were
   reached. The high-P/low-T prograde metamorphism of the eclogite facies
   in the Tonaru mass and other tectonic blocks show similar steep dP/dT
   geothermal gradients despite their diverse peak P-T conditions,
   suggesting that these tectonic blocks reached different depths in the
   subduction zone. The individual rocks in each metamorphic zone of the
   Sambagawa schists also recorded steep dP/dT geothermal gradients during
   the early stages of the Sambagawa prograde metamorphism, and these
   gradients are similar to those of the eclogite-bearing tectonic blocks.
   Therefore, the eclogite-bearing tectonic blocks reached greater depths
   in the subduction zone than the Sambagawa schists. All the tectonic
   blocks were ultimately emplaced into the hanging wall side of the
   later-subducted Sambagawa high-grade schists during their exhumation.}},

Abstract = {{The accumulation of the scrapie agent in lymphoid tissues following
   inoculation via the skin is critical for efficient neuroinvasion, but
   how the agent is initially transported from the skin to the draining
   lymph node is not known. Langerhans cells (LCs) are specialized
   antigen-presenting cells that continually sample their microenvironment
   within the epidermis and transport captured antigens to draining lymph
   nodes. We considered LCs probable candidates to acquire and transport
   the scrapie agent after inoculation via the skin. XS106 cells are
   dendritic cells (DCs) isolated from mouse epidermis with characteristics
   of mature LC cells. To investigate the potential interaction of LCs with
   the scrapie agent XS106 cells were exposed to the scrapie agent in
   vitro. We show that XS106 cells rapidly acquire the scrapie agent
   following in vitro exposure. In addition, XS106 cells partially degrade
   the scrapie agent following extended cultivation. These data suggest
   that LCs might acquire and degrade the scrapie agent after inoculation
   via the skin, but data from additional experiments demonstrate that this
   ability could be lost in the presence of lipopolysaccharide or other
   immunostimulatory molecules. Our studies also imply that LCs would not
   undergo maturation following uptake of the scrapie agent in the skin, as
   the expression of surface antigens associated with LC maturation were
   unaltered following exposure. In conclusion, although LCs or DCs have
   the potential to acquire the scrapie agent within the epidermis our data
   suggest it is unlikely that they become activated and stimulated to
   transport the agent to the draining lymph node.}},

Abstract = {{In The Empire. of Chance, historians of science Gigerenzer et al. argue
   that statistical thinking has been ``second to no other area of
   scientific endeavor{''} in its influence on ``modern life and
   thought{''} (Gigerenzer et al. 1989, xiv-xv). This article describes how
   quantitative descriptions of risk associated with industrialization and
   technological change became part of the mentality of ordinary Americans.
   It explains why Americans began counting accidents, tells what kinds of
   accidents they counted and how they counted them, and shows how
   statistical representations of risk were used to justify prescriptions
   for public policy and individual behavior. On this frontier of the
   empire of chance, safety experts and self-styled ``practical
   statisticians{''} were the principal colonizers. Distant from the
   centers of academic statistical science, they compromised rigorous
   scientific standards of methodology and accurate prediction in order to
   make convincing arguments outside their circles of expertise. To convey
   their point of view to audiences who were not literate in the field of
   statistics, they created a public language that conveyed statistical
   ideas through metaphors, graphic representations, and other rhetorical
   devices. They also engaged non-experts in collecting and analyzing data
   and, by the 1920s, even used quantitative self-measurement as a device
   to convince members of the public to alter their own risk-taking
   behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial organization of cells within bacterial aggregates on leaf
   surfaces was determined for pair-wise mixtures of three different
   bacterial species commonly found on leaves, Pseudomonas syringae,
   Pantoea agglomerans, and Pseudomonas fluorescens. Cells were
   coinoculated onto bean plants and allowed to grow under moist
   conditions, and the resulting aggregates were examined in situ by
   epifluorescence microscopy. Each bacterial strain could be localized
   because it expressed either the green or the cyan fluorescent protein
   constitutively, and the viability of individual cells was assessed by
   propidium iodide staining. Each pair of bacterial strains that was
   coinoculated onto leaves formed mixed aggregates. The degree of
   segregation of cells in mixed aggregates differed between the different
   coinoculated pairs of strains and was higher in mixtures of P.
   fluorescens A506 and P. agglomerans 299R and mixtures of P. syringae
   B728a and P. agglomerans 299R than in mixtures of two isogenic strains
   of P. agglomerans 299R. The fractions of the total cell population that
   were dead in mixed and monospecific aggregates of a gfp-marked strain of
   P. agglomerans 299R and a cfp-marked strain of P. agglomerans 299R, or
   of P. fluorescens A506 and P. agglomerans 299R, were similar. However,
   the proportion of dead cells in mixed aggregates of P. syringae B728a
   and P. agglomerans 299R was significantly higher (13.2\% +/- 8.2\%) than
   that in monospecific aggregates of these two strains (1.6\% +/- 0.7\%),
   and it increased over time. While dead cells in such mixed aggregates
   were preferentially found at the interface between clusters of cells of
   these strains, cells of these two strains located at the interface did
   not exhibit equal probabilities of mortality. After 9 days of
   incubation, about 77\% of the P. agglomerans 299R cells located at the
   interface were dead, while only about 24\% of the P. syringae B728a
   cells were dead. The relevance of our results to understanding bacterial
   interactions on leaf surfaces and the implications for biological
   control of pathogenic and other deleterious microorganisms is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In the era of community policing, a mini-police station system gained
   popularity and was adopted in many countries in order to improve
   relationships with citizens and decentralize the police. The very
   similar system in South Korea, which existed as the core division since
   the establishment of the modern Korean Police, however, stimulated
   controversy over the effectiveness of preventing crime and improving the
   relationship between citizens and the police. Unfortunately, an
   empirical study was not conducted to examine the effectiveness of the
   mini-police station system in South Korea, despite the significance of
   the issue. As a first step, the current study examined Korean police
   officers' perception of the efficacy of police mini-stations. Results
   showed that a majority of Korean officers believed that mini-police
   stations played crucial and positive roles. Regarding determinants of
   the perceived efficacy of a mini-police station, individual and
   organizational factors (except rank and unit assigned) were not
   significantly related to officers' attitude toward the efficacy of a
   mini-police station. Instead, attitudinal factors were found to be
   significant predictors of the perceived efficacy of a mini-police
   station. Policy implications and directions for future research are

Abstract = {{Boron-neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is based on the preferential
   targeting of tumor cells with B-10 and subsequent irradiation with
   epithermal neutrons to produce a highly localized field of lethal alpha
   particles, while sparing neighboring non-targeted cells. BNCT treatment
   of 9L brain tumors in a rat model using
   beta-D-5-o-carboranyl-2'-deoxyuridine (D-CDU) resulted in greater
   efficacy than predicted based on the assumption of a uniform tumor
   distribution of B-10. Thus, the geometric heterogeneity of dividing
   cells in brain tumors warranted studies on the cell cycle dependency of
   D-CDU accumulation, metabolism and entrapment in a relevant brain tumor
   cell system. U-271 human glioma cells were synchronized in G(1) or
   S-phases of the cell cycle. The cellular accumulation and
   phosphorylation of D-CDU was measured in the G(1) and S-phase cells
   using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Cells synchronized
   in the S-phase accumulated significantly higher amounts of D-CDU and
   produced larger amounts of negatively charged D-CDU monophosphate
   (D-CDU-MP) and nido-CDU metabolites than resting cells. Since brain
   tumors contain a larger proportion of cycling cells than neighboring
   tissue, these results support the hypothesis that in addition to
   breakdown of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) in tumors, the preferential
   phosphorylation of D-CDU in cycling cells may further enrich the
   distribution of B-10 in dividing cells. Therefore, dosimetry
   calculations that include the spatial distribution of cycling cells may
   be warranted for D-CDU.}},

   Streptococcus pneumoniae on the induction of tumour necrosis
   factor-alpha (TNF-alpha,) and interleukin-1 beta (IL- 1 beta) genes by
   human macrophages and the influence of antibiotic concentration and
   bacterial growth phase upon this induction. Gene expression was measured
   by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and protein was measured by
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Treatment of lag phase S.
   pneumoniae with one-eighth minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
   penicillin resulted in enhanced expression of TNF-alpha messenger RNA
   (mRNA), but not TNF-alpha protein at 6 h compared with untreated
   bacteria. IL- 1 beta mRNA and protein were not affected by these
   bacteria. MIC treatment of lag or early log phase bacteria induced both
   protein and mRNA for IL-1 beta. Bacteria exposed to concentrations of
   penicillin that cause lysis (MIC) or no lysis with morphological changes
   (sub-MIC) induce differential patterns of pro-inflammatory cytokine

Abstract = {{Animals commonly modify their behavior in the presence of a conspecific
   or in response to signals. This is particularly true in the context of
   aggressive exchanges, which animals use to form networks of social
   relationships and to communicate social status associated with those
   relationships. Although hierarchical structures are a widespread
   phenomenon that has been studied extensively, the dynamic communication
   processes, specifically chemical communication in this review, is
   relatively overlooked. In particular, it is the exchange of information
   during agonistic interactions that mediates hierarchies and/or alters
   the outcomes of agonistic interactions. Given the theoretical appeal of
   these interactions, and the evolutionary importance and taxonomic
   diversity associated with social hierarchies, it is not surprising that
   the sensory mechanisms involved in the formation and maintenance of
   hierarchical structures have received recent attention. In crayfish,
   dominance is thought to be largely determined by physical superiority,
   where encounters are largely dyadic and fighting behavior is highly
   stereotyped. However, recent evidence has shown that the outcome of
   dyadic encounters are dependent upon a number of factors other than
   physical size, that include the exchange of chemical information during
   encounters, previous social history, and the intrinsic neurochemical
   state of opponents. We have attempted to provide a comprehensive
   analysis of the extrinsic chemical processes (previous history, sensory
   communication, etc.) and intrinsic chemical processes (neurochemical
   state) that produce and maintain dominance relations and social
   hierarchies in crayfish. We hope that this review will bring together a
   global picture of the processes that determine a crayfish's social
   standing and how intrinsic and extrinsic chemicals have substantial
   effects on aggressive states and agonistic bouts.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial biofilm formation has been described as a developmental
   process. This process may be divided into three stages: the planktonic
   stage, the monolayer stage and the biofilm stage. Bacteria in the
   planktonic stage are not attached to each other or to a surface;
   bacteria in the monolayer stage are attached to surfaces as single
   cells; and bacteria in the biofilm stage are attached to surfaces as
   cellular aggregates. In a study limited to the Vibrio cholerae flaA,
   mshA and vps genes, we previously demonstrated that transcription in
   monolayer cells is distinct from that in biofilm cells and that the
   genetic requirements of monolayer formation are distinct from those of
   biofilm formation. In this work, we sought to identify additional
   stage-specific genetic requirements through microarray analysis of the
   V. cholerae transcriptome during biofilm development. These studies
   demonstrated unique patterns of transcription in the planktonic,
   monolayer and biofilm stages of biofilm development. Based on our
   microarray results, we selected cheY-3 as well as two previously
   uncharacterized genes, bap1 and leuO, for targeted mutation. The Delta
   cheY-3 mutant displayed a defect in monolayer but not biofilm formation,
   suggesting that chemotaxis plays a stage-specific role in formation of
   the V. cholerae monolayer. Mutants carrying deletions in bap1 and leuO
   formed monolayers that were indistinguishable from those formed by
   wild-type V. cholerae. In contrast, these mutants displayed greatly
   decreased biofilm accumulation. Our microarray analyses document
   modulation of the transcriptome of V. cholerae as it progresses through
   the stages in biofilm development. These studies demonstrate that
   microarray analysis of the transcriptome of biofilm development may
   greatly accelerate the discovery of novel targets for stage-specific
   inhibition of biofilm development.}},

Title = {{Too little, too late: The illusive goal of school desegregation in
   Kansas City, Missouri, and the role of the federal government}},
Journal = {{TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD}},

Abstract = {{This article explores the twisting and complicated history of school
   desegregation in Kansas City, Missouri, as an example of how illusive
   meaningful racial integration was and still is in urban America. The
   goal of desegregation was difficult to achieve from the beginning, when
   the school district adopted its initial desegregation plan based on
   neighborhood schools. This article examines the impact of that plan and
   its many shortcomings, particularly the provision permitting students to
   transfer between schools and the manner in which massive demographic
   change in the city undermined desegregation. The role of the U.S.
   Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) is also examined in
   detail, especially the department's part in pressuring school officials
   in Kansas City to reform the original plan in the early 1970s. By the
   late 1960s and early 1970s, the Kansas City school district, like a
   great many other urban school districts, had experienced massive white
   and middle-class flight that left it with a smaller tax base and
   significant fiscal difficulties. Consequently, the Kansas City Public
   Schools grew increasingly reliant on federal funding. In compelling
   Kansas City to make changes to its desegregation plan, HEW officials
   used a ``carrot and stick{''} approach. On one hand, HEW offered
   incentives to the school district in the form of large grants; on the
   other hand, HEW coerced the school district into making reforms by
   threatening to terminate the school district's federal funding.
   Ultimately, the desegregation that was accomplished in Kansas City was
   far too little and came far too late, after the school district had lost
   most of its white students to the predominantly white suburbs beyond.
   This historical analysis of school desegregation in Kansas City is
   important because it illustrates how race, inequality, and segregation
   profoundly affected an urban school district's willingness and ability
   to implement Brown, with or without federal funding. Similar stories
   echo through urban school districts across the United States.}},

Abstract = {{This paper collects together early IAU Circular observations, plots the
   light curve, and presents our own spectra of V475 Scuti (Nova Sct 2003).
   We describe the early spectral evolution of this nova during the 7 weeks
   after its discovery. The principal spectra show this nova to be a common
   Fe II type (R. E. Williams et al.). The nova displayed dominant Balmer
   lines and numerous Fe II multiplets (42, 48, 49, 55, and 74), with
   strong, well-distributed P Cygni profiles that disappeared near the end
   of our observations. Spectral evolution produced low-ionization
   forbidden lines consistent with an auroral phase (R. E. Williams et
   al.). V475 Sct was a fast nova, with t(2) = 22 days and with a type Ba
   light curve (H. W. Duerbeck) from the American Association of Variable
   Star Observers. The Ha velocity widths showed a twofold increase,
   together with an unusual broadening of the line, during our
   observations. The lack of structure within the high-resolution Ha
   profiles suggests that the nova is exhibiting an isotropic expansion as
   an optically thick wind, which may result in material falling back onto
   the white dwarf. We encourage further monitoring.}},

   the first evidence that lapper-shaped polyethers interact with

Abstract = {{The present study investigated the effects of job stress on cellular
   immune function, such as NK cell activity and NK cell subsets. The
   participants were 61 female nurses aged 23-59, who worked in a public
   psychiatric hospital in Ishikawa, Japan. Each subject completed the
   Nursing Job Stressor Scale (NJSS) and their NK cell activity and
   lymphocyte surface antigens (CD16(+)56(+)) were evaluated as immune
   system parameters. The NJSS has seven subscales: conflict with other
   nursing staff, nursing role conflict, conflict with physicians or
   autonomy, conflict with death or dying, quantitative work load,
   qualitative work load and conflict with patients. Factors influencing NK
   cell activity, and the proportion and cell counts of CD16(+)56(+)
   lymphocytes were evaluated. Increase in quantitative work load
   significantly decreased NK cell activity. Conversely, no linear
   relationship was observed between qualitative work load and
   immunological variables, with the highest percentage of CD16(+)56(+)
   lymphocytes observed among participants in the medium work load group.
   The other five NJSS subscales did not relate to immune parameters. In
   conclusion, the results suggest that perceived job strains, particularly
   quantitative work load, decreased NK cell function.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the uptake of MeHg in astrocytes and neurons, as well as
   specific indicators of neurotoxicity. Cerebellar granule neurons and
   astrocytes separately and in co-culture were cultured in the presence of
   MeHg and changes in 3-{[}4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5
   diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)-reduction, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
   leakage, and cellular content of glutathione and amino acids were used
   as indicators of MeHg toxicity. Mitochondria in cortical astrocytes were
   slightly more sensitive than those in cerebellar astrocytes to the toxic
   effects of MeHg; furthermore, cellular integrity was better preserved in
   cerebellar astrocytes. When neurons and astrocytes from cerebellum were
   incubated in separable co-cultures using inserts, the astrocytes showed
   cellular damage at lower exposure to MeHg while neurons showed less
   changes compared to respective cell types in mono-cultures. Mercury
   uptake studies at 25 mu M MeHg (10\% serum present) showed that for
   neurons in co-culture the uptake was 1/3 compared to mono-cultures. In
   contrast, for astrocytes in co-culture, uptake was increased by 75\%. A
   MeHg concentration-dependent increase of glutamate content in
   mono-cultures was noted. When MeHg concentration was increased to 10,
   25, or 50 mu M, neurons in co-cultures decreased their glutamate
   content, whereas astrocytes showed an increase. Other amino acids, such
   as glutamine, serine, valine, isoleucine, taurine, and phenylalanine
   were unaffected by MeHg. Glutathione content showed MeHg
   concentration-dependent changes in astrocytes and was increased in
   neurons in co-culture incubated with 5 mu M MeHg. In conclusion,
   astrocytes appear to increase neuronal resistance, indicating a possible
   protective role for astrocytes in MeHg neurotoxicity.}},

Abstract = {{We used terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP),
   clone library, phylogenetic, and bulk nucleic acid hybridization
   analyses to identify and characterize spatial and temporal patterns in
   marine bacterioplankton communities at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series
   Study (BATS) site. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling of monthly surface
   and 200-m bacterial 16S rDNA T-RFLP fragments from 1992 to 2002 revealed
   temporal trends in bacterial community structure in different depth
   horizons. A 200-m 16S IRNA gene clone library was used to identify
   fragments increasing in relative abundance following mixing events and
   to link observed terminal restriction fragments with those predicted
   from sequence data. T-RFLP fragments matching those of cloned OCS116,
   SAR11, and marine Actinobacteria rRNA genes exhibited the strongest
   increases at 200 In following convective overturn, and fragments
   attributable to SAR11, SAR86, and SAR116 rRNA genes exhibited the
   strongest increases at the ocean surface during summer time periods.
   Variability in the distribution and relative abundance of fragments
   assigned to different SAR11 and SAR86 subclusters was also evident.
   Quantitative hybridization of extracted 16S IRNA with radiolabeled,
   taxon-specific oligonucleotide probes provided additional data
   supporting spatial and temporal patterns of lineage distributions and
   abundances suggested by ordination. Overall increases in the relative
   abundance of T-RFLP fragments attributable to the OCS116, SAR11, and
   marine Actinobacteria clusters following convective overturn suggest
   that members of these groups may play important roles in dissolved
   organic carbon dynamics at BATS.}},

   week, 33 mls (3.5\%). At the one month follow-up, the reduction was
   101mls (9.0\%). All reductions were statistically significant. Reported
   arm heaviness and tightness also statistically significantly decreased
   directly after the regime with the reduction in tightness being
   sustained at 24 hours. The reduction in heaviness was sustained at 24
   hours, 1 week, and even one month after the program. Perceived limb size
   was significantly reduced at 1 week and at the 1 month follow-up. There
   was also a significant improvement in the anterior thorax tonometry
   reading at the 1 month follow-up.
   This study indicates that combined arm exercise and deep breathing is an
   easy to perform and implement regime which significantly reduces arm
   volume and subjective symptoms both initially after treatment and when
   performed over a 1 month period.}},

Abstract = {{Acute abdomen is not a disease entity on its own but describes a
   critical state of the patient which can be caused by numerous diseases.
   The surgeon and internist have to apply an interdisciplinary approach to
   enable a rapid decision on whether immediate laparotomy is mandatory.
   Few appropriate diagnostic procedures support decision making. In many
   cases there is an indication for immediate surgery, such as perforated
   gastric or duodenal ulcer, acute appendicitis, diverticulitis, ruptured
   aortic aneurysm, mechanic ileus, infarction of the mesenteric artery.
   This review is mainly focused on diseases which may present as acute
   abdomen but for which surgery is usually not indicated, such as acute
   pancreatitis. Furthermore, one also has to consider rare diseases in
   which laparotomy would clearly be a mistake, such as acute intermittent
   porphyria or intestinal pseudo-obstruction.}},

Abstract = {{Lichenometric dating is a cheap, relatively rapid means of dating rock
   surfaces, which has generally been overlooked in Australia. While
   lichenometry finds its greatest application in arctic and alpine
   geomorphological studies, there has been limited application to
   archaeological studies. This project set out to test the technique in
   south-eastern Australia, and assess its usefulness for dating
   post-settlement artefacts. The diameters of Buellia albula lichens
   growing on well-dated memorials in the Bendigo cemetery were measured,
   and the relationship between age and lichen diameter established. The
   results indicate that B. albula can be used to determine the age of
   exposed cement surfaces from the 1890s to the present. The positive
   results suggest the technique should be investigated in other
   applications and environments in Australia, particularly where
   alternative dating techniques cannot be used.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To compare the expulsion rates of intrauterine devices (IUDs)
   inserted in the immediate postpartum after vaginal birth and cesarean
   section.
   Methods: Nineteen patients who had a vaginal birth and 1 9 patients who
   had a cesarean section at Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Brazil,
   were selected for copper T 380A IUD insertion. With the aim of detecting
   clinically unnoticed dislodged devices, ultrasound examinations were
   performed at 1 month and between 3 and 12 months after delivery. The
   lUDs were considered completely expelled when found outside the
   endometrial cavity (e.g., in the cervical canal) or outside the uterus
   (in the vagina).
   Results: Expulsion rates were statistically different between the two
   groups: after a vaginal birth, 50\% (ultrasound only) + 27.8\% (clinical
   examination); and post-cesarean section, 0\% (p < .001; OR 5.75, 95\% CI
   2.36-14.01).
   Conclusion: Considering that the contraceptive efficacy of IUDs is
   associated with their intrauterine location, the high expulsion rates
   seen when they are inserted immediately after vaginal delivery
   contraindicate their use in this setting. The use of IUDs immediately
   after a cesarean section is still a reasonable alternative because its
   expulsion rate was zero. Ultrasound assessment of IUD positioning
   performed better than clinical examination, which failed to detect
   expulsion after postpartum insertion in 75\% of the cases (9 from 12
   cases). (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{77}},

Abstract = {{Osteoporosis is known to have a strong genetic basis. It has been
   proposed that polymorphisms within the KL (klotho) gene have a
   significant effect on aging, in particular, the osteoblast defect of
   aging. The association between polymorphisms within this gene and
   biochemical markers of bone formation and resorption, bone structure,
   and fracture rates was studied in 1,190 postmenopausal women with a mean
   age of 75 years. Genotyping of these polymorphic sites was carried out
   using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight
   (MALDI-ToF) mass spectrometry. The G allele of SNP c. 1775G > A was
   associated with a lower osteocalcin level than the A allele (P = 0.004)
   in a codominant model. SNPs C-387T and IVS1+8262c > t both showed
   nonsignificant associations with osteocalcin (P values of 0.063 and
   0.068, respectively), but a haplotype analysis of 2 of 5 haplotypes of
   the three SNPs with a frequency greater than 4\% revealed a significant
   association with osteocalcin (P = 0.036). None of the individual
   polymorphisms or haplotypes analyzed showed any associations with a
   marker of bone resorption the deoxypyridinoline creatinine ratio, bone
   structure, or fracture data. Therefore, the G polymorphism within the
   c.1775G > A SNP sit, and a haplotype including this are, associated with
   a reduced osteoblast product osteocalcin. These data suggest that
   variation in the KL gene product affects osteoblast activity independent
   of osteoclast activity but that this defect does not result in an effect
   on bone structure in this population, perhaps because of ``rescue{''} by
   other genetic or environmental factors in this population.}},

Abstract = {{A study was conducted to determine the effect of level of substitution
   of Red Swazi A sorghum variety (RSA) for maize on average feed intake
   (ADFI), average daily body weight gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio
   (FCR), hot carcass mass (HCM), cold dressed mass (CDM), drip loss (DL)
   and backfat thickness (BF) in Large White (LW), Mukota and F-1 crossbred
   pigs. Twelve pigs of each breed were randomly assigned to diets that
   contained 0, 200, 400 and 600 g/kg of RSA, and similar levels of energy
   and crude protein. The pigs were kept for 14 weeks. There was a linear
   decrease in ADG in the crossbred pigs as the sorghum level increased (P
   < 0.05). In the LW pigs, no linear or quadratic relationships existed in
   ADG. The ADG in the Large White and crossbred pigs was 0.69 and 0.61 kg,
   respectively. In Mukota pigs, however, there was a linear increase (P <
   0.05) in ADG with sorghum inclusion level. The least square mean ADG for
   Mukota pigs was 0.34. The FCR increased (P < 0.05) in both LW and
   crossbred pigs as sorghum level increased, but no statistically
   significant change was observed in the Mukota. The least square mean FCR
   were 4.2, 3.3 and 3.7 for Mukota, LW and crossbred pigs, respectively.
   The respective DL values were 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03 for the Mukota, LW and
   crossbred pigs. The BF values were 8.8, 14.5 and 14.0 for Mukota, LW and
   crossbred pigs, respectively. These findings suggest that Mukota pigs
   could utilise diets containing high levels of red sorghum better than
   either the LW or crossbred pigs. Mukota pigs, which are indigenous and
   adapted to sub-tropical environmental conditions, can therefore be
   recommended for use in dry areas that are suitable for sorghum
   production to achieve sustainable pig production. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Folate, methionine, betaine, choline, zinc and Vitamins B-12, B-6 and
   B-2 are involved in one-carbon metabolism, which includes
   S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) substrated methylation. Inadequate enzyme
   activities and imbalances of substrates and cofactors in one-carbon
   metabolism, together referred to as the `methyldietary' constituents,
   may cause homocysteine and S-adenosylhomocysteine accumulation.
   Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with many disorders including
   coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD at adult age is also associated with
   low birth weight-induced `programming', which prepares for unfavorable
   postpartum conditions and carries the potential of transgenerational
   transmission. CAD risks of hyperhomocysteinemia and `programming' might
   find a common biochemical basis in epigenetics, which, among others,
   operates via SAM-substrated methylation of DNA and histones. Folic
   acid-responsive global and locus-specific hypomethylation were found in
   hyperhomocysteinemia and CAD. Currently, there is no hard evidence that
   folic acid supplementation of CAD patients is beneficial or that
   improved folate status in pregnancy prevents CAD in the offspring at
   adult age. The folate RDA as derived from CAD primary prevention might
   require embracement of the assumption that `what nutritional measures
   are best for CAD patients are most probably best for the general
   population'. We have no knowledge on the optimal `methyldiet' balance on
   which our genome has become adapted during millions of years of
   evolution and on which our genome consequently functions best. More
   insight may derive from the study of methyldietary constituents and soft
   endpoints such as plasma homocysteine and gene methylation, in healthy,
   pregnant and non-pregnant, subjects and CAD patients and in populations
   with high and low CAD risks and those consuming diets more closely
   related to our ancient diet. Folic acid supplementation is obviously
   unnecessary at sufficient intake of naturally occurring folates,
   implying that continuing efforts should aim at meeting the
   recommendations by making the right choice of food products, that are
   either or not folate-enriched by genetic modification. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Organic luminescent solids are attracting increasing interest in various
   fields of application(1-3). Modification or alteration of the chemical
   structures of their component molecules is the most common approach for
   tuning their luminescence properties. However, for dynamic tuning or
   switching of solid-state luminescence with high efficiency and
   reproducibility successful examples are limited(2,4) as chemical
   reactions in the solid state frequently encounter insufficient
   conversion, one-way reactions or loss of their luminescence properties.
   One promising approach is to control the luminescence properties by
   altering the mode of solid-state molecular packing without chemical
   reactions. Here, we show that 2, 2':6',2 `'-terpyridine(5), practically
   non-luminescent in the form of amorphous solid or needle crystal(6),
   shows strong blue luminescence upon formation of a plate crystal.
   Efficient and reproducible on-off switching of solid-state luminescence
   is demonstrated by heat-mode interconversion between the plate and
   needle crystals. Because alteration of the mode of molecular packing
   does not require chemical reactions, the present findings would open the
   way for the development of novel organic luminescent solids that can be
   switched on and off by external thermal stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{We present a structural and optical characterization of scepterlike
   micrometer-sized free-standing structures, composed of a long InGaP rod
   with a metallic sphere on its top, grown on polycrystalline InP
   substrates. In contrast to the conventional vapor-liquid-solid growth
   method, no catalyst was deposited on the substrate. Instead, metallic In
   liberated from the InP substrate by phosphor evaporation works as the
   catalyst metal. We performed Raman scattering, photoluminescence
   spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive x-ray
   spectroscopy measurements on individual structures. The alloy
   composition measured by microscopic techniques is in agreement with the
   values obtained by the optical measurements considering that the rod is
   strain free. The InGaP rods present essentially constant Ga composition
   within a fluctuation of similar to 10\% and efficient optical emission.
   We also observed a marked increase in the Raman-scattering signal at rod
   positions near the metallic sphere (the ``neck{''}), which was
   attributed to a surface-enhanced Raman-scattering effect. Our results
   demonstrate the possibility of using InGaP rods for optical device
   applications. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the predispersal survivorship of seeds of six
   dipterocarp species (Dipterocarpus globosus, D. tempehes, Dryobalanops
   aromatica, D. lanceolata, Shorea beccariana, and S. pilosa) during
   2001-2002, when a general flowering occurred in Lambir Hills National
   Park, Sarawak, Malaysia. More immature seeds dropped during the first
   month in Dryobalanops and Shorea spp. than in Dipterocarpus spp. Insects
   attacked the seeds of all species during all developmental stages
   through to maturity, although temporal patterns varied among the
   dipterocarps. In contrast, arboreal vertebrates only occasionally ate
   seeds, and produced less damage than insects. In four species, insects
   damaged a significantly higher percentage of seeds than did vertebrates.
   Direct observations of seed survival patterns and bagging experiments
   using two sizes of mesh (cloth and wire) in the canopy of Dryobalanops
   aromatica identified insects as the principal seed predators during both
   the last phase, and overall. These results document the relative
   importance of insects as predispersal seed predators in these
   dipterocarp species.}},

Abstract = {{Conventionally, dye-exclusion test for determining cell viability has
   been restricted only for cells in suspension in tissue culture. In this
   paper, salivary gland of Chironomus has been proposed as a simple tissue
   model system where dye-exclusion test can be reliably employed for the
   intact gland. We have compared suitability of commonly used vital dyes
   and nigrosin was found suitable for the salivary gland cells.
   Biochemical tests using tetrazolium salts are also commonly used for
   determining quantitative indices of cell viability in metabolically
   active cells. Ours is the first attempt to extend the same technique for
   the whole tissue. We standardized the conditions and prepared a protocol
   for MTT-based colorimetric assay suitable for the salivary gland of
   Chironomus. A strong correlation (r(2) = 0.9893) was obtained where
   increasing O.D. correlated linearly with the number of live glands. We
   concluded that nigrosin dye-exclusion and MTT metabolic inclusion assays
   are suitable methods for the viability test of metabolically active
   intact salivary gland of Chironomus which can serve as a potential model
   for the assessment of cytotoxicity in future.}},

Abstract = {{The genus Rumex includes hermaphroditic, polygamous, gynodioecious,
   monoecious, and dioecious species, with the dioecious species being
   represented by different sex-determining mechanisms and sex-chromosome
   systems. Therefore, this genus represents an exceptional case study to
   test several hypotheses concerning the evolution of both mating systems
   and the genetic control of sex determination in plants. Here, we compare
   nuclear intergenic transcribed spacers and chloroplast intergenic
   sequences of 31 species of Rumex. Our phylogenetic analysis supports a
   systematic classification of the genus, which differs from that
   currently accepted. In contrast to the current view, this new phylogeny
   suggests a common origin for all Eurasian and American dioecious species
   of Rumex, with gynodioecy as an intermediate state on the way to dioecy.
   Our results support the contention that sex determination based on the
   balance between the number of X chromosomes and the number of autosomes
   (X/A balance) has evolved secondarily from male-determining Y mechanisms
   and that multiple sex-chromosome systems, XX/XY1Y2, were derived twice
   from an XX/XY system. The resulting phylogeny is consistent with a
   classification of Rumex species according to their basic chromosome
   number, implying that the evolution of Rumex species might have followed
   a process of chromosomal reduction from x = 10 toward x = 7 through
   intermediate stages (x = 9 and x = 8).}},

Abstract = {{In the pursuit of ever increasing productivity, the need to be able to
   measure specific aspects of software is generally agreed upon. As object
   oriented programming languages are becoming more and more widely used,
   metrics are required that are specifically designed for object oriented
   software. In recent years there has been an explosion of new, object
   oriented software metrics proposed in the literature. Unfortunately,
   many or most of the proposed metrics have not been sufficiently
   validated to measure what they claim to measure. An analysis of some of
   these metrics shows that they do not always satisfy basic properties of
   measurement theory. In this paper ten new metrics are proposed and
   analyzed using measurement theory}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{29}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To examine whether early anthropometric measures and
   reproductive factors were associated with body mass index (BMI),
   overweight, and obesity.
   DESIGN: Cross-sectional, observational study.
   SUBJECTS: In all, 18 109 healthy women who participated in the Swedish
   Mammography Cohort aged 49-83 y.
   MEASUREMENTS: Early anthropometric (birthweight and body shape at age 10
   y) and reproductive ( age at menarche, age at the birth of the first
   child, and parity) variables were our predictors and current BMI,
   overweight ( BMI 25-29.99 kg/m(2)), and obesity (BMI >= 30 kg/m(2)) were
   our outcomes.
   RESULTS: In multivariate-adjusted polytomous logistic regression
   analysis, risk of overweight and obesity increased with increasing body
   shape at age 10 y and decreased with increasing age at menarche and age
   at first birth (P for trend < 0.0001). A U-shaped relation with
   birthweight was observed. In our tests for effect modification of the
   relation with overweight/obesity (ow/ob; BMI >= 25 kg/m(2)), we detected
   significant interactions between body shape at 10 y and age ( P <
   0.0001); body shape at 10 y and physical activity ( P < 0.0001); age at
   first birth and smoking (P = 0.02); and parity and physical activity (P
   = 0.004). The increased risk of ow/ob among women who reported a larger
   childhood body shape was reduced as women moved from the lowest to
   highest quartile of physical activity in adulthood. Likewise, the
   increasing risk of ow/ob among women with greater parity was reduced
   with increased physical activity.
   CONCLUSION: Early anthropometric measures and reproductive factors are
   significantly associated with BMI, overweight, and obesity among older
   women. The effects of childhood body weight, age at first birth, and
   parity may be modified by adult lifestyle choices, as well as age.}},

Abstract = {{We present the design and implementation of a highly scalable and easily
   deployed middleware system that provides performance-isolated execution
   environments for client and server application functionality. The Java
   Active Extensions system allows clients or servers to `extend' their
   operation by hosting portions of their codes, called extensions, at
   network vantage points for improved performance and reliability, and by
   providing them with quality of service via rate-based resource
   reservations. This system is especially useful for wireless
   resource-limited clients, which can remotely locate filters, caches,
   monitors, buffers, etc., to act on their behalf and improve interactions
   with servers. Servers also benefit by moving some of their services
   close to their clients (e.g. those near a common base station) to reduce
   latency and improve bandwidth. In both cases, the client's or server's
   extended functionality executes with a specified fraction of the
   (remote) system's processor. The system design is based on a scalable
   distributed architecture that allows for incremental hardware growth,
   and is highly deployable, as it runs entirely at user level, including
   its rate-based scheduling system. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce algorithms for constructing broadcasting and
   multicasting trees. These algorithms are general because they may be
   used for tree cost functions that are of arbitrary form. Thus,
   essentially the same algorithmic procedures are used for different tree
   cost functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of the general algorithms
   by applying them to different cost functions that are often used to
   model wired and wireless networks. Besides providing a unifying
   framework for dealing with many present and future tree-construction
   applications, these algorithms typically outperform some existing
   algorithms that are specifically designed for energy-aware wireless
   networks. These general algorithms perform well at the expense of higher
   computational complexity. They are centralized algorithms, requiring the
   full network information for tree construction. Thus, we also present
   variations of these general algorithms to yield other algorithms that
   have lower complexity and distributed implementation.}},

Journal = {{ICARUS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{177}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We present delay-Doppler images of Saturn's rings based on radar
   observations made at Arecibo Observatory between 1999 and 2003, at a
   wavelength of 12.6 cm and at ring opening angles of 20.1 degrees <= |B|
   <= 26.7 degrees. The average radar cross-section of the A ring is
   similar to 77\% relative to that of the B ring, while a stringent upper
   limit of 3\% is placed on the cross-section of the C ring and 9\% on
   that of the Cassini Division. These results are consistent with those
   obtained by Ostro et al. {[}1982, Icarus 49, 367-381] from radar
   observations at |B| = 21.4 degrees, but provide higher resolution maps
   of the rings' reflectivity profile. The average cross-section of the A
   and B rings, normalized by their projected unblocked area, is found to
   have decreased from 1.25 +/- 0.31 to 0.74 +/- 0.19 as the rings have
   opened up, while the circular polarization ratio has increased from 0.64
   +/- 0.06 to 0.77 +/- 0.06. The steep decrease in cross-section is at
   variance with previous radar measurements {[}Ostro et al., 1980, Icarus
   41, 381-388], and neither this nor the polarization variations are
   easily understood within the framework of either classical,
   many-particle-thick or monolayer ring models. One possible explanation
   involves vertical size segregation in the rings, whereby observations at
   larger elevation angles which see deeper into the rings preferentially
   see the larger particles concentrated near the rings' mid-plane. These
   larger particles may be less reflective and/or rougher and thus more
   depolarizing than the smaller ones. Images from all four years show a
   strong m = 2 azimuthal asymmetry in the reflectivity of the A ring, with
   an amplitude of +/- 20\% and minima at longitudes of 67 +/- 4 degrees
   and 247 +/- 4 degrees from the sub-Earth point. We attribute the
   asymmetry to the presence of gravitational wakes in the A ring as
   invoked by Colombo et al. {[}1976, Nature 264, 344-345] to explain the
   similar asymmetry long seen at optical wavelengths. A simple radiative
   transfer model suggests that the enhancement of the azimuthal asymmetry
   in the radar images compared with that seen at optical wavelengths is
   due to the forward-scattering behavior of icy ring particles at
   decimeter wavelengths. A much weaker azimuthal asymmetry with a similar
   orientation may be present in the B ring. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{An intense discussion still exists as to whether pain and depression are
   causally related or independent of each other. To investigate processing
   of pain-related word stimuli in subclinically depressed individuals, we
   designed an event-related potentials study in a group control design.
   Pain words and neutral words were presented to 16 subclinically
   depressed and 16 control participants. Behavioral and
   electrophysiological measures were taken during lexical decision and
   recognition tasks. Depressive compared to control participants showed
   enhanced P300 amplitudes at parietal electrodes triggered by
   pain-related words during the lexical decision task, which presumably is
   a sign of enhanced recollection processes for these word stimuli. In
   line with these electrophysiological findings, depressed participants
   also tended to better recall the pain-related words in the later
   recognition task than control participants. We conclude that
   subclinically depressed individuals selectively process pain-related
   stimuli, and this processing bias could enhance their vulnerability to
   develop pain symptoms. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   actinide dioxides with the Advanced Light Source Molecular Environmental
   Science (ALS-MES) Beamline 11.0.2 soft X-ray scanning transmission X-ray
   microscope (STXM) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL).
   The ALS-MES STXM permits near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure
   (NEXAFS) and imaging with 30-nm spatial resolution. The first STXM
   spectromicroscopy NEXAFS spectra at the actinide 4d(5/2) edges of the
   imaged transuranic particles, NpO2 and PuO2, have been obtained.
   Radiation damage induced by the STXM was observed in the investigation
   of a mixed oxidation state particle (Np(V,Vl)) and was minimized during
   collection of the actual spectra at the 4d(5/2) edge of the Np(V,VI)
   solid. A plutonium elemental map was obtained from an irregular PuO2
   particle with the dimensions of 650 x 650 nm. The Pu 4d(5/2) NEXAFS
   spectra were collected at several different locations from the PuO2
   particle and were identical. A representative oxygen K-edge spectrum
   from UO2 was collected and resembles the oxygen K-edge from the bulk
   material. The unique and current performance of the ALS-MES STXM at
   extremely low energies (ca. 100 eV) that may permit the successful
   measurement of the actinide 5d edge is documented. Finally, the
   potential of STXM as a tool for actinide investigations is briefly
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Kinetics of folic acid degradation in cowpea ( Vigna catjang L.) as well
   as in pure folic acid solutions at initial concentrations present in
   cowpea over a temperature range of 50 - 120 degrees C ( isothermal
   conditions) followed first order reaction kinetics, where the rate
   constant increased with an increase in temperature. The temperature
   dependence of degradation was adequately modeled by Arrhenius equation.
   The degradation was also evaluated in normal open pan cooking,
   pressure-cooking and a newly developed and patented fuel-efficient Eco
   Cooker (non-isothermal heating process). A mathematical model was
   developed using the isothermal kinetic parameters obtained to predict
   the losses of folic acid from the time - temperature data of the
   non-isothermal heat processing method. The results obtained indicate
   that the folic acid degradation is of a similar order of magnitude in
   all the methods of cooking.}},

Abstract = {{It has now been well established that D-serine, a coagonist for the
   N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors (NR1/NR2 type), is
   maintained at a high concentration in mammalian brains for life and
   shows a brain-selective and NMDA receptor R2B subunit-related
   distribution, overturning the hitherto generally accepted theory that
   D-amino acid is not always present in mammalian tissues. D-Serine in the
   brain has been shown to be contained in both the glia and neurons and to
   have specific processes of biosynthesis, extracellular release, uptake,
   and degradation. Moreover, the selective elimination Of D-Serine reduces
   the NMDA receptor-mediated intracellular signaling and long-term
   potentiation of synaptic connections. Together with the anti-psychotic
   and anti-ataxic property Of D-serine and the pivotal roles of the NMDA
   receptor in divergent higher brain functions, these observations support
   the view that the D-amino acid may be involved as an endogenous
   modulator for the NMDA receptor in various neuropsychiatric functions
   and their pathological conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The fabrication process of a carbon-nanotube (CNT) field-emitter array

   suitable for a large-sized FEA because of its coating property and
   thermal stability. These features contribute to the display-image
   uniformity, the tolerance to the thermal-sealing process, etc. A new
   method of forming via holes on the insulator instead of gate holes has
   been developed. The method uses a spin-wet-etching (SWE) technique
   instead of the typical reactive-ion-etching (RIE) method. The RIE method
   damages and contaminates the CNT at the end of the etching process.
   However, the SWE technique ensures fine gate hole configurations with
   little under-cut without any damage nor contamination. An FEA panel 1.5
   in. on the diagonal was fabricated by using the method. The FEA showed
   good emission uniformity with proper surface treatment of the CNT.}},

Abstract = {{The binding domain of the chicken leptin receptor {[}chLBD (chicken
   leptin-binding domain)], subcloned from the full-size chicken leptin
   receptor and prepared in an Escherichia coli system, was subjected to
   site-directed mutagenesis to identify the amino acids involved in leptin
   binding. A total of 22 electrophoretically pure, > 90\%
   monomer-containing mutants were expressed, refolded and purified. The
   effects of the mutations were tested by the ability to form complexes
   with ovine leptin, and the kinetic parameters of interaction were
   determined by surface plasmon resonance. Six mutants were used to
   determine whether mutations of several amino acids that differ between
   chLBD and mammalian LBDs will affect affinity: none showed any such
   effect, except the mutant A105D (Ala(105) -> Asp), which exhibited some
   decrease in affinity. Surface plasmon resonance analysis identified six
   mutants in which binding activity was totally abolished (F73A,
   Y14A/F73A, V76A/F77A, L78A/L79A, V76A/F77A/L78A/L79A and A105D/D106V)
   and six mutants (Y14A, R41A, R41A/S42A/K43A, V103A, V135A/F136A and
   F136A) in which affinity for the hormone was reduced, mainly by
   increased dissociation rates. Gel-filtration experiments indicated the
   formation of a 1:1 ovine or human leptin-chLBD complex with a molecular
   mass of approx. 41 kDa. Gel-filtration experiments yielded 1: 1
   complexes with those mutants in which affinity had decreased, but not
   with the six mutants, which had totally lost their binding capacity.
   Modelling the leptin-chLBD complex indicated that the binding domain of
   the latter is located mainly in the L3 loop, which contributes nine
   amino acid residues interacting with leptin. Contact-surface analysis
   identified the residues having the highest contribution to the
   recognition site to be Phe(73), Phe(77) and Leu(79).}},

   addition, the effect of preincubation was estimated in order to
   investigate the mechanism-based inhibition. IC50 values of miconazole
   against CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 activities were 2.90 and 6.46 mu M,
   respectively, and miconazole at 10 mu M concentration slightly inhibited
   CYP2E1 activity. On the other hand, other antifungal drugs neither
   inhibited nor stimulated all of the metabolic activities. The
   stimulation of the inhibition of the metabolic activities mediated by
   CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or CYP2E1 by 15-min preincubation was not observed for
   any of the antifungal drugs, suggesting that these antifungal drugs are

Abstract = {{Generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa (GABEB), a subtype of
   epidermolysis bullosa (EB), is an autosomal recessive skin disease
   characterized by derm-epidermal separation leading to skin fragility and
   atrophy and other associated abnormalities. Although a few reports
   demonstrated that eosinophils are infiltrating beneath bullas in infants
   with some types of EB, no such condition in adult GABEB patients has
   been known. Here we report on three adult patients with GABEB from a
   Japanese family, whose bullous skin lesions showed massive eosinophil
   infiltration. One of the three patients showed amyloid deposition at the
   intestine, kidney, and skin. Linkage analysis revealed that GABEB in the
   family was linked to COL17A1 with a maximum LOD score of 3.08. Mutation
   analysis identified in the three patients a homozygous insertional
   mutation, 209-210insCA, in exon 5 of COL17A1. The expression of mutated
   COL17A1 was confirmed by semiquantitative RT-PCR, but no signals for
   truncated COL17A1 protein were detected by the immunohistochemical
   studies using antibodies against BP180. Furthermore, no autoantibody
   against the mutant protein was detected by western blot analysis. It is
   thus less likely that autoantibody and/or a local immune reaction in

Abstract = {{This article derives an updated cost-benefit ratio for the High/Scope
   Perry Preschool Program, an intensive preschool intervention delivered
   during the 1960s to at-risk children in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Because
   children were randomly assigned to the program or a control group,
   differences it? outcomes are probably attributable to program status.
   Data on outcome differences is now available on participants as they
   reached the age of 40; outcomes include educational attainment,
   earnings, criminal activity, and welfare receipt. These outcomes are
   rendered in money terms and compared to the costs of delivering the
   program to calculate the net present value of the program both for
   participants and for society. The data show strong advantages for the
   treatment group in terms of higher lifetime earnings and lower criminal
   activity. For the general public, gains in tax revenues, lower
   expenditures on criminal justice, lower victim costs, and lower welfare
   payments easily outweigh program costs. At a 3\% discount rate the
   program repays \$12.90 for every \$1 invested from the perspective of
   the general public; with a 7\% discount rate, the repayment per dollar
   is \$5.67. Returns are even higher if the total benefits-both public and
   private-are counted. However, there are strong differences by gender: a
   large proportion of the gains from the program come from lower criminal
   activity rates by the treatment group, almost all of which is undertaken
   by the males in the sample. The implications of these findings for
   public policy on early childhood education are considered.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence suggests that the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) and
   its ligands are involved in the pathogenesis of different human
   carcinomas, including breast cancer. Results of phase II clinical trials
   of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have shown that these
   compounds have little activity in breast cancer patients when used as
   single agents. The potential pitfalls of these clinical trials, and the
   molecular mechanisms that might be involved in regulating the
   sensitivity/ resistance of breast cancer cells to EGFR TKIs are
   discussed in this brief article. In particular, preclinical findings
   clearly demonstrate that breast cancer cells are able to activate
   different mechanisms to escape the anti-tumor effects of drugs directed
   against growth factor-driven pathways. Therefore, it is conceivable that
   significant blockade of tumor growth might be obtained only through
   contemporary blockade of different growth promoting pathways, at least
   in advanced disease. In addition, preclinical and clinical findings
   support the use of EGFR TKIs in specific subgroups of breast cancer
   patients, such as estrogen receptor positive (ER+), tamoxifen resistant
   patients. In this regard, we describe potential future applications of
   these compounds in combination with other agents in the treatment of

Abstract = {{Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for pediatric heart surgeries is not ideal.
   The currently available systems have a priming volume of 400-1,200 ml,
   requiring substantial hemodilution. CPB also subjects immature lung
   tissue to unphysiologic conditions. Exposure of the pediatric patient's
   blood to the large surface areas of foreign materials associated with an
   oxygenator results in humoral and cellular impacts on the pediatric
   patient's immature organs and should be avoided. For selected cases of
   pediatric heart surgeries, the SELCAB (selflung cardiac bypass)
   procedure would be advantageous over CPB. This procedure is equivalent
   to a biventricular assist device (BVAD) implantation. To distinguish
   this procedure from long-term BVAD, a BVAD implantation of less than 2
   weeks is referred to as SELCAB. Also, the SELCAB's inflow cannulations
   are either in atria or veins, whereas BVAD inflow cannulations are in
   ventricles. Advantages and disadvantages of SELCAB are discussed. The
   physiologic acceptance of SELCAB procedures in immature calves
   (pediatric model), with beating and nonbeating natural hearts for as
   long as 3 months, is described. The SELCAB and BVAD systems developed by
   these authors are also described in this article.}},

Abstract = {{A series of polymers tethered with bis-MPA dendrons was synthesized by a
   combination of divergent growth and atom transfer radical polymerization
   (ATRP). Macromonomers of first and second generation were synthesized
   utilizing the acetonide protected anhydride of bis-MPA as the generic
   esterfication agent. The macromonomers were polymerized in a controlled
   fashion by ATRP utilizing Cu(I)/Cu(II) and N-propyl-2-pyridylmethanamine
   as the halogen/ligand system. The end-groups of these polymers were
   further tailored to achieve hydroxyl, acetate, and aliphatic hexadecyl
   functionality. With this approach all polymers will emanate from the
   same backbone, enabling for an evaluation of both the generation and
   end-group dependent properties. Furthermore, a dendronized tri-block
   copolymer was synthesized. All materials were analyzed by H-1 and C-13
   NMR, as well as size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). The SEC analysis
   revealed that the molecular weights of the divergently grown dendronized
   polymers increased with increasing generation while the polydispersity
   (PDI) was kept low. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Neonatal resuscitation is a common and important intervention.
   International consensus statements advise how newborns should be
   resuscitated and suggest equipment to be used. Use of equipment not
   specifically recommended in these guidelines has been advocated. We
   wished to determine how widely this supplementary equipment is used in a
   geographically defined region. Methods: Each of the 25 tertiary
   perinatal centres with on-site deliveries in Australia and New Zealand
   was surveyed. The questionnaire asked about the use of the following
   items during delivery room resuscitation: pulse oximetry, exhaled carbon
   dioxide detection, polyethylene wrapping, oxygen blenders, laryngeal
   mask and oropharyngeal airways. Results: Data were obtained from all
   centres. Pulse oximetry is used at 12 (48\%) centres. Exhaled CO2
   detection is used to confirm endotracheal tube placement at three (12\%)
   of the centres. Polyethylene wrapping is used to prevent heat loss in
   very-low-birthweight infants at delivery at 11 (44\%) centres. Oxygen
   blenders are used to modify the amount of oxygen delivered at nine
   (36\%) centres. Laryngeal mask airways are infrequently used at two
   (8\%) centres. Oropharyngeal airways are infrequently used at five
   (20\%) centres.
   Conclusion: There is considerable variation in the equipment and
   techniques used to resuscitate newly born infants. Use of equipment not
   specifically recommended in international consensus statements is
   widespread. These are potentially effective tools to improve
   resuscitation. The evidence supporting their use is, however, limited.
   Urgent evaluation of their efficacy and safety is required before even
   more widespread use occurs.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Neonatal resuscitation is a common and important
   intervention, and adequate ventilation is the key to success. In the
   delivery room, positive pressure ventilation is given with manual
   ventilation devices using face masks. Mannequins are widely used to
   teach and practise this technique. During both simulated and real
   neonatal resuscitation, chest excursion is used to assess tidal volume
   delivery, and leakage from the mask is not measured.
   Objective: To describe a system that allows measurement of mask leakage
   and estimation of tidal volume delivery.
   Methods: Respiratory function monitors, a modified resuscitation
   mannequin, and a computer were used to measure leakage from the mask and
   to assess tidal volume delivery in a model of neonatal resuscitation.
   Results: The volume of gas passing through a flow sensor was measured at
   the face mask. This was a good estimate of the tidal volume entering and
   leaving the lung in this model. Gas leakage between the mask g g g and
   mannequin was also measured. This occurred principally during inflation,
   although gas leakage during deflation was seen when the total leakage
   was large. A volume of gas that distended the mask but did not enter the
   lung was also measured.
   Conclusion: This system can be used to assess the effectiveness of
   positive pressure ventilation given using a face mask during simulated
   neonatal resuscitation. It could be useful for teaching neonatal
   resuscitation and assessing ventilation through a face mask.}},

Abstract = {{Reovirus induces apoptosis in cultured cells and in vivo. In cell
   culture models, apoptosis is contingent upon a mechanism involving
   reovirus-induced activation of transcription factor NF-kappa B complexes
   containing p50 and p65/Re1A subunits. To explore the in vivo role of
   NF-kappa B in this process, we tested the capacity of reovirus to induce
   apoptosis in mice lacking a functional nfkb1/p50 gene. The genetic
   defect had no apparent effect on reovirus replication in the intestine
   or dissemination to secondary sites of infection. In comparison to what
   was observed in wild-type controls, apoptosis was significantly
   diminished in the CNS of p50-null mice following reovirus infection. In
   sharp contrast, the loss of p50 was associated with massive
   reovirus-induced apoptosis and uncontrolled reovirus replication in the
   heart. Levels of IFN-beta mRNA were markedly increased in the hearts of
   wild-type animals but not p50-null animals infected with reovirus.
   Treatment of p50-null mice with IFN-beta substantially diminished
   reovirus replication and apoptosis, which suggests that IFN-beta
   induction by NF-kappa B protects against reovirus-induced myocarditis.
   These findings reveal an organ-specific role for NF-kappa B in the
   regulation of reovirus-induced apoptosis, which modulates encephalitis
   and myocarditis associated with reovirus infection.}},

Abstract = {{Full fat, milled-curd Cheddar cheeses ( 2 kg) were manufactured with 0.0
   ( control), 0.1, 1.0, or 10.0 mu mol of pepstatin ( a potent competitive
   inhibitor of chymosin) added per liter of curds/whey mixture at the
   start of cooking to obtain residual chymosin levels that were 100, 89,
   55, and 16\% of the activity in the control cheese, respectively. The
   cheeses were ripened at 8 degrees C for 180 d. There were no significant
   differences in the pH values of the cheeses; however, the moisture
   content of the cheeses decreased with increasing level of pepstatin
   addition. The levels of pH 4.6-soluble nitrogen in the 3 cheeses with
   added pepstatin were significantly lower than that of the control cheese
   at 1 d and throughout ripening. Densitometric analysis of urea-PAGE
   electrophoretograms of the pH 4.6-insoluble fractions of the cheese made
   with 10.0 mu mol/L of pepstatin showed complete inhibition of hydrolysis
   of alpha(S1)-casein (CN) at Phe(23)-Phe(24) at all stages of ripening.
   The level of insoluble calcium in each of 4 cheeses decreased
   significantly during the first 21 d of ripening, irrespective of the
   level of pepstatin addition. Concurrently, there was a significant
   reduction in hardness in each of the 4 cheeses during the first 21 d of
   ripening. The softening of texture was more highly correlated with the
   level of insoluble calcium than with the level of intact alpha(S1)-CN in
   each of the 4 cheeses early in ripening. It is concluded that hydrolysis
   of alpha(S1)-CN at Phe(23)-Phe(24) is not a prerequisite for softening
   of Cheddar cheese during the early stages of ripening. We propose that
   this softening of texture is principally due to the partial
   solubilization of colloidal calcium phosphate associated with the
   para-CN matrix of the curd.}},

Title = {{Two novel variants of human medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) -
   K364R, a folding mutation, and R256T, a catalytic-site mutation

Abstract = {{Two novel rare mutations, MCAD similar to 842G -> C (R256T) and MCAD
   similar to 1166A -> G (K364R), have been investigated to assess how far
   the biochemical properties of the mutant proteins correlate with the
   clinical phenotype of medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD)
   deficiency. When the gene for K364R was overexpressed in Escherichia
   coli, the synthesized mutant protein only exhibited activity when the
   gene for chaperonin GroELS was co-overexpressed. Levels of activity
   correlated with the amounts of native MCAD protein visible in western
   blots. The R256T mutant, by contrast, displayed no activity either with
   or without chaperonin, but in this case a strong MCAD protein band was
   seen in the western blots throughout. The proteins were also purified,
   and the enzyme function and thermostability investigated. The K364R
   protein showed only moderate kinetic impairment, whereas the R256T
   protein was again totally inactive. Neither mutant showed marked
   depletion of FAD. The pure K364R protein was considerably less
   thermostable than wild-type MCAD. Western blots indicated that, although
   the R256T mutant protein is less thermostable than normal MCAD, it is
   much more stable than K364R. Though clinically asymptomatic thus far,
   both mutations have a severe impact on the biochemical phenotype of the
   protein. K364R, like several previously described MCAD mutant proteins,
   appears to be defective in folding. R256T, by contrast, is a well-folded
   protein that is nevertheless devoid of catalytic activity. How the
   mutations specifically affect the catalytic activity and the folding is
   further discussed.}},

Title = {{Thromboxane A(2) promotes interleukin-6 biosynthesis mediated by an
   activation of cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein in 1321N1
   human astrocytoma cells}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{670-679}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{1321N1 human astrocytoma cells express thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2))
   receptors (TP). However, physiological consequences of TXA(2) signaling
   in glial cells remain unclear. Herein, we show that TXA(2) promotes
   interleukin-6 (IL-6) biosynthesis in glial cells. A TP agonist,
   9,11-dideoxy-9 alpha, 11 alpha-methanoepoxyprosta-5Z, 13E-dien-1-oic
   acid (U46619), enhanced IL-6 production in both 1321N1 cells and
   cultured mouse astrocytes. It has been shown that IL-6 gene expression
   is regulated by various transcription factors. Among them, we found a
   significant increase in cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein
   (CREB) activity with its phosphorylation at Ser133 by U46619 in 1321N1
   cells. Although U46619 increased IL-6 promoter activity, a mutation at
   cyclic AMP-response element (CRE) on the promoter clearly suppressed the
   effect, suggesting that CRE is involved in U46619-induced IL-6
   expression. Furthermore, both CREB and IL-6 promoter activities were
   suppressed by SB203580
   {[}4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1H-imidaz
   ole], a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK) inhibitor, and H89
   {[}N-{[}2-(4-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5- isoquinoline], a protein
   kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, indicating involvements of p38 MAPK and PKA in
   CREB activation and IL-6 expression. To determine which G-proteins are
   implicated in the U46619-induced IL-6 synthesis, the interfering mutants
   of G alpha(q), G alpha(12), or G alpha(13) were overexpressed in 1321N1
   cells by adenoviral approach. It is noteworthy that the G alpha(q) or G
   alpha(13) mutant blocked the IL-6 production by U46619. The
   constitutively active mutant of G alpha(q), G alpha(12), or G alpha(13)
   enhanced IL-6 production, indicating that G alpha(q) and G alpha(13)
   were involved in U46619-induced IL-6 production. In conclusion, TXA(2)
   enhances the IL-6 biosynthesis via the PKA p38 MAPK/CREB pathway in
   1321N1 cells. IL-6 induction depends on G alpha(q) and G alpha(13) as
   well. This is the first report showing TP-mediated IL-6 production in
   glial cells.}},

Abstract = {{We present our technique of repair of meniscal tears in 11 patients
   using a newly designed stapler, the Polysorb Meniscal Stapler XLS (USS
   Sports Medicine, Norwalk, CT), to increase the effectiveness and ease of
   repair of tears in the vascular zone while limiting potential
   complications. The low-profile stapler comes with a reloadable pistol
   grip device and a disposable straight or 15 degrees upcurved shaft with
   a single preloaded 10-mm staple. Standard anteromedial and anterolateral
   portals were used, along with a superomedial portal for inflow. The
   portal was enlarged slightly to facilitate introduction of the cannula
   or the stapler directly into the knee. The nose of the stapler was
   applied to the superior surface of the inner edge of the meniscal tear.
   The sharp points on the tip of the nose were used to manipulate the
   inner edge and coapt the tear site. Firm pressure was applied to the
   meniscal tissue, and the nose of the stapler was embedded in the inner
   edge of the meniscus no more than 2 to 3 mm from the tear (as measured
   along the meniscal surface). The handle was pulled slowly as the staple
   engaged the meniscal tissue. This step was repeated every 3 to 4 rum to
   ensure ideal tear stabilization.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: Recently, we demonstrated a proinflammatory effect
   of cytosin-guanosin dinucleotide (CpG)-oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN)
   treatment in established dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis.
   Here, we investigated whether DNA derived from luminal bacteria plays a
   role in the perpetuation of chronic intestinal inflammation. Methods:
   Toll-like receptor (TLR9)-deficient and wild-type (wt) control mice were
   used for the induction of chronic DSS colitis. Moreover, mice with
   established chronic colitis using different experimental models were
   treated with adenoviral ODN (AV-ODN) known to block CpG effects. Colonic
   inflammation was scored and cytokine production was quantified both in
   colonic tissue and draining mesenteral lymph node cells (MILC). Results
   : Eight weeks after induction of chronic DSS colitis in TLR9-deficient
   mice, intestinal inflammation was significantly lower (-68\%), and
   proinflammatory cytokine production was drastically reduced. Treatment
   of wt mice with chronic DSS-induced colitis with AV-ODN resulted in a
   significant amelioration of disease with a reduced histologic score
   (-43\%) and reduced cytokine production of MLC (interleukin {[}IL]-6:
   -68\%; interferon {[}IFN]-gamma: -48\%) and RNA expression of the T
   helper (Th)1-specific transcription factor T-bet (-62\%) in colonic
   tissue. Qualitatively, the same results were obtained in the severe
   combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) transfer model of colitis and
   in spontaneous colitis in IL-10-deficient mice. Conclusions: Bacteria{[}
   DNA derived from luminal bacteria contributes significantly to the
   perpetuation of chronic intestinal inflammation. Inhibition of the
   immune-stimulating properties of bacterial DNA using AVODN may offer a
   novel and specific tool for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{1198-1204}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives. Investigators often need to assess the
   accuracies of diagnostic tests when the gold standard is not
   binary-scale. The objective of this article is to describe nonparametric
   estimators of diagnostic test accuracy when the gold standard is
   continuous, ordinal, and nominal scale.
   Materials and Methods. A nonparametric method of estimating and
   comparing the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves,
   proposed by DeLong et al, is extended to situations in which the gold
   standard is not binary. Two examples illustrate the methods.
   Results. Measures of diagnostic test accuracy, their variance, and tests
   for comparing two diagnostic tests' accuracies in paired designs are
   presented for situations in which the gold standard is continuous,
   ordinal, and nominal scale. These summary measures of diagnostic test
   accuracy are analogous in form and interpretation to the area under the
   ROC curve.
   Conclusion. Dichotomizing the outcomes of a gold standard so that
   traditional ROC methods can be applied can lead to bias. The methods
   described here are useful for assessing and comparing summary test
   accuracy when the gold standard is not binary scale. They have
   limitations similar to other summary indices.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a perception experiment that was
   carried out to verify the hypothesis that in Russian the contrast
   between pitch accents LH{*}L and LH{*} on utterance-final syllables is
   neutralized. Recordings for the experiment were 10 sets of three short
   utterances with word stress in the ultimate, penultimate and
   antepenultimate syllable of the utterance-final word. These utterances
   were read aloud by four female and four male native speakers. They were
   asked to realize accents LH{*}L and LH{*} in the utterance-final word.
   After instructions and rehearsing, recordings were made separately for
   each of the two types. In the perception experiment, 30 native subjects
   listened to short utterances selected from the recordings and presented
   in 180 pairs: 120 pairs with ultimate stress and, in order to test
   whether listeners can hear the difference at all, 60 pairs with
   penultimate and antepenultimate word stress in utterance-final position.
   The 180 stimuli pairs consisted of short utterances with realizations of
   LH{*}L and LH{*} on the final word, each pair containing two same or two
   different types of pitch accent. The task was to compare two stimuli in
   a pair and to indicate on a score form whether two realizations in a
   stimulus pair count as passable imitations of each other and thus belong
   to the same type of pitch accent. The same/different judgments indicate
   that listeners successfully distinguished between the two pitch accents
   in the antepenultimate and penultimate conditions, but much less so in
   the ultimate condition. This suggests that the two accents are truncated
   in final position, but not neutralized. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

   imaging of surrounding tissues. We performed MR imaging at 1.5 T by
   using standard pulse sequences and pulse sequences with high-gradient
   and high-radiofrequency duty cycle. MR imaging caused no measurable
   change in prosthesis length, and the temperature of the prosthesis
   increased by less than 1 degrees C during repeated 14-min exposures.
   Despite significant signal loss and image distortion around the
   prosthetic joint, clinically useful images were obtained as close as 12
   cm from the ends of the prosthetic stems, measured toward the body of
   the device. Thus, the prosthesis can be safely exposed to MR imaging
   pulse sequences at 1.5 T, and the visualization of some tissue

Abstract = {{Study objective: There is little guidance on how to identify useful
   evidence about the health effects of social interventions. The aim of
   this study was to assess the value of different ways of finding this
   type of information.
   Design: Retrospective analysis of the sources of studies for one
   systematic review.
   Setting: Case study of a systematic review of the effectiveness of
   interventions in promoting a population shift from using cars towards
   walking and cycling.
   Main results: Only four of the 69 relevant studies were found in a
   ``first-line'' health database such as Medline. About half of all
   relevant studies were found through the specialist Transport database.
   Nine relevant studies were found through purposive internet searches and
   seven relevant studies were found by chance. The unique contribution of
   experts was not to identify additional studies, but to provide more
   information about those already found in the literature.
   Conclusions: Most of the evidence needed for this review was not found
   in studies indexed in familiar literature databases. Applying a
   sensitive search strategy across multiple databases and interfaces is
   very labour intensive. Retrospective analysis suggests that a more
   efficient method might have been to search a few key resources, then to
   ask authors and experts directly for the most robust reports of studies
   identified. However, internet publications and serendipitous discoveries
   did make a significant contribution to the total set of relevant
   evidence. Undertaking a comprehensive search may provide unique evidence
   and insights that would not be obtained using a more focused search.}},

Abstract = {{The use of monogenic race-specific resistance is widespread for the
   control of maize (Zea mays L.) helminthosporiosis caused by Exserohilum
   turcicum. Inoculation of 18 Brazilian isolates of E. turcicum onto elite
   maize lines containing previously identified resistance genes and onto
   differential near-isogenic lines allowed the identification of new
   qualitative resistance genes. The inoculation of one selected isolate on
   differential near-isogenic lines, F, generations and a BC,F, population
   from the referred elite lines enabled the characterization of the
   resistance spectrum of three new genes, one dominant (HtP), one
   recessive (rt) and a third with non-identified genetic action. Three
   physiological races of the pathogen were also identified including two
   with new virulence factors capable of overcoming the resistance of one
   of the resistance genes identified here (rt).}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new technique for the closure of oro-antral
   fistula/communication, in which both hard tissue (bone) and soft tissue
   closure is achieved The sandwich technique utilizes a suitable bone
   grafting material sandwiched between two sheaths of Biogide (R) (a
   resorbable membrane) for the hard tissue closure of oro-antral
   communication post traumatic exodontia. The bone grafting material
   utilized for this case was Bio-oss. The result obtained was excellent
   with regeneration of sufficient bony tissue to allow placement of an
   endosseous implant. This sandwich technique is a simple and excellent
   technique for the closure of oro-antral communication, especially when
   subsequent placement of endosseous implant is considered without the
   need of donor site surgery for bone grafting. The otorhinolaryngologists
   and oral and maxillofacial surgeons should find this technique very
   useful in the closure of oro-antral fistulae.}},

   schwannoma cell lines. An immunoblotting experiment showed the
   successful activation of EGF receptors and an effector protein, STAT5,
   due to EGF treatment. The microarray study showed that 35 genes were
   significantly induced and 2 were repressed within 60 min after the
   treatment. The list of induced genes included early growth response 1,
   suppressor of cytokine signaling 3, c-fos, interferon regulatory factor
   1 and early growth response 2, etc. According to the microarray data,
   six of these were induced by more than 10-fold, and showed at least two
   different induction patterns, indicating complicated regulatory

Abstract = {{To explore the effect of chemotherapy against peritoneal

   featuring three human gastric C, cancer cell lines tagged with the green

   GCIY-EGFP, the survival rate of mice treated with weekly intraperitoneal
   paclitaxel starting one day following inoculation was significantly
   higher than those of control mice or truce given the same treatment
   starting on day eight. Intravenous paclitaxel exhibited no significant
   survival benefit regardless of the treatment schedule. Pharmacokinetic
   analysis revealed that the concentration of paclitaxel in the metastatic
   nodules treated with intraperitoneal administration was 2-3-fold higher
   than those treated with intravenous paclitaxel, provided the treatment
   was given on day one. Even greater responses were observed with less
   aggressive MKN28-EGFP and MKN45-EGFP cell lines, whose peritoneal
   metastases resolved completely due to early intraperitoneal treatment in
   13 of the 14 mice tested. These results indicate that intraperitoneal

   antiferromagnetic (AF) phase (x <= 0.02) and the superconducting phase
   where the system is nonmagnetic for x >= 0.15. The obtained phase
   diagram qualitatively agrees well with that commonly found for

Abstract = {{A p-chloranil modified carbon paste electrode was constructed and the
   electrochemical behavior of this electrode was studied in the aqueous
   solution with different pH. From the E-1/2 - pH diagram for this
   compound the values of formal potential E-0' and pK(a) of some different
   redox and acid-base couples depending on the solution pH were estimated.
   The diffusion coefficient, D, value for p-chloranil was estimated 1.5 X
   10(-7) cm(2) s(-1). It has been shown by direct current cyclic
   voltammetry and double potential step chronoamperometry, that this
   p-chloranil incorporated carbon paste electrode, can catalyze the
   oxidation of ascorbic acid in the aqueous buffered solution. Under the
   optimum condition (pH 7.00), the oxidation of ascorbic acid at the
   surface of such an electrode occurs at a potential about 325 mV less
   positive than that at an unmodified carbon past electrode. The catalytic
   oxidation peak currents was linearly dependent on the ascorbic acid
   concentration and a linear calibration curve was obtained in the range
   of 7 x 10-5 M 4 x 10(-3) M of ascorbic acid with a correlation
   coefficient of 0.9998. The limit of detection (3 sigma) was determined
   as 3.5 x 10(-5) M. This method was used as simple, selective and precise
   voltammetric method for determination of ascorbic acid in pharmaceutical

Abstract = {{Analyzing the dependencies between spike trains is an important step in
   understanding how neurons work in concert to represent biological
   signals. Usually this is done for pairs of neurons at a time using
   correlation-based techniques. Chornoboy, Schramm, and Karr (1988)
   proposed maximum likelihood methods for the simultaneous analysis of
   multiple pair-wise interactions among an ensemble of neurons. One of
   these methods is an iterative, continuous-time estimation algorithm for
   a network likelihood model formulated in terms of multiplicative
   conditional intensity functions. We devised a discrete-time version of
   this algorithm that includes a new, efficient computational strategy, a
   principled method to compute starting values, and a principled stopping
   criterion. In an analysis of simulated neural spike trains from
   ensembles of interacting neurons, the algorithm recovered the correct
   connectivity matrices and interaction parameters. In the analysis of
   spike trains from an ensemble of rat hippocampal place cells, the
   algorithm identified a connectivity matrix and interaction parameters
   consistent with the pattern of conjoined firing predicted by the overlap
   of the neurons' spatial receptive fields. These results suggest that the
   network likelihood model can be an efficient tool for the analysis of
   ensemble spiking activity.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated whether paraquat (Pq)-induced lipidic
   peroxidation (LP) is accompanied by changes in blood pressure and heart
   rate (HR) in rats. Groups of adult male Wistar rats were studied 2 and
   12 h after Pq (35 mg/kg, i.p.) administration. The LP was evaluated by
   monitoring thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in the
   kidneys, liver and lungs, and validated by including a group treated
   with an antioxidant, superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD 50,000 IU/kg), in the
   study. The TBARS levels were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the
   kidneys of the rats studied 2 h after Pq than in their respective
   controls. Similarly, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were
   higher (p < 0.05), while HR was lower (p < 0.05) than basal levels 2 and
   12 h after Pq administration. In contrast, the group treated
   simultaneously with Pq and CuZnSOD exhibited lower levels of TBARS (p <
   0.05) in all studied organs compared to the control group, while the
   mean arterial pressure and HR did not differ from those seen in the
   control group. These findings indicate that acute Pq poisoning symptoms
   include high blood pressure.}},

Abstract = {{A key step in homologous recombination is the loading of Rad51 onto
   single-stranded DNA to form a nucleoprotein filament that promotes
   homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange. Mediator proteins, such as
   Rad52 and Rad55-Rad57, are thought to aid filament assembly by
   overcoming an inhibitory effect of the single-stranded-DNA-binding
   protein replication protein A. Here we show that mediator proteins are
   also required to enable fission yeast Rad51 (called Rhp51) to function
   in the presence of the F-box DNA helicase Fbh1. In particular, we show
   that the critical function of Rad22 (an orthologue of Rad52) in
   promoting Rhp51-dependent recombination and DNA repair can be mostly
   circumvented by deleting fbh1. Similarly, the reduced growth/viability
   and DNA damage sensitivity of an fbh1(-) mutant are variously suppressed
   by deletion of any one of the mediators Rad22, Rhp55, and Swi5. From
   these data we propose that Rhp51 action is controlled through an
   interplay between Fbh1 and the mediator proteins. Colocalization of Fbh1
   with Rhp51 damage-induced foci suggests that this interplay occurs at
   the sites of nucleoprotein filament assembly. Furthermore, analysis of
   different fbh1 mutant alleles suggests that both the F-box and helicase
   activities of Fbh1 contribute to controlling Rhp51.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a solution method to analyze the geometrically
   nonlinear response of a patch-repaired flat panel (skin) with a cutout
   under general loading conditions. The effect of induced stiffening due
   to tensile loading on the in-plane and, particularly, the out-of-plane
   behaviors of the patch-repaired skin are investigated. The damage to the
   skin is represented in the form of a cutout under the patch. The patch
   with tapered edges is free of external tractions. The skin is subjected
   to general boundary and loading conditions along its external edge. The
   solution method provides the transverse shear and normal stresses in the
   adhesive between the skin and the patch, and in-plane and bending
   stresses in the patch and skin. Both the patch and skin are made of
   linearly elastic composite laminates, and the adhesive between them is
   homogeneous and isotropic, exhibiting a bi-linear elastic behavior.
   Modified Green's strain-displacement relations in conjunction with von
   Karman assumptions are employed in determining the in-plane strains in
   the skin and patch; however, the transverse shear strains in the
   adhesive are determined based on the shear-lag theory. The present
   solution method utilizes the principle of virtual work in conjunction
   with complex potential functions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A simple and sensitive reversed-phase liquid chromatographic method has
   been developed for the determination of amikacin (AMK) by
   derivatization. The method is based on the pre-column derivatization of
   AMK with 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate (AQC). The
   derivatization reaction proceeds in aqueous solution at room temperature
   with a borate buffer of pH 8.0. The formation of the corresponding
   derivative of AMK is instantaneous and it is stable for more than 36 h.
   Detection was performed by UV-absorption instead of fluorescence.
   Several factors influencing the derivatization reaction yields were
   studied and optimized. The system offered the following analytical
   parameters: limit of detection (LOD) of 0.068 mu g ml(-1) (3 sigma),
   linear correlation coefficient of 0.9998 and linear range response from
   2 to 50 mu g ml(-1). The precision of the method was < 1 \%. As a
   preliminary application, the method has been successfully applied to the
   amikacin determination in parenteral pharmaceutical formulations. (c)

Abstract = {{During epidermal chemical carcinogenesis benign papillomas convert to
   squamous cell carcinomas, some of which undergo epithelia I-mesenchyma I
   conversion to highly malignant spindle cell tumors. TGF beta inhibits
   early stages of carcinogenesis but promotes the spindle cell phenotype
   in later stages. One hallmark of spindle cell tumors is upregulation of
   the alpha 5 beta 1 integrin fibronectin receptor. To examine the
   significance of altered alpha 5 beta 1 integrin expression, we induced
   tumors in transgenic mice expressing alpha 5 beta 1 in the suprabasal
   epidermal layers. Inv alpha 5 beta 1 mice developed threefold more
   papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas than wild-type (Wt) littermates;
   however, no spindle cell tumors or increased metastases were observed.
   Suprabasal expression of the alpha 6 beta 4 integrin increases squamous
   cell carcinoma formation and decreases TGF beta sensitivity while alpha
   3 beta 1 may have the opposite effect. In contrast, nuclear phosphoSmad2
   labeling in Inv alpha 5 beta 1 epidermis and tumors was
   indistinguishable from Wt, and suprabasal alpha 5 beta 1 did not block
   TGF beta-induced Smad2/3 translocation or growth inhibition in cultured
   keratinocytes. We conclude that upregulation of alpha 5 beta 1 does not
   predispose the epidermis to undergo conversion to spindle cell tumors
   and that the mechanism by which alpha 5 beta 1 influences susceptibility
   to carcinogenesis is independent of perturbed TGF beta signaling. (c)

Abstract = {{Hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains a significant threat to the general
   health of the world's population, and there is a pressing need for the
   development of new treatments and preventative vaccines. Here, we
   describe the generation of retrovirus-based pseudoparticles (HCVpp)
   incorporating a panel of full-length E1E2 clones representative of the
   major genotypes 1 through 6, and their application to assess the
   reactivity and neutralizing capability of antisera and monoclonal
   antibodies raised against portions of the HCV E2 envelope protein.
   Rabbit antisera raised against either the first hypervariable region or
   ectodomain of E2 showed limited and strain specific neutralization. By
   contrast, the monoclonal antibody (MAb) AP33 demonstrated potent
   neutralization of infectivity against HCVpp carrying E1E2 representative
   of all genotypes tested. The concentration of AP33 required to achieve
   50\% inhibition of infection by HCVpp of diverse genotypes ranged from
   0.6 to 32 mu g/ml. The epitope recognized by MAb AP33 is linear and
   highly conserved across different genotypes of HCV. Thus, identification
   of a broadly neutralizing antibody that recognizes a linear epitope is
   likely to be of significant benefit to future vaccine and therapeutic
   antibody development.}},

Abstract = {{Thiamin is being incorporated into a variety of nutritionally enhanced
   beverages. Although thiamin degradation during thermal processing has
   been extensively studied, minimal data exist regarding its stability in
   solution during ambient storage. This study collected kinetic data for
   thiamin degradation in solutions as a function of pH, buffer, type,, and
   buffer concentration at 25 degrees C. Thiamin was incorporated into
   sodium phosphate and citrate buffer solutions, each prepared at 0.02 and
   0.1 M and pH 4, 5, 6, and 7. Experimental solutions were stored in an
   incubator at 25 degrees C. Thiamin concentrations Were analyzed at 9
   time points over a 42-wk period. Thiamin degradation data were modeled
   using pseudo-1st-order kinetics. Thiamin stability generally decreased
   as pH and buffer concentration increased in both phosphate and citrate
   buffers. In 0.1 M phosphate buffer, the time for a 10\% loss of thiamin
   decreased from 79 wk at pH 4 to 3 wk at pH 7. At pH 6 and 7, thiamin
   stability was greater in citrate buffer than in phosphate buffer.
   However, at pH 4 and 5, thiamin stability was greater in phosphate
   buffer than citrate buffer. To optimize thiamin stability in low pH
   beverages, phosphate buffer would be more appropriate to use than
   citrate buffer, whereas citrate buffer should be used for better thiamin
   stability in high pH beverages.}},

Abstract = {{The encoding process of vector quantization (VQ) is a time bottleneck
   preventing its practical applications. In order to speed up VQ encoding,
   it is very effective to use lower dimensional features of a vector to
   estimate how large the Euclidean distance between the input vector and a
   candidate codeword could be so as to reject most unlikely codewords. The
   three popular statistical features of the average or the mean, the
   variance, and L-2 norm of a vector have already been adopted in the
   previous works individually. Recently, these three statistical features
   were combined together to derive a sequential EEENNS search method in
   {[}6], which is very efficient but still has obvious computational
   redundancy. This Letter aims at giving a mathematical analysis on the
   results of EEENNS method further and pointing out that it is actually
   unnecessary to use L-2 norm feature anymore in fast VQ encoding if the
   mean and the variance are used simultaneously as proposed in IEENNS
   method. In other words, L-2 norm feature is redundant for a rejection
   test in fast VQ encoding. Experimental results demonstrated an
   approximate 10-20\% reduction of the total computational cost for
   various detailed images in the case of not using L-2 norm feature so
   that it confirmed the correctness of the mathematical analysis.}},

   cerebrospinal fluid outflow controlled by medium pressure valve, in

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{147}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background. Although sporadic studies have described temporary external
   cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lumbar drainage as a highly accurate test for
   predicting the outcome after ventricular shunting in normal pressure
   hydrocephalus (NPH) patients, a more recent study reports that the
   positive predictive value of external lumbar drainage (ELD) is high but
   the negative predictive value is deceptively low. Therefore, we
   conducted a prospective study in order to evaluate the predictive value
   of a continuous ELD, with CSF outflow controlled by medium pressure
   valve, in NPH patients.
   Method. Twenty-seven patients with presumed NPH were admitted to our
   department and CSF drainage was carried out by a temporary (ELD) with
   CSF outflow controlled by a medium pressure valve for five days. All
   patients received a ventriculoperitoneal shunt using a medium pressure
   valve based upon preoperative clinical and radiographic criteria of NPH,
   regardless of ELD outcome. Clinical evaluation of gait disturbances,
   urinary incontinence and mental status, and radiological evaluation with
   brain CT was performed prior to and after ELD test, as well as three
   months after shunting.
   Findings. Twenty-two patients were finally shunted and included in this
   study. In a three-month follow-up, using a previously validated score
   system, overall improvement after permanent shunting correlated well to
   improvement after ELD test (Spearman's rho = 0.462, p = 0.03). When
   considering any degree of improvement as a positive response, ELD test
   yielded high positive predictive values for all individual parameters
   (gait disturbances 94\%, 95\% CI 71\%-100\%, urinary incontinence 100\%,
   95\% CI 66\%-100\%, and mental status 100\%, 95\% CI 66\%-100\%) but
   negative predictive values were low (< 50\%) except for cognitive
   impairment (85\%, 95\% CI 55\%-98\%).
   Conclusion. This study suggests that a positive ELD-valve system test
   should be considered a reliable criterion for preoperative selection of
   shunt-responsive NPH patients. In case of a negative ELD-valve system
   test, further investigation of the presumed NPH patients with additional
   tests should be performed.}},

Abstract = {{A new slow-release powdered fertilizer product has been developed for
   use in the landscape industry. A series of tests was conducted to
   evaluate this product in several landscape applicator modes: turf
   broadcast, turf gun, and soil injection (for trees). Variables included
   concentration, nozzle size and type, pressure, agitation, and holding
   time in the tank before spraying. The product worked well in a wide
   variety of spray equipment and operating conditions. It could be sprayed
   at a rate of 0.030 kg-N/L (0. 25 lb-N/gal) in nozzles as small as DG
   8002 {[}0.011-L/s (0.17-gpm) flow rate] without nozzle plugging and at
   rates of up to 0. 060 kg-N/L (0.5lb-N/gal) in larger nozzles. The
   product settled out of suspension rapidly, so good agitation was
   critical. No differences in screen or nozzle plugging were noted that
   could be attributed to nozzle type or spraying pressure. Suspensions
   could be held overnight if properly re-agitated before spraying. Foaming
   was a problem with this product. An antifoam agent should be considered.
   Large diameter filters minimized problems with filter plugging by
   providing more screen area.}},

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to identify the rate and mechanism of
   abiotic oxidation of ferrous iron at the waterferric oxide interface
   (heterogeneous oxidation) at neutral pH. Oxidation was conducted at a
   low partial pressure Of O-2 to slow the reactions and to represent very
   low dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions that can occuratoxic/ anoxic
   fronts. Hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) was partially converted to goethite
   after 24 h of anoxic contact with Fe(II), consistent with previous
   results. This resulted in a significant decrease in sorption of Fe(II).
   No conversion to goethite was observed after 25 min of anoxic contact
   between HFO and Fe(II).O-2 was then introduced into the chamber and
   sparged (transfer half-time of 1.6 min) into the previously anoxic
   suspension, and the rate of oxidation of Fe(II) and the distribution
   between sorbed and dissolved Fe(II) were measured with time. The
   concentration of sorbed Fe(II) remained steady during each experiment,
   despite removal of all measurable dissolved Fe(II) in some
   experiments.The rate of oxidation of Fe(II)was proportional to the
   concentration of DO and both sorbed and dissolved Fe(II) up to a surface
   density of 0.02 mol Fe(II) per mol Fe(III), i.e., similar to 0.2 Fe(II)
   per nm(2) of ferric oxide surface area. This result differs from
   previous studies of heterogeneous oxidation, which found that the rate
   was proportional to sorbed Fe(II) and DO but did not find a dependence
   on dissolved Fe(II). Most previous experiments were autocatalytic; i.e.,
   the initial concentration of ferric oxide was low or none, and sorbed
   Fe(II) was not measured. The results were consistent with an
   anode/cathode mechanism, with O-2 reduced at electron-deficient sites
   with strongly sorbed Fe(II) and Fe(II) oxidized at electron-rich sites
   without sorbed Fe(II). The pseudo-first-order rate constants for
   oxidation of dissolved Fe(II) were about 10 times faster than those
   previously predicted for heterogeneous oxidation of Fe(II).}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. There is little data on the relationships between
   hypertension and snoring in Asians, whose anthropometrics and prevalence
   of diseases are different from Western populations. This study evaluated
   the prevalence and the factors associated with snoring in an adult
   Korean population (>= 18 years). Methods. The questions on snoring were
   divided into five Likert scales {[}{''}never'' to ``severe''(
   everyday)]. Subjects were divided into two mutually exclusive groups:
   moderate and severe groups of snorers considered habitual snorers, and
   never, sometimes and mild snorers considered the non-snoring group. We
   classified the severity of hypertension according to JNC 6. Independent
   variables included demographic and baseline characteristics,
   hypertension, anthropometrics, current medical history, medications and
   substance use. Results. Overall prevalence of habitual snoring is
   15.58\% in males and 8.40\% in females. The mean age, body mass index (
   BMI), both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and anthropometric
   data, including neck, chest and abdominal girth, were significantly
   associated with the snoring group in both men and women. Neck length was
   only significantly shorter in females, not in males. Alcohol consumption
   rate was significantly higher in the snoring group of the men, but was
   lower in the snoring group in women. Smoking did not show any
   significant relationship with snoring and non-snoring groups in both
   genders. Snoring was significantly higher in the menopause group ( odds
   ratio 2.8) than the premenopausal group. Fifty per cent in the snoring
   group and 33.08\% in the non-snoring group were diagnosed as having
   hypertension. The prevalence of hypertension was significantly higher in
   the snoring group aged < 40 years and was weakly significant in those
   subjects aged between 40 and 60 years in males. The prevalence of
   hypertension was significantly higher in the snoring group in those both
   aged < 40 years and those aged between 40 and 60 years in females. Those
   aged > 60 years old in both genders showed no significant differences in
   the prevalence of hypertension between snorers and non-snorers. The
   relationship between hypertension and snoring after adjustments for age,
   BMI, age, smoke and alcohol usage showed a dose-response relationship in
   both genders. Conclusions. This study showed the dose-response
   relationship between hypertension and snoring, even after adjustments
   for age, BMI, age, smoke and alcohol usage. Snoring significantly
   increased after menopause in women. Snoring had a significant
   relationship with neck length in females but not in males. There is a
   dose response relationship between snoring and hypertension in both
   genders in those subjects aged < 60 years old.}},

Abstract = {{Investigation into the methods of direct fabrication for
   submicron-detailed patterns without the use of any photomask was carried
   out using two-photon polymerization (TPP). Some patterns can be
   fabricated easily in the range of several micrometers by solidifying
   inside a photopolymerizable resin by a scanning process using a
   volume-pixel (voxel) matrix that is transformed from a bitmap figure
   file. The voxels are generated consecutively to merge into adjoining
   voxels in the process of fabricating a pattern. The resolution of a
   fabricated pattern can be obtained under the diffraction limit of a
   laser beam due to the nonlinear absorption phenomenon. In this paper, a
   top-down reverse building technique was introduced to fabricate a
   polymeric pattern on a metal layer. Also, a contour offset algorithm
   (COA) and a beam expanding method have been attempted to make precise
   patterns and to enlarge the working area. Through this work, several
   patterns for various applications on nano- and microtechnology were
   fabricated on a glass plate and a thin metal layer to demonstrate the

Abstract = {{Instances of morbidity amongst rock lobsters (Panulirus cygnus) arriving
   at factories in Western Australia (WA) have been attributed to stress
   during post-harvest handling. This study used discriminant analysis to
   determine whether physiological correlates of stress following a period
   of simulated post-harvest handling had any validity as predictors of
   future rejection or morbidity of western rock lobsters. Groups of 230
   western rock lobsters were stored for 6 h in five environments
   (submerged/flowing sea water, submerged/recirculating sea water, humid
   air, flowing seawater spray, and recirculated seawater spray). The
   experiment was conducted in late spring (ambient sea water 22 degrees
   C), and repeated again in early autumn (ambient sea water 26 degrees C).
   After 6 h treatment, each lobster was graded for acceptability for live
   export, numbered, and its haemolymph was sampled. The samples were
   analysed for a number of physiological and health status parameters. The
   lobsters were then stored for a week in tanks in the live lobster
   factory to record mortality. The mortality of lobsters in the factory
   was associated with earlier deviations in haemolymph parameters as they
   emerged from the storage treatments. Discriminant analysis (DA) of the
   haemolymph assays enabled the fate of 80-90\% of the lobsters to be
   correctly categorised within each experiment. However, functions derived
   from one experiment were less accurate at predicting mortality when
   applied to the other experiments. One of the reasons for this was the
   higher mortality and the more severe patho-physiological changes
   observed in lobsters stored in humid air or sprays at the higher
   temperature. The analysis identified lactate accumulation during
   emersion and associated physiological and haemocyte-related effects as a
   major correlate of mortality. Reducing these deviations, for example by
   Submerged transport, is expected to ensure high levels of survival. None
   of the indicators tested predicted mortality with total accuracy. The
   simplest and most accurate means of comparing emersed treatments was to
   count the mortality afterwards.}},

Abstract = {{Whether the purchasing power parity (PPP) theory of exchange rate
   determination holds for transition economies is an interesting question,
   given peculiar situations of transition economies. In this paper, we
   examine the real exchange rate for Croatia, a transition economy that
   has had some success in moving towards a market economy. Using a battery
   of tests that allow for a maximum of two structural breaks whose
   locations are determined endogenously from the data, we failed to find
   evidence supporting the validity of PPP for the Croatian economy. Thus,
   the conjecture that transition economies experiencing growth in
   productivity and real wages should experience real appreciation (thereby
   introducing doubt as to whether purchasing power parity holds) is
   substantiated by our results. (c) 2005 Society for Policy Modeling.

Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a basic, easily to multi-contact problems extendable,
   non-smooth approach is applied to analyze a bar striking an inelastic
   half-space. Coulomb contact is assumed and modeled by using set-valued
   Newtonian impact laws in normal as well as in tangential direction. The
   resulting linear complementarity problem contains all possible impact
   states and provides an instantaneous collision operator that respects
   all inequality constraints. This operator depends on the orientation of
   the bar and determines uniquely the post-impact velocities as functions
   of the pre-impact state. Different types of solutions may occur,
   including ``stick'' and ``slip''. In this context, stick and slip have
   to be understood as the two cases characterized by the tangential
   impulsive force as an element of either the set-valued or of the
   single-valued domain of the friction law. Depending on the choice of
   parameters, sign reversal of the tangential contact velocity is
   possible. For certain inertia properties and initial conditions, the
   collision operator yields an impact, even for initially vanishing normal
   contact velocity. This phenomenon is well known as the Painleve paradox.
   The results obtained by this fully non-smooth rigid body approach are
   compared with those of other impact models, such as a lumped mass model
   with compliance elements, and a collision operator used for particle
   interactions in flows.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study was undertaken to determine whether the benefits
   of a single course of antenatal steroid treatment for neonatal
   respiratory morbidity diminish beyond 7 days.
   Study design: A retrospective chart review was performed of all
   deliveries less than 34 weeks' gestation where delivery occurred after
   completing a single course of antenatal steroids (dexamethasone or
   betamethasone). Maternal and neonatal charts were reviewed, treatment
   course was confirmed, and neonatal morbidities were collected.
   Results: Of 197 neonates whose mothers received a full course of
   antenatal steroids, 98 delivered within 7 days and 99 delivered more
   than 7 days after the initial dose. The 2 groups were similar in
   gestational age at delivery (30 weeks 0 days vs 30 weeks 4 days). The
   groups were also similar in maternal age, race, payor status, type of
   steroid given, route of delivery, gender, and birth weight. Overall,
   infants delivering within 7 days had a lower incidence of receiving
   respiratory support for more than 24 hours (62\% vs 81 \%, P < .01), but
   there were no significant differences between the groups in surfactant
   treatment (39\% vs 47\%), use of mechanical ventilation (49\% vs 59\%),
   necrotizing enterocolitis (6\% vs 4\%), intraventricular hemorrhage
   (15\% vs 20\%), oxygen dependence at 28 days (24\% vs 23\%) or at 36
   weeks estimated gestational age (13\% vs 12\%), length of stay (34 days
   vs 38 days), or mortality (2 vs 0). These results were no different when
   evaluating only infants delivered before 30 weeks.
   Conclusion: Among infants exposed to a single course of antenatal
   steroids, delivering more than 7 days after initiation of treatment was
   associated with an increased need for short-term respiratory support,
   but not other measures of neonatal morbidity. These data challenge the
   concept of diminishing efficacy of steroids after 7 days, and question
   the need for considering a rescue course. (C) 2005 Mosby, Inc. All

Abstract = {{Background: Increased dietary intake of antioxidants has been associated
   with higher lung function, but few studies have used biological markers
   of antioxidant intake.
   Objective: This study aimed to determine if antioxidant status, as
   measured by blood levels, influences lung function.
   Design: Using a random subsample of 479 participants, aged 18 - 65 y
   old, from a larger cross-sectional observational study, the association
   of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) with plasma copper, vitamin C,
   vitamin E and serum selenium was assessed.
   Results: An s. d. increase in blood copper level was associated with a
   difference in FEV1 of - 48 ml (95\% confidence intervals: - 95, - 2 ml,
   P = 0.04), vitamin C + 49 ml (+4, +94, P = 0.03), vitamin E - 15 ml
   (-62, +32, P = 0.53) and selenium +52 ml (+7, +96, P = 0.02). The sizes
   of association were not appreciably altered in a mutually adjusted
   model.
   Conclusions: Higher levels of serum vitamin C and selenium appear to be
   associated with higher FEV1. The association between higher serum copper
   and lower FEV1 requires further study in view of the ubiquitous exposure
   to this mineral. Sponsorship: National Asthma Campaign and British Lung

Abstract = {{This study extends previous research on gap analysis of service quality
   by including not only functional service quality but also relational
   benefits. To this end, afield study was carried out in 36 hotels and 35
   restaurants. The samples consisted of 213 employees and 657 customers. A
   questionnaire format was used to measure both functional and relational
   service quality, as well as customers' loyalty. When comparing employee
   and customer perceptions, gaps potentially range from `overestimation'
   (employees' perceptions are greater than customers' perceptions)
   to,underestimation' (customers' perceptions are greater than employees'
   perceptions). In general, the results indicated that the employees
   surveyed overestimated the service quality they offer to customers,
   although gaps were greater for certain service attributes than for
   others. In addition, some gaps were more related to customer loyalty
   than others. The findings also showed that employees' overestimation of
   relational benefits plays a moderating role, increasing the negative
   relationship between employees' overestimation of functional service
   quality and customers' loyalty. The theoretical and managerial
   implications of the results are discussed further in this paper.}},

   surgically treated by means of posterior lumbar interbody fusion with

   initial postoperative phase, the patient complained of severe pain in
   the low back and gluteal region 9 day after surgery. Radiographs as well
   as CT-scans showed a horizontal fracture of the sacrum. After a short
   period of immobilisation the patient was carefully remobilised with an
   orthesis and the pain gradually subsided. Conventional radiographs one
   year later showed complete consolidation of the fracture and a good
   clinical result. There are only two literature reports with together 3
   cases of patients attaining an early sacral fracture after
   spondylodesis. The main cause seems to be the unphysiological
   biomechanical stress placed on the osteoporotic sacrum after
   moresegmental spondylodesis. Further risk factors seem to be adipositas,
   female gender and age. Despite the rarity of sacral fractures after
   lumbosacral fusion, this complication should at least be considered in
   the differential diagnosis in patients who complain of persisting or

Abstract = {{This paper presents an outline methodology and an operational framework
   for assessing and mapping the risk of death or serious harm to people
   from flooding, covering death and physical injuries as a direct and
   immediate consequence of deep and/or fast flowing floodwaters (usually
   by drowning), and deaths and physical injuries associated with the flood
   event (but occurring in the immediate aftermath). The main factors that
   affect death or injury to people during floods include flow velocity,
   flow depth, and the degree to which people are exposed to the flood. The
   exposure potential is related to such factors as the ``suddenness{''} of
   flooding (and amount of flood warning), the extent of the floodplain,
   people's location on the floodplain, and the character of their
   accommodation. In addition, risks to people are affected by social
   factors including their vulnerability and behaviour. A methodology is
   described for estimating the likely annual number of deaths/injuries.
   This is based on defining zones of different flood hazard and, for each
   zone, estimating the total number of people located there, the
   proportion that are likely to be exposed to a flood, and the proportion
   of those exposed who are likely to be injured or killed during a flood
   event. The results for each zone are combined to give an overall risk
   for each flood cell and/or community. The objective of the research
   reported here is to develop a method which could be applied using a
   map-based approach in which flood risks to people are calculated and
   displayed spatially for selected areas or communities. The information
   needed for each part of the process is described in the paper, and the
   further research to provide the required information is identified.}},

Abstract = {{In philosophy, `saying something about something' implies that someone
   proposes a thought to some potential listener, who, in turn, responds by
   offering another proposition to the first speaker. Attention to the
   dative and donative structure of the exchange enacted in all
   philosophical events can be developed into a phenomenological analysis
   of the intersubjective, social, historical, traditional, authoritative,
   and dialogical properties that constitute the essence of philosophy.
   Such a (metaphilosophical) phenomenology cannot avoid the question of
   what basically binds the interlocutors in their search. Does their
   sought, through the multiplication of datives and proposals, seduce the
   participants to a friendly alliance that unites their different paths
   and discoveries through convergence toward the never quite revealed, but
   nevertheless orienting and supportive truth?}},

Abstract = {{Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder that primarily affects
   girls, most of whom have mutations in the transcription regulatory gene
   MECP2. However, mutations in MECP2 also have been identified in normal
   carrier female individuals, female individuals with mild learning
   disabilities and features of Angelman syndrome, and male individuals
   with Klinefelter syndrome or Rett syndrome-like features, fatal neonatal
   encephalopathy, and familial X-linked mental retardation with or without
   motor abnormalities. Therefore, molecular testing should be considered
   for a wide spectrum of individuals. As such, Rett syndrome remains a
   clinical diagnosis. In this article, we also discuss three recent
   developments: (1) the recognition of significant gallbladder
   dysfunction, especially in those 20 years of age or younger; (2) a
   clinical trial of folate and betaine, which produced no objective
   improvement but did yield a subjective increase in attention and

Abstract = {{Ionization energies and the polarizabilites of a shallow donor in a
   quantum well of the GaAs/Ga1-xAlxAs superlattice system are obtained. In
   the presence of an electric field, a variational procedure within the
   effective mass approximation is employed. Within the one-electron
   approximation the occurrence of Mott transition is seen when the binding
   energy of a donor vanishes. The effects of Anderson localization and
   exchange and correlation in the Hubbard model are included in our model.
   It is found that the ionization energy (i) decreases as well width
   increases for a given electric field, (ii) decreases when well width
   increases, and (iii) the critical concentration at which the
   metal-insulator transition occurs is reduced in an external electric
   field. All the calculations have been carried out with finite and
   infinite barriers and the results are compared with available data in

Abstract = {{In response to calls to improve public health education and our own
   desire to provide a more relevant educational experience to our Master
   of Public Health students, the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB)
   School of Public Health designed, developed, and instituted a fully
   integrated public health core curriculum in the fall of 2001.
   This curriculum combines content from discipline-specific courses in
   biostatistics, environmental health, epidemiology, health
   administration, and the social and behavioral sciences, and delivers it
   in a 15 credit hour, team-taught course designed in modules covering
   such topics as tobacco, infectious diseases, and emergency preparedness.
   Weekly skills-building sessions increase student competence in data
   analysis and interpretation, communication, ethical decision-making,
   community-based interventions, and policy and program planning.
   Evaluations affirm that the integrated core is functioning as intended:
   as a means to provide critical content in the core disciplines in their
   applied context. As public health education continues to be debated, the
   UAB public health integrated core curriculum can serve as one model for
   providing quality instruction that is highly relevant to professional
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{Using patch-clamp techniques, we investigated the characteristics of the
   spontaneous oscillatory activity displayed by starburst amacrine cells
   in the mouse retina. At a holding potential of -70 mV, oscillations
   appeared as spontaneous, rhythmic inward currents with a frequency of
   similar to 3.5 Hz and an average maximal amplitude of similar to 120 pA.
   Application of TEA, a potassium channel blocker, increased the amplitude
   of oscillatory currents by >70\% but reduced their frequency by similar
   to 17\%. The TEA effects did not appear to result from direct actions on
   starburst cells, but rather a modulation of their synaptic inputs.
   Oscillatory currents were inhibited by
   6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxalene-2,3-dione (CNQX), an antagonist of
   AMPA/kainate receptors, indicating that they were dependent on a
   periodic glutamatergic input likely from presynaptic bipolar cells. The
   oscillations were also inhibited by the calcium channel blockers cadmium
   and nifedipine, suggesting that the glutamate release was calcium
   dependent. Application of AP4, an agonist of mGluR6 receptors on
   on-center bipolar cells, blocked the oscillatory currents in starburst
   cells. However, application of TEA overcame the AP4 blockade, suggesting
   that the periodic glutamate release from bipolar cells is intrinsic to
   the inner plexiform layer in that, under experimental conditions, it can
   occur independent of photoreceptor input. The GABA receptor antagonists
   picrotoxin and bicuculline enhanced the amplitude of oscillations in
   starburst cells prestimulated with TEA. Our results suggest that this
   enhancement was due to a reduction of a GABAergic feedback inhibition
   from amacrine cells to bipolar cells and the resultant increased
   glutamate release. Finally, we found that some ganglion cells and other
   types of amacrine cell also displayed rhythmic activity, suggesting that
   oscillatory behavior is expressed by a number of inner retinal neurons.}},

   theoretical model that shows how to eliminate the capture and the use of
   first-class continuations in the presence of a generalized stack
   inspection mechanism. The second half of the paper explains how to
   translate this model into practice in two different contexts. First, we
   reformulate the servlet interaction language in the PLT Web server,
   which heavily relies on first-class continuations. Using our technique,
   servlet programs can be run directly under the control of
   non-cooperative web servers such as Apache. Second, we show how to use
   our new technique to copy and reconstitute the stack on MSIL.Net using
   exception handlers. This establishes that Scheme's first-class
   continuations can exist on non-cooperative virtual machines.}},

Journal = {{GENETICS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{171}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{385-392}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The dominance of deleterious mutations has important consequences for
   phenomena such as inbreeding depression, the evolution of diploidy, and
   levels of natural genetic variation. Kacser and Burns' metabolic theory
   provides a paradigmatic explanation for why most large-effect mutations
   are recessive. According to the metabolic theory, the recessivity of
   large-effect mutations is a consequence of a diminishing-returns
   relationship between flux through a metabolic pathway and enzymatic
   activity at any step in the pathway, which in turn is an inevitable
   consequence of long metabolic pathways. A major line of support for this
   theory was the demonstration of a negative correlation between
   homozygous effects and dominance of mutations in Drosophila, consistent
   with a central prediction of the metabolic theory. Using data on gene
   deletions in yeast, we show that a negative correlation between
   homozygous effects and dominance of mutations exists for all major
   categories of genes analyzed, not just those encoding enzymes. The
   relationship between dominance and homozygous effects is similar for
   duplicated and single-copy genes and for genes whose products are
   members of protein complexes and those that are not. A complete
   explanation of dominance therefore requires either a generalization of
   Kacser and Burns' theory to nonenzyme genes or a new theory.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of narrowband interference (NBI) on two ultra wideband (UWB)
   systems is analyzed. The two systems are impulse radio (IR) and a
   variation of it, termed direct-sequence IR (DS-IR). The signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR) at the decision device of a correlation receiver is computed
   for both systems, assuming that the NBI is wide sense stationary and
   that the channel is frequency-selective. The SNR is expressed by means
   of a simple equation involving the signal and the interference spectrum.
   Next, a statistical model for the interference is introduced,
   considering the interference as the sum of a given number of sinusoidal
   signals with random powers and frequencies. The bit-error rate of IR and
   DS-IR is derived. The results are then specialized and compared with
   simulations in three case studies of practical interest, where the NBI
   is a single jammer with deterministic power and frequency, a multitone
   signal with random frequencies, or a grid of interfering signals with
   random powers.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the study is to test GPS equipment receivers commonly used
   for natural resource management, and to quantify recording rate and
   positioning quality under different conditions, the objective being to
   assist GPS users in their choices.
   Four factors were evaluated: (a) the type of receiver: three ranges of
   GPS equipment were compared; (b) forest cover effects (three covers were
   tested: open cover, coppice and deciduous high forest); (c) the effects
   of GPS survey components: the number of recordings (between 1 and 300),
   the Position Dilution of Precision (PDOP) thresholding (between 4 and
   50), the time interval between recordings (between 1 and 15 seconds),
   and the differential correction effect; and (d) the season (winter and
   summer). A GPS survey was carried out and a database of 140,000 readings
   was established, from which a large number of random rover files were
   extracted for each combination of factors.
   It appears the only factor not to be significant is the seasonal effect.
   The type of equipment used and the forest cover effect both modify
   positioning accuracy by a factor of 2 or 3, as does the use of
   differential correction for Trimble receivers in open cover. Increasing
   the number of recordings and the time interval between recordings, and
   decreasing the PROP threshold, improve precision, with a different
   effect according to the GPS receiver and the forest cover. The effect is
   generally more pronounced under high forest cover. The combined effects
   of GPS survey components produce significant changes in accuracy at the
   expense of the time spent in acquiring data.}},

Abstract = {{A linear elastic fracture mechanics analysis of a silicon
   dioxide-polycrystalline silicon (SiO2-Si) bimaterial system was

   is due to a ``reaction-layer fatigue{''} process where silicon
   structural films fail due to the sequential, mechanically induced
   thickening and environmentally assisted cracking of the silicon dioxide
   reaction layer which forms on the surface upon exposure to air. This
   work specifically considered the stability of a crack reaching the
   SiO2-Si interface. This analysis revealed a significant overestimate in
   the oxide thicknesses susceptible to reaction-layer fatigue reported in
   our previous studies. Instead, a surface oxide layer as thin as 15 nm
   may activate this fatigue mechanism for a polycrystalline silicon thin

Abstract = {{Main questions, which are connected with a determination of residual
   stresses by combining the hole-drilling method and whole-field
   displacement measurements, are considered in detail. The relations,
   which are needed for converting initial experimental data into stress
   values of interest, are presented for thin-walled plane structures.
   Required input data are obtained by simultaneous measurements of probe
   hole distortions in two principal strain directions on opposite sides of
   thin plane specimen. Emphasis is made on a careful quantitative
   formulation of the inverse problem, a solution of which is capable of
   deriving both membrane and bending residual stress components with the
   highest possible accuracy. It is shown that an availability of two-side
   initial data is both an essential and a necessary condition of such
   formulation. Detailed analysis of accuracy of the results obtained is
   performed proceeding from three different criteria. All presented

Abstract = {{Intravascular stents are being designed which utilise the shape memory
   properties of NiTi alloy. Despite the clinical advantages afforded by
   these stents their application has been limited by concerns about the
   large nickel ion content of the alloy. In this study, the surface
   chemistry of NiTi alloy was modified by mechanical polishing and
   oxidising heat treatments and subsequently characterised using X-ray
   photon spectroscopy (XPS). The effect of these surfaces on monolayer
   formation and barrier integrity of human umbilical vein endothelial
   cells (HUVEC) was then assessed by confocal imaging of the adherens
   junctional molecule VE-cadherin, perijunctional actin and permeability
   to 42 kDa dextrans. Dichlorofluoroscein assays were used to measure
   oxidative stress in the cells. XPS analysis of NiTi revealed its surface
   to be dominated by TiO2. However, where oxidation had occurred after
   mechanical polishing or post polishing heat treatments at 300 and 400
   degrees C in air, a significant amount of metallic nickel or nickel
   oxide species (10.5 and 18.5 at\%) remained on the surface. Exposure of
   HUVECs to these surfaces resulted in increased oxidative stress within
   the cells, loss of VE-cadherin and F-actin and significantly increased
   paracellular permeability. These pathological phenomena were not found
   in cells grown on NiTi which had undergone heat treatment at 600 degrees
   C. At this temperature thickening of the TiO2 layer had occurred due to
   diffusion of titanium ions from the bulk of the alloy, displacing nickel
   ions to sub-surface areas. This resulted in a significant reduction in
   nickel ions detectable on the sample surface (4.8 at\%). This study
   proposes that the integrity of human endothelial monolayers on NiTi is
   dependent upon the surface chemistry of the alloy and that this can be
   manipulated, using simple oxidising heat treatments. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background: Endogenous histamine-releasing factors (HRFs) are involved
   in 30-60\% of patients with chronic urticaria (CU). Evidence for their
   existence comes from in vivo studies of autoreactivity with the
   autologous serum skin test (ASST), in vitro immunoassays demonstrating
   autoantibodies against the immunoglobulin E (IgE) or the high affinity
   IgE receptor (Fc epsilon RI) and serum-induced histamine release (HR)
   from basophils and mast cells. We have examined the correlation between
   the ASST and a new basophil histamine-releasing assay (the HR-Urtikaria
   test) in a group of well-characterized CU patients and subsequently
   determined the frequency of HR-Urticaria-positive sera from a larger
   population of CU patients.
   Subjects: Group 1 consisted of 28 patients with CU (16 were
   ASST-positive) 20 patients with atopic dermatitis, 24 patients with
   allergy to birch and nine healthy controls. Group 2 consisted of 873
   unselected CU patients.
   Methods: White blood cells containing 1-2\% basophils from a healthy
   nonatopic donor were incubated with patients sera in the presence of
   interleukin (IL)-3. Histamine was measured by the glass fibre method.
   Results: Using the ASST as the true outcome, the HR-Urticaria test
   showed a sensitivity and specificity of 75\% in group 1 using a cut-off
   value for HR of > 16.5\%. None of the controls was positive in the
   HR-Urticaria test. In group 2, we found no difference in the frequency
   of positives between male (34.6\%, n = 254) and female adults (35.1\%, n
   = 576) but twice as many females as males were tested.
   Conclusions: Our studies have shown that the HR-Urticaria test has a
   good sensitivity and specificity for endogenous HRFs demonstrated by the
   ASST in patients with CU and that about one-third of unselected patients
   with CU have a positive result.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose: The investigation of epiphytic community was
   carried out on growing and dead stalls of sawgrass (Cladium mariscus
   Pohl.) from Plitvice Lakes National Park. The natural phenomenon of
   karst was protected by adding the Lales to the UNESCO list of World
   Heritage in 1979. Recently, sawgrass became the main constituent of
   macrophyte vegetation in this region. Increase in density of submerged
   vegetation indicate higher trophic level.
   Materials and Methods: Samples of epiphyton were collected from stalls
   at a site 1.5 m from shorelines and 0.5 m below water surface. In the
   laboratory, epiphyton were carefully removed from stalks by scalpel and
   rinsing with distilled water: Microphytes were determined, as well as
   their relative abundance, saprobity values of species, and the degree of
   water saprobity.
   Results and Conclusions: During the investigation, 125 microphyte
   species were established (64 on growing and 113 on dead stalls). Diatom
   species were predominant in all samples. Only 42\% species were common
   for both types of substrates. Especially on dead stalls, a mass
   development of filamentous bacteria, Cyanobacteria and Chlorophyta, was
   observed, indicating higher saprobic and trophic level in the ecosystem.
   Saprobity index of epiphytic communities ranged from 1.5 to 1.9 on
   growing stalks and from 1.8 to 2.3 on dead stalls.}},

Abstract = {{The foundation of non-equilibrium thermodynamics is discussed. The

   equivalent to the conventional formulation of the second law of
   thermodynamics. This work has to be included into the balance energy
   equation (the first law of thermodynamics). These statements, in line
   with axioms introducing internal variables, can be considered as basic
   principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The statements do not
   affect equilibrium thermodynamic functions, but allow one to obtain
   consistent definitions of non-equilibrium functions. On some examples,
   it is demonstrated that the developed formalism provides the known
   results for non-equilibrium functions in a direct way, which encourages
   us to investigate and apply the formalism further.}},

Pages = {{1463-1468}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: The aim of this clinical study was to evaluate bone
   elongation and the effectiveness of distraction osteogenesis when
   utilizing an extraosseous distractor to treat cases of atrophic
   posterior mandible.
   Methods: Fourteen surgical sites were evaluated in 10 healthy,
   non-smoking, female patients, with varying degrees of atrophic posterior
   mandible, who underwent surgery by alveolar bone distraction. The
   patients presented between 6 and 10 mm above the mandibular, inferior
   alveolar nerve. Panoramic radiographs were taken before surgery and at
   the beginning and end of the consolidation period. The extraosseous
   distractor was fixed to both the basal and the osteotomized bone. After
   a 7-day latency period, the patients rotated the distractor rod three
   times a day for 3 to 10 days (1 mm per day). The mobile segment was held
   in place for 8 to 12 weeks for bone consolidation.
   Results: The results revealed a distraction range of 2.32 to 8.11 mm
   (mean distraction +/- standard deviation, 5.12 +/- 1.67 mm), which was
   less than the real, measured distance between the upper and lower
   miniplates of the distractor (5.58 +/- 1.62 mm). The bone segments
   showed between 0.03 and 2.53 mm (mean, 0.88 +/- 0.59 mm) resorption
   above the upper miniplate. The efficacy of the extraosseous distractor
   was calculated as between 30.41\% and 94.58\% (73.45\% +/- 20.32\%).
   Conclusions: Bone regeneration was obtained in all cases; however, when
   planning alveolar bone distraction using the extraosseous distractor,
   greater distraction should be performed to compensate for the
   inclination of the distractor rod and possible bone loss. This
   adjustment should increase the efficacy of distraction osteogenesis.}},

Journal = {{CARCINOGENESIS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{1,3-Butadiene (BD) is a confirmed rodent carcinogen and a suspect human
   carcinogen that forms mutagenic epoxide metabolites during
   biotransformation. Species differences in the roles of individual DNA
   reactive intermediates in BD mutagenicity and carcinogenicity are not
   completely understood. Evidence suggests that 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane
   (DEB) is responsible for the mutagenic effect induced by exposures to
   low concentrations of BD in mice and that metabolites of
   3-butene-1,2-diol (BD-diol) are involved in the mutagenicity at high
   exposures in both mice and rats. Two reactive metabolites,
   3,4-epoxy-1,2-butanediol (EB-diol) and hydroxymethylvinyl ketone (HMVK),
   are formed during the biotransformation of BD-diol and could potentially
   be involved in BD-diol associated mutagenicity. To examine the role of
   EB-diol in BD-diol mutagenicity we have evaluated the dosimetry of
   N7-(2,3,4-trihydroxybutyl)guanine (THB-Gua) and
   N-(2,3,4-trihydroxybutyl)valine (THB-Val) in female B6C3F1 mice and
   female F344 rats exposed by inhalation to 0, 6, 18 and 36 p.p.m. BD-diol
   for 4 weeks (6 h/day x 5 days/week). Results showed higher levels of
   both THB-Gua and THB-Val in mice than in rats. An evaluation of THB-Gua
   adducts showed virtually no differences between liver and lung for
   either species, suggesting that EB-diol is stable and is freely
   circulated. The data also indicated that THB adduct formation began to
   plateau around 18 p.p.m. in both species. Most importantly, the shape of
   the dose-response curve for THB adduct formation mimicked the one
   observed for hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt)
   mutation frequency. This showed that THB adducts, which are not thought
   to be responsible for causing the mutations, are good quantitative
   indicators of mutagenicity in rodents exposed to BD-diol. Although the
   potential contribution of HMVK still needs to be evaluated, the data
   suggest that EB-diol is responsible, at least in part, for BD-diol
   associated mutagenicity in rodents.}},

Abstract = {{The aims of this study were to (1) quantify any central fatigue that
   occurs following prolonged dynamic exercise, i.e. reduced muscle force
   caused by impaired motor drive from the central nervous system and (2)
   determine whether decreased cortical arousal, assessed using critical
   flicker fusion threshold (CFF), occurs and is related to impaired
   exercise performance. Fifteen healthy men cycled at 70\% VO2peak until
   exhaustion. The peak force of maximum voluntary isometric contractions
   (MVC) of the quadriceps muscle group was reduced by 30\% at exhaustion.
   The voluntary activation ratio determined using superimposed tetanic
   stimulation fell from 0.99 to 0.86 at exhaustion. The central fatigue
   (\%) at exhaustion was 33 +/- 12\% ( SD) (assessed via the tetanus
   interpolation technique) and 54 +/- 32\% (assessed via the relative
   decline of MVC and peak tetanic force) of the total fatigue. The MVC
   only partially recovered and central fatigue persisted at 30 min
   post-exercise. CFF increased from 39.2 +/- 2.3 to 41.8 +/- 3.5 Hz at
   exhaustion, but did not correlate with central fatigue. Every subject
   reached the highest. rating of perceived exertion (RPE) at exhaustion of
   20 on the Borg scale. The time to exhaustion was related to how quickly
   the RPE increased and to the ability to sustain exercise at very high
   RPE. These data suggest that with prolonged cycling: (1) there is
   considerable and a persistent form of central fatigue, (2) there is an
   increased level of cortical arousal, and (3) exhaustion is linked to
   very high subjective RPE.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACAROLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{277-288}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In 2001 and 2002, grapevines in southcentral Washington were surveyed to
   assess taxonomic composition, density, and phenology of spider mites and
   predaceous phytoseiid mites. To determine how management intensity
   affected the mite fauna we compared mite densities among, 1) non-managed
   grapevines not exposed to any chemical input, 2) managed vineyards
   exposed to fungicides and herbicides, and 3) managed vineyards exposed
   to fungicides, herbicides, insecticides and acaricides. Because the use
   of non-selective pesticides often results in higher pest densities due
   to negative effects on predators, our hypothesis was that as chemical
   input increased, spider mite densities would increase while densities of
   phytoseiid mites would decrease. Tetranychus mcdanieli McGregor was the
   most abundant spider mite in our samples. Spider mite densities were
   lowest in sites receiving no chemical input, while spider mite densities
   were similar in low and high input managed vineyards. Galendromus
   occidentalis (Nesbitt) was the primary specialist-feeding phytoseiid
   mite in our samples. There were no significant differences in specialist
   phytoseiid mite densities among vineyards, regardless of management
   scheme. This suggests that intensive vineyard management is having
   little impact on specialists, perhaps in part due to the evolution of
   pesticide resistance among predator populations in heavily managed
   vineyards. A guild of generalist phytoseiid mites dominated non-managed
   sites, but was virtually absent from managed vineyards, regardless of
   the intensity of chemical use. Tydeid mite densities were higher on
   grapevines receiving no chemical input than in managed vineyards. More
   robust populations of generalists in non-managed sites indicate that
   intensive vineyard management has strong negative impacts on these
   predators. However, conservation of generalists may be challenging for
   growers to implement, because generalist densities were decimated even
   under the least-chemically intensive management regime.}},

Abstract = {{Software development project managers may need to focus on particular
   issues during the development process for a variety of reasons,
   including limited resources. This study utilized a survey to ask
   software practitioners, who are at the core of development, to provide
   insight into some of the important early non-technical issues of
   software development, including those related to sponsor/senior
   management, customer/users and requirements management. Proposed
   relationships among these early items, and their relationship to
   software practitioners' perception of project success, were
   quantitatively represented through a proposed Bayesian Belief Network.
   The concept of `success' was derived from a pilot study of practitioners
   and was `defined' as (a) there is a project plan, (b) the project is
   well planned, (c) practitioners have a sense of achievement while
   working on a project, (d) practitioners have a sense of doing a good job
   (i. e. delivered quality) while working on a project, and (e)
   requirements are accepted by the development team as
   realistic/achievable. The proposed causal model provided quantitative
   evidence that reaching agreement with customers/ users on requirements,
   a high level of customer/user participation, and users who make adequate
   time for requirements gathering have the largest direct impacts on
   project success among the investigated items. The proposed model
   identified the following as the critical chain of events for success:
   (1) Having a sponsor throughout the project, (2) users who make adequate
   time for requirements gathering, (3) a high level of customer/user
   participation in the development process, and (4) agreement on
   requirements between customer/users and the development team.}},

Title = {{Effects of cautionary messages and vulnerability factors on viewers'

Abstract = {{Objective: This study examined how individual difference vulnerability
   factors affect college students' perceptions of beer commercial actors'
   age, attractiveness and drinking. We were also interested in whether
   viewers' exposure to a cautionary message would affect their perceptions
   of the actors' drinking behavior. Method: Three groups of college
   students were exposed to the same set of two alcohol advertisements.
   After watching the ads, each group received a different cautionary
   message prior to answering questions about the ad's content: (1) a
   neutral message (viewed by 42\% {[}n = 119] of the sample), (2) a U.S.
   federal warning (viewed by 31\% {[}n = 89]) and (3) an industry message
   (viewed by 27\% {[}n - 76]). We also examined three putative
   vulnerability factors: age (underage 21 or not), gender and family
   history of alcohol problems (yes or no) as well as the effects of
   quantity-frequency of alcohol consumption, episodic heavy drinking,
   severity of alcohol dependence, disinhibition sensation seeking and the
   eight factors of the Alcohol Expectancy Scale. Results: The cautionary
   messages had no effect on viewers' perceptions of characters' age,
   attractiveness and drinking behavior. Although neither of the
   commercials depicted the physical act of drinking, the student raters
   nevertheless perceived the characters to be heavy episodic drinkers.
   Those reporting more alcohol dependence symptoms perceived increased
   drinking for the male characters, as did females and viewers with
   expectancies for social and physical pleasure. Conclusions: Perceptions
   of the drinking in beer commercials are based in part on the character
   depicted in the ad and in part on the demographic and personal
   vulnerability factors of the viewer.}},

Abstract = {{Sodium methyldithiocarbamate (SMD; trade name, Metam Sodium) is an
   abundantly used soil fumigant that can cause adverse health effects in
   humans, including some immunological manifestations. The mechanisms by
   which SMD acts, and its targets within the immune system are not fully
   understood. Initial experiments demonstrated that SMD administered by
   oral gavage substantially decreased IL-12 production and increased IL-10
   production induced by lipopolysaccharide in mice. The present study was
   conducted to further characterize these effects and to evaluate our
   working hypothesis that the mechanism for these effects involves
   alteration in signaling through toll-like receptor 4 and that this would
   suppress innate immunity to infection. SMD decreased the activation of
   MAP kinases and AP-1 but not NF-kappa B in peritoneal macrophages. The
   expression of mRNA for IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-18, IFN-gamma, IL-12
   p35, IL-12 p40, and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was
   inhibited by SMD, whereas mRNA for IL-10 was increased. SMD increased
   the IL-10 concentration in the peritoneal cavity and serum and decreased
   the concentration of IL-12 p40 in the serum, peritoneal cavity, and
   intracellularly in peritoneal cells (which are > 80\% macrophages).
   Similar effects on LPS-induced cytokine production were observed
   following dermal administration of SMD. The major breakdown product of
   SMD, methylisothiocyanate (MITC), caused similar effects on cytokine
   production at dosages as low as 17 mg/kg, a dosage relevant to human
   exposure levels associated with agricultural use of SMD. Treatment of
   mice with SMD decreased survival following challenge with non-pathogenic
   Escherichia coli within 24-48 h, demonstrating suppression of innate
   immunity.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple myeloma is an incurable form of lymphoid cancer characterized
   by accumulation of neoplastic plasma cells in the bone marrow cavity.
   Little is known about the mechanisms regulating myeloma cell movement
   within the bone marrow and metastasis to secondary sites. Herein, we
   identify multiple members of the wingless/ int (Wnt) family as promoters
   of myeloma cell migration/invasion. Wnt-mediated migration was
   associated with the Wnt/ RhoA pathway and did not necessitate signaling
   through beta-catenin. Activation of both RhoA and members of the protein
   kinase C (PKC) family, including PKC alpha, PKC beta, and PKC mu, were
   required for induction of migration. Activated RhoA and PKC alpha, PKC
   beta, and PKC mu appear to assemble in macromolecular signaling
   complexes that are associated with the cell membrane. These results
   suggest that Wnt responsiveness of myeloma plasma cells may be a
   significant factor in disease progression.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the prototype of
   autoimmune disease and the mechanisms underlying the disease have not
   yet been elucidated. Thus, animal models of SLE would facilitate
   investigation of pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the development of
   the disease. This study characterizes a murine model of SLE-like
   syndrome induced by syngeneic activated lymphocyte-derived DNA (referred
   to as ALD DNA).
   Methods. Normal BALB/c mice were immunized subcutaneously with highly
   purified ALD DNA. Anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies were
   determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Other SLE-associated
   autoantibodies were examined by indirect immunofluorescence and anti-ENA
   (extractable nuclear antigen) profile assay. Pathological changes were
   analysed by light microscopy and electron microscopy. Kidney cryostat
   sections were viewed by immunofluorescence for the presence of
   glomerular IgG and C3 deposits. Proteinuria was measured by Coomassie
   brilliant blue assay.
   Results. High levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies and other autoantibodies
   frequently appearing in SLE were detectable in the sera of ALD
   DNA-immunized mice. Glomerulonephritis and glomerular deposition of IgG
   plus C3 were observed in the kidney sections. Moreover, proteinuria was
   seen in the immunized mice.
   Conclusions. SLE-like syndrome can be induced by ALD DNA in normal mice.
   This induced model may be useful for elucidating the mechanisms involved
   in autoimmunity to DNA and the development of SLE.}},

   Count data from a study of the proportion of inoculated transgenic hairy
   roots expressing resistance to cyst nematode in soybean (glycine max)
   cultivars and a set of 10 examples of proportion estimation involving
   several independent samples are used for a practical evaluation of the
   findings. Results show that using the arithmetic average estimator can
   inflate variance and widen large sample confidence intervals of the
   estimates. The weighted average is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Split beam type of fracture specimens is commonly used in the
   delamination evaluation of laminated composites. The compliance and
   energy release rate (ERR) of the specimens are examined in this study in
   the new light of the crack tip deformation. Three joint deformation
   models (i.e., the rigid, semi-rigid, and flexible joint models)
   describing the different degrees of crack tip deformation are obtained
   based on three corresponding bi-layer beam theories (i.e., the
   conventional composite beam, shear deformable bi-layer beam, and
   interface deformable bi-layer beam). Due to different considerations of
   the interface displacement compatibility in each bi-layer beam theory,
   these joint models, among which the semi-rigid and flexible joint ones
   are new, show three distinct levels of accuracy in predicting the crack
   tip deformation. By using these two novel joint models, the new terms,
   which are ``missing{''} in the rigid joint model, are recovered for the
   compliances and ERRs of six common delamination specimens. As a
   validation, an asymmetric DCB specimen is examined by three joint
   models, as well as the numerical finite element analysis, and three
   distinct accuracy levels of the solutions Lire revealed again in
   comparison with finite clement analysis. It is shown that the rigid
   joint model is the most approximate due to neglecting the crack tip
   deformation, the semi-rigid model provides better solutions due to
   partially inclusion of the joint deformation, and the flexible joint
   model is the most accurate because of the fully consideration of the
   crack tip deformation. The distinction on accuracy also indicates the
   significant effect of joint (crack tip) deformation on delamination
   specimen analysis. The novel semi-rigid and flexible joint deformation
   models presented in this study provide explicit closed-form solutions of
   fracture parameters which can be easily adopted in practice. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Aluminum- and chromium-substituted barium ferrite particles with single
   magnetic domain were prepared using self-propagating combustion method.
   The crystalline structure, size, coercivity and microwave absorption
   property of the particles were investigated by means of X-ray
   diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, vibrating sample
   magnetometry and vector network analyzer. The results show that the
   crystalline structure of BaFe12-xAlxO19 is still hexagonal. But when the
   chromium substitution amount y exceeds 0.6, the extra chromium ions
   cannot enter the lattice of BaFe12-yCryO19. After Fe3+ is partly
   substituted with Al3+ and Cr3+, the microwave absorption properties of
   barium ferrite are improved. The maximum absorption reaches 34.76 dB.
   The ferromagnetic resonance is an important channel of barium ferrite to
   absorb microwaves with high frequency. Aluminum and chromium
   substitutions change the ferromagnetic resonant frequency of barium
   ferrite. The multipeak phenomenon of the ferromagnetic resonance
   increases the microwave absorption capability of barium ferrite. (C)

Abstract = {{Genetically engineered herpes simplex virus ICP34.5 null mutants
   replicate only in dividing cells and have shown potential for the
   treatment of malignant disease, including glioma. Phase I trials have
   demonstrated the safety of these viruses in various clinical settings
   but it is envisaged that for full efficacy they will be used in
   combination with other therapeutic modalities. To enhance virus-induced
   tumour cytotoxicity, we have engineered an ICP34.5 null mutant (HSV1716)
   of HSV1 which expresses the noradrenaline transporter gene (NAT). This
   virus is designated HSV1716/NAT. We have shown previously that
   introduction of the NAT gene into a range of tumour cells, via
   plasmid-mediated transfection, conferred the capacity for active uptake
   of the radiopharmaceutical {[}I-131] MIBG and resulted in dose-dependent
   toxicity. In this study, combination therapy utilising HSV1716/NAT and
   {[}I-131] MIBG was assessed in vitro by the MTT assay. We demonstrate
   that the NAT gene, introduced by HSV1716/NAT into cultured glioma cells,
   was expressed 1 h after viral infection, enabling active uptake of
   {[}I-131] MIBG. The combination of viral oncolysis and induced
   radiopharmaceutical uptake resulted in significantly enhanced
   cytotoxicity compared to either agent alone and the response was dose-
   and time-dependent. These studies show that the combination of oncolytic
   HSV therapy with targeted radiotherapy has the potential for effective
   tumour cell kill and warrants further investigation as a treatment for
   malignant glioma.}},

Abstract = {{The baseline New Keynesian model cannot replicate the observed

   values. As a result, several extensions have been suggested to improve

   the baseline sticky price model of Calvo's {[}1983. Staggered prices in
   a utility maximizing framework. Journal of Monetary Economics 12,
   383-398.] and three extensions. Our empirical results are as follows.
   First, we find that adding price indexation improves the fit of Calvo's
   {[}1983. Staggered prices in a utility maximizing framework. Journal of
   Monetary Economics 12, 383-398.] model. Second, models with both
   staggered price and wage setting dominate models with only price
   rigidities. Third, introducing wage indexation does not significantly
   improve the fit. Fourth, all model estimates suggest a high degree of
   price stickiness. Fifth, the estimates of labor supply elasticity are
   higher in models with both staggered price and wage contracts. Finally,
   the estimated inflation parameters of the Taylor rule are stable across

Abstract = {{A comprehensive classification framework was developed that refines the
   current Xanthomonas classification scheme and provides a detailed
   assessment of Xanthomonas diversity at the species, subspecies,
   pathovar, and subpathovar levels. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using
   primers targeting the conserved repetitive sequences BOX,
   enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC), and repetitive
   extragenic palindromic (REP) (rep-PCR) was used to generate genomic
   fingerprints of 339 Xanthomonas strains comprising 80 pathovars, 20 DNA
   homology groups, and a Stenotrophomonas maltophilia reference strain.
   Computer-assisted pattern analysis of the rep-PCR profiles permitted the
   clustering of strains into distinct groups, which correspond directly to
   the 20 DNA-DNA homology groups (genospecies) previously identified.
   Group 9 strains (X. axonopodis) were an exception and did not cluster
   together into a coherent group but comprised six subgroups. Over 160
   strains not previously characterized by DNA-DNA hybridization analysis,
   or not previously classified, were assigned to specific genospecies
   based on the classification framework developed. The rep-PCR delineated
   subspecific groups within X. hortorum, X. arboricola, X. axonopodis, X.
   oryzae, X. campestris, and X. translucens. Numerous taxonomic issues
   with regard to the diversity, similarity, redundancy, or misnaming were
   resolved. This classification framework will enable the rapid
   identification and classification of new, novel, or unknown Xanthomonas
   strains that are pathogenic or are otherwise associated with plants.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Tacrolimus (TAC) dosing in lung transplantation is
   traditionally based on blood trough levels (CO). The best sampling
   strategy for the estimation of total drug exposure (area-under-the-curve
   {[}AUC]) has not been determined.
   Methods: Thirty-one 12-hour pharmacokinetic profiles were studied in 15
   patients (8 men and 7 women, 42.0 +/- 13 years) post-bilateral lung
   transplantation (7.3 +/- 3.7 months; range, 3-18 months). Twelve-hour
   AUC (AUC(0-12)) was calculated by trapezoidal rule. Relationships
   between individual concentration points or abbreviated kinetics (2-4
   concentration points) and AUC(0-12) were determined by linear regression
   analysis (R 2; absolute prediction error {[}APE]).
   Results: Pharmacokinetic profiles showed high variability, particularly
   in the absorption phase. AUC was 221 +/- 47.2 ng/ml (range, 156-329.3
   ng/ml) at CO 10 to 15 ng/ml and was independent of TAC dose (R-2 =
   0.002). CO was poorly predictive of AUC(0-12) (R-2 = 0.64; APE, 16.1\%
   10.9\%; range, 1.4\%-37.8\%). The predictive performance for AUC(0-12)
   was highest with abbreviated kinetics using 4 (C0/C2/C3/C4: R-2 = 0.99;
   APE, 2.6\% +/- 2.0\%; range, 0.1\%-7\%) or 3 concentration points
   (C0/C2/C4: R-2 = 6.98; APE, 2.6\% +/- 2.1\%; range, 0.1\%-9.1\%). Of the
   2-point kinetics C2/C6 (R-2 = 0.96; APE, 5.3\% 3.7\%; range,
   0.1\%-12.7\%), C2/C4 (R-2 =0.94, APE 6.7\% +/- 4.8\%; range
   0.1\%-14.6\%) and C0/C4 (R-2 = 0.94; APE 4.1\% +/- 2.9\%; range,
   0.5\%-11.4\%) performed best. Single point strategies (best was C4: R-2
   = 0.94; APE 7.1\% +/- 5.5\%, range, 0.2\%-24.1\%) all had unacceptably
   high APE (range > 15\%).
   Conclusion: True TAC exposure shows high variability in stable lung
   transplant patients and is poorly predicted by CO. Abbreviated kinetics
   covering at least 2 concentration points between 0 and 4 hours post-drug
   intake are required for an accurate estimation of AUC.}},

Abstract = {{Group C rotaviruses were detected by reverse transcription-PCR in 14
   (2.3\%) of 611 group A rotavirus-negative stool specimens from the
   patients admitted to the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease
   Research, Bangladesh hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh, during July to
   December 2003. The low rate of detection suggested that infection with
   group C rotaviruses was an uncommon cause of hospitalization due to
   gastroenteritis. In addition, coinfections with pathogenic enteric
   bacteria were frequently observed in group C rotavirus-infected
   patients. Nucleotide sequence comparison of the VP4, VP6, and VP7 genes
   revealed that the Bangladeshi group C rotaviruses were most similar to
   Nigerian group C rotavirus strains. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that
   all human group C rotaviruses, including the strains isolated in our
   study, clustered in a monophyletic branch, which was distantly related
   to the branch comprised of animal group C rotaviruses.}},

Abstract = {{The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, after completing its developmental
   stages and a brief reproductive period, spends the remainder of its
   adult life as an organism consisting exclusively of post-mitotic cells.
   Here we show that telomere length varies considerably in clonal
   populations of wild-type worms, and that these length differences are
   conserved over at least ten generations, suggesting a length regulation
   mechanism in cis. This observation is strengthened by the finding that
   the bulk telomere length in different worm strains varies considerably.
   Despite the close correlation of telomere length and clonal cellular
   senescence in mammalian cells, nematodes with long telomeres were
   neither long lived, nor did worm populations with comparably short
   telomeres exhibit a shorter life span. Conversely, long-lived daf-2 and
   short-lived daf-16 mutant animals can have either long or short
   telomeres. Telomere length of post-mitotic cells did not change during
   the aging process, and the response of animals to stress was found
   independent of telomere length. Collectively, our data indicate that
   telomere length and life span can be uncoupled in a post-mitotic
   setting, suggesting separate pathways for replication-dependent and
   -independent aging.}},

Abstract = {{White spruce (Picea glauca (Moeneh) Voss) is a characteristic primary
   species of the Canadian boreal forest region, where it occurs in
   conifer-dominated and mixedwood forest types. Genetic diversity and
   population structure of white spruce may differ between the
   conifer-dominated and mixedwood forest types owing to the inherent
   differences in stand structure and dynamics. The objective of our study
   was to determine genetic diversity and population structure of pristine
   white spruce stands as they occur in conifer-dominated and mixedwood
   forest types at the EMEND (Ecosystem Management Emulating Natural
   Disturbance) study sites in northern Alberta. Nuclear microsatellite DNA
   markers were used to examine genetic diversity and population structure
   of 16 pristine natural old-growth (>= 100 years) white spruce stands
   (subpopulations) of fire origin; 8 from conifer-dominated and 8 from
   neighboring mixedwood forest types. High levels of genetic diversity
   were observed, as expected. The genetic diversity and genetic
   constitution of white spruce were similar between the conifer-dominated
   and mixedwood forest types. Most of the genetic variation resided within
   subpopulations, with only about 2\% genetic differentiation detected
   among 16 subpopulations as well as among 8 subpopulations within the
   same forest type. The mean genetic distances among subpopulations within
   and between the forest types were similar. Our study suggests that white
   spruce genetic resources are similar in the conifer-dominated and
   mixedwood forest types located in the EMEND study area in northern
   Alberta, and it provides the benchmarks for determining and monitoring
   the genetic diversity impacts of forest harvesting and forest fires.}},

Abstract = {{Let A be a possibly unbounded skew-adjoint operator on the Hilbert space
   X with compact resolvent. Let C be a bounded operator from D(A) to
   another Hilbert space Y. We consider the system governed by the state
   equation <(z)over dot >(t)=Az(t) with the output y(t)=Cz(t). We
   characterize the exact observability of this system only in terms of C
   and of the spectral elements of the operator A. The starting point in
   the proof of this result is a Hautus-type test, recently obtained in
   Burq and Zworski (J. Amer. Soc. 17 (2004) 443-471) and Miller (J. Funct.
   Anal. 218 (2) (2005) 425-444). We then apply this result to various
   systems governed by partial differential equations with observation on
   the boundary of the domain. The Schrodinger equation, the
   Bernoulli-Euler plate equation and the wave equation in a square are
   considered. For the plate and Schrodinger equations, the main novelty
   brought in by our results is that we prove the exact boundary
   observability for an arbitrarily small observed part of the boundary.
   This is done by combining our spectral observability test to a theorem
   of Beurling on nonharmonic Fourier series and to a new number theoretic
   result on shifted squares. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1), a CXC chemokine that play
   important roles in tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis of tumor
   cells, has a polymorphism at position 801 of its 3'-untranslated region,
   known as SDF1-3'A. This polymorphism has been investigated in HIV-1
   infection and the susceptibility to breast cancer.
   In this investigation 72 lung cancer patients and 262 cases of normal
   healthy control were investigated for the genotype frequency of SDF-1
   gene. Genotype frequency was carried out by PCR-RFLP method. Of 72
   cancer patients 9 (12.5\%) cases were emerged with AA genotype, 38
   (52.8\%) patients with AG and 25 (34.7\%) with GG genotype. Comparison
   of these data with genotype frequency of SDF-1 gene of 262 normal
   healthy controls indicates a significant difference among patient and
   control groups (P=0.008). Results also showed that the frequency of AA
   and AG genotypes was higher among patients, while the frequency of GG
   genotype was lower compared to the controls. By considering the
   importance of SDF-1 in several physiological processes and also its
   significant biological behavior in cancer metastasis and on the basis of
   the results of this study we conclude that AA and AG genotypes of SDF-1
   may be considered as factors increasing the susceptibility of Iranian
   patients to lung cancer. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We present here a technique to compute electronic thermal conductivity
   of fluids using quantum-molecular dynamics and the formulation of
   Chester-Tellung for the Kubo-Greenwood formula. In order to validate our
   implementation, the electrical and thermal conductivities of liquid

   K. Results agree well with experimental data for Al at 1000 K. The
   Lorentz number, defined as K/sigma T, where K is the thermal
   conductivity, sigma is the electrical conductivity, and T is the
   temperature, is close to the ideal value of 2.44x10(-8) for metals, and
   the Wiedemann-Franz law is verified.}},

Abstract = {{The Food and Drug Administration approved over-the-counter (OTC) sale of
   nicotine gum and nicotine patches in 1996. We used data from the 1996
   California Tobacco Survey to compare the rates of nicotine replacement
   therapy (NRT) use and smoking abstinence in California for each month
   during a period immediately preceding and immediately following the OTC
   availability of nicotine gum and patches. For smokers eligible to report
   a quit attempt, the proportion making a quit attempt using NRT and the
   proportion remaining abstinent was calculated for each of the 12 months
   prior to the survey interview. Multiple regression modeling of quit
   attempts and abstinence included a term for the number of months between
   the quit attempt and survey interview and dummy variables for the months
   before and after the OTC availability of NRT. Results showed a
   significant increase in the fraction of smokers using the patch (P <
   0.01) and gum (P < 0.05) immediately following their availability OTC.
   There was also a significantly higher proportion of smokers reporting
   abstinence with gum use (P < 0.01) and a significant increase in
   reported abstinence with patch use (P < 0.01) during the period of time
   immediately following the availability of these products without a
   prescription. The results of this study suggest that removing the
   prescription status of NRT products resulted in an immediate increase in
   quit attempts and smoking abstinence with the use of nicotine gum or
   patches.}},

   data drawn from Title VIII sexual harassment cases, the authors present
   3 studies designed to examine the nature of sexual harassment in
   housing. Despite overall similarities to its workplace counterpart, a
   number of distinctive characteristics of residential harassment were
   evident; in particular, the phenomena of home invasion and masculine
   possessiveness have no apparent workplace parallels. Housing sexual
   harassment often takes place in the victim's home, creating an intensely
   threatening atmosphere. Legal and public policy implications are

Abstract = {{Intact myenteric ganglia from 4- to 10-day-old rats were isolated from
   the small intestine. The preparations were cultured overnight, and drugs
   were applied within this time frame (20 h). Whole cell patch-clamp
   technique was used to measure basal membrane potential and
   carbachol-induced depolarization at neurons within these ganglia.
   Pretreatment with TNF-alpha (100 ng/ml) hyperpolarized the membrane
   (from -31.0 +/- 2.7 mV under control conditions to -61.2 +/- 3.2 mV in
   the presence of the cytokine) and potentiated the depolarization induced
   by carbachol (from 5.2 +/- 0.7 mV under control conditions to 27.5 +/-
   2.0 mV in the presence of the cytokine). These effects were mimicked by
   carbocyclic thromboxane A(2) (10(-6) mol/l), a stable thromboxane A(2)
   agonist. The TNF-alpha action was inhibited by 1-benzylimidazole (2 x
   10(-4) mol/l), a thromboxane synthase inhibitor, and BAY U 3405 (5 x
   10(-4) mol/l), an inhibitor of thromboxane receptors. Measurements of
   thromboxane production in the supernatant of the culture revealed an
   increased concentration of thromboxane B-2, the stable metabolite of
   thromboxane A2, after exposure to TNF-alpha. Immuncytochemical staining
   for cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and the neuronal marker
   microtubule-associating protein-2 revealed an upregulation of COX-2 in
   myenteric neurons after exposure to the cytokine. These results
   demonstrate the involvement of COX-2 and the subsequent production of
   thromboxane A(2) in the presence of TNF-alpha.}},

Abstract = {{Alcohol expectancies are theorized to operate through associative memory
   networks. These networks are thought to differ on the basis of
   individual experience (direct and vicarious) with alcohol.
   Free-associate probabilities have been used in cognitive psychology as a
   metric of the associative strength of words to other words; this method
   has been used to establish the relationships within a semantic memory
   network. Participants from a large college sample were asked to free
   associate to the phrase ``Alcohol makes me \_.{''} They were also asked
   about their quantity of alcohol consumption. Results showed that
   specific responses were given with different probabilities by
   individuals who drank at different levels. The heaviest drinkers tended
   to have more positive and arousing responses than did lighter drinkers,
   who tended to have more negative and sedating responses. These results
   underscore the need to take into account relevant individual differences
   in behavior and experience when characterizing semantic networks.}},

   remains a clinical challenge. We analyzed the Stanford experience with
   use of the Thoratec ventricular assist device (VAD) in children and
   adolescents and data from the company's voluntary database. Through
   January 2005, 209 patients up to 18 years of age have been supported
   with the Thoratec VAD worldwide. Mean age was 14.5 years (range 5-18
   years), mean weight was 57 kg (range 17-118 kg), and mean body surface
   area was 1.6 m(2) (range 0.7-2.3 m(2)). The majority of patients were
   supported for cardiomyopathies (55\%) and acute myocarditis (25\%). A
   minority (6\%) was treated for end-stage congenital heart disease.
   Average duration of support was 44 days (0-434 days). Overall survival
   to transplantation or weaning off the device was 68\%. Survival rates
   were higher for patients with cardiomyopathies (74\%) and acute
   myocarditis (86\%) compared with patients with congenital heart disease
   (27\%). We performed a subanalysis in small children with a body surface

Abstract = {{We analyze the shapes of roughness distributions of discrete models in
   the Kardar, Parisi, and Zhang (KPZ) and in the Villain, Lai, and Das

   Three KPZ models in d=2 confirm the expected scaling of the distribution
   and show a stretched exponential tail approximately as exp(-x(0.8)),
   with a significant asymmetry near the maximum. Conserved restricted
   solid-on-solid models belonging to the VLDS class were simulated in d=1
   and d=2. The tail in d=1 has the form exp(-x(2)) and, in d=2, has a
   simple exponential decay, but is quantitatively different from the
   distribution of the linear fourth-order (Mullins-Herring) theory. It is
   not possible to fit any of the above distributions to those of
   1/f(alpha) noise interfaces, in contrast with recently studied models
   with depinning transitions.}},

Abstract = {{Bradykinin is a potent inflammatory mediator that induces vasodilation,
   vascular leakage, and pain sensations. This short-lived peptide hormone
   is liberated from its large precursor protein high molecular weight
   kininogen (HK) through the contact system cascade involving coagulation
   factor XII and plasma kallikrein. Although bradykinin release is well
   established in vitro, the factors and mechanisms controlling bradykinin
   generation in vivo are still incompletely understood. In this study we
   demonstrate that binding of HK to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) of the
   heparan and chondroitin sulfate type efficiently interferes with
   bradykinin release in plasma and on endothelial surfaces. Proteolytic
   bradykinin production on endothelial cells is restored following
   degradation of cell surface GAG through heparinase. Alternatively,
   application of HK fragments D3 or light chain, which compete with
   uncleaved HK for, cell binding, promote kininogen proteolysis and
   bradykinin release. Intravital microscopy revealed that HK fragments
   increase bradykinin-mediated mesentery microvascular leakage. Topical
   application of D3 or light chain enhanced bradykinin generation and
   edema formation in the mouse skin. Our results demonstrate that
   bradykinin formation is controlled by HK binding to and detachment from
   GAGs. Separation of the precursor from cell surfaces is a prerequisite
   for its efficient proteolytic processing. By this means, fragments
   arising from HK processing propagate bradykinin generation, revealing a
   novel regulatory level for the kallikrein-kinin system.}},

Abstract = {{Background The military presents a unique opportunity to study the
   incidence of disease in a population with complete knowledge of
   person-time and occupation. Women in the Army are employed more
   frequently in non-traditional, industrial jobs such as auto mechanic and
   motor transport operators than in the general US population, increasing
   the probability of exposure to industrial chemicals. A cohort to
   investigate the risk of breast cancer among active duty Army women
   occupationally exposed to volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) was
   constructed.
   Methods Age-adjusted incidence rates for breast cancer were
   calculatedfor more than 270,000 enlisted women who served between
   1980-1996. Twenty-one VOCs, described in previously published literature
   as having a potential risk of breast cancer, were identified in an Army
   industrial hygiene survey database. Job title histories were linked to
   workplace chemical evaluations conducted by Army industrial hygienists,
   which included a subjective exposure potential rating (high, medium,
   low, and none)for each VOC Poisson regression analysis was used to
   evaluate the association between the exposure rating by job title and
   breast cancer.
   Results The incidence of breast cancer in the cohort was significantly
   elevated in women younger than 35 years of age, especially among black
   women, when compared to the age-specific rates in the general
   population. Women who worked in occupations with a moderate to high
   exposure potential to at least one VOC had a 48\% increased risk (P <
   0.05) of breast cancer while on active duty between 1980-1996 when
   compared to those women with low to no exposure potential.
   Conclusions This study provides preliminary evidence that exposure to
   one or more Of the study VOCs is associated with an increased risk of
   breast cancer Further substance-specific, quantitative analyses are
   warranted.}},

   observations at 90 GHz and 230 GHz have been obtained from the
   Swedish-ESO Submillimeter Telescope (SEST) and the IRAM-PdB
   interferometer over more than a month following the burst. We use these
   data to constrain the double jet model proposed by Berger et al. ( 2003)
   for this afterglow. We also examine whether instead of the two jets
   being simultaneously present, the wider jet could result from the
   initially narrow jet, due to a fresh supply of energy from the central
   engine after the ``jet break{''}.}},

Title = {{Simplifying thrombolysis decisions in patients with left bundle branch
   block}},
Journal = {{EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{617-620}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: To redesign and simplify an existing decision algorithm for
   the management of patients who present to the emergency department with
   chest pain and left bundle branch block ( LBBB) based on the Sgarbossa
   criteria. To compare its reliability with the current algorithm.
   Methods: A simplified algorithm was created and tested against the
   existing algorithm. Electrocardiograms ( ECGs) of patients with LBBB
   were presented to 10 emergency department doctors with both old and new
   algorithms a week apart. Six ECGs displayed the relevant criteria for
   thrombolysis and had proven acute myocardial infarction ( AMI) based on
   a gold standard of enzyme measurements. Subjects were asked whether or
   not they would thrombolyse a patient presenting with the given ECG using
   each of the algorithms as a guide.
   Results: The new algorithm has demonstrated improvements in terms of an
   increase in appropriate thrombolysis and a reduction in inappropriate
   thrombolysis. Specificity for AMI rose from 0.85 to 0.99 and sensitivity
   from 0.38 to 0.6. kappa score showed greater agreement with the gold
   standard.
   Conclusion: Patients with AMI and LBBB have a significantly poorer
   outcome than those without LBBB. Despite this, thrombolysis is less
   likely to be given to patients with AMI and LBBB. This study
   demonstrates that in part this is because of cognitive difficulties
   using the current algorithm. The proposed proforma addresses these
   issues and provides a simple tool to aid appropriate treatment in this
   group of patients.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Today, it is generally accepted that unconscious stimuli can activate a
   response code, which leads to a response congruency effect (RCE) on a
   subsequent target. However, it is not yet clear whether this is due to
   the semantic processing of the primes or to the formation of direct
   stimulus-response (S-R) associations bypassing the semantic system.
   Recently, it was shown that even novel primes, for which no direct S-R
   links exist, can also evoke an RCE that is in line with the activation
   of response codes through semantics. In these experiments, the authors
   examined 3 alternatives for this RCE from novel primes and report a
   novel effect in unconscious priming. First, the authors show that this
   effect is not limited to a small set of numerical stimuli but also
   extends to letter stimuli (Experiments 1-3). Second, the authors show
   that the RCE is not a side effect of the prime-target distance effect,
   as has been reported before (Experiments 1-2). Third, the authors found
   that, for RCE to occur, overlap at the motor level but not at the
   semantic level was crucial (Experiments 2-3). Finally, in addition, the
   results showed a category match priming effect independent of RCE. This
   last result is evidence that novel unconscious primes activate their
   semantic category prior to the target and might be considered a good
   marker for semantic processing.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Little is known about the radiation sensitivity of bile duct
   carcinomas. The current study was undertaken to prospectively assess the
   objective response rates in bile duct carcinomas treated with
   radiotherapy and razoxane. Materials and Methods: Twenty-three patients
   with advanced cancer of the biliary tree were irradiated together with
   the radiosensitizer razoxane at a dose of 125 mg twice daily by mouth.
   There were 16 females and 7 males, median age 68 years. They received a
   total tumor dose of 48 Gy (range 1.7-60) at the ICRU point with single
   fractions of 1. 7 to 2 Gy. Results: Among the 23 patients, 14 had
   measurable disease. Objective tumor responses were seen in 4/4
   gallbladder carcinomas (1 CR, 3 PR), 4/5 extrahepatic
   cholangiocarcinomas (2 CR, 2 PR), and 1/5 hepatobiliary cancers (1 PR),
   leading to an overall response rate of 64\%. The tumors remained locally
   controlled in 12 out of 16 assessable patients (75\%). On an
   intention-to-treat basis, all patients with different biliary cancer
   without distant metastases had a median-survival time of 10 months
   (range 1 to 48) from the start of the radiotherapy; the 1-year survival
   was 43\%. No patient survived beyond 4 years. Tolerance to the treatment
   was fairly good. Nausea and vomiting of grade 1 and 2 (WHO) was noted in
   61\%, and reversible leukopenia of grade 3 and 4 in 9\% of the cases.
   The rate of inherent complications was high. Conclusion: Combined
   radiotherapy and razoxane led to local response rates which are superior
   to data from the literature when radiotherapy alone is used. Obstacles
   to the treatment were complications of the disease and frequent
   metastasis.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The present article compares Brazilian and American norms for
   the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), a set of normative
   emotional photographic slides for experimental investigations. Methods:
   Subjects were 1,062 Brazilian university students (364 men and 698
   women) who rated 707 pictures from the IAPS in terms of pleasure,
   arousal, and dominance following the methodology of the original
   normative study in the US, enabling direct comparison of data from the
   two samples through Pearson product moment correlation and Student t
   test. Results: All correlations were highly significant with the highest
   level for the pleasure dimension, followed by dominance and arousal.
   However, contrary to the American normative values, our data showed that
   Brazilian subjects generally assigned higher arousal ratings overall.
   Conclusion: Our findings confirm that this set of stimuli can be used in
   Brazil as an affective rating tool due to the high correlations found
   across the two populations, despite differences on the arousal
   dimension, which are discussed in detail.}},

Abstract = {{Family studies have shown that maternal depression is a risk factor for

   simultaneously accounting for genetic relatedness in a UK. community
   sample of twins aged 8 to 17 years and their mothers. A model that
   constrained the genetic and environmental parameters to be equal within
   the two generations and included genetic and environmental paths between
   mother and offspring (twins) was tested with data from 1468 families.
   Significant environmental paths were found when maternal ratings were
   used. When cross-informant data were used (maternal depression and child
   self-reports of depression), the environmental path was no longer
   significant. However, for cross-informant data where children were
   classified as having high depression scores or scores within the normal

Abstract = {{In this paper, we focus our interest on the image-matching problem. This
   major problem in Image Processing has received a considerable attention
   in the last decade. However, contrarily to other image-processing
   problems such as image restoration, the image-matching problem have been
   mainly tackled using a single approach based on variational principles.
   In this paper, our motivation is to investigate the feasibility of
   another famous image-processing approach based on Markov random fields
   (MRF). For that, we propose a discrete and stochastic image-matching
   framework which is equivalent to an usual variational one and suitable
   for an MRF-based approach. In this framework, we describe multigrid
   implementations of two algorithms: an iterated conditional modes (ICM)
   and a simulated annealing. We apply these algorithms for the
   registration of mammograms and compare their performances to those of an
   usual variational algorithm. We come to the conclusion that MRF-based
   techniques are optimization techniques which are relevant for the
   mammogram application. We also point out some of their specific
   properties and mention interesting perspectives offered by the markovian
   approach. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine the nature and extent of
   androgen influence on gene expression in the lacrimal gland. Lacrimal
   glands were obtained from orchiectomized mice that had been treated with
   testosterone or vehicle for 2 weeks, as well as from testicular
   feminized mice and their Tabby controls. Samples were pooled according
   to experiment, processed for the isolation of RNA, and analyzed for
   differentially expressed mRNAs by using primarily CodeLink Bioarrays,
   GEM 1 and 2 gene chips and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) procedures.
   Gene chip data were analyzed with GeneSifter.Net software. Our results
   demonstrate that testosterone regulates the expression of over 2000
   genes in the lacrimal gland. Gene ontologies most affected by androgen
   treatment included those related to cell growth, proliferation and
   metabolism, cell communication and transport, nucleic acid binding,
   signal transduction and receptor activities. Our findings also indicate
   that androgen action may be mediated, at least in part, through
   classical androgen receptors, and may contribute to the sex-related
   differences in gene expression of lacrimal tissue. Overall, these
   results support our working hypothesis that androgen action on the
   lacrimal gland is mediated primarily through a receptor-associated
   regulation of gene transcription. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We present a growth study of the alkali halides NaCl and KCl on the

   arrangement between the ionic adlayer and the stepped metal substrate is
   characterized by an alignment of the polar in-plane Cl ion rows parallel
   and perpendicular to the intrinsic Cu steps. For low coverages (similar
   to 1 ML) the Cl ions are in registry with the intrinsic substrate steps
   causing uniaxial strain in the direction perpendicular to the steps. In
   contrast, parallel to the steps the Cl ions are free to adjust their
   optimum Cl-Cl spacing. For coverages >3 ML, the strain perpendicular to
   the intrinsic Cu steps is accommodated which suggests the incorporation
   of monoatomic Cu defect steps at the interface in this regime of higher

Abstract = {{In addition to improving drug solubilization, cyclodextrins (CDs) also
   affect the biological behavior of the included compound. We evaluated
   the effects of two natural CDs beta-CD and gamma-CD, and six beta-CD
   derivatives, Dimeb, Trimeb, SBb, 2-HP, 6AD, and 6 MTU on the biological
   behavior of (TcN)-Tc-99m-NOET, a technetium-99m-labeled, lipophilic
   compound readily detectable through radioactivity assessment.
   Determination of CDs' affinities for (TcN)-Tc-99m-NOET indicated that
   the cavity size of gamma-CD was not suitable for (TcN)-Tc-99m-NOET
   inclusion, and that beta-CD derivatization mostly resulted in decreased
   CDs affinities for (TcN)-Tc-99m-NOET to various extents compared with
   the natural beta-CD. In vitro and ex vivo experiments performed on
   newborn rat cardiomyocytes and isolated perfused rat hearts,
   respectively, showed 1.7- and 2.3-fold maximal differences in
   (TcN)-Tc-99m-NOET cellular and tissue activities. Regression analyzes
   indicated no significant correlation between these observed biological
   differences and the affinities of the eight CDs tested for
   (TcN)-Tc-99m-NOET or for cellular membranes. In conclusion, CD
   derivatization often resulted in impaired affinity of the derivatives
   for the lipophilic compound (TcN)-Tc-99m-NOET. Moreover, the in vitro
   and ex vivo biological behavior of (TcN)-Tc-99m-NOET was greatly
   affected depending on the CD used for inclusion of the tracer. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{The kinetics of 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions of benzonitrile oxide with a
   series of N-substituted maleimides and with cyclopentene are reported
   for water, a wide range of organic solvents and binary solvent mixtures.
   The results indicate the importance of both solvent polarity and
   specific hydrogen-bond interactions in governing the rates of the
   reactions. The aforementioned reactions are examples for which these
   factors often counteract, leading to a complex dependence of rate
   constants on the nature of the solvent. For the reactions of
   N-ethylmaleimide and N-n-butylmaleimide with benzonitrile oxide,
   isobaric activation parameters have been determined in several organic
   solvents, water, and water-1-propanol mixtures. Interestingly, the
   activation parameter; reveal significant differences in solvation in
   different solvents that are not clearly reflected in the rate constants.
   In highly aqueous mixtures, enforced hydrophobic interactions lead to an
   increase in rate constant, relative to organic solvents. However, the
   overall rate enhancement in water is modest, if present at all, because
   the solvent polarity diminishes the rate constant. This pattern
   contrasts with common Diels-Alder reactions, where polarity,
   hydrogenbond donor capacity and enforced hydrophobic interactions work
   together, which can result in impressive rate accelerations in water.

Abstract = {{The aerobiological behaviour of Fagaceae in Trieste and the correlations
   with the meteorological parameters were examined. Airborne pollen grains
   of Castanea, Fagus and Quercus were collected from 1990 to 2003 using a
   Hirst type spore trap. The main pollen season (MPS) takes place in April
   and May for Quercus and Fagus, in June and July for Castanea. The
   highest values occur in year 1993 for Quercus, in 1998 for Castanea and
   in 1992 for Fagus. The Fagaceae content of the air is mainly due to
   Quercus and Castanea pollen, Fagus usually having a scarce pollen
   shedding in Trieste. The highest counts of Fagaceae pollen grains are
   found from late April to mid May and are mainly due to the pollen
   shedding of oaks. The cumulative counts vary over the years, with a mean
   value of 2.719 pollen grains, a lowest total of 1.341 in 2002 and a
   highest total of 4.704 in 1993. No positive nor negative long-term
   trends in pollen shedding are found. No cyclic variations were observed.
   Spearman's correlation was used to establish the relationship between
   the daily pollen counts and the daily meteorological data. Daily pollen
   concentrations present sometimes positive correlation with temperature,
   negative with rainfall and wind speed, and no correlation with humidity.
   Fagus and Quercus start dates result positively correlated between
   themselves. Significant correlations are found between the start of MPS
   and the mean and maximum temperature in March for Fagus and Quercus, and
   May for Castanea.}},

Abstract = {{This essay examines court cases involving insult to a public official,
   which came before the local courts in Rome in the second half of the

   analysis correlates two aspects of these cases: the first is the context
   of the offenses, characterized by the application of a detailed set of
   local police regulations, and experienced as a limitation of masculine
   personal liberty. The second aspect relates to the institutional
   organization of the police forces and the masculine identity of the
   officers themselves. The combination of these two elements during
   interactions between population and the police forces meant that the
   subjects' gender became more significant than other variables (such as
   social class), to the extent that these interactions took on the
   inflections of a performative `face-off'. In this way the variable of
   gender brings into question the traditional reading of public order in
   the Liberal era as the product of a policy of containment of the popular

Abstract = {{Glycosaminoglycans (GAG) as hyaluronan and proteoglycans (PG) as
   dermatan sulfate (DSPG) and keratan sulfate (KSPG) play important role
   in the structure and physiological functions of cornea. Several corneal
   pathologies are associated with qualitative and quantitative alterations
   of GAG and/or PG biosynthesis. For these reasons we investigated the
   effect of procyanidolic oligomers (PCO) on the biosynthesis and
   excretion of GAG-s in bovine corneal explant cultures. This was
   accomplished by the determination of their chemical components, hexoses,
   hexosamines and uronic acids as well as the incorporation Of
   S-35-sulfate in the presence and without PCO in the culture medium. In
   presence of 1 mg/ml PCO total hexoses, hexosamines and uronic acids
   increased at 5 and 24 h of incubation, hexoses less than the two other
   components. Stimulation of biosynthesis concerned essentially the uronic
   acid containing GAG-s, DS and hyaluronan. S-35-sulfate incorporation
   decreased in presence of PCO, showing a decreased sulfation of GAG-s.
   The most striking effect was however the strongly increased excretion of
   neosynthesized GAG-s in the culture medium. This effect could be
   beneficial in decreasing corneal hydration in inflammatory conditions,
   together with the previously demonstrated protection of corneal
   macromolecules against proteolytic degradation. (C) 2005 Elsevier SAS.

Abstract = {{Background There are no studies that have compared outcomes for staff in
   different types of supported accommodation for people with intellectual
   disabilities and challenging behaviour. This study looked at stress,
   morale and intended job turnover in staff in two types of
   community-based residential supports: non-congregate settings where the
   minority of residents have challenging behaviour; and congregate
   settings where the majority of residents have challenging behaviour.
   Materials and methods A self-completion survey questionnaire was used to
   collect information on the basic characteristics of staff, levels of
   staff stress, job satisfaction and propensity to leave their employment.
   Results One hundred and fifty-seven questionnaires were returned from
   staff, the majority of whom were on fixed-term contracts. Congregate
   settings were not associated with higher levels of stress as might be
   assumed. Overall, over a quarter of staff reached criterion on the
   General Health Questionnaire-12 for experiencing emotional distress, and
   over a third were likely to actively seek new employment in the next
   year. The greatest perceived sources of stress were lack of resources
   and lack of staff support. The lowest level of satisfaction was with the
   rate of pay. Those in non-congregate settings reported greater perceived
   stress because of lack of procedures to deal with challenging behaviour.
   Conclusions High levels of intended staff turnover may be more due to
   job insecurity and lack of support than service user challenging
   behaviour. Employers seeking to reduce turnover should pay attention to
   basic pay and conditions, as well as staff training in appropriate
   methods for dealing with challenging behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Modem MEG technology provides whole head helmet systems which extend
   posterior to the base of the skull. While this provides better
   visualization of low temporal structures it also allows the intrusion of
   activity that is of cardiac origin. This consists not only of the QRS
   complex of the MCG but a late component (LC) during the SP interval.
   This tends to consist of a series of waves and has a different
   topographic distribution from the magnetic QRS complex. The LC is
   usually most prominent in the low occipital and sub-occipital sensors
   but can occur also in other areas. When the highpass filter is set to
   0.1 Hz it can be seen that the LC rides on a slow wave of about 0.3 Hz,
   which is linked to respiration. Principal component analysis of cardiac
   cycles averaged from the ECG separates the MCG from the LC. The
   physiology of the LC is unknown at this time but it maybe related to the
   ballistocardiogram. Algorhythms designed to remove the cardiac
   contributions to the MEG will have to take the LC and its marked
   variability into account.}},

Abstract = {{Knowing the distribution of the number of handovers during a call

   virtual circuits for wireless cells. In this paper, we study the

   time (CHT) and cell residence time (CRT) distributions. We assume that
   the first CRT in the originating cell has different statistics from the
   CRTs in the subsequent cells. In particular, we consider circular cells.
   Based on the formulation in terms of delayed renewal processes, we
   obtain analytical expressions for the probability mass functions and

Abstract = {{Which domains in life produce the greatest potential for regret, and
   what features of those life domains explain why? Using archival and
   laboratory evidence, the authors show that greater perceived opportunity
   within life domains evokes more intense regret. This pattern is
   consistent with previous publications demonstrating greater regret
   stemming from high, rather than low opportunity or choice. A
   meta-analysis of 11 regret ranking studies revealed that the top six
   biggest regrets in life center on (in descending order) education,
   career, romance, parenting, the self, and leisure. Study Set 2 provided
   new laboratory evidence that directly linked the regret ranking to
   perceived opportunity. Study Set 3 ruled out an alternative
   interpretation involving framing effects. Overall, these findings show
   that people's biggest regrets are a reflection of where in life they see
   their largest opportunities; that is, where they see tangible prospects
   for change, growth, and renewal.}},

Title = {{TCP performance enhancement by implicit priority forwarding (IPF) packet
   buffering scheme for mobile IP based networks}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{367-376}},

Abstract = {{The smooth handoff supported by the route optimization extension to the
   mobile IP standard protocol should support a packet buffering mechanism
   at the base station (BS), in order to reduce the degradation in TCP
   performance caused by packet losses within mobile network environments.
   The purpose of packet buffering at the BS is to recover the packets
   dropped during inter-subnetwork handoff by forwarding the packets
   buffered at the previous BS to the new BS. However, when the mobile host
   moves to a congested BS within a new foreign subnetwork, the buffered
   packets forwarded by the previous BS are likely to be dropped. This
   subsequently causes global synchronization to occur, resulting in the
   degradation of the wireless link in the congested BS, due to the
   increased congestion caused by the forwarded burst packets. Thus, in
   this paper, we propose an implicit priority forwarding (IPF) packet
   buffering scheme as a solution to this problem within mobile IP based
   networks. In the proposed IPF method, the previous BS implicitly marks
   the priority packets being used for inter-subnetwork handoff. Moreover,
   the proposed modified random early detection (M-RED) buffer at the new
   congested BS guarantees some degree of reliability to the priority
   packets. The simulation results show that the proposed IPF packet
   buffering scheme increases the wireless link utilization and, thus, it
   enhances the TCP throughput performance in the context of various
   inter-subnetwork handoff cases.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We describe an approach for characterizing the process performed by a
   quantum gate using quantum process tomography, by first modeling the
   gate in an extended Hilbert space, which includes nonqubit degrees of
   freedom. To prevent unphysical processes from being predicted, present
   quantum process tomography procedures incorporate mathematical
   constraints, which make no assumptions as to the actual physical nature
   of the system being described. By contrast, the procedure presented here
   assumes a particular class of physical processes, and enforces
   physicality by fitting the data to this model. This allows quantum
   process tomography to be performed using a smaller experimental data
   set, and produces parameters with a direct physical interpretation. The
   approach is demonstrated by example of mode matching in an all-optical
   controlled-NOT gate. The techniques described are general and could be
   applied to other optical circuits or quantum computing architectures.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of the thermal and electric states of high-T-c composite
   superconductors is theoretically investigated as a function of a sweep
   rate of fully penetrated current. The electric field and temperature
   induced by current charging were simulated using the temperature
   dependences of the composite heat capacity and matrix resistivity. It is
   proved that the stable high-field part of the voltage-current
   characteristics of high-T-c composite superconductors might depend on
   the sweep rate even at relatively slow sweeps. As a result, the critical
   currents determined in accordance with the fixed voltage criterion may
   increase with increasing sweep rate. However, the fully penetrated
   current stability boundary defining the limiting current that stably
   flows in a superconductor without irreversible superconducting-to-normal
   transition, is not affected by the sweep rate. These regularities depend
   on the corresponding composite temperature rise preceding instability
   onset. The analysis reveals also the connection between different
   criteria used to determine the current stability conditions for both
   low-T-c and high-T-c superconducting composites. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{We have studied the properties of simple models of linear and
   star-branched polymer chains confined in a slit formed by two parallel
   impenetrable walls. The polymer chains consisted of identical united
   atoms (homopolymers) and were restricted to a simple cubic lattice. Two
   macromolecular architectures of the chain: linear and regular stars with
   three branches of equal length, were studied. The excluded volume was
   the only potential introduced into the model and thus the system was
   athermal. Monte-Carlo simulations with the sampling algorithm based on
   the chain's local changes of conformation were carried out for chains
   with different lengths as well as for different distances between the
   confining surfaces. We found that the properties of model chains differ
   for both macromolecular architectures but a universal behavior for both
   kinds of chains was also found. Investigation of the frequency of
   chain-wall contacts shows that the ends of the chains are much more
   mobile than the rest of the chain, especially in the vicinity of the
   branching point in star polymers.}},

Abstract = {{The authors investigated the emergence of independent control of body
   segments in bimanual tasks involving either voluntary or involuntary
   trunk motion by tracking the transition from an ego- to an exocentric
   mode of postural control during childhood (i.e., from body-referenced
   orientation to externally referenced action). A paradigm combining a
   seated manual task and various trunk manipulations described the
   coordination strategies used by 24 children at different ages (2 to 9
   years) and by adults. The following questions were asked: (a) When do
   children begin to dissociate upper limb movements from those of the
   trunk? (b) What segmental strategies are exhibited by each age group
   (2-3, 4-6, and 7-9 years, and adults)? Kinematic analyses revealed that
   younger children (2-6 years) used either the trunk or the support
   surface as reference to orient the limbs. Older children (7-9 years)
   began to use a gravitational reference frame similar to that of adults;
   they uncoupled upper limb motion from the trunk in either voluntary or
   imposed conditions. Young children patterned the forearm trajectory
   after the initiating segment (support surface or the trunk), thus
   reducing the degrees of freedom during the dual task. Echoing previous
   reports, 7-9 years of age appears to be a critical period in which
   children master postural control and develop an internal representation
   of body scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Perceptual load of an attended task influences the processing of
   irrelevant background stimuli. In a series of behavioral, functional
   magnetic resonance (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) experiments
   we examined the influence of working memory (WM) load related to a
   relevant visual stimulus on the processing of irrelevant backgrounds. We
   further addressed two open questions about the mechanism of
   load-dependent modulation: (i) is this modulation dependent on regional
   activity (i.e. phasic)? (ii) At what processing stage does this
   modulation take place? Load was manipulated by a WM task and
   concurrently the processing of irrelevant visual objects was assessed
   with fMRI and EEG. To examine the dependency of this modulation on
   intrinsic activity, we varied the activity level of visual areas by
   presenting objects with different levels of degradation. Activity in the
   lateral occipital complex (LOC) increased with object visibility and was
   phasically modulated by WM load. Event related potentials revealed that
   this phasic modulation occurred similar to 170 ms after stimulus onset,
   indicative of an early selection under high load. The results indicate a
   phasic modulatory effect of WM load on visual object processing in the
   LOC that is comparable to the effects found for perceptual load
   manipulations.}},

Abstract = {{Transplantation protocols for patients with Fanconi anemia are being
   modified continuously. However, it is unclear how outcomes have changed
   over time. We determined historical adverse event rates from long-term
   follow-up of 117 Fanconi anemia patients in the Hopital Saint Louis
   transplant cohort, who received low-dose cyclophosphamide- and
   irradiation-based conditioning, in combination with other modalities,
   between 1976 and October 2002. In high-risk patients with mismatched
   donors, the peritransplantation mortality rate during 0 to 6 months
   declined significantly over time (P =.003), from 28\%/month (95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI], 9\%-87\%/month) during 1985 to 1989 to
   3.3\%/month (95\% CI, 0.8\%-13.3\%/month) during 2000 to October 2002.
   The corresponding proportion of patients who developed severe acute
   graft-versus-host disease also declined significantly over time (P
   =.003). In low-risk patients with matched sibling donors, the
   peritransplantation mortality rate was consistently low, 1.4\%/month
   (95\% CI, 0.3 \%-5.3\%/month), during 1990 to October 2002. Sample sizes
   to detect 2-fold reductions from rates and risks observed since the
   mid-1990s are larger than recently reported case series. To demonstrate
   further advances in survival, transplant centers may need to coordinate
   their protocols and engage in multicenter collaborative studies. (c)

Abstract = {{This review describes recent published observational studies that assess
   the associations between early nutritional status or early asymptomatic
   diagnosis and outcomes among patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) in the
   United States. Three national registry-based studies demonstrated an
   association between nutritional status early in life (1-8 years of age)
   and subsequent lung function and mortality. These studies lend weight to
   the hypothesis that improved nutrition in early childhood, which has
   been associated with diagnosis by means of newborn screening, could lead
   to improved lung function and survival. Another study examined the
   association of early asymptomatic diagnosis and outcomes among patients
   in the US CF Registry and found that, among patients born after 1987,
   early asymptomatic diagnosis appeared to result in improved lung
   function as long as 10 years of age. This association was limited to
   children born after 1987, which suggests that recent improvements in
   early treatment strategies allowed early diagnosis to lead to more
   aggressive therapies, resulting in important improvements in pulmonary
   health. Taken together, these observational studies provide indirect
   evidence that diagnosis by means of newborn screening may improve the
   pulmonary health and survival of patients with CF.}},

Abstract = {{What makes for a good explanation of a person's actions? Their reasons,
   or so a natural reply goes. But how do reasons function as part of
   explanations, that is, within an account of the causes of action? Here
   philosophers divide concerning the logical relation in which reasons
   stand to actions. For, tradition holds, reasons evaluatively
   characterized must be causally inert, inasmuch as the normative features
   cannot be found in any account of the empirical/descriptive. To
   countenance reasons as causes thus seems to imply some degree of
   normative involvement in causal explanation. Mark Risjord opts for full
   normative involvement while David Henderson insistently denies a role to
   norms in explanation. Stueber occupies an intermediate position here. I
   question just whether there exists some ``special{''} problem regarding
   norms, at least in the form which, I take it, all three of the authors I
   discuss assume there to be one.}},

   DSC. In addition to fusion, a number of solid-solid phase transitions
   have also been detected in these diacids. The vaporization enthalpies of
   these compounds have been measured by correlation gas chromatography
   using the vaporization enthalpies of butanedioic, hexanedioic and
   decanedioic acids as standards. The vaporization enthalpies of the
   diacids from C-4 to C-10 correlated linearly with the number of
   methylene groups present. Above C-10, the vaporization enthalpies of
   C-11-C-14 and C-16 begin to deviate from linearity. The vaporization
   enthalpies for these compounds are dependent on the temperature of the
   GC column used. Similar departure from linearity has also been observed
   previously in the sublimation enthalpies for these compounds. The
   results are discussed in terms of formation of a cyclic intramolecular

   actuator based on a proportional integral differential (PID) feedback
   controller with a feedforward compensation. The hysteresis phenomenon of
   a piezoelectric actuator is described in the feedforward loop by using a
   new mathematical model. Finally, some tracking control experiments for a
   desired sinusoidal trajectory are performed according to the proposed
   control method. The experimental results demonstrate that the
   positioning precision is noticeably improved by adding the feedforward
   compensation based on the new hysteresis model. The maximum error in
   tracking the sinusoidal signal is lowered about one order of magnitude

Abstract = {{The dissipation rate transport equation is analyzed in the setting of

   predict self- similar unit flows such as decaying turbulence and
   homogeneous shear flow. The limitations of this approach are shown by
   constructing classes of self- similar states of forced isotropic
   turbulence. Any choice of constants in the epsilon equation yields a
   model that is consistent with some self- similar states, but not with
   all possible states: two- equation models of the standard form select a

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To retrospectively compare the results of immobilization of the
   forearm in supination with the results of tension band fixation of the
   ulnar styloid in 35 patients with distal radius fractures, fracture of
   the base of the ulnar styloid, and distal radioulnar joint instability
   treated with external fixation.
   Methods: Thirty-five patients with fractures of the distal radius,
   fracture of the base of the ulnar styloid, and unstable distal
   radioulnar joint had external fixation with adjunctive percutaneous pins
   and allograft bone to reduce and stabilize the distal radius fracture
   anatomically. Only those patients with an associated ulnar styloid base
   fracture displaced over 2 mm with gross distal radioulnar joint
   instability relative to the contralateral wrist were included in this
   study. Group I consisted of patients in whom the ulnar styloid base
   fracture was treated with conventional tension band wiring techniques.
   Group 2 patients were treated with a supplemental outrigger from the
   external fixator to the ulna and locked in 60 degrees of forearm
   supination. Groups I and 2 had an average follow-up period of 40 and 36
   months, respectively.
   Results: Group 2 had significantly better supination than group 1. In
   terms of functional outcome it was found that there was no significant
   difference for the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand and the
   Gartland and Werley scores between the 2 treatment groups. There was a
   lower rate of complications and fewer secondary procedures were required
   in group 2. The incidence of distal ulna resection was 4 of the 35
   patients (2 patients in each group).
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that patients in whom the ulnar
   styloid can be reduced and maintained in supination can be treated
   effectively with fixed supination outrigger external fixation. This
   method resulted in a statistically significant improvement in supination
   and a lower rate of distal radioulnar joint complications, and it
   required fewer secondary procedures.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine whether serum matrix
   metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) could predict cause-specific and
   relapse-free survival in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of head
   and neck. Furthermore, this study was designed to investigate whether
   there is an association between MMP-9 immunohistochemical staining and
   serum MMP-9 levels. Pretreatment serum levels of MMP-9 were
   quantitatively measured by ELISA assay in 67 patients presenting with a
   primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The results were compared
   with the corresponding immunohistochemical staining results, clinical
   data and the patients' outcome. The follow-up time for all of the
   patients was at least 5 years. There was a statistically significant
   correlation between circulating MMP-9 and MMP-9 immunohistochemical
   staining in the corresponding tumors (p = 0.028). The cause-specific and
   relapse-free survival rates were clearly lower among patients with high
   MMP-9 serum levels (> 73 ng/ml). The 5-year cause-specific survival-rate
   was 40\% in a patient group with high serum MMP-9, and 69\% for patients
   with a low MMP-9 level (p = 0.027). In the same follow-up period, the
   cumulative relapse-free survival rate was 36\% in patients presenting
   with a high serum MMP-9 and 66\% in those with a low MMP-9 level. No
   correlation was found between MMP-9 serum levels and the traditional
   clinical or histopathologic factors. The results suggest for the first
   time that pretreatment serum MMP-9 level could serve as a prognostic
   factor in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. (C) 2005 Wiley-Liss,

   nucleotides downstream of the position 3358 3' splice site. Deletion of
   the enhancer caused loss of both splicing at the upstream position 3358
   3' splice site and polyadenylation at the early polyadenylation signal,
   pAE. Direct splicing occurred at the competing L1 3' splice site at
   position 5639 in the late region. Optimization of the position 3358 3'
   splice site restored splicing to that site and polyadenylation at pAE.
   Additionally, a sequence of 40 nucleotides with a negative effect on
   late mRNA production was located immediately downstream of the enhancer.
   As the E4 3' splice site is employed by both early and late mRNAs, the
   enhancer constitutes a key regulator of temporal HPV-16 gene expression,
   which is required for early mRNA production as well as for the
   inhibition of premature late gene expression.}},

Title = {{Assessment of acute renal transplant rejection with blood oxygen
   level-dependent MR imaging: Initial experience}},
Journal = {{RADIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{236}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{911-919}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To prospectively assess the oxygenation state of renal
   transplants and determine the feasibility of using blood oxygen
   level-dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to differentiate
   between acute tubular necrosis (ATN), acute rejection, and normal
   function.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This HIPAA-compliant study had institutional
   human subjects review committee approval, and written informed consent
   was obtained from all patients. BOLD MR imaging was performed in 20
   patients (age range, 21-70 years) who had recently received renal
   transplants. Six patients had clinically normal functioning transplants,
   eight had biopsy-proved rejection, and six had biopsy-proved ATN. R2{*}
   (1/sec) measurements were obtained in the medulla and cortex of
   transplanted kidneys. R2{*} is a measure of the rate of signal loss in a
   specific region and is related to the amount of deoxyhemoglobin present.
   Statistical analysis was performed by using a two-sample t test.
   Threshold R2{*} values were identified to discriminate between
   transplanted kidneys with ATN, those with acute rejection, and those
   with normal function.
   RESULTS: R2{*} values for the medulla were significantly lower in the
   acute rejection group (R2{*} = 15.8/sec +/- 1.5) than in normally
   functioning transplants (R2{*} = 23.9/sec +/- 3.2) and transplants with
   ATN (R2{*} = 21.3/sec +/- 1.9). The differences between the acute
   rejection and normal function groups (P =.001), as well as between the
   acute rejection and ATN groups (P <.001), were significant. Acute
   rejection could be differentiated from normal function and ATN in all
   cases by using a threshold R2{*} value of 18/sec. R2{*} values for the
   cortex were higher in ATN (R2{*} = 14.2/sec +/- 1.4) than for normally
   functioning transplants (R2{*} = 12.7/sec 1.6) and transplants with
   rejection (R2{*} = 12.4/sec +/- 1.2). The difference in R2{*} values in
   the cortex between ATN and rejection was statistically significant (P
   =.034), although there was no threshold value that enabled
   differentiation of all cases of ATN from cases of normal function or
   acute rejection.
   CONCLUSION: R2{*} measurements in the medullary regions of transplanted
   kidneys with acute rejection were significantly lower than those in
   normally functioning transplants or transplants with ATN. These results
   suggest that marked changes in intrarenal oxygenation occur during acute
   transplant rejection. (c) RSNA 2005.}},

Abstract = {{Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) is currently considered the gold
   standard for genotyping of enterococci. However, PFGE is both expensive
   and time-consuming. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether
   the PhP system can be used as a reliable clinical screening method for
   detection of genetically related isolates of enterococci. If so, it
   should be possible to minimize the number of isolates subjected to PFGE
   typing, which would save time and money. Ninety-nine clinical
   enterococcal isolates were analysed by PhP (similarity levels
   0.90-0.975) and PFGE (similarity levels <= 3 and <= 6 bands) and all
   possible pairs of isolates were cross-classified as matched or
   mismatched. We found that the probability that a pair of isolates (A and
   B) belonging to the same type according to PhP also belong to the same
   cluster according to PFGE, i.e. p(A(PFGE) = B-PFGE vertical bar A(PhP) =
   B-PhP), and the probability that a pair of isolates of different types
   according to PhP also belong to different clusters according to PFGE,
   i.e. p(A(PFGE) not equal B-PFGE vertical bar A(PhP) not equal B-PhP),
   was relatively high for E faecalis (0.86 and 0.96, respectively), but
   was lower for E. faecium (0.51 and 0.77, respectively). The concordance
   which shows the probability that PhP and PFGE agree on match or mismatch
   was 86\%-93\% for E. faecalis and 54\%-66\% for E. faecium, which
   indicates that the PhP method may be useful for epidemiological typing
   of E faecalis in the current settings but not for E. faecium.}},

Journal = {{CLIMATE DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{415-426}},

Abstract = {{A global, flux-corrected climate model is employed to predict the
   surface wind stress and associated wind-driven oceanic circulation for
   climate states corresponding to a doubling and quadrupling of the
   atmospheric CO2 concentration in a simple 1\% per year CO2 increase
   scenario. The model indicates that in response to CO2 increase, the
   position of zero wind stress curl in the mid-latitudes of the Southern
   Hemisphere shifts poleward. In addition, the wind stress intensifies
   significantly in the mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere. As a
   result, the rate of water circulation in the subpolar meridional
   overturning cell in the Southern Ocean increases by about 6 Sv ( 1 Sv =
   10(6) m(3) s(-1)) for doubled CO2 and by 12 Sv for quadrupled CO2,
   implying an increase of deep water upwelling south of the circumpolar
   flow and an increase of Ekman pumping north of it. In addition, the
   changes in the wind stress and wind stress curl translate into changes
   in the horizontal mass transport, leading to a poleward expansion of the
   subtropical gyres in both hemispheres, and to strengthening of the
   Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Finally, the intensified near-surface
   winds over the Southern Ocean result in a substantial increase of
   mechanical energy supply to the ocean general circulation.}},

Abstract = {{With the opening up of trade-in goods and services, globalization taking
   place at a rapid pace and multilateral trade arrangements coming into
   force, intellectual property, rights (IPR) occupy an important place.
   Generation, protection and management of IPR are essential for pro
   notion of innovations in the country. Many patents are granted all over
   the world in the field of information technology. Patent filing in India
   in this area indicates that the share of Indians and Indian companies is
   on the lower side. One of the reasons for this trend is lack of
   awareness about IPR among scientists and technologists. This article
   aims at bringing,out essential and important features of IPR and how
   they need to be managed.}},

   triisopropylguanidine (TPG) and
   N,N'-diisopropyl-N{''}-2,6-dimethylphenylguanidine (DPArG) with HX or
   equivalents (X = Cl, Br) yielded the anticipated guanidinium halide
   salts. The structures of TPGH(+)X(-) (X = Cl, 1), TPGH(+)X(-.)H(2)O (X =
   Br, 3(.)H(2)O), and DPArGH(+)X(-) (X = Cl, 2; Br, 4) were determined by
   single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis to examine the potential
   intermolecular interactions in these compounds and their influence on
   the extended structures that were observed. The formation of strong,
   charge-assisted hydrogen bonds, NH+...X-, dominates the extended
   structures. In addition, weaker interactions between the N-substituents
   and between the X- anions and CH bonds of the substituents have an
   apparent role in the structures of these materials. While the TPGH(+)
   cation displayed a C-3 propeller-type orientation in the structures of 1
   and 3(.)H(2)O, two different isomeric forms for the less symmetric
   DPArGH(+) cations were observed, and the identity of the anion and of
   the substituents both appear to be important in determining which form
   is obtained. Although the DPArGH(+) cation exhibited different isomeric
   structures in 2 and 4, a common structural motif consisting of
   hydrogen-bonded chains was observed in their solid-state structures.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. Invasive fungal sinusitis is a rare but often fatal
   infection in immunocompromised patients. Aggressive antifungal treatment
   is mandatory, but is not without risk. Caspofungin, an antifungal agent
   that is a member of the echinocandin family, an inhibitor of glucan
   synthesis in the fungal wall, is active against Aspergillus and Candidae
   infections. Although it works on the fungal wall, it does not affect
   mammalian cells; hence, its toxicity is minimal.
   Case Summary. This report describes a case of invasive Aspergillus
   sinusitis in a kidney transplant recipient with diabetes mellitus. The
   infection involved the apex of the right orbit causing optic nerve
   compression. The patient was treated with transnasal endoscopic
   decompression of the optic nerve and intravenous AmBisome (liposomal
   amphotericin B) for 2 weeks without clinical improvement. The
   combination of caspofungin and AmBisome administered for another 2 weeks
   yielded partial improvement. The AmBisome had to be discontinued due to
   deterioration of renal and hepatic function, but the patient completed a
   further 7-week course of caspofungin alone. Retro-orbital biopsy
   confirmed a complete response to treatment; the patient's renal and
   hepatic function returned to normal.
   Conclusion. This case indicates that caspofungin is effective to treat
   invasive Aspergillus sinusitis in kidney transplant recipients. This
   agent is well tolerated and safe with respect to renal and hepatic
   function.}},

Abstract = {{The present study thoroughly examined the localization and

   the seminal vesicles of the miniature pig, employing light and electron
   microscopic histochemical procedures, including lectin methods. The
   present results showed the epithelial cells and luminal secretions to
   contain glycoconjugates with abundant neutral saccharides and a small
   amount of acidic saccharides, containing varying types of terminal sugar
   residues. At ultrastructural levels, the free surface coat of the plasma
   membrane was rich in a-D-Man, a-D-Glc, beta-D-Gal, GlcNAc, and sialic
   acid. The flocculent contents of the secretory vesicles indicated the
   localization of a-D-Man, a-D-Glc, a-L-Fuc, beta-D-Gal, GIcNAc, and
   sialic acid; such sugar residues were also seen in the elements of the
   Golgi apparatus. The present results have characterized the seminal
   vesicles of the miniature pig as having a high secretory activity and
   copiously producing glycoconjugates with various sugar residues. Such
   glycoconjugates appear to be indispensable substances for porcine
   reproduction, possibly influencing the fertilizing capacity of
   spermatozoa within the female genital tract.}},

Abstract = {{Markedly elevated levels of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP),
   which exhibit potent diuretic and vasoactive properties, has been well
   documented in patients with acute lung injury. We examined the
   physiological effects of additional smoke inhalation on plasma ANP
   concentrations in an ovine burn model. Seventeen sheep were instrumented
   to receive fluid and have physiological measurements taken. The burn
   group (it = 8) received 40\% body surface area third degree burn and the
   burn + smoke group (n = 9) received the same burn plus 48 breaths of
   cotton smoke insufflation. The animals were resuscitated according to
   the Parkland formula with Ringer's lactate in the following 72 h period.
   Hemodynamic, oxygenation, fluid balance, and plasma ANP levels were
   serially determined. The effects of smoke inhalation manifested as
   deteriorated oxygenation, and increased fluid accumulation after a
   sustained initial shock period of more than 12 h. Plasma ANP levels in
   the burn + smoke group showed a biphasic elevation, whereas the burn
   group showed no appreciable changes throughout the whole experimental
   period. The initial increase in plasma ANP concentrations occurred
   immediately after injury (from 96 +/- 10 at baseline to 136 +/- 17 pg/mL
   at 3 h after injury); thereafter, it decreased towards baseline value,
   followed by a second increase in the post resuscitation period (183 +/-
   43 pg/mL at 72 h after injury). Decreased urine output and accentuated
   pulmonary vascular resistance in the combined injury group was observed
   between the two ANP level peaks, indicating that ANP release modified
   physiological responses to the burn + smoke injury. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Chorizo de cebolla is a dry-fermented sausage abundantly produced and
   consumed in Galicia (NW Spain). The gross chemical composition and the
   main physicochemical, proteolytic, lipolytic and fat autooxidative
   parameters were determined throughout the ripening process of seven
   homemade batches and four industrial batches. Samples from each batch of
   sausages were taken at 0 days (mix before stuffing), and after 2, 7, 14,
   21, 28 and 42 days of ripening. Dehydration throughout ripening was more
   intense in the homemade batches, which showed final moisture and a(w)
   values lower than the industrial batches. In comparison to other
   varieties of chorizo and other similar raw-cured sausages, Chorizo de
   cebolla is characterised by high contents of fat and hydroxyproline and
   low contents of protein, NaCl and ash. In both systems of manufacture
   (homemade and industrial), a significant decrease in the pH values is
   observed until the seventh day of ripening (coinciding with the period
   of maximum degradation of the sugars), after which the pH was
   practically constant until the end of ripening in the homemade batches
   and showed a slight, but progressive increase after the 14th day in the
   industrial batches. The final pH values were lower than those reported
   for similar sausages.
   The different nitrogen fractions showed an increase during ripening and
   no significant differences in the final values, associated with the
   system of manufacture, were observed. The values of the nitrogen
   fractions show that proteolysis is particularly evident in the early
   stages of ripening, coinciding with the development of fermentation and
   a sharp decrease in pH.
   The acidity of the fat increases considerably during ripening in both
   systems of manufacture; however, the final values were among the lowest
   previously reported. The peroxide and TBA values evolved differently in
   the homemade and industrial batches. At the end of ripening, no
   significant differences associated with the system of manufacture
   (homemade or industrial) were observed in the peroxide value; however,
   the homemade batches showed significantly higher TBA values. (c) 2004

Abstract = {{Positron emission tomography (PET) studies suggest that propofol and
   inhaled anesthetics increase C-11-flumazenil binding in the living human
   brain, thus supporting the involvement of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A
   (GABA,) receptors in the mechanism of action of these drugs. Ketamine
   produces its anesthetic effects primarily by N-methyl-(D)-aspartate
   receptor antagonism, but it may also have GABA, receptor agonistic
   properties. By using PET, we studied the cerebral C-11-flumazenil
   binding in 10 healthy subjects before and during a subanesthetic racemic
   ketamine infusion reaching a serum concentration of 350 +/- 42 ng/ mL.
   Ketamine did not affect C-11-flumazenil binding to GABA(A) receptor in
   the brain, indicating that this mechanism is of minor importance in the
   actions of subanesthetic ketamine.}},

Abstract = {{Adenovirus vectors encoding carcinoembryonic antigen (Ad-CEA) or
   costimulatory molecules CD80, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)
   and leucocyte function-associated antigen-3 (LFA-3) (Ad-STIM) were used
   to transduce murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC). BMDC
   were characterized for expression of activation markers and for their
   ability to elicit protective immunity against MC38-CEA tumours in
   wildtype and CEA-transgenic (CEA-tg) mice. To determine optimal culture
   conditions, studies were conducted using BMDC cultured in heterologous
   bovine serum or autologous mouse serum. Transduction of cells grown in
   presence of heterologous serum increased the expression of costimulatory
   molecules, major histocompatibility complex class II, of IL-6 and IL-12.
   Upon vaccination, tumour protection was not specific and was observed
   also with untransduced cells. Transduced BMDC cultured in the presence
   of autologous serum showed low expression of the activation markers, did
   not express IL-6 and had reduced ability to stimulate T-cell
   proliferation. Nonetheless, CEA-specific CD8(+) T-cell response was
   enhanced upon coinfection of Ad-STIM and Ad-CEA in both mouse strains,
   although this immune response was not sufficient to protect CEA-tg mice
   from tumour challenge. These studies support the use of BMDC transduced
   with Ad vectors encoding tumour antigens for cancer immunotherapy and
   demonstrate that culture conditions greatly affect the immunological
   properties of these cells.}},

Abstract = {{Heterozygosity for a t haplotype (t) in mate mice results in distorted
   transmission (TRD) of the t-bearing chromosome 17 homolog to their
   offspring. However, homozygosity for t causes male sterility, thus
   limiting the spread of t through the population at large. The Ca2+-
   dependent sperm tail curvature phenotypes, ``fishhook{''}, where
   abnormally high levels of sperm exhibit sharp bends in the midpiece, and
   ``curlicue{''}, where motile sperm exhibit a chronic negative curving of
   the entire tail, have been tightly linked to t-associated male TRD and
   sterility traits, respectively. Genetic studies have indicated that
   homozygosity for the t allele of Dnahc8, an axonemal gamma-type dynein
   heavy chain (gamma DHC) gene, is partially responsible for expression of
   ``curlicue{''}; however, its involvement in ``fisbhook{''}/TRD, if any,
   is unknown. Here we report that the major isoform of DNAHC8 is copiously
   expressed, carries an extended N-terminus and full-length C-terminus,
   and is stable and equally abundant in both testis and sperm from +/+ and
   t/t animals. By in silico analysis we also demonstrate that at least
   three of the seventeen DNAHC8(t) mutations at highly conserved positions
   in wild-type DHCs may be capable of substantially altering normal DNAHC8
   function. Interestingly, DNAHC8 is confined to the principal piece of
   the sperm tail. The combined results of this study suggest possible
   mechanisms of DNAHC8(t) dysfunction and involvement in ``curlicue{''},
   and support the hypothesis that ``curlicue{''} is a multigenic
   phenomenon. They also demonstrate that the accelerated ``fishhook{''}
   phenotype of sperm from +/t males is not directly linked to DNAHC8(t)
   dysfunction. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article aims to contribute an integrated solution for the design
   and test of railway bogies, so that the demands of each new design can
   be validated by computing. Nowadays, official approval regulations
   demand experimental tests on real prototypes. Three different kinds of
   tests are required. Trying to substitute these tests by simulations on a
   finite element method (FEM) model, two main troubles appear. (1) Strain
   gauges used in experimental tests must be substituted by a FEM entity
   that provides similar results as long as official standard regulations
   can be applied to them. (2) Current FEM codes present several problems
   simulating fatigue phenomenon. In this article, a new type of finite
   element, called virtual strain gauge, is proposed. Results obtained by
   this element can be treated as experimental results, as long as they are
   much similar to strain gauges results than other typical FEM ones.
   Fatigue testing may be reduced when greater experience is acquired with
   virtual strain gauges. However, it will always play a key role in final
   test with real prototypes, pinpointing errors in materials, manufacture,
   and welding. This work concludes that, using virtual strain gauges,
   experimental tests can be drastically reduced by replacing them with FEM
   simulations. An example of an MSP railway bogie is analysed to
   illustrate theoretical results.}},

Abstract = {{Many patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria are not sufficiently
   controlled with histamine H-1-receptor antagonists. Leukotriene receptor
   antagonists have been reported to be effective for certain cases of
   urticaria, although their proper application remains to be established.
   To study the effectiveness of montelukast, a leukotriene receptor
   antagonist, for the treatment of chronic urticaria that was not
   controlled by histamine H-1-receptor antagonists. Twenty-five patients
   with chronic idiopathic urticaria were treated with 10 mg of montelukast
   for one week or more, without changing any precedent treatment that they
   were using before the study including histamine H-1-receptor
   antagonists. The effectiveness of montelukast for each patient was
   evaluated and compared with clinical features and/or backgrounds of the
   patients. Twelve patients, including six who had been treated with
   corticosteroids, were evaluated as ``markedly improved{''} or
   ``improved{''} following treatment with montelukast. There was no
   statistically significant relation of the effectiveness to the
   complications with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
   intolerance, mechanical urticaria, or reactions to autologous serum skin
   test. However, the patients for whom montelukast was effective were
   younger (33.2 +/- 16.3 years, mean +/- SD)(P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney test)
   and their duration of illness shorter (15.9 +/- 18.3 months) (P < 0.005,
   Mann-Whitney test) than those of patients for whom montelukast was
   ineffective (45.9 +/- 15.0 years, 89.6 +/- 71.7 months). Montelukast may
   be worth trying for patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, when the

Abstract = {{A dynamical system falling in between the elementary binary cellular
   automata and the coupled map lattices is presented. It is composed by a
   one-dimensional cellular automaton in which the values within each cell
   are continuous instead of discrete. However, in this case, the coupling
   between cells is made through a logistic map instead of making the
   fuzzification of the disjunctive normal form describing the
   corresponding Boolean rule. The system resembles the CA rule 90
   evolution, since the future value of a cell depends only on a
   combination of the values of the nearest neighbors cells. The basic
   dynamical and stability properties of the system are analyzed. The
   system displays different types from attractors (fixed points, cycles
   and chaotic attractors), depending on the growth rate parameter used for
   the logistic map coupling. If the cell values are binary, i.e., only
   values 0 and 1 are allowed within each cell, the dynamical evolution of
   the rule 90 automaton is recovered.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents some results of an investigation of sulphur
   atmospheric deposition in areas with different anthropogenic loads in
   Belarus. Through sampling and chemical analysis of precipitation, new
   data about sulphate concentrations in precipitation and atmospheric
   deposition of sulphur in different conditions, including regional
   background conditions, a large industrial city and a zone affected by
   point source of sulphur emission, were obtained. Comparison of the
   chemical composition of precipitation at three sampling locations has
   shown that the local emission of sulphur compounds has a minor influence
   on local sulphur deposition. This data points to the dominant role of
   transboundary transfer of sulphur in contamination and acidification of

Abstract = {{Introduction: Oil massage for newborns is reported to improve weight
   gain by better thermoregulation. A role for transcutaneous absorption
   has also been suggested. Aims and Objectives: This study was undertaken
   to compare the effect of massage with coconut oil versus mineral oil and
   placebo (powder) on growth velocity and neuro-behavior in well term and
   preterm babies. Study design: Open Randomized Controlled trial. Setting:
   The Premature unit and the postnatal wards of a major teaching hospital
   in a metropolitan city. Material and methods: Intramural preterm
   appropriate for gestational age babies weighing between 1500 to 2000
   grams and term births weighing more than 2500 grams fulfilling the
   inclusion criteria constituted the two gestation age categories studied.
   Babies in each group were randomized to receive massage with either
   coconut oil, mineral oil or with placebo. Oil massage was given by a
   trained person from day 2 of life till discharge, and thereafter by the
   mother until 31 days of age, four times a day. Babies were followed up
   daily till discharge and every week after discharge for anthropometry.
   Neurobehavioral outcome was assessed by the Brazelton Score at baseline,
   day 7 and on day 31. Results: Coconut oil massage resulted in
   significantly greater weight,gain velocity as compared to mineral oil
   and placebo in the preterm babies group; and in the term baby group, as
   compared to the placebo. Preterm infants receiving coconut oil massage
   also showed a greater length gain velocity compared to placebo group. No
   statistically significant difference was observed in, the
   neurobehavioral assessment between all three subgroups in term babies as
   well as in preterm babies.}},

   the crown-rump length and the trunk diameter of the embryo were
   estimated. Later, when the fetal organs and structures could be
   distinguished, several measurements were done in the skull
   (occipito-snout length and biparietal and orbit diameters), the trunk
   (thoracic diameter and width of vertebrae), and the abdominal cavity
   (stomach and kidney longitudinal diameters); femur length was also
   determined. All fetal measurements were correlated with gestational age
   (P < 0.001), but the parameters showing the highest correlation with
   time (R-2 up to 0.94) were the crown-rump and occipito-snout lengths and
   the thoracic and biparietal diameters. No significant differences were

Abstract = {{Etomidate is often used for inducing anesthesia in patients who have
   limited hemodynamic reserve. Using invasive hemodynamic monitoring, we
   studied the acute effects of a bolus of etomidate during induction of
   anesthesia in children. Twelve children undergoing cardiac
   catheterization were studied (mean age, 9.2 +/- 4.8 yr; mean weight,
   33.4 +/- 15.4 kg); catheterization procedures included device closure of
   secundum atrial septal defects (n = 7) and radiofrequency catheter
   ablation procedures for supraventricular tachycardia (n = 5). Using IV
   sedation, a balloon-tipped pulmonary artery catheter was placed to
   measure intracardiac and pulmonary artery pressures and oxygen
   saturations. Baseline measurements were recorded and then re- pealed
   after a bolus of IV etomidate (0.3 mg/kg). For the entire group, no
   significant changes in right atrial, aortic, or pulmonary artery
   pressure, oxygen saturations, calculated Qp:Qs ratio or systemic or
   pulmonary vascular resistance were detected after the bolus dose of
   etomidate. The lack of clinically significant hemodynamic changes after
   etomidate administration supports the clinical impression that etomidate
   is safe in children. Further research is needed to determine the
   hemodynamic profile of etomidate in neonates and in pediatric patients
   with severe ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To obtain data on sleep quality in women attending menopause
   clinics in Italy.
   Design: A cross-sectional study was conducted on the sleep quality of
   postmenopausal women attending a network of first-level outpatient
   menopause clinics in Italy for general counseling about menopause or
   treatment of its symptoms. Eligible for the study were women observed
   consecutively during the study period with natural or spontaneous
   menopause. All participating centers enrolled women into the study who
   had never used hormone therapy (HT) (group 1, 819 women), current users
   of transdermal estrogens with or without progestins (group 2, 819
   women), and current users of oral estrogens with or without progestins
   (group 3, 790 women). The women were asked about their quality of sleep
   using the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire, their quality of life using
   the Short Form-12 questionnaire, and the intensity of hot flushes using
   a visual analogue scale.
   Results: Women in groups 2 and 3 tended to report difficulties in
   sleeping less often than those in group 1. For example, never users of
   HT more frequently reported sleeping poorly and needed more time to
   sleep or had problems falling asleep; these differences were significant
   (P < 0.05). Otherwise, no difference emerged from the Basic Nordic Sleep
   Questionnaire between women in groups 2 and 3.
   Conclusions: This study gives support to the suggestion that HT improves
   the quality of sleep. The effect was similar in women taking oral or
   transdermal therapy with or without progestins.}},

Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Many topically applied drugs are ionized molecules that exhibit poor
   penetration across the lipid domains of the stratum corneum. Reduction
   of the charge on the molecule would be expected to enhance skin
   penetration. The objective of this study was to investigate the
   interaction of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug benzydamine
   hydrochloride with suitable counter-ions including ibuprofen sodium. The
   influence of pH of the donor solution and hence degree of ionization on
   partitioning between n-octanol: buffer and the flux of benzydamine
   hydrochloride across polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) membrane and human
   epidermis was determined. The maximum flux was determined at pH 7.6 when
   the fraction unionized was 2.51\%, rather than at pH 9 when the fraction
   unionized was 38.7\%. This suggests that at higher pH, although the
   permeability coefficient is increased, the decrease in solubility and
   therefore concentration of dissolved benzydamine in the medium results
   in a decrease in flux across the PDMS membrane. Ion-pair formation or
   interaction with each of the counter-ions was confirmed by NMR
   spectroscopy. Significant increases in log P and flux across PDMS
   membrane were determined for the ion-pairs (0.087, 12.54, 11.31, 0.121
   mu g cm(-2) h(-1) for benzydamine hydrochloride and ion-pairs with
   ibuprofen sodium, sodium benzoate and sodium octane sulfonate
   respectively). This study shows that it is possible to significantly
   enhance the flux of salts across a lipophilic membrane in the presence
   of counter-ions, resulting from intermolecular interaction and/or
   ion-pair formation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an agent architecture for a combination of
   speculative computation and abduction. Speculative computation is a
   tentative computation when complete information for performing
   computation is not obtained. We use a default value to complement such
   incomplete information. Unlike usual default reasoning, the real value
   for the information can be obtained during the computation and the
   computation can be revised on the fly. In the previous work, we applied
   this technique to handling distributed problem solving under incomplete
   communication environments in the context of multi-agent systems and
   proposed correct procedures in abductive logic programming in terms of
   perfect model semantics. In the previous work, however, we regarded
   assumptions as defaults and used these assumptions for speculative
   computation. Thus, we could not perform hypothetical reasoning, that is,
   the original usage of abduction. In this paper, we,extend our framework
   so that speculative computation and abduction can be both performed. As
   a result, our procedure becomes an extension of the abductive procedure
   developed by Kakas and Mancarella augmented by dynamic belief revision
   mechanism about outside world.}},

Abstract = {{The change of the pH of a NaCl solution (139-149 mM NaCl) buffered with
   5-15 mM sodium phosphates (pH 7.4) during electromanipulation was
   studied. It has been determined that an increase in the pH value of
   electroporation solution of a whole chamber volume, caused by the
   application of electric field pulses, commonly used in cell
   electromanipulation procedures, can exceed 1-2 pH units.
   Several materials for the cathode were tested. In all cases a stainless
   steel anode was utilized. The aluminum cathode gave a two-fold greater
   Delta pH in comparison with platinum, copper or stainless steel
   cathodes. In addition, a substantial release of aluminum (up to I mg/l)
   from the cathode was observed. It has also been found that the shift in
   pH depended on the medium conductivity: ApH of the solution, in which
   sucrose was substituted for NaCl, was about 5 times less.
   On the basis of the results obtained here, to avoid the plausible
   undesirable consequences of the cathodic electrolysis processes, in
   particular under the conditions of strong electric treatment, it could
   be recommended that chambers with aluminum electrodes not be utilized
   and one should use strongly buffered solutions of low conductivity and
   alternating current (sine or square wave) bipolar electric pulses. (c)

Abstract = {{Perlecan (Pln) is a major heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) of
   extracellular matrices and bone marrow stroma. Pln, via
   glycosaminoglycans in domains I and V, acts as a co-receptor for
   delivery of heparin binding growth factors (HBGFs) that support cancer
   growth and vascularization. Specifically, glycosaminoglycans bind HBGFs
   and activate HBGF receptors, including those for FGF-2 and VEGF-A. The
   contribution of Pln to prostate cancer growth was tested using a
   ribozyme approach to knockdown Pln expression levels. Transfection into
   the androgen-independent, bone targeted prostate cancer line, C4-2B, and
   efficient stable knockdown of Pln was demonstrated by quantitative PCR,
   immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Three individually isolated
   subclones with 75-80\% knockdown in Pln mRNA, protein expression and
   secretion into ECM were used to study in vitro growth responses to FGF-2
   and VEGF-A. While cells with normal Pln levels responded to both HBGFs,
   knockdown cells responded poorly. All lines responded to serum growth
   factors and IGF-I. Anchorage-independent growth assays showed reduced
   colony size and cohesiveness by all Pln deficient subclones compared to
   parental C4-2B cells. In vivo effects of Pln knockdown were measured by
   inoculating knockdown and control ribozyme transfected cell lines into
   athymic mice. A reduced growth rate, smaller tumor size, diminished
   vascularization and failure to elevate serum PSA characterized mice
   bearing Pln knockdown C4-2B cells. Poor vascularization correlated with
   reduced levels of VEGF-A secreted by Pln knockdown lines. We conclude
   that Pln is an essential ECM component involved in growth responses of
   metastatic prostate cancer cells to HBGFs deposited in local and
   metastatic microenvironment.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this investigation was to confirm the main results reported
   in recent studies on the induction of genotoxic effects in human
   fibroblasts exposed to 50 Hz intermittent (5 min field on/10 min field
   off) sinusoidal electromagnetic fields. For this purpose, the induction
   of DNA single-strand breaks was evaluated by applying the alkaline
   single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE)/comet assay. To extend the study
   and validate the results, in the same experimental conditions, the
   potential genotoxicity was also tested by exposing the cells to a 50 Hz
   powerline signal (50 Hz frequency plus its harmonics). The
   cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay was applied after 24 h intermittent
   exposure to both sinusoidal and powerline signals to obtain information
   on cell cycle kinetics. The experiments were carried out on human
   diploid fibroblasts (ES-1). For each experimental run, exposed and
   sham-exposed samples were set up; positive controls were also provided
   by treating cells with hydrogen peroxide or mitomycin C for the comet or
   micronucleus assay, respectively. No statistically significant
   difference was detected in exposed compared to sham-exposed samples in
   any of the experimental conditions tested (P > 0.05). In contrast, the
   positive controls showed a statistically significant increase in DNA
   damage in all cases, as expected. Accordingly, our findings do not
   confirm the results reported previously for either comet induction or an
   increase in micronucleus frequency. (c) 2005 by Radiation Research

Organization = {{IOF}},
Abstract = {{Inflammatory diseases lead to systemic osteoporosis. Causal factors
   include increased circulating concentrations of inflammatory cytokines
   such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha
   (TNF-alpha), glucocorticoid medication, and reduced physical activity.
   In addition, disturbances of vitamin D metabolism play an important role
   for the development of inflammation induced osteoporosis. Therefore,
   D-hormone analogs offer an important treatment option.
   1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (D-hormone) prevented bone loss in the rat model
   of inflammation mediated osteopenia and in an arthritis model. One
   explanation is that animals and humans with inflammatory diseases
   exhibit markedly reduced circulating concentrations of D-hormone, partly
   the result of inhibition of renal 1-alpha-hydroxylase by TNF-alpha. In
   addition, the number of vitamin D receptors is reduced by
   glucocorticoids. Moreover, D-hormone has pleiotropic effects not only on
   calcium homoeostasis but also on muscle (improving power), the nervous
   system, and the immune system. D-hormone inhibits the release of
   cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha) from macrophages and stimulates
   osteoprotegerin secretion in vitro and improves arthritis in animal
   models. This article reviews the interaction between inflammatory
   disease and vitamin D metabolism, summarizes the rationale for the
   therapeutic use of alfacalcidol, and provides recent data from
   controlled clinical trials comparing the effect of alfacalcidol versus
   plain vitamin D in secondary osteoporosis. Alfacalcidol, but not plain
   vitamin D, has pleiotropic effects improving bone and muscle metabolism
   and clinical symptoms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach for estimating nonlinear models of the electrically
   stimulated quadriceps muscle group under nonisometric conditions is
   investigated. The model can be used for designing controlled
   neuro-prostheses. In order to identify the muscle dynamics (stimulation
   pulsewidth-active knee moment relation) from discrete-time angle
   measurements only, a hybrid model structure is postulated for the
   shank-quadriceps dynamics. The model consists of a relatively well known
   time-invariant passive component and an uncertain time-variant active
   component. Rigid body dynamics, described by the Equation of Motion
   (EoM), and passive joint properties form the time-invariant part. The
   actuator, i.e. the electrically stimulated muscle group, represents the
   uncertain time-varying section. A recursive algorithm is outlined for
   identifying online the stimulated quadriceps muscle group. The algorithm
   requires EoM and passive joint characteristics to be known a priori. The
   muscle dynamics represent the product of a continuous-time nonlinear
   activation dynamics and a nonlinear static contraction function
   described by a Normalised Radial Basis Function (NRBF) network which has
   knee-joint angle and angular velocity as input arguments. An Extended
   Kalman Filter (EKF) approach is chosen to estimate muscle dynamics
   parameters and to obtain full state estimates of the shank-quadriceps
   dynamics simultaneously. The latter is important for implementing state
   feedback controllers. A nonlinear state feedback controller using the
   backstepping method is explicitly designed whereas the model was
   identified a priori using the developed identification procedure. (c)

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the predictive validity of an alternative to the
   DSM-IV for diagnosing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in preschool
   children and prospectively explore the course of PTSD symptomatology.
   Method: Sixty-two traumatized children, ages 20 months through 6 years,
   were assessed three times in 2 years with caregiver diagnostic
   interviews. Results: PTSD diagnosis at visit 1 significantly predicted
   degree of functional impairment 1 and 2 years later and predicted PTSD
   diagnosis 2 years later but not 1 year later. The lack of 1-year
   diagnostic continuity may be explained by children with new traumas.
   Unexpectedly, overall PTSD symptoms did not remit over time, regardless
   of community treatment; however, reexperiencing symptoms decreased and
   avoidance/numbing symptoms increased with time, with avoidance/numbing
   symptoms increasing at a faster rate in children with PTSD at visit 1.
   The previous finding that arousal may cause emotional numbing was not
   replicated. Significantly more children were functionally impaired at
   visits 2 (48.9\%) and 3 (74.3\%) than were diagnosed with PTSD (23.4\%
   and 22.9\%, respectively). Conclusions: This study demonstrates
   predictive validity for the alternative method of diagnosing PTSD in
   preschool children. The unremitting course of PTSD symptomatology in
   preschool children and rates of impairment that are higher than rates of
   diagnosis indicate the need for efficacious treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Application of organic residues to soil is generally assumed to improve
   soil tilth. Only few studies have reported the long-term effects on the
   more subtle aspects of soil porosity, and no reports have considered the
   potential effects of organic amendments on the pore system in the
   subsoil. We sampled undisturbed soil cores (100 cm(3) and 6280 cm(3))
   using metal cylinders in differently fertilized plots in the long-term
   field experiment at Askov Experimental Station, Denmark. We selected the
   0-60 cm soil layer of plots dressed for a century with either mineral
   fertilizers (labelled NPK) or animal manure (labelled AM) and
   unfertilized plots (UNF) as a reference. Both fertilization treatments
   were studied at two levels of nutrient application: `normal' (labelled
   `1') and 1.5 times `normal' (labelled `1'). Water retention, air
   permeability and air diffusivity were measured on the small cores, and
   we used the large cores for measuring near-saturated and saturated
   hydraulic conductivity. In the plough layer, the AM and NPK soils
   displayed identical pore volumes in size fractions that were larger as
   well as smaller than 30 mu m, while the UNF soil had a significantly
   smaller volume of pores < 30 mu m. No clear trends were found in
   treatment effects on pore organization as calculated from air
   diffusivity and air permeability measurements. No significant
   differences in hydraulic conductivity were found in the plough layer.
   For the subsoil below ploughing depth, significantly larger macropore
   volumes and near-saturated hydraulic conductivities were found for soil
   of plots receiving the larger ('1') amount of nutrients compared with
   the `normally' dressed soil. This effect was independent of
   fertilization system (AM or NPK). We attribute the larger volume of
   macropores to the improved root growth conditions in the soil with the
   higher nutrient level. We conclude that addition of animal manure at
   rates realistic in agriculture has only a modest effect on soil pore
   characteristics of the plough layer soil compared with the use of
   mineral fertilizers. For the subsoil below ploughing depth, a high level
   of nutrient application may increase soil macroporosity and
   near-saturated hydraulic conductivity, but the origin of nutrients is of
   no significance.}},

Abstract = {{Two new transient absorption measurement techniques are described which
   use commercially available pulsed laser diodes or high-power
   light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as monitoring beam. The semiconductor
   devices substitute the probe in a kilohertz-repetition-rate ultrafast
   pump-probe setup. A fully functional and highly compact laser flash
   photolysis system reaching the nanosecond to millisecond time scale is
   thereby added to a state-of-the-art femtosecond system. The sample is
   excited with UV-Vis tunable femtosecond pulses, and for the
   electronically synchronized probing light either subnanosecond pulsed
   laser diodes for selected wavelengths or LEDs covering the visible to
   near infrared and UV regions are used. The applicability and reliability
   of the devices are demonstrated for various probe wavelengths in the
   visible by the investigation of excited-state decay or photoinduced
   bimolecular reactions. The time resolution is found to be 400 ps for the
   pulsed laser diodes and a few nanoseconds for the LEDs. This provides
   overlap to the accessible time range of the ultrafast pump-probe
   experiment. In this way full reaction cycles of photo-physical or

Abstract = {{An overview about various observed phenomena, assumptions, and relations
   concerning the development of uterine torsion in cattle is presented.
   Furthermore, contradictory observations and old ideas are relativated
   and more accurate interpretations are given. It is known that the fetus
   himself is moving what is considered a reason for a torsion of the
   uterus. Intrauterine movements of the fetus are physiologic, and
   therefore other factors for uterine torsions are likely to be involved.
   A very plausible explanation for the selective occurrence of uterine
   torsion in cattle seems to be decreased amniotic fluid in relation to
   the size of fetus and uterus, because other influences can also be
   observed in all or at least in a high number of other animals.
   Destabilizing factors concerning the uterus (tonus decreased, uterus
   outside bursa supraomentalis) increase the possibility of developing a
   torsio uteri but are not compelling for the torsio uteri.}},

Abstract = {{Dexrazoxane (ICRF-187) is clinically used as a doxorubicin
   cardio-protective agent and may act by preventing iron-based oxygen free
   radical damage through the iron-chelating ability of its fully
   hydrolyzed metabolite ADR-925
   (N,N'-{[}(1S)-1-methyl-1,2-ethanediyl]bis{[}(N-(2-amino-2-oxoethyl)]glyc
   ine). Dexrazoxane undergoes initial metabolism to its two one-ring open
   intermediates and is then further metabolized to its active metal
   ion-binding form ADR-925. The metabolism of these intermediates to the
   ring-opened metal-chelating product ADR-925 has been determined in a rat
   model to identify the mechanism by which dexrazoxane is activated. The
   plasma concentrations of both intermediates rapidly decreased after
   their i.v. administration to rats. A maximum concentration of ADR-925
   was detected 2 min after i.v. bolus administration, indicating that
   these intermediates were both rapidly metabolized in vivo to ADR-925.
   The kinetics of the initial appearance of ADR-925 was consistent with
   formation rate-limited metabolism of the intermediates. After
   administration of dexrazoxane or its two intermediates, ADR-925 was
   detected in significant levels in both heart and liver tissue but was
   undetectable in brain tissue. The rapid rate of metabolism of the
   intermediates was consistent with their hydrolysis by tissue
   dihydroorotase. The rapid appearance of ADR925 in plasma may make
   ADR-925 available to be taken up by heart tissue and bind free iron.
   These studies showed that the two one-ring open metabolites of
   dexrazoxane were rapidly metabolized in the rat to ADR-925, and thus,
   these results provide a mechanism by which dexrazoxane is activated to
   its active metal-binding form.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. Our purpose was to quantitatively and qualitatively compare
   3D intraarterial (IA) gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography (IA MRA) versus
   the standard of reference of MR angiography, 3D IV gadolinium-enhanced
   MR angiography (IV MRA), in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive
   disease (PAOD) for use during catheter-based MR-guided endovascular
   interventions.
   CONCLUSION. IA MRA provides image quality of the infrainguinal arteries
   in PAOD patients comparable to IV MRA with a significantly improved
   assessment of the infrapopliteal arteries due to reduced venous
   contamination. Further benefits of IA MRA include usage of only very low
   doses of gadolinium and simplified bolus timing.}},

Abstract = {{Single morphine injections induce a state of acute opioid dependence
   measured by an increase in naloxone potency to precipitate withdrawal.
   Repeated morphine exposure (daily/weekly intervals) results in further
   potentiation of naloxone potency, perhaps due to conditioning
   mechanisms. The current study tested the hypothesis that previously
   neutral stimuli could elicit a conditioned potentiation of the
   withdrawal response following acute bolus injections of morphine. Rats
   trained on an FR-15 schedule for food received five morphine injections
   (5.6 mg/kg) at daily intervals. Four hr after morphine injection on
   Conditioning Days (first 4 days), naloxone (I mg/kg)-induced suppression
   of responding was paired either with operant context only, or with a
   tone/light conditioned stimulus (CS). On Test Day low dose naloxone
   (0.001-0.33 mg/kg) given 4-h post-morphine preceded the operant session.
   Rats exposed to naloxone repeatedly in the operant context without CS
   (Paired-Context Only) showed an increase in naloxone potency on Test Day
   relative to Unpaired Controls that received all morphine and naloxone in
   the home cage at a different time of day than operant testing. Rats
   exposed to the tone/light CS on Conditioning Days also showed a
   significant increase in naloxone potency relative to Unpaired Controls
   when the CS was represented on Test Day (Paired-CS), but not when the CS
   was omitted on the Test Day (Paired-CS/Test Context). Thus, conditioning
   processes appear to play a significant role in the early development of
   opioid dependence and withdrawal. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Lamins are intermediate filaments that line the inner surface of the
   nuclear envelope, providing structural support and making contacts with
   chromatin. There are two types of lamins, A- and B-types, which differ
   in structure and expression. Drosophila possesses both lamin types,
   encoded by the LamC (A-type) and lamin Dm(O) (B-type) genes. LamC is
   nested within an intron of the essential gene ttv. We demonstrate that
   null mutations in LamC are lethal, and expression of a wild-type LamC
   transgene rescues lethality of LamC but not ttv mutants. Mutations in
   the human A-type lamin gene lead to diseases called laminopathics. To
   determine if Drosophila might serve as a useful model to study lamin
   biology and disease mechanisms, we generated transgenic flies expressing
   mutant LamC proteins modeled after human disease-causing lamins. These
   transgenic animals display a nuclear lamin aggregation phenotype
   remarkably similar to that observed when human mutant A-type lamins are
   expressed in mammalian cells. LamC aggregates also cause disorganization
   of lamin Dm(O), indicating interdependence of both lamin types for
   proper lamina assembly. Taken together, these data provide the first
   detailed genetic analysis of the LamC gene and support using Drosophila
   as a model to study the role of lamins in disease.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to assess the side effects and the efficacy of
   thalidomide alone or in combination with dexamethasone in relapsed
   multiple myeloma (MM) and to evaluate possible predictive factors for
   response rate and survival. Twenty-nine pretreated patients were
   enrolled, including 13 patients with a relapse after high-dose
   chemotherapy. The median number of relapses was 3 (range: 1-7).
   Twenty-two patients received thalidomide in combination with
   dexamethasone and seven patients thalidomide alone. The dosage of
   thalidomide was 400 mg/day and the dosage of dexamethasone 20 mg/m(2)
   daily for 4 consecutive days every 3 weeks. Cycles of dexamethasone were
   given until maximal decline of myeloma protein was achieved, whereas
   therapy with thalidomide was maintained until disease progression.
   Responses occurred in 62\% of patients, including 5 (17\%) complete
   remissions and 13 (45\%) partial remissions. The median event-free
   survival (EFS) was 7.2 months and the median overall survival (OS) 26.1
   months. In multivariate analysis, pretreatment serum levels of soluble
   interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) were a significant prognostic factor for
   EFS, and those of beta(2)-microglobulin (beta 2M) and sIL-2R for OS.
   Serum levels of sIL-2R significantly increased after 3 weeks of
   treatment in 89\% of patients, possibly representing lymphocyte
   activation induced by thalidomide. Two patients died of septic
   complications within 3 months after starting treatment with thalidomide
   and dexamethasone and one patient of herpes encephalitis after 26 months
   of treatment with thalidomide alone. Also, one case of pneumonia and one
   case of deep venous thrombosis of the lower limb occurred. Other side
   effects were somnolence, peripheral neuropathy, and bradycardia
   occurring in 35, 55, 38 and 55\% of patients, respectively. The
   combination of thalidomide and dexamethasone is an effective therapy in
   heavily pretreated myeloma patients with a high response rate and
   acceptable toxicities. A powerful predictive factor both for EFS and OS
   was the pretreatment serum level of sIL-2R.}},

Abstract = {{Home health agencies, challenged to demonstrate quality while containing
   costs, are motivated to find best practices for managing patient and
   wound care. The effects of different wound therapies on frequency of
   hospitalization and emergent care, two prominent quality measures, have
   not been studied. A retrospective study was conducted to determine the
   prevalence of Stage III and Stage IV pressure ulcers in the home health
   population and to quantify the impact of negative pressure wound therapy
   in reducing acute care hospitalizations and emergent care in general,
   and wound infection or deteriorating wound status in particular. Data
   from 1.94 million OASIS start-of-care assessments in 2003 and 2004 were
   evaluated to estimate pressure ulcer prevalence and a retrospective
   matched group analysis compared patients using (n = 60) and not using (n
   = 2,288) negative pressure wound therapy. In 2003, 6.9\% and in 2004,
   7\% of patients had pressure ulcers at start of care. Of these, 23\%
   were Stage III or Stage IV and 31\% were ``not healing.{''} In the
   matched analysis group, it was found that compared to comparison group
   patients, those receiving negative pressure wound therapy experienced
   lower rates of hospitalization (35\% versus.48\%, P < .05),
   hospitalization due to wound problems (5\% versus 14\%, P < .01), and
   emergent care for wound problems (0\% versus 8\%, P = .01). To offset
   potential limitations in generalizability and increase practical
   application of these results, further research is needed with a larger,
   nationally representative sample to compare other quality outcomes as
   well as the cost of providing negative pressure wound therapy to other
   specific wound care modalities.}},

Abstract = {{C57BL/6J (B6) mice consume more sugar and fat solutions than do 129 mice
   in 24-h preference tests. Previous studies have attributed this
   observation to strain differences in taste responsiveness to these
   nutrients. We tested the hypothesis that differences in postingestive
   responsiveness contribute to the strain differences. In experiment 1, B6
   and 129 mice were trained to associate consumption of a flavored
   solution (CS+) with intragastric (IG) infusions of 16\% sucrose and a
   different flavored solution (CS+) with IG water infusions ( 22 h/day).
   They were then retrained with new flavors paired with IG infusions of
   5.6\% soybean oil and water. Although both strains developed preferences
   for the nutrient-paired CS+ solutions, the B6 mice displayed
   significantly stronger preferences. The B6 mice consumed more CS+ during
   training, which may have contributed to their enhanced preference. In a
   second experiment, training intakes were equated by giving B6 and 129
   mice ``isosweet{''} CS solutions prepared with different amounts of
   sucrose and saccharin. The B6 and 129 mice consumed more of the sugar-
   or fat-paired CS+ than the water-paired CS+ during training. The two
   strains also displayed equally strong preferences for the CS+ over CS+
   in choice tests, indicating that they had similar postingestive
   responsiveness to the sucrose and soybean oil. We propose that B6 mice
   consume more sugar and fat than 129 mice because their stronger
   orosensory response stimulates greater intake, which leads to greater
   stimulation of postingestive nutrient detectors and further enhancement
   of consumption.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted an evidence-based review of psychological treatments for
   geriatric depression using coding criteria, and we identified six
   treatments to be beneficial: behavioral therapy, cognitive behavioral
   therapy, cognitive bibiiotherapy, problem-solving therapy, brief
   psychodynamic therapy, and reminiscence therapy. Other interventions
   were found to be promising but were lacking replication. These findings
   suggest that (a) there are several treatment choices for consumers and
   practitioners across a relatively broad range of theoretical
   orientations and modalities, (b) there needs to be a recognition of the
   viability of psychological treatments for depressed elders by other
   disciplines, and (c) there is an opportunity to provide training in
   evidence-based treatments for present and future providers to the
   growing number of older adults.}},

Volume = {{89}},

Abstract = {{Caveolae are present in almost all cells and concentrate a wide variety
   of signaling molecules, receptors, transporters, and ion pumps. We have
   investigated the distribution of the ryanodine receptor, the Na+/Ca2+
   exchanger, the predominant Na+ channel isoform rH1, and the L-type
   calcium channel, Ca(v)1.2, relative to the muscle-specific caveolin
   isoform, caveolin-3, in adult rat ventricular myocytes.
   Three-dimensional immunofluorescence images were deconvolved and
   analyzed. Caveolin-3 colocalizes with all of these molecules at the
   surface of the cell, but there is no significant colocalization between
   caveolin-3 and either the Na+/ Ca2+ exchanger or the Na+ channel in the
   cell interior. The distribution of the surface colocalization indicates
   that the caveolae that colocalize with each molecule form distinct
   populations. This organization indicates that there are multiple
   populations of caveolae separable by location and occupants. In the
   interior of the cell, caveolin-3 shows a marked colocalization with a
   population of ryanodine receptors that are separate from those within
   the dyad. Because of their location, the signaling molecules contained
   within these caveolae may have preferred access to the neighboring
   nondyadic ryanodine receptors.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing use of organophosphorus insecticides in agriculture and
   inside homes and schools, as well as its widespread existence in the
   environment, poses a potential health hazard. As the use of these agents

   other organophosphates, chlorpyrifos kills insects and other animals,
   including human beings, because of its toxicity to the nervous system.
   Exposure of pregnant women to organophosphates is an important clinical
   entity because of its effects on two organisms -mother and fetus. There
   are few reports about fetal toxicity of organophosphates in the
   literature because of the relatively few cases reported. In this paper

Abstract = {{To evaluate some hard biscuits produced in Croatia as a source of
   different minerals in nutrition, macro-elements Ca, Mg, Na and K were
   determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy
   (ICP-AES) in sweet classic white wheat flour biscuits and in enriched
   dietetic sweet and salted biscuits. Ca and Mg contents in different
   kinds of biscuit ranged from 20.43 up to 87.92 mg/100 g and from 17.29
   to 59.53 mg/100 g, respectively. Since 100 g of enriched biscuits can
   cover, depending on the kind of biscuits and needs of different
   populations, about 5-18\% of recommended Adequate Intake (AI) for Ca and
   about 5-45\% of AI for Mg (DRI, 2004), such dietetic confectionery
   products can be considered as a good additional source of these
   essential macro-elements in nutrition. Besides salted biscuit (750.18
   mg/100 g), sweet biscuits are rich source of Na (194.60-360.51 mg/100 g)
   too, 100 g of biscuits covering 13-24\% of AI of Na for adult persons
   and 16-30 \% of AI recommended for children (4-8 year) and old people.
   All examined biscuits are poor sources of K (85.,85-261.30 mg/100 g)
   covering only 2-6\% of recommended AI of K for adult persons. That
   results in very adverse relation of Na and K intakes with biscuits. The
   results point to the problem of high intake of sodium with sweet
   biscuits.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes
   after arthroscopic single-bundle posterior cruciate ligament (PCL)
   reconstruction in patients with isolated grade Ell PCL injuries. Type of
   Study: Retrospective review. Methods: Twenty-one patients who underwent
   an isolated arthroscopic single-bundle PCL reconstruction for the
   treatment of a grade III PCL injury between 1989 and 1998 were included
   in the study. There were 15 male and 6 female patients with an average
   age of 38 years (range, 20 to 62 years). The length of follow-up was 5.9
   years (range, 2.6 to 11 years), and the average time from injury to
   surgery was 4.5 years (median, 1.3 years; range, 2 weeks to 25 years).
   All patients completed a subjective evaluation and 14 patients returned
   for a physical examination and radiographs. One patient underwent an
   acute reconstruction (<3 weeks), 4 had a subacute (<3 months), and 16
   underwent a chronic (>3 months) reconstruction. The anterolateral bundle
   of the PCL was reconstructed using an Achilles tendon allograft passed
   through femoral and tibial bone tunnels. Results: The overall average
   Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADLS), Sports Activities Scale (SAS),
   and SF-36 scores were 79.3, 71.6, and 98 points, respectively. There was
   a significant difference identified when the ADLS (91.3 v 75.6) and the
   SAS (90.4 v 65.8) scores of the subacute/acute group were compared with
   those of the chronic reconstruction group. Using the International Knee
   Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective assessment, 57\% of the
   patients had normal/near normal knee function, and 62\% had a
   normal/near normal activity level. The average extension and flexion
   losses were 1 degrees and 5 degrees, respectively. Instrumented laxity
   examination revealed that 62\% had less than a 3-mm and 31\% had a 3- to
   5-mm side-to-side difference in corrected posterior displacement.
   Radiographs at follow-up showed that 75\% had normal/near normal
   findings according to IKDC guidelines. Conclusions: The clinical
   outcomes after arthroscopic single-bundle PCL reconstruction in this
   study produced a satisfactory return of function and improvement in
   symptoms. All patients in this study had improved laxity of at least I
   grade. When compared with chronic reconstructions, acute reconstructions
   had statistically significant better ADLS and SAS scores. Level of
   Evidence: IV, case series.}},

Abstract = {{HIV-1 subtyping is important to study the changing scenario of genetic
   variation. The gag-based heteroduplex mobility assay (gag-HMA) was
   developed and evaluated as a powerful and reliable technique for
   identifying the HIV-1 group M subtypes A to H and the circulating
   recombinant forms (CRFs). To study the subtype distribution of HIV-1
   strains from the eastern part of India, we used the gag-based HMA,
   followed by the sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Blood samples from
   HIV-1-seropositive female sex workers in Calcutta were subjected to
   gag-HMA. The most prevalent subtype was found to be the C type, among
   which the C4 subsubtype was prevalent. However, a number of nontypable C
   strains were found in gag-HMA. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the
   discrete nature of the C strains and no monophyletic cluster was
   noticed. This result might indicate a growing tendency of variations
   among the HIV-1 type C strains circulating in eastern India.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{125}},

Abstract = {{We used data from a long-term study on two medium-sized generalist
   predators, the black kite (Milvus migrans) and the red kite (Milvus
   milvus), to illustrate the complexity of managing wide-ranging top
   predators by site-protection. The study was conducted between 1989 and
   2000 in the Reserva Biologica de Donana, located at the core of Donana
   National Park. Both species occurred at high density and showed high
   productivity. Black kites were slightly increasing, and red kites showed
   a non-significant trend. The main cause of breeding failure was nest
   predation, mainly by mammalian predators, most likely Iberian lynx (Lynx
   pardinus) or common genet (Genetta genetta). The main cause of mortality
   was illegal poisoning, which sharply increased in the late 1990s.
   Nest-site selection models showed that: (1) black kites selected areas
   near the seasonal marshes, rich in their main prey species and (2) red
   kites selected areas rich in marshland and far from the park border,
   possibly in response to illegal poisoning episodes. Productivity was
   positively related to the availability of marshland and of open
   terrestrial habitats for black and red kites, respectively, and
   negatively related for both species to the density of black kites within
   200 In of the nest. Our results showed that: (1) intraguild predation
   and competition among predators make outcomes of interspecific
   interactions extremely complex, leading to unpredictable side-effects of
   priority actions targeting one species at a time and (2) though the park
   was fenced and patrolled by wardens, the wide ranging behaviour of the
   two species made park borders permeable to negative human pressures,
   such as poisoning, leading to extreme edge effects and absence of a
   true, safe core of the park. Park management needs to be better
   integrated with its regional socio-economic and cultural context.
   Education programmes against illegal poisoning should be urgently
   promoted. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The prostate exhibits electric activity in the form of slow waves (SWs)
   and action potentials (APs). As the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs)
   are considered the pacemaker cells which generate the electric waves, we
   investigated the hypothesis that the prostate contains ICC. Prostatic
   biopsies were obtained from 15 healthy volunteers (mean age 36 +/- 3.8
   SD years). They were subjected to c-kit immunohistochemistry. Controls
   for the specificity of the antisera consisted of tissue incubated with
   normal rabbit serum substituted for the primary antiserum.
   C-kit-positive cells were identified as fusiform with dendritic
   processes. The cytoplasm was granular and the nucleus large and oval.
   Mast cells, also c-kit-positive, were round and lacked the dendritic
   processes. Immunoreactivity was absent in the negative controls. There
   were cells in the prostate with morphological and immunological
   phenotypes similar to ICCs of the gut. We predict an abnormal
   distribution of these cells in prostatic diseases. The study of the
   integrity of these cells may prove to be a useful investigative toot in
   the diagnosis of prostatic diseases and in the planning of an
   appropriate treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Aims. This study advances previously performed clinical studies of
   antifungal prophylaxis and prospectively evaluates the efficacy of
   low-dose amphotericin B preparations for the prevention of invasive
   fungal infection (M) in high-risk liver transplant (LT) recipients.
   Methods. High-risk LT patients were recruited and randomised to openly
   receive intravenously either conventional amphotericin B (amB) at a dose
   of 15 mg daily, or liposomal amphotericin B (amBisome) 50 mg daily
   Prophylaxis was continued until discharge from the intensive care unit
   (ICU), until patient death, or until time of conversion to high-dose
   amBisome for treatment of suspected or confirmed IFI. Results. During
   the study period, 360 adult LTs were performed; 132 patients were
   eligible for 149 recruitment episodes into the trial, and 83 patients
   were recruited for 92 episodes. Of the 92,48 patient episodes were
   randomised to receive amBisome prophylaxis, and 44 to receive amB. IFI
   was uncommon, diagnosed for 3 patients in the amBisome group, and for 2
   in the amB group. Furthermore, Asperigillus was isolated on a single
   occasion during 92 episodes of prophylaxis. Fungal colonisation scores
   did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. There was a
   significant difference in the rates of survival to ICU discharge between
   the 2 groups (79.6\% amBisome vs. 59.5\% amB, P = 0.038). Renal function
   measures including creatinine clearance at commencement and conclusion
   of prophylaxis, and at 12 months post transplant were not statistically
   different between the 2 groups. Conclusion. The use of amphotericin B,
   liposomal or non-liposomal preparations at low doses, for prophylaxis of
   IFI in high-risk LT patients, is associated with a low incidence of
   serious fungal infection. In this randomised study, low-dose amBisome
   prophylaxis was associated with an increased likelihood of successful
   discharge from the ICU.}},

Abstract = {{The k-epsilon-S-p model, describing two-dimensional gas-solid two-phase

   two-phase turbulent flow behind a vertical backward-facing step is
   simulated numerically and the turbulent transport velocities of solid
   particles with high density behind the step are predicted. The numerical
   simulation is validated by comparing the results of the numerical
   calculation with two other two-phase turbulent flow models

Abstract = {{This paper utilizes existing statistics on adolescent suicide to examine
   adolescent suicide trends and patterns in Hong Kong for the period of
   1980 to 2003. Several trends and patterns are revealed from the
   analyses. First, there was a gradual rising trend where adolescent
   suicide rates in the 1990's and the early 2000's were higher than those
   in the 1980's. Second, suicide rates for adolescents aged 10-24 years
   were lower than those of other adult age groups. Third, although
   adolescent suicide rates in Hong Kong were lower than those reported in
   some English-speaking countries and Mainland China, the figures were
   higher than those reported in Taiwan. Fourth, suicide rates among
   teenagers in early adolescence were lower than those among adolescents
   in late adolescence. Fifth, although male adolescent suicide rates were
   in general higher than female adolescent suicide rates (10-24 age
   group), gender differences in suicide rates appeared to be moderated by
   age. Sixth, there was a gradual rising trend in adolescent proportional
   mortality rates for suicide since the 1990's. Seventh, proportional
   mortality rates for suicide among teenagers in early adolescence were
   lower than those among adolescents in late adolescence. Finally,
   although jumping from a height was a common method of adolescent
   suicide, there was a rising trend of using other methods, such as taking
   drugs, hanging and charcoal burning. The observed adolescent suicide
   phenomena are discussed in this study with reference to the
   socio-cultural context of Hong Kong.}},

Abstract = {{The Potrerillos minibasin of the La Popa basin, Mexico, is defined by
   the Carroza syncline and bounded by the El Gordo anticline and the La
   Popa salt weld. Stratigraphic geometries and facies distribution of the
   upper sandstone member of the Potrerillos Formation within the minibasin
   indicate that diapirism, shortening, and deposition were simultaneous
   and complexly interrelated during the Paleocene. The upper sandstone
   member is a regressive succession of marginal marine, siliciclastic
   deposits. Wave-dominated shoreface deposits consist of mudstone,
   siltstone, and sandstone and are interpreted to represent offshore to
   upper shoreface environments. Tide-dominated environments are
   heterogeneous and grouped into four broad classes based on the energy of
   the depositional environment. Lower delta-plain deposits range from
   mudstone to sandstone and are interpreted to represent channel,
   flood-plain, and lagoonal environments. Sedimentary structure
   orientations indicate asymmetrical, bidirectional paleocurrents with a
   dominant southeast trend parallel to regional structural trends.
   Unconformity-bounded strata onlap the El Gordo anticline, indicating
   syndepositional folding and control of the depositional system by
   detachment fold trends in the basin.
   The strata of the upper sandstone member are interpreted to contain six
   systems tracts that record three successive fourth-order eustatic
   cycles. These strata represent the deposits of a prograding,
   ebb-dominated deltaic system confined to the Carroza syncline. Maximum
   stratal accumulation in the synclinal hinge caused the migration of
   underlying salt into flanking structures. A balance between salt
   withdrawal and subsidence stabilized the position of both the synclinal
   hinge and the shoreline, leading to a positive deposition-subsidence
   feedback loop. During regional regression, the structural basin defined
   by the syncline formed a paleogeographic embayment and controlled
   shoreline evolution.}},

Abstract = {{In this chapter we address a complex set of optical phenomena linked to
   the spin dynamics of exciton polaritons in semiconductor microcavities.
   When optically created, polaritons inherit the spin and dipole moment
   from the exciting light. Their state can be fully characterized by a
   so-called ``pseudospin{''} accounting for both spin and dipole moment
   orientation. However, from the very beginning of their life in a
   microcavity, polaritons start changing their pseudospin state under
   effect of effective magnetic fields of different nature and due to
   scattering with acoustic phonons, defects, and other polaritons. This
   makes pseudospin dynamics of exciton polaritons rich and complex. It
   manifests itself in non-trivial changes in polarization of light emitted
   by the cavity versus time, pumping energy, pumping intensity and
   polarization. During the first years of theoretical research on
   exciton-polariton relaxation the polarization has been simply neglected.
   Later it has been understood that the energy and momentum-relaxation of
   exciton polaritons are spin-dependent. It is typically the case in the
   regime of stimulated scattering when the spin polarizations of initial
   and final polariton state have a huge effect on the scattering rate
   between these states. It appeared that critical conditions for polariton
   Bose-condensation are also polarization-dependent. In particular, the
   stimulation threshold (i.e. the pumping power needed to have a
   population exceeding 1 at the ground state of the lower polariton
   branch) has been experimentally shown to be lower under linear than
   under circular pumping. These experimental observations have stimulated
   the theoretical research toward understanding of mutually dependent
   polarization- and energy-relaxation mechanisms in microcavities. The
   authors of this chapter have been working on theoretical description of
   different specific effects of polariton spin-dynamics in microcavities
   for years. Here we attempted to put together all fragments and to
   formulate a general approach to the problem that would allow then to
   consider a variety of particular cases. We start from reminding the main
   spin-relaxation mechanisms known for free carriers and excitons. We then

   declined in the aged. Their Ig syntheses by B cells and the
   differentiation into plasma cells were diminished in vitro compared with
   those in adults. A rise of anti-pneumococcal IgM in sera of elderly
   persons was found with lower levels compared with those in adults after
   pneumococcal vaccination. Although diminished function itself of aged B
   cells surely exist, decline of the IgM memory B cell pool is expected to

Abstract = {{The array-based comparative genomic hybridization using microarrayed
   bacterial artificial chromosome clones allows high-resolution analysis
   of genome-wide copy number changes in tumors. To analyze the genetic
   alterations of primary lung adenocarcinoma in a high-throughput way, we
   used laser-capture microdissection of cancer cells and array comparative
   genomic hybridization focusing on 800 chromosomal loci containing
   cancer-related genes. We identified a large number of chromosomal
   numerical alterations, including frequent amplifications on 7p12,
   11q13,12q14-15, and 17q21, and two homozygous deletions on 9p21 and one
   on 8p23. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of multiple
   alterations revealed three subgroups of lung adenocarcinoma that were
   characterized by the accumulation of distinct genetic alterations and
   associated with smoking history and gender. The mutation status of the
   epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene was significantly
   associated with specific genetic alterations and supervised clustering
   analysis based on EGFR gene mutations elucidated a subgroup including
   all EGFR gene mutated tumors, which showed significantly shorter
   disease-free survival. Our results suggest that there exist multiple
   molecular carcinogenesis pathways in lung adenocarcinoma that may
   associate with smoking habits and gender, and that genetic cancer
   profiling will reveal previously uncharacterized genetic heterogeneity
   of cancer and be beneficial in estimating patient prognosis and
   discovering novel cancer-related genes including therapeutic targets.}},

Abstract = {{In an attempt to improve the sensitivity of detection in capillary
   electrophoresis (CE), a novel online sample-concentration method,
   full-capillary sample stacking (FCSS)/sweeping-micellar electrokinetic
   chromatography (sweeping-MEKC) mode, is proposed.
   Naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxaldehyde (NDA)-derivatized tryptophan and
   isoleucine were selected as model compounds. In the initial step, the
   weakly acidic compounds, dissolved in a low-conductivity buffer (35.1 mu
   S/cm; apparent ph (pH{*}) in a mixed solution of
   acetonitrile/methanol/water, 4.6), fill the entire capillary, two vials
   of a high-conductivity buffer (2.06 mS/cm; pH{*} 2.0) are placed on each
   end, and a negative polarity is then applied. Under these conditions,
   the direction of the electroosmotic flow (EOF) is toward the inlet.
   Meanwhile, the anionic analytes move in the reverse direction and are
   neutralized and stacked at the boundary of a dynamic pH-junction
   (between the sample matrix and the nonmicellar background solution
   (BGS)). When the sample concentration is completed, the BGS is quickly
   changed to solutions containing SDS-BGS for the subsequent separation.
   Since the mobility of SDS-analytes is then greater than the EOF, the
   following steps occur by the sweeping (for focusing) and MEKC (for
   separation) mode. Using these steps, a full-capillary sample
   injection/separation can be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{The basic electrical properties of Nb2O5 and Si-doped Nb2O5 (Nb2O5-Si)
   thin films, which were obtained by anodically oxidizing Nb in an H3PO4
   solution, were investigated using their current-voltage (I-V) and
   capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics with the aim of determining
   their electrical conduction mechanism. In the forward bias condition,
   Poole-Frenkel conduction is plausible for both Nb2O5 and Nb2O5-Si
   (Si-doping less than 19 at. \%). For the reverse bias condition, a
   Schottky-barrier is formed at the Au/Nb2O5 and/or Au/Nb2O5-Si interface
   (Si-doping less than 5 at. \%) because of the difference in the work
   function. The low frequency capacitance (1 kHz) increased with forward
   bias due to the lifetime of the carriers (electrons, holes, or both)
   injected into the Nb2O5 and/or Nb2O5-Si films. A schematic energy band
   diagram for Au/ Nb2O5/Nb and/or Au/Nb2O5-Si/Nb-Si (Si doping less than 5
   at. \%) capacitor structures is hypothesized in order to explain the I-V
   and C-V characteristics.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Aims: To evaluate the clinical value of multidetector row computed
   tomography (MDCT) as a pre-operative staging tool. for lymph node
   metastasis in patients with early gastric cancer (EGC).
   Methods: In 278 consecutive patients with EGC, Lymph node metastasis was
   evaluated pre-operatively with MDCT at a slice thickness of 2.5 mm (n =
   57), 5.0 mm (n = 188), or 7.5 mm (n = 33).
   Results: Overall accuracy of nodal category from N0 to N3 was 86\% for
   MDCT and 95\% for operative assessment. Regarding accuracy in detecting
   at Least one metastatic lymph node, area under curves (AUC) of receiver
   operating characteristics for 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5-mm slices and assessment
   during surgery were 0.87, 0.67 and 0.47, and 0.70, which were
   significantly different (P<0.0001). MDCT image with 2.5-mm could
   discriminate the presence of Lymph node metastasis with diagnostic
   accuracy: sensitivity 80\%; specificity 92\%; positive predictive value
   (PPV) 50\%; negative predictive value (NPV) 98\%, whereas assessment
   during surgery was as follows: sensitivity 65\%; specificity 98\%; PPV
   72\%; and NPV 97\%.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that pre-operative assessment with
   MDCT using thinner slices may detect at Least one lymph node metastasis
   as accurately as assessment during surgery for patients with EGC. (c)

Abstract = {{Individuals in a population susceptible to a disease may be represented
   as vertices in a network, with the edges that connect vertices
   representing social and/or spatial contact between individuals.
   Networks, which explicitly included six different patterns of connection
   between vertices, were created. Both scale-free networks and random
   graphs showed a different response in path level to increasing levels of
   clustering than regular lattices. Clustering promoted short path lengths
   in all network types, but randomly assembled networks displayed a
   logarithmic relationship between degree and path length; whereas this
   response was linear in regular lattices. In all cases, small-world
   models, generated by rewiring the connections of a regular lattice,
   displayed properties, which spanned the gap between random and regular
   networks.
   Simulation of a disease in these networks showed a strong response to
   connectance pattern, even when the number of edges and vertices were
   approximately equal. Epidemic spread was fastest, and reached the
   largest size, in scale-free networks, then ill random graphs. Regular
   lattices were the slowest to be infected, and rewired lattices were
   intermediate between these two extremes. Scale-free networks displayed
   the capacity to produce an epidemic even at a likelihood of infection,
   which was too low to produce an epidemic for the other network types.
   The interaction between the statistical properties of the network and
   the results of epidemic spread provides a useful tool for assessing the
   risk of disease spread in more realistic networks. (C) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Increased cell killing after exposure to low acute doses of X rays
   (0-0.5 Gy) has been demonstrated in cells of a number of human tumor
   cell lines. The mechanisms underlying this effect have been assumed to
   be related to a threshold dose above which DNA repair efficiency or
   fidelity increases. We have used cells of two radioresistant human tumor
   cell lines, one that shows increased sensitivity to low radiation doses
   (T98G) and one that does not (U373), to investigate the DNA damage
   response at low doses in detail and to establish whether there is a
   discontinuous dose response or threshold in activation of any important
   mediators of this response. In the two cell lines studied, we found a
   sensitive, linear dose response in early signaling and transduction
   pathways between doses of 0.1 and 2 Gy with no evidence of a threshold
   dose. We demonstrate that ATM-dependent signaling events to downstream
   targets including TP53, CHK1 and CHK2 occur after doses as low as 0.2 Gy
   and that these events promote an effective damage response. Using
   chemical inhibition of specific DNA repair enzymes, we show that
   inhibition of DNA-PK-dependent end joining has relatively little effect
   at low (< 1 Gy) doses in hyper-radiosensitive cells and that at these
   doses the influence of RAD51-mediated repair events may increase, based
   on high levels of RAD51/BRCA2 repair foci. These data do not support a
   threshold model for activation of DNA repair in hyper-radiosensitive
   cells but do suggest that the balance of repair enzyme activity may
   change at low doses. (c) 2005 by Radiation Research Society.}},

Abstract = {{The properties of aqueous concentrated polymer solutions, containing
   sulphite lignin and a high-molecular acrylic polymer, were studied by
   FT-IR spectroscopy, rheology, as well as by determining their

   blends were structured liquids owing to the formation of a
   semi-interpenetrating polymer network. The non-linear dependence of the
   viscosity logarithm oil inverse temperature, as well as the values of
   the activation energy of the viscous flow testified a major contribution
   of the inter-polymer H-bonds to the cohesion strength of the spatial
   network. At the same time, the adhesiveness of polymer aqueous blends
   largely depended on the content of a long-chain acrylic polymer present
   in them. The local increase in structure viscosity with increasing shear
   stress made it possible to regard the flow of the aqueous blends of
   polymers as a reversible chemical reaction, proceeding directly with the
   formation of new physicochemical bonds between interpolymer

Abstract = {{The use of field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS)
   has rapidly grown with the advent of commercial FAIMS systems coupled to
   mass spectrometry. However, many fundamental aspects of FAIMS remain
   obscure, hindering its technological improvement and expansion of
   analytical utility. Recently, we developed a comprehensive numerical
   simulation approach to FAIMS that can handle any device geometry and
   operating conditions. The formalism was originally set up in one
   dimension for a uniform gas flow and limited to ideal asymmetric voltage
   waveforms. Here we extend the model to account for a realistic gas flow
   velocity distribution in the analytical gap, axial ion diffusion, and
   waveform imperfections (e.g., noise and ripple). The nonuniformity of
   the gas flow velocity profile has only a minor effect, slightly
   improving resolution. Waveform perturbations are significant even at
   very low levels, in some cases similar to 0.01\% of the nominal voltage.
   These perturbations always improve resolution and decrease sensitivity,
   a trade-off controllable by variation of noise or ripple amplitude. This
   trade-off is physically inferior to that obtained by adjusting the gap
   width and/or asymmetric waveform frequency. However, the disadvantage is
   negligible when the perturbation period is much shorter than the
   residence time in FAIMS, and ripple adjustment appears to offer a
   practical method for modifying FAIMS resolution.}},

Abstract = {{The cold-active alpha-amylase from the Antarctic bacterium
   Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis (AHA) is the largest known multidomain
   enzyme that displays reversible thermal unfolding (around 30 degrees C)
   according to a two-state mechanism. Transverse urea gradient gel
   electrophoresis (TUG-GE) from 0 to 6.64 M was performed under various
   conditions of temperature (3 degrees C to 70 degrees C) and pH (7.5 to
   10.4) in the absence or presence of Ca2+ and/or Tris (competitive
   inhibitor) to identify possible low-stability domains. Contrary to
   previous observations by strict thermal unfolding, two transitions were
   found at low temperature (12 degrees C). Within the duration of the
   TUG-GE, the structures undergoing the first transition showed slow
   interconversions between different conformations. By comparing the
   properties of the native enzyme and the N12R mutant, the active site was
   shown to be part of the least stable structure in the enzyme. The
   stability data supported a model of cooperative unfolding of structures
   forming the active site and independent unfolding of the other more
   stable protein domains. In light of these findings for AHA, it will be
   valuable to determine if active-site instability is a general feature of
   heat-labile enzymes from psychrophiles. Interestingly, the enzyme was
   also found to refold and rapidly regain activity after being heated at
   70 degrees C for 1 h in 6.5 M urea. The study has identified.
   fundamental new properties of AHA and extended our understanding of

Abstract = {{A simplified model of polypeptide chains was designed and studied by

   assumption was the lattice approximation for the chains. We used a (310)
   lattice, which was found useful for studying properties of proteins. The
   force field used consisted of a long-range contact potential between
   amino-acid residues and a local preference for forming alpha-helical
   states. The chain consisted of two kinds of residues: hydrophilic (P)
   and hydrophobic (H) ones forming model helical septets -HHPPHPP- in a
   sequence. The chains were placed near an impenetrable surface with a
   square hole in it. The size of the hole was comparable or smaller than
   the size of a chain. The properties of these model chains were
   determined using the Monte-Carlo simulation method. During the
   simulations, translocation of the chain through the hole in the wall was
   observed. The influence of the chain length, the temperature differences
   on both sides of the wall and the force field on the chain properties

Abstract = {{Development was monitored throughout the entire life span of silver
   birch (Betula pendula Roth.) leaves. The focus was on senescence-related
   changes in photosynthesis and gene expression. The youngest fully
   developed leaves were compared with older senescing leaves in two silver
   birch lines: the wild-type line R and a late-senescing line R3.1. Line
   R3.1 was found among transgenic lines produced with a plasmid containing
   sense-RbcS and nptlII under the control of the 35S CaMV promoter.
   Compared with the wild type, line R3.1 showed no general change in the
   mRNA levels of RbcS or Rubisco protein; therefore, it can be considered
   a line whose phenotype is due to insertional mutagenesis. Leaf
   senescence earlier in line R than in line R3.1. Senescence was
   characterized by declining photosynthesis as indicated by decreases in
   chlorophyll fluorescence, the amount and activity of Rubisco, and the
   level of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase small
   subunit (RbcS]) mRNA. Some well-known senescence-associated genes (SAGs)
   encoding cysteine proteinases (Cyp1, Cyp2) and a pathogenesis-related
   gene (Pr1) were associated with leaf senescence. The expression pattern
   of Cyp1 indicated that it could serve as a molecular marker of leaf
   senescence in silver birch. Several genes related to energy metabolism,
   antioxidants and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis showed enhanced expression
   during leaf senescence. A distinct pattern in transcript abundance
   during leaf development was revealed for some of the identified SAGs.}},

Abstract = {{The TopHat experiment was designed to measure the anisotropy in the

   to 30 degrees and the thermal emission from both Galactic and

   spanning frequencies from 175 to 630 GHz. The telescope was a compact, 1
   m, on-axis Cassegrain telescope designed to scan the sky at a fixed
   elevation of 78 degrees. The radiometer used cryogenic bolometers
   coupled to a single feed horn via a dichroic filter system. The
   observing strategy was intended to efficiently cover a region 48 degrees
   in diameter centered on the south polar cap with a highly cross-linked
   and redundant pattern with nearly uniform sky coverage. The Long
   Duration Balloon flight over Antarctica in 2001 January surveyed about
   6\% of the sky. Here we describe the design of the instrument and the
   achieved in-flight performance and provide a brief discussion of the

Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate computed
   tomography (CT) enhancement characteristics for a new iodinated
   macromolecular contrast medium (MMCM), PEG12000-Gen4-triiodo, for
   angiograpbic effect and for assessment of abnormal vascular permeability
   in cancer.
   Materials and Methods: Time persistence of angiographic effect was
   evaluated on rat CT images acquired over 30 minutes using the iodinated
   polyethyleneglycol- (PEG) based macromolecule. Dynamic CT imaging after
   PEG12000-Gen4-triiodo-enhancement in tumor-bearing rats was used to
   quantitatively estimate plasma volume and microvascular transendothelial
   permeability for both tumor and normal soft tissue. Using identical
   doses of iodine, 300 mg iodine/kg, blood curves for this MMCM and
   iohexol were compared.
   Results: Serial whole-body CT angiograms using PEG12000-Gen4-triiodo
   showed diagnostic vascular detail through 20 minutes, and the blood
   enhancement curve was higher and more persistent than with
   small-molecular iohexol. Permeability estimates were Significantly (P <
   0.02; paired t test) higher in tumors (48.2 +/- 18.1 mu L/min(-1) 100
   mL(-1)) than in muscle (2.5 +/- 5.7 mu L/min(-1) 100 mL(-1)).
   Conclusions: Use of PEG-based MMCM for experimental CT allowed for a
   persistent angiographic enhancement and for quantitative estimation of
   tumor microvascular characteristics.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{583}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Primary alkyl halides RI were reduced at smooth palladium electrodes (as
   well as palladiated copper, nickel, platinum and glassy carbon) in
   organic solvents such as dimethylformamide, propylene carbonate and
   acetonitrile in the presence of tetraalkylammonium salts. Under these
   experimental conditions all iodo derivatives exhibited a very large
   cathodic activation compared to the processes at more conventional
   materials like bare platinum and glassy carbon. The observed shifts
   towards less cathodic potentials were so large that in all cases the
   first reduction step turned to a diffusion one electron process. Thus
   under the given conditions, the cathodic reduction of RI's occurred in
   two well separated one electron steps, suggesting therefore the
   formation of alkyl radicals as such. Microcoulometry at the level of the
   first step confirmed that the reaction is monoelectronic with a
   quantitative loss of iodide. The transient formation of free radicals is
   also supported by GC/MS results (presence of R-R and R(-H) type
   compounds after electrolysis). Finally ESR experiments confirm the
   transient formation of alkyl radicals which were trapped by nitrones.

Abstract = {{The dissociation of water adsorbed on the surface of NiO was
   investigated by using the semi-empirical SCF MO method MSINDO.
   Simulations were based on embedded cluster models representing the (100)
   surface, with and without a monatomic step. The angle formed between the
   metal adsorption site and the O-H bond associated with water has been
   found to be critical to the energetics of the dissociation process.
   Based on this criterion, it was shown that water dissociation is
   favorable on the stepped surface, but highly unlikely on the planar
   surface. In addition, the activation energy required for water
   dissociation in a monatomic NiO step was considerably lower than for
   dissociation at the planar surface. The high activation energy
   associated with water dissociation on the planar surface is attributed
   to the rigidity of the NiO lattice.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To compare the distribution of estradiol levels between women
   with a hysterectomy and ovarian conservation and women with an intact
   uterus.
   Methods A large cross-sectional study of women aged between 40 and 69
   years, residing in Melbourne, Australia. Estradiol levels were available
   for 152 women with a hysterectomy and ovarian conservation and 1423
   women with an intact uterus. All of the women were `never-users' of
   hormone replacement therapy.
   Results For women under 55 years of age, we observed that those with a
   hysterectomy and ovarian conservation had slightly higher estradiol
   levels compared with those with an intact uterus after adjustment for
   age, body mass index, smoking status and alcohol intake (ratio of
   geometric means of estradiol levels= 1.24; 95\% confidence interval =
   1.00-1.53). For women who were 55 years or greater, the distribution of
   estradiol levels varied little by hysterectomy status.
   Conclusions Our data do not suggest that women with hysterectomy and
   ovarian conservation have markedly different estradiol levels compared
   to women with an intact uterus.}},

   X chromosome and the autosomes in Drosophila melanogaster. This may in
   part be due to differences in the effective population size between the
   two chromosome sets and in part to the hemizygosity of the X chromosome
   in Drosophila males. These and other factors may lead to differences
   both in the gene complements of the X and the autosomes and in the
   properties of the genes residing on those chromosomes. Here we show that
   codon bias and recombination rate are correlated strongly and negatively
   on the X chromosome, and that this correlation cannot be explained by
   indirect relationships with other known determinants of codon bias. This
   is in dramatic contrast to the weak positive correlation found on the
   autosomes. We explored possible explanations for these patterns, which
   required a comprehensive analysis of the relationships among multiple
   genetic properties such as protein length and expression level. This
   analysis highlights conserved features of coding sequence evolution on
   the X and the autosomes and illuminates interesting differences between
   these two chromosome sets.}},

Abstract = {{Light models for vegetation canopies based on the turbid medium analogy
   are usually limited by the basic assumption of random foliage dispersion
   in the canopy space. The objective of this paper was to assess the
   effect of three possible sources of non-randomness in tree canopies on
   light interception properties. For this purpose, four three-dimensional
   (3-D) digitized trees and four theoretical canopies - one random and
   three built from fractal rules - were used to compute canopy structure
   parameters and light interception, namely the sky-vault averaged STAR
   (Silhouette to Total Area Ratio). STAR values were computed from (1)
   images of the 3-D plants, and (2) from a 3-D turbid medium model using
   space discretization at different scales. For all trees, departure from
   randomness was mainly due to the spatial variations in leaf area density
   within the canopy volume. Indeed STAR estimations, based on turbid
   medium assumption, using the finest space discretization were very close
   to STAR values computed from the plant images. At this finest scale,
   foliage dispersion was slightly clumped, except one theoretical fractal
   canopy, which showed a marked regular dispersion. Taking into account a
   non-infinitely small leaf size, whose effect is theoretically to shorten
   self-shading, had a minor effect on STAR computations. STAR values
   computed from the 3-D turbid medium were very sensitive to plant
   lacunarity, a parameter introduced in the context of fractal studies to
   characterize the distribution of gaps in porous media at different
   scales. This study shows that 3-D turbid medium models based on space
   discretization are able to give correct estimation of light interception
   by 3-D isolated trees, provided that the 3-D grid is properly defined,
   that is, discretization maximizes plant lacunarity.}},

Journal = {{RADIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To prospectively investigate the relationship between
   myocardial contractile impairment and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy
   measured at cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in patients with
   hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) caused by the substitution of aspartic
   acid 175 with asparagine (ie, Asp175Asn mutation) in the
   alpha-tropomyosin gene (TPM1).
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study protocol was approved by the hospital
   ethics committee, and all subjects gave written informed consent. LV
   mass, maximal LV wall thickness, and myocardial fractional thickening
   during systole were measured at cine MR imaging in 24 subjects (11 male,
   13 female; mean age, 42 years; age range, 17-68 years) with the
   Asp175Asn mutation in TPM1 and in 17 healthy volunteers (eight men, nine
   women; mean age, 38 years; age range, 23-60 years). The proportion of
   hypokinetic LV segments was calculated as the number of LV segments with
   fractional thickening of less than 30\% divided by the total number of
   segments measured. Anthropometric and biochemical correlates of LV
   hypertrophy were determined. Univariate and multiple linear regression
   analyses were used to investigate the association of the proportion of
   hypokinetic segments and other correlates of LV hypertrophy with LV mass
   and maximal wall thickness.
   RESULTS: The proportion of hypokinetic segments was higher in patients
   with HCM than in control subjects (37\% +/- 20 {[}standard deviation] vs
   12\% +/- 12, P < .001). In stepwise multiple regression analysis, the
   proportion of hypokinetic segments accounted for 42\% (P < .001); the LV
   end-diastolic volume, for 24\% (P = .003); and male sex, for 10\% (P =
   .014) of the variability in LV mass in patients with HCM. The proportion
   of hypokinetic LV segments, which accounted for 48\% of the variability
   in LV maximal wall thickness (P < .001), was the only variable
   significantly associated with maximal wall thickness.
   CONCLUSION: The extent of myocardial contractile impairment is strongly
   and independently related to LV mass and maximal wall thickness in
   patients with HCM attributable to the Asp175Asn mutation in TPM1. (c)

   and nondisabled Subjects; however, these differences were not
   statistically significant. Subjective levels of arousal were also
   compared between SCI and nondisabled control subjects. Both vibratory
   and manual clitoral stimulation resulted in significantly increased

Abstract = {{The non-coding portion of human genome is punctuated by a large number
   of multispecies conserved sequence (MCS) elements with largely unknown
   function. We demonstrate that MCSs are unevenly distributed in human
   introns with the majority of relatively short introns (< 9 kb long)
   displaying no or a few MCSs and that MCS density reaching up to 10\% of
   total size in longer introns. After correction for intron length, MCSs
   were found to be enriched within genes involved in development and
   transcription, whereas depleted in immune response loci. Moreover, many
   central nervous system tissues show a preferential expression of
   MCS-rich genes and MCS enrichment significantly correlates with gene
   functional complexity in terms of distinct protein domains. Analysis of
   human-mouse orthologous pairs indicated a significant association
   between intronic MCS density and conservation of protein sequence,
   promoter regions and untranslated sequences. Moreover, MCS density
   correlates with the predicted occurrence of human-mouse conserved
   alternative splicing events. These observations suggest that evolution
   acts on human genes as integrated units of coding and regulatory
   capacity and that functional complexity might represent a major source
   of negative selection on non-coding sequences. To substantiate our
   result, we also searched previously experimentally identified intronic
   regulatory elements and indicate that about half of these sequences map
   to an MCS; in particular, support to the notion whereby mutations in
   MCSs can result in human genetic diseases is provided, because three
   previously identified intronic pathological variations were found to
   occur within MCSs, and human disease and cancer genes were found
   significantly enriched in MCSs.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of this article is on the role of the transnational capitalist
   class (TCC) in and around architecture in the production and marketing
   of iconic buildings and spaces, in global or world cities. The TCC is
   conceptualized in terms of four fractions: (1) Those who own and/or and
   control the major transnational corporations and their local affiliates
   (corporate fraction). In architecture these are the major architectural,
   architecture-engineering and architecture-developer-real estate firms.
   In comparison with the major global consumer goods, energy and financial
   corporations the revenues of the biggest firms in the architecture
   industry are quite small. However, their importance for the built
   environment and their cultural importance, especially in cities, far
   outweighs their relative lack of financial and corporate muscle. (2)
   Globalizing politicians and bureaucrats (state fraction). These are the
   politicians and bureaucrats at all levels of administrative power and
   responsibility who actually decide what gets built where, and how
   changes to the built environment are regulated. (3) Globalizing
   professionals (technical fraction). The members of this fraction range
   from the leading technicians centrally involved in the structural
   features of new building to those responsible for the education of
   students and the public in architecture. (4) Merchants and media
   (consumerist fraction). These are the people who are responsible for the
   marketing of architecture in all its manifestations. (There is obviously
   some overlap between the membership of these fractions.). My conclusion
   is that many global and aspiring global cities have looked to iconic
   architecture as a prime strategy of urban intervention, often in the
   context of rehabilitation of depressed areas. The attempt to identify
   the agents most responsible for this transformation, namely the TCC, and
   to explain how they operate, suggests that deliberately iconic
   architecture is becoming a global phenomenon, specifically a central
   urban manifestation of the culture-ideology of consumerism.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{3109-3121}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Highly informative genetic markers, such as simple sequence repeats
   (SSRs), can be used to directly measure pollen flow by parentage
   analysis. However, mistyping (i.e. false inference of genotypes caused
   by the occurrence of null alleles, mutations, and detection errors) can
   lead to substantial biases in the estimates obtained. Using computer
   simulations, we evaluated a direct method for estimating pollen
   immigration using SSR markers and a paternity exclusion approach. This
   method accounts for mistyping and does not rely on assumptions about the
   distribution of male reproductive success. If ignored, even minor rates
   of mistyping (1.5\%) resulted in overestimating pollen immigration by up
   to 150\%. When we required at least two mismatching loci before
   excluding candidate fathers from paternity, the resulting pollen
   immigration estimates had small biases for rates of mistyping up to
   4.5\%. Requiring at least three mismatches for exclusion was needed to
   minimize the upward biases of pollen immigration caused by rates of
   mistyping up to 10.5\%. The minimum number of highly variable SSR loci
   needed to minimize cryptic gene flow and obtain reliable estimates of
   pollen immigration varied from five to seven for a sampling scheme
   applicable to most conifers (i.e. when paternal haplotypes can be
   unambiguously determined). Between five and nine highly variable SSR
   loci were needed for a more general sampling scheme that is applicable
   to all diploid seed plants. With moderately variable SSR markers,
   consistently accurate estimates of pollen immigration could be obtained
   only for rates of mistyping up to 4.5\%. We developed the POLLEN FLOW
   (PFL) computer program which can be used to obtain unbiased and precise
   estimates of pollen immigration under a wide range of conditions,
   including population sizes as large as 600 parents and mistyping rates
   as high as 10.5\%.}},

Abstract = {{Aluminum (At) toxicity is a major limiting factor of crop production in
   acidic soils. Medicago truncatula Gaertn., a close relative of alfalfa
   (M. sativa L.), is negatively affected by Al toxicity. The objective of
   this study was to assess the variation for Al tolerance among M.
   truncatula accessions held in the USDA National Plant Germplasm System,
   with the long-term goal of identifying Al tolerance genes to be used for
   alfalfa improvement. Three hundred twenty-one accessions of M.
   truncatula, from 20 different countries, were screened for Al tolerance
   in a hydroponics approach. Seed from each M. truncatula accession were
   surface sterilized and germinated before being grown in hydroponics. Ten
   germinated seedlings were transferred to a hydroponics culture tank
   containing modified Blaydes medium without aluminum and ten were
   transferred to a second tank containing modified Blaydes medium with 50
   mu M Al. Seedlings were grown for 5 d and root length was measured.
   Relative root growth in Al medium was used as a measure of All
   tolerance. Relative root growth varied from 0.35 to 1.09, indicating
   that sufficient variation exists within this collection of M. truncatula
   accessions to select sensitive and tolerant accessions, which could be
   used to identify QTL for Al tolerance, the first step in a map-based
   cloning approach to discover Al tolerance genes.}},

Abstract = {{A surgical protocol in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome
   (OSAS) is presented. Eighteen patients with particular craniofacial
   characteristics consisting in maxillomandibular retroposition or
   retromandibulism underwent bimaxillary advancement by way of Lefort I
   and bilateral sagittal ramus osteotomies. Adjunctive procedures
   (genioplasty, uvuloplasty, and glossoplasty) were performed in the same
   surgical procedure. In all cases, the patients were evaluated before and
   6 months after surgery by a physical examination, Delaire cephalometric
   analysis, and polysomnography. Surgery was considered successful when
   the postoperative apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) was less than 15/h and with
   at least a 50\% reduction of the initial index. The surgical success
   rate was 84\%. AHI decreased from 54/h (+/- 20.7) to 9.66/h (+/- 6.67).
   The results of this study indicate that successful surgical treatment by
   maxillomandibular advancement with adjunctive procedures at the same
   operative time is efficient with a high percentage of success when
   patients are clearly selected.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the incidence of hypermobility in young female
   netball players and to determine the relation between hypermobility,
   previous injuries sustained in netball or other sports, and the use of
   protective equipment.
   Methods: Under 16 year old female netball players from a local suburban
   netball association were assessed for joint hypermobility using the
   validated Beighton score ( 0 - 9, with higher scores indicating
   increasing hypermobility). Player profiles and details of sporting
   injuries, both netball and non-netball, and the use of protective
   equipment were gathered by means of a self completed questionnaire.
   Parental and child consent was obtained.
   Results: Two hundred netball players were recruited for the study.
   Twenty one percent of the subjects with a Beighton hypermobility score
   of 0 - 2 had sustained previous netball injuries compared with 37\% with
   Beighton scores of 3 - 4, and 43\% with scores of 5 - 9. These
   differences were significant ( p< 0.025). Injuries were most common in
   the ankle ( 42\%), knee ( 27\%), and fingers (15\%). Thirty nine players
   (19\%) wore protective equipment, and within this group 30 (77\%) had
   sustained previous injuries. No association was detected between
   hypermobile joints and non-netball sporting injuries.
   Conclusions: In this study hypermobility was significantly associated
   with an increased prevalence of injuries in junior netball players. A
   targeted interventional approach may help to reduce injuries in this
   susceptible group.}},

Abstract = {{The botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are category A biothreat agents which
   have been the focus of intensive efforts to develop vaccines and
   antibody-based prophylaxis and treatment. Such approaches must take into
   account the extensive BoNT sequence variability; the seven BoNT
   serotypes differ by up to 70\% at the amino acid level. Here, we have
   analyzed 49 complete published sequences of BoNTs and show that all
   toxins also exhibit variability within serotypes ranging between 2.6 and
   31.6\%. To determine the impact of such sequence differences on immune
   recognition, we studied the binding and neutralization capacity of six
   BoNT serotype A (BoNT/A) monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to BoNT/A1 and
   BoNT/A2, which differ by 10\% at the amino acid level. While all six
   MAbs bound BoNT/A1 with high affinity, three of the six MAbs showed a
   marked reduction in binding affinity of 500- to more than 1,000-fold to
   BoNT/A2 toxin. Binding results predicted in vivo toxin neutralization;
   NlAbs or MAb combinations that potently neutralized A1 toxin but did not
   bind A2 toxin had minimal neutralizing capacity for A2 toxin. This was
   most striking for a combination of three binding domain MAbs which
   together neutralized > 40,000 mouse 50\% lethal doses (LD(50)s) of A1
   toxin but less than 500 LD(50)s of A2 toxin. Combining three MAbs which
   bound both At and A2 toxins potently neutralized both toxins. We
   conclude that sequence variability exists within all toxin serotypes,
   and this impacts monoclonal antibody binding and neutralization. Such
   subtype sequence variability must be accounted for when generating and
   evaluating diagnostic and therapeutic antibodies.}},

   for pT2 disease). Benign parenchymal exposure was identified in 16
   patients (14.5\%). Six of these patients had concomitant negative
   surgical margins for cancer. The positive margin rate for patients with
   Stage pT2 disease was 22.2\% in group 1 and 5.9\% in group 2. The
   positive margin rate was 34.8\%, 13.6\%, and 13.8\% for bilateral,
   unilateral, and non-nerve-sparing procedures, respectively.
   Conclusions. LRP offers comparable surgical margins to those of reported
   open prostatectomy series. Careful pathologic review provides feedback
   so that technique modifications can be implemented and the positive
   margin rates improved further. A low, but significant, positive margin
   or benign parenchymal exposure rate in pT2 disease indicates room for
   improvement in the surgical technique. The presence of benign glands at
   the inked margin is not routinely reported but does provide an
   additional parameter of surgical adequacy.}},

Abstract = {{This study realizes the conceptual method to predict combustion
   instability in actual full-scale combustion chamber of rocket engines by
   experimental tests with model (sub-scale) chamber. The model chamber was
   designed based on the methodologies proposed in the previous work
   regarding geometrical dimensions and operating conditions, and hot-fire
   test procedures were followed to obtain stability boundaries. From the
   experimental tests, two instability regions are presented by the
   parameters of combustion-chamber pressure and mixture (oxidizer/fuel)
   ratio, which are customary for combustor designers. It is found that
   instability characteristics in the chamber with the adopted jet
   injectors can be explained by the correlation between the characteristic
   burning or mixing time and the characteristic acoustic time. In each
   instability region, dynamic behaviors of flames are investigated to
   verify the hydrodynamically-derived characteristic lengths of the jet
   injectors. Large-amplitude pressure oscillation observed in upper
   instability region is found to be generated by lifted-off flames.}},

Abstract = {{This article suggests that the `Disputation of Ceuta' provides a link
   between the Christian anti-Jewish polemical discourse of the twelfth
   century, produced largely for internal consumption, and the active
   inissionising of the thirteenth century. Having purportedly taken place
   in the North African port of Ceuta between a Christian merchant from
   Genoa and a Jew from Ceuta at the time of Almohad rule (1179), the
   disputation displays the signs of a major shift in the Christian contra
   Judaeos strategies. Unlike other twelfth-century works of this genre,
   which address a variety of points central to Jewish-Christian debate,
   the Ceuta Disputation is remarkably consistent in its emphasis oil one
   particular issue - that of the coming of the Messiah. The messianic
   content of this disputation thus foreshadows the central thrust of the
   thirteenth-century Dominican mission to the Jews, which finds its
   fullest expression at the Barcelona Disputation of 1263. The article
   explains the prominence of this theme in the period by suggesting that
   the extraordinary emphasis on the Messiah in the Ceuta Disputation could
   be the result of the Christian protagonist's meeting with the North
   African Jew face-to-face and discovering that the Messianic promise was
   a subject of considerable interest for his opponent. More importantly,
   regardless of whether the discussion in Ceuta had or had not taken
   place, the new Christian attitude towards anti-Jewish polemics expressed
   in the Disputation's text was most likely inspired by real-life
   discussions between Jews and Christians. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This study is about changes in land use and interactions of land use
   change and livelihoods in the Chagga farming system on the slopes of Mt.
   Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. An aerial photo interpretation and fragmentation
   analysis of the years 1961, 1982 and 2000 was conducted covering
   approximately the Kirua Vunjo Division, a transect of 152 km 2 from the
   forest reserve edge to the plains. Earlier changes were traced from
   literature review. The results show the expansion of cultivation to more
   marginal land down the slope, the disappearance and extreme
   fragmentation of bush land and appearance and expansion of settlements.
   The home garden area has experienced some specific internal change, but
   has not expanded down the slope. In the 1960s there were small open
   fields and patches of grazing lands amongst home gardens. In the 1980s
   the area was more uniformly covered by homegardens. Since then it has
   become patchy again as new homesteads have been built on subdivided
   farms and more food is produced on the higher slopes. Population
   pressure and the ensuing expansion of agriculture to more marginal land,
   intensification of the homegarden system, together with climate changes
   affecting the water supplies, have caused changes in farmers'
   livelihoods. As land scarcity now hinders expansion of agriculture, farm
   size has seriously decreased, common resources have become scarce, and
   prices of coffee in the world market remain low, farmers are trying to
   intensify and diversify their farm production. Local initiative is
   leading to change, but the locally conceived alternatives are too few
   and lack integrated approaches of technical agricultural research,
   economic analysis, and policy studies and reforms. Non-agricultural
   activities and paid employment are becoming increasingly important.
   However, due to considerable entry barriers to remunerable off-farm
   jobs, not all households enjoy equal access to attractive non-farm
   opportunities. The future welfare of the area will depend on increasing
   the marketable knowledge and skills of the population that will enable
   it to become integrated in the economy of the region and the country.

Abstract = {{Celiac disease is a multifactorial disease with complex genetics. Both
   HLA and non-HLA genes contribute to the genetic component, but recent
   findings suggest that the importance of non-HLA genes might have been

   identified in celiac disease. In contrast to the meager knowledge
   regarding non-HILA genes, we have acquired a detailed understanding
   about which HLA genes are predisposing for disease, and how they are
   involved in the pathogenesis. This knowledge might pave the road for
   novel treatments for the disease. The role of HLA as a necessary, but
   not sufficient, genetic factor can moreover be used for diagnostic
   purposes to exclude a celiac disease diagnosis. The applicability of HLA
   genotyping is particularly useful for excluding celiac disease in family
   members or risk groups with fairly unbiased distribution of HLA alleles

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Germination is very important for plant
   establishment in arid regions. The strategies taken by halophytes during
   the seed germination stage to adapt to saline environments in an arid
   zone were investigated in Suaeda physophora (euhalophyte), Haloxylon
   ammodendron (xero-halophyte) and Haloxylon persicum (xerophyte).
   Methods Seeds of S. physophora, H. ammodendron and H. persicum were
   exposed to a range of iso-osmotic NaCl and PEG solutions. Seed
   germination in, and recovery germination from, high NaCl were recorded.
   The effects of iso-osmotic NaCl and PEG on seed water uptake and changes
   in ion content were measured. In addition, the structure of seeds and
   Na+ distribution in the seed coat and embryos of dry seeds were
   investigated.
   Key Results The relative increase in fresh weight of germinating seeds
   was markedly reduced in -2.24 MPa PEG compared with that in -2.24 MPa
   NaCl, while the opposite trend was found in concentration of K+ during
   the initial 9 h for all species. Haloxylon ammodendron and S. physophora
   had a higher recovery germination from -3.13 MPa NaCl compared with H.
   persicum. Seeds of all species had no endosperm. More Na+ was
   compartmentalized in the seed coats of the two halophytic species
   compared with that in the xerophyte H. persicum.
   Conclusions The effect of NaCl on seed germination was due to both
   osmotic stress and ion toxicity for the three species. High soil
   salinity and a high content of Na+ in seeds may induce more seeds to
   remain ungerminated in S. physophora and H. ammodendron. Morphological
   structure and adaptation to salinity during seed germination may
   determine the geographical distribution of H. ammodendron and S.
   physophora in certain saline regions.}},

Abstract = {{Elimination capacity (EC) is frequently used as a performance and design
   criterion for vapor-phase biofilters without further verification of the
   microbial quantity and activity. This study was conducted to investigate
   how biofilters respond to high pollutant loadings and ultimately how
   this affects the EC of the biofilter. Two identical laboratory-scale
   biofilters were maintained at an initial toluene loading rate of 46
   gm(3) h(-1) for a period of 24 days. After the initial biofilm
   development stage, the loading rates were increased to 91 g m(3) h(-1)
   and 137 g m(-3) h(-1), respectively. Following a short period of
   pseudo-steady state, toluene removal efficiencies rapidly declined in
   both biofilters, with a concurrent decline in both critical and maximum
   ECs. The decline was mainly due to deterioration in the biodegradation
   activity of the biofilm and a decline in the toluene-degrading bacterial
   population within the biofilm phase. The findings imply that high
   toluene loadings accelerated the deterioration in overall performance
   due to a rapid accumulation of inactive biomass. As a result, care must
   be used when relying on EC values for biofilter design and operational
   purposes, since the values do not appropriately reflect the temporal
   changes in biodegradation activity and active biomass quantities that
   can occur in biofilters subjected to high inlet loadings.}},

Abstract = {{Mutations in the myosin-VIIa (MY07a) gene cause human Usher disease,
   characterized by hearing impairment and progressive retinal
   degeneration. In the retina, myosin-VIla is highly expressed in the
   retinal pigment epithelium, where it plays a role in the positioning of
   melanosomes and other digestion organelles. Using a human cultured
   retinal pigmented epithelia cell line, ARPE- 19, as a model system, we
   have found that a population of myosin-VIIa is associated with cathepsin
   D- and Rab7-positive lysosomes. Association of myosin-VIla with
   lysosomes was Rab7 independent, as dominant negative and dominant active
   versions of Rab7 did not disrupt myosin-VIIa recruitment to lysosomes.
   Association of myosinVIla with lysosomes was also independent of the
   actin and microtubule cytoskeleton. Myosin-VIIa copurified with
   lysosomes on density gradients, and fractionation and extraction
   experiments suggested that it was tightly associated with the lysosome
   surface. These studies suggest that myosin-VIIa is a lysosome motor.}},

Abstract = {{New insights into the mating systems of common marmosets suggest that
   they are mainly monogamous, although polygyny and polyandry occasionally
   occur. Long-term monitoring of wild common marmosets has shown that some
   reports of polygynous groups (i.e., groups that contain more than one
   reproducing female) in fact indicate an unbalanced reproductive output
   associated with extragroup copulation. In this study we describe the
   behavioral and hormonal profiles of common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)
   females living in three wild monogamous groups Q, PBf, and T), varying
   from five to 11 individuals, at Nisia Floresta field station, RN,
   Brazil. The mating system of the groups was previously characterized in
   terms of affiliative, sexual, and mate-guarding behaviors. Behavioral
   data were collected once a week, and fecal samples were collected at
   least twice a week for 10-16 months, depending on the group. A
   preferential allogrooming relationship was recorded between dominant
   males and females. Under field conditions the reproductive inhibition of
   subordinate females appears to be more behavioral than hormonal, since
   subordinate females of the three groups ovulated and two conceived
   during the study. In these cases, the subordinate and dominant females
   reproduced 1 month apart, and infanticide (one case confirmed and one
   suspected) appeared to be part of the reproductive strategy of dominant
   females. Following the infanticide, ovarian inhibition (group T) or
   emigration and return to the natal group (group PBf) were observed. In
   the third group (Q) the subordinate female showed hormonal profiles
   compatible with pregnancy, but no infants were seen. These findings
   reflect the different alternatives that wild subordinate common marmoset
   females use to reproduce.}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal lipid nanoparticle dispersions have been characterized by
   rheological measurements using two different nanostructured lipid
   carrier (NLC)-based formulations intended for cosmetic application of
   substances like sunflower oil and alpha-tocopherol. This study has shown
   that rheological and viscoelastic properties of aqueous NLC dispersions
   are quantitatively very different depending on the composition of the
   oil phase and the temperature of storage despite similar or even
   identical particle size. NLC were loaded with 30\% active ingredient
   relative to the particle mass. Stearyl alcohol was used as lipid matrix
   and the particle sizes determined by photon correlation spectroscopy
   were in the range 210-270 nm. In general, sun flower oil-loaded NLC
   dispersions showed distinctly higher storage modulus (G'), loss modulus
   (G{''}) and complex viscosity (eta{*}). Storage at lower temperature (4
   degrees C versus 20 degrees C) delay the build up of a microstructure
   affected not only by size and stabilizer but also loaded ingredient and
   storage history after preparation, i.e. storage at room temperature
   accelerates the build up of a final suspension structure.}},

Abstract = {{Reliable elasticity parameters describing the behavior of a given
   material are an important issue in the context of physically-based
   simulation. In this paper we introduce a method for the determination of
   the mechanical properties of brain tissue.
   Elasticity parameters Young's modulus E and Poisson's ratio v are
   estimated in an iterative framework coupling a finite element simulation
   with image registration. Within this framework, the outcome of the
   simulation is parameterized with both elasticity moduli that are
   automatically varied until optimal image correspondence between the
   simulated and the intraoperative data is achieved.
   We calculated optimal mechanical properties of brain tissue in six
   cases. The statistical analysis of the obtained values showed a good
   correlation of the results, thus proving the value of the method.
   An approach combining simulation and registration for the determination
   of the mechanical brain tissue properties is presented. This contributes
   to performing reliable physically-based simulation of soft tissue
   movement.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Cyclosporin (CsA) and tacrolimus (FK-506) are
   immunosuppressive drugs that specifically inhibit T-cell activation via
   calcineurin inhibition. Gingival overgrowth is a common side effect
   following the administration of CsA. The severity of gingival overgrowth
   seen in patients taking FK-506 is less than that observed with CsA.
   Little is known about the involvement of saliva in drug-induced gingival
   overgrowth. The purpose of this study was to investigate the salivary
   contents of tumor growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), epidermal growth
   factor (EGF), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) as well as the hystometry of
   gingival tissue obtained from rats treated with either FK-506 or CsA.
   Methods: For 30 or 60 days rats received daily subcutaneous injection
   doses of either CsA or FK-506 (10 mg/kg). The concentrations of TGF-beta
   1, EGF, and IL-6 in saliva were determined by enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay, and after histological processing, the oral
   epithelium and connective tissue were assessed at the region of the
   lower first molars.
   Results: The levels of TGF-beta l, EGF, and IL-6 in saliva were not
   significantly altered by any of the treatments after 30 days. After 60
   days of treatment with CsA, gingival overgrowth and significant increase
   in salivary TGF-beta 1, EGF, and IL-6 concentrations were observed; no
   statistically significant changes were induced by FK-506.
   Conclusion: Within the limits of this experimental study, it can be
   concluded that CsA, but not FK-506, induced gingival overgrowth
   associated with an increase of the salivary levels of the cytokines
   TGF-beta 1, EGF, and IL-6.}},

Abstract = {{low of an incompressible viscous fluid past a porous sphere has been
   discussed. The flow has been divided in three regions. The Region-I is
   the region inside the porous sphere in which the flow is governed by
   Brinkman equation with the effective viscosity different from that of
   the clear fluid. In Regions II and III clear fluid flows and Stokes and
   Oseen solutions are respectively valid. In all the three regions Stokes
   stream function is expressed in powers of Reynolds number. Stream
   function of Region II is matched with that of Region I at the surface of
   the sphere by the conditions suggested by Ochao-Tapia and Whitaker and
   it is matched with that of Oseen's solutions far away from the sphere.
   It is found that the drag on the sphere reduces significantly when it is
   porous and it decreases with the increase of permeability of the medium.}},

Abstract = {{Nurses, because of their nursing education and perspective practicing in
   multiple roles and settings, are uniquely qualified for mass casualty
   preparedness and response. Educating the current 2.7 million registered
   nurses and all future nursing graduates is a daunting task. Nursing
   education must ensure that graduates are prepared with the necessary
   knowledge and skills for mass casualty incidents. Four key entities are
   essential for education's successful implementation of disaster
   preparedness: education and professional organizations, accreditation
   and regulatory bodies, schools of nursing, and continuing education
   providers. This article examines die role each of these key entities
   plays in die development of a nursing workforce prepared for mass
   casualty response. In addition, the International Nursing Coalition for
   Mass Casualty Education (INCMCE) registered nurse (RN) competencies for
   mass casualty incidents and guidelines for integrating these
   competencies into the nursing education curricula are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Isotropic spheres or droplets dispersed in a smectic freely suspended
   film can self-organize in chains that interact with the c-director field
   of the embedding smectic material. Spontaneous buckling of such chains
   has been reported when the chains grow under geometrical restrictions,

   for incompressible chains by taking into account a finite energy
   associated with the variation of the intrachain
   droplet-droplet-distance. In addition to the wavelength selection
   described already by the inelastic chain model, the refined model yields
   a critical threshold for spontaneous buckling, in agreement with
   experimental observations.}},

Abstract = {{The incidence of testicular germ cell carcinoma (TGCC) is highest among
   men ages 20 to 44 years. Exposure to relatively high circulating
   maternal estrogen levels during pregnancy has long been suspected as
   being a risk factor for TGCC. Catechol (hydroxylated) estrogens have
   carcinogenic potential, thought to arise from reactive catechol
   intermediates with enhanced capability of forming mutation-inducing DNA
   adducts. Polymorphisms in maternal or offspring genes encoding
   estrogen-metabolizing enzymes may influence prenatal catechol estrogen
   levels and could therefore be biomarkers of TGCC risk. We conducted a
   population-based, case-parent triad study to evaluate TGCC risk in
   relation to maternal and/or offspring polymorphisms in CYP1A2, CYP1B1,
   CYP3A4, and CYP3A5. We identified 18- to 44-year-old men diagnosed with
   invasive TGCC from 1999 to 2004 through a population-based cancer
   registry in Washington State and recruited cases and their parents (110
   case-parent triads, 50 case-parent dyads). Maternal or offspring
   carriage of CYP1A2 -163A was associated with reduced risk of TGCC
   {[}maternal heterozygote relative risk (RR), 0.6; 95\% confidence
   interval (95\% Cl), 0.2-1.7; offspring heterozygote RR, 0.7; 95\% CL
   0.3-1.5)]. Maternal CYP1B1 (48)Gly homozygosity was associated with a
   2.7-fold increased risk of TGCC (95\% Cl, 0.9-7.9), with little evidence
   that Leu(432)Val or Asn(453)Ser genotypes were related to risk. Men were
   also at increased risk of TGCC if they carried the CYP3A4 -392G (RR,
   7.0; 95\% Cl, 1.6-31) or CYP3A5 6986G (RR, 2.4; 95\% Cl, 1.1-5.6)
   alleles. These results support the hypothesis that maternal and/or off
   spring catechol estrogen activity may influence sons' risk of TGCC.}},

   general intellectual functioning. In this third of four reanalyses of
   results from the Mayo Clinic's Older Americans Normative Studies (MOANS)
   databases, age-adjusted index and scaled scores for the Wechsler Memory

   education (rs = .089 to .310) for healthy older examinees between 56 and

Abstract = {{The management of chronic osteomyelitis requires the excision of
   necrotic and infected material followed by the prolonged administration
   of antibiotics. Sequestrectomy may be required before an involucrum has
   formed, resulting in a longitudinal bone defect. This can be difficult
   to fill. Vascularised grafts are complicated by a high rate of recurrent
   infection and thrombosis.
   We have managed defects of long bones in children after sequestrectomy
   by the use of non-vascularised fibular grafts harvested subperiosteally
   and held by an intramedullary Kirschner wire. Eight children underwent
   this procedure. In six the tibia was involved and in one each the
   humerus and radius. One patient was lost to follow-up. Six grafts united
   at both ends within 12 weeks. The seventh developed an infected nonunion
   distally which united after further debridement. One patient required a
   further sequestrectomy which did not compromise union.
   We have found this to be a straightforward technique with reliable
   results and were able to salvage the limb in all the seven patients who
   were reviewed.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated nest odor dynamics in the common yellow jacket, Vespula
   vulgaris. In six isolated colonies, we tested the aggression rates
   toward dead nestmates that had been stored for 10 min, 10 and 19 days
   outside their colonies at -76 degrees C. The aggression rate increased
   from about 12\% toward recently killed nestmates up to 30\% toward
   nestmates killed 19 days before the experiment. Obviously, the conserved
   nest odor profile of the nestmates frozen for several days did not match
   with that of their colony anymore. This indicates a change of the nest
   odor within the colony. In a second experiment, we kept two colonies
   each in one nest box with a complete separation of both neighbor nests
   by a solid wall inside the box for 28 days. In confrontation
   experiments, the colony members treated dead foragers from the neighbor
   nest as aggressively as dead foreign, non-neighbor workers (about 39\%
   each) whereas only about 14\% reacted aggressively toward dead
   nestmates. Seventeen days after the replacement of the solid wall by a
   metallic grid, which allowed no physical contact but air exchange
   between the two neighbor colonies, the aggression rates toward foreign
   workers and nestmates remained relatively unaffected whereas it
   decreased significantly toward dead neighbors to about 11\%. These
   results suggest a nest odor dynamic caused by volatiles transferred
   between two adjacent colonies, resulting in an equalization of the
   former colony specific nest odors. A change of nest odor dynamics
   influenced by volatiles was so far described only for one ant species at
   all.}},

   Engineering-an art of guiding force-fused with culture-the art of being
   human. To the author, the best contemporary synthesis of culture,
   creativity and engineering is the work of the
   engineer/architect/sculptor Santiago Calatrava. Such a synthesis,
   however, evades his Lisbon Oriente Station, in Portugal, which,
   paradoxically, brings the issue to the fore and allows it to be
   discussed. Lisbon's eastern industrial wasteland has been regenerating
   at a breathtaking pace, as if to keep up with the high-speed trains now
   calling at Santiago Calatrava's new and controversial Oriente Station,
   the area's catalyst project. It is controversial because it is a
   paradox. That paradox, this paper argues, comes down to a denial of the
   cultural role of railway stations.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To compare the rate of drug use prevalence and to investigate
   opinions regarding such use among undergraduate students at the
   University of Sao Paulo - Sao Paulo campus in 1996 and again in 2001.
   Methods: Both studies followed the same procedures of sampling and data
   collection. A random sample of undergraduate students, divided into the
   areas Humanities, Exact Sciences and Biologic Sciences, responded to an
   anonymous and self-report survey regarding the use of licit and illicit
   drugs within the last 30 days, within the last 12 months and over the
   lifetime of the subject. The two surveys were compared through the
   construction of (95\%) confidence intervals for the prevalence
   differences for each substance by area and by total number of students.
   The Wald test for homogeneity was applied in order to compare the
   prevalences. Results: High approval of regularly trying and using
   cocaine, crack, amphetamines and inhalants was observed. The drugs that
   showed statistic significant increasing were: lifetime use: alcohol,
   tobacco, marijuana, inhalants, hallucinogens, amphetamines,
   anticholines, barbiturics and any illicit drug; last-12-month use:
   marijuana, inhalants, amphetamines, hallucinogens and any illicit drug,.
   last-30-day use: marijuana, inhalants, amphetamines and any illicit
   drug. Discussion: The observed difference in the use of some drugs
   between the two surveys appears to be a consequence of the higher rates
   of favorable opinions regarding trying and regularly using some
   psychoactive substances, a finding that mirrors global trends in drug
   use.}},

Abstract = {{Folliculostellate (FS) cells are present in the anterior pituitary and
   have important regulatory functions including controlling hormone
   release from other anterior pituitary cells. FS cells do not usually
   express neuroendocrine genes such as chromogranin A (CgA). We analyzed
   transcriptional regulation and gene expression in the TtT/GF FS cell
   line to better understand the role of FS cells in anterior pituitary
   function. After transient transfection with a human (h) CgA promoter
   sequence linked to a luciferase reporter, there was basal level of
   transcriptional activity, which was two- to fourfold less than that
   observed in the anterior pituitary neuroendocrine cell lines HP75 and
   GH(3). The transcriptional activity was decreased in all cell lines when
   a mutant hCgA promoter cyclic AMP response element (CRE) was used for
   transfection. Sodium butyrate treatment increased the transcriptional
   activity in all cell lines, but remained two- to fourfold higher in the
   HP75 and GH(3) cell lines than in the TtT/GF cells.
   Stable transfection of a plasmid expressing bovine (b) CgA in the TtT/GF
   cells led to inhibition of cell growth as measured by H-3-thymidine
   incorporation, Ki-67 labeling index, and growth curve analysis. CgA
   protein and mRNA could be readily demonstrated in the cloned cells but
   not in the parental cell line or vector control cells. When the CgA
   expressing cloned cells were injected into SCID mice, there was a
   decrease in the rate of tumor growth compared to the vector control in
   vivo.
   These results indicate that the TtT/GF FS cells are fibroblast-like
   compared to the neuroendocrine anterior pituitary secretory cells when
   analyzed by transcriptional activity with a transiently transfected CgA
   promoter. In TtT/GF cells with a stably transfected bCgA plasmid, CgA
   has a direct regulatory effect on tumor cell proliferation.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: Medial branch blocks have been widely
   described in the literature as a diagnostic tool for facet joint pain.
   Recently, a new ``single-needle' technique was described that is
   purported to be equally accurate, and in some respects, superior to the
   standard multiple-needle technique. To date, no studies have been
   performed that compared these 2 techniques.
   Methods: In a multicenter setting, 24 subjects underwent 2 separate
   diagnostic medial-branch blocks in a randomized, single-blind crossover
   comparison of the single-needle and multiple-needle techniques. Multiple
   variables were compared between the 2 techniques, including
   procedure-related discomfort, postprocedure pain relief, volume of local
   anesthetic required, accuracy as determined by final needle position and
   contrast-media spread, and time needed to perform the procedure.
   Results: In this pilot study, the single-needle technique resulted in
   less procedure-related pain (P = .0003), required less superficial local
   anesthesia (P = .0006), and took less time to complete (P < .0001) than
   did the multiple-needle approach. With regard to final needle position,
   contrast spread, and postprocedure pain relief (P = .8), no differences
   were noted between the 2 techniques.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that the single-needle technique takes
   less time to perform and causes less patient discomfort than does the
   standard technique but provides the same degree of accuracy. More
   studies with larger sample sizes are needed to corroborate these results
   and explore the effect the single-needle approach has on the rate of
   false-positive medial branch blocks.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, I consider the effects of Spanish missionization on
   indigenous identity and biological interaction patterns. Odontometric
   data were recorded for 26 skeletal samples dating to three time periods:
   precontact (C.E. 1200-1400), early mission (C.E. 1600-1650), and late
   mission (C.E. 1650-1700). Population genetic analyses generated
   estimates of regional genetic variation (F(ST)) and intersample genetic
   distances. Genetic variation during the precontact period was limited
   despite documented linguistic and cultural variation. Variation
   increased during the early mission period, indicating a decline in
   between-group interaction despite inclusion within a single colonial
   sociopolitical framework. During the late mission period, variation
   declined significantly, indicating a dramatic reduction in between-group
   variability consistent with genetic drift and gene flow between
   communities. I discuss these results in terms of archaeological and
   historical models of postcolonial transformation and suggest an emerging
   polyethnic community was resident in La Florida preceding the subsequent
   diaspora caused by burgeoning European military conflict in eastern
   North America.}},

   faces (Stone \& Valentine, 2004, in press-b) did report a vague, partial
   visual percept. Two experiments investigated the relative strength of
   the visual percept generated by famous and unfamiliar faces, using
   masked 17 ms exposure. Each trial presented simultaneously a famous and
   an unfamiliar face, one face in LVF and the other in RVF. In one task,
   participants responded according to which of the faces generated the
   stronger visual percept, and in the other task, they attempted an
   explicit familiarity decision. The relative strength of the visual
   percept of the famous face compared to the unfamiliar face was moderated
   by response latency and participants' attitude towards the famous
   person. There was also an interaction of visual field with response
   latency, suggesting that the right hemisphere can generate a visual
   percept differentiating famous from unfamiliar faces more rapidly than
   the left hemisphere. Participants were at chance in the explicit
   familiarity decision, confirming the absence of awareness of facial
   familiarity. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To identify the prevalence of Borzoi chorioretinopathy in
   western Canada, characterize lesions with fluorescein angiography,
   determine if lesions were progressive, clarify the association of
   progressive retinal atrophy and investigate the etiology.
   Materials and methods Serial ophthalmic examination, fundus photography,
   electroretinography, and fluorescein angiography were used to evaluate
   Borzoi dogs with lesions of Borzoi chorioretinopathy. Pedigree analysis
   and test breeding of two affected dogs were completed to determine the
   heritability of Borzoi chorioretinopathy.
   Results One hundred three Borzoi dogs were examined between 1998 and
   2003. Focal, peripheral, tapetal, hyper-reflective and pigmented areas
   consistent with focal retinal degeneration and RPE pigmentation were
   identified in 12 dogs between 7 months and 7 years of age. Seven males
   and five female dogs were affected. Ophthalmoscopy and fundus
   photography over 5 years revealed individual lesions that did not
   progress or coalesce in 12 affected dogs. Electroretinography of
   affected and normal Borzoi dogs confirmed that retinal function was
   similar in normal and affected dogs up to 7 years of age. Fluorescein
   angiography was performed in three affected dogs and confirmed intact
   blood-ocular barriers, focal retinal pigment epithelium hypertrophy, and
   focal absence of choroiocapillaris corresponding to chronic, focal
   lesions. Pedigree analysis precluded simple dominant, X-linked dominant,
   or X-linked recessive inheritance. One male dog from the test-bred
   litter developed bilateral lesions at 14 months of age. Simple
   recessive, polygenetic, and acquired etiologies of these lesions cannot
   be ruled out at this time.
   Conclusions Borzoi chorioretinopathy is an acquired condition that
   initially manifests as focal retinal edema and loss of choriocapillaris
   and tapetum. With time the retina degenerates becoming hyper-reflective
   and with RPE hyper-pigmentation and clumping within the borders of the
   tapetal lesions. Choriocapillaris remains hypofluorescent on fluorescein
   angiography. Progressive retinal atrophy was excluded as an etiology of
   multifocal chorioretinopathy in Borzois dogs. This condition is not
   inherited by simple autosomal dominant or sex-linked modes of
   inheritance.}},

Abstract = {{The use of marker-peptides, measured by LC-MS/MS, is investigated for
   the quantitative analysis of proteins. To that end, cystatin C is chosen
   as a model protein. It not only functions as a proof of concept protein
   but the growing interest in cystatin C as a new marker of kidney failure
   provides a practical application at the same time. The use of
   trypsin-based proteolysis, to obtain so-called marker-peptides,
   simplifies the quantification of a protein to the quantification of a
   single or a number of peptides. Reproducibility of the trypsin
   proteolysis procedure is vital and has been optimised. A number of the
   marker-peptides obtained are selected for LC-MS(/MS) analysis. They are
   completely separated by high-pressure LC allowing maximum selectivity
   and mass spectrometric multiple reaction monitoring sensitivity. By
   doing so, linear calibration curves can be obtained for cystatin C over
   two orders of magnitude. Experiments have been performed on a triple
   quadrupole mass spectrometer by single ion monitoring (maximum
   sensitivity) as well as by multiple reaction monitoring (maximum
   specificity).}},

Abstract = {{The present study is an assessment of normal values of nasal nitric
   oxide (nNO) in healthy children.
   Healthy children aged between 6-17 yrs were recruited from three schools
   in Rotterdam (The Netherlands). Breath was held for 10 s, while air was
   extracted from one nostril at 700 mL center dot min(-1). The mean nNO
   value at the response plateau after 7-10 s was recorded and the average
   of three measurements was used.
   In total, 340 children participated; the male:female ratio was 156:184.
   Three reliable measurements were available in 85\% of the children. The
   nNO concentrations were distributed normally (mean 449 ppb, SD 115).
   They were not associated with sex, passive smoking or body mass index.
   In children aged <12 yrs nNO correlated positively with age, history of
   adenoidectomy and ambient NO. In children aged >= 12 yrs ambient NO was
   the only significant modifier. Prediction rules for nNO values in
   children were formulated.
   In conclusion, the current study presents normal values for nasal nitric
   oxide in children, which can be used to assess the value of nasal nitric
   oxide in respiratory illnesses.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss two sampling schemes for selecting random subnets from a
   network, random sampling and connectivity dependent sampling, and
   investigate how the degree distribution of a node in the network is
   affected by the two types of sampling. Here we derive a necessary and
   sufficient condition that guarantees that the degree distributions of
   the subnet and the true network belong to the same family of probability
   distributions. For completely random sampling of nodes we find that this
   condition is satisfied by classical random graphs; for the vast majority
   of networks this condition will, however, not be met. We furthermore
   discuss the case where the probability of sampling a node depends on the
   degree of a node and we find that even classical random graphs are no
   longer closed under this sampling regime. We conclude by relating the
   results to real Eschericia coli protein interaction network data.}},

   coincident with the AR. By using inhibitors of PKA, a permeable analog
   of cAMP and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX, we show that PKA
   activity is required for AR induction by EJ. A minimum of six sperm
   proteins are phosphorylated by PKA upon exposure to EJ, as detected by a
   PKA substrate-specific antibody. The phosphorylation of these proteins
   and the percentage of acrosome reacted sperm can be regulated by PKA
   modulators. The fucose sulfate polymer (FSP), a major component of EJ,
   is the molecule that triggers sperm PKA activation. Extracellular Ca2+
   is required for PKA activation. Six sperm proteins phosphorylated by PKA
   were identified by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) utilizing the
   emerging sea urchin genome. Based on their identities and localizations
   in sperm head and flagellum, the putative functions of these proteins in
   sperm physiology and AR induction are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Aims. The aim of our study was to analyse the serum level of interleukin
   18 (IL-18) in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients with type 2
   diabetes mellitus (DM), and to relate this to clinical findings.
   Methods. The IL-18 level was measured by ELISA in serum samples from 130
   CAD patients prior to their first, elective, coronary artery bypass
   surgery. Forty-three of them had been diabetic for several years. A
   control group consisted of 31 healthy people matched according to age,
   BMI, lipid and smoking status. Results. The CAD patients with DM were
   similar to the non-diabetic CAD patients with respect to age, BMI, grade
   of heart failure, ejection fraction. There were no differences in the
   duration of CAD, history of myocardial infarction and PTCA or
   instability of angina. The serum level of IL-18 was higher in the CAD
   patients than in the control group. The CAD patients with DM had a
   higher concentration of IL-18 compared to the non-diabetic CAD group.
   The diabetic patients with triple-vessel disease were characterized by a
   higher concentration of IL-18 than the non-diabetic patients with the
   same grade of CAD. Smoking affected the IL-18 concentration,
   particularly in the diabetic patients. Conclusion. Type 2 DM predisposes
   patients, especially those with multi-vessel CAD who were smokers, to a
   higher serum level of IL-18, which may help explain their vulnerability
   to fatal, secondary cardiovascular events. These patients should be in
   the first line for stringent, secondary cardiovascular prevention.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{501-507}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background. Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats bred in ordinary rat cages rarely
   develop osteonecrosis of the epiphyseal nucleus of the femoral head
   (OENFH), a pathological condition with findings similar to those of
   early-stage Perthes' disease in humans. OENFH occurs frequently in
   spontaneously hypertensive rats. Interestingly, when rats are forced to
   stand upright on the hindlimbs at feeding time, OENFH is frequently
   encountered.
   Methods. Experiment I investigated the stage of growth development at
   which osteonecrosis might be generated. Forty male WKY rats 5 weeks of
   age were kept and fed in high (27cm height) rat cages. Twenty femora
   from 10WKYs per observation time were resected under deep ether
   anesthesia at 9, 12,15, and 20 weeks. Histologic examination of the
   femoral head focused on OENFH and abnormalities of the growth plate.
   Experiment II defined the period after postnatal week 5 when OENFH was
   generated while standing upright. The standing posture was lessened up
   to postnatal weeks 9 and 12 using a low (10cm height) rat cage and then
   reenforced at feeding time with a high rat cage until 15 weeks. Forty
   femora from the 20 WKYs were then resected as in experiment I.
   Results. The onset of OENFH was observed only at 12 and 15 weeks of age
   in experiment I, revealing that OENFH occurred specifically during this
   growth period. In experiment II the osteonecrosis was minimal.
   Abnormalities in the growth plates of experiment II animals were less
   pronounced than those of rats killed 15 weeks after birth in experiment
   I.
   Conclusions. Repetitive mechanical stress on the femoral heads from 5 to
   9 weeks of age played an important role in the etiology of osteonecrosis
   in WKYs. This etiological finding could provide a clue to the
   pathogenesis and prevention of Perthes' disease in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Pregnenolone sulfate is one of the most abundantly produced
   neurosteroids in the brain. The present paper studies the effect of
   pregnenolone sulfate on excitatory synaptic transmission in the
   pyramidal cells of the layer V-VI of the prelimbic cortex using
   whole-cell patch-clamp in slices. We found that pregnenolone sulfate
   inhibited stimulus-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC); the
   effect of pregnenolone sulfate was significant at concentration of 1 mu
   M and increased with an increase in concentrations; pregnenolone sulfate
   had no effect on the amplitude and frequency of miniature excitatory
   spontaneous postsynaptic currents; pregnenolone sulfate significantly
   enhanced the paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and inhibited dopamine and
   5-HT-evoked increase in the frequency of spontaneous excitatory
   postsynaptic currents; the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 and Rp-cAMPS
   enhanced PPF and canceled the effect of pregnenolone sulfate on PPF;
   pregnenolone sulfate inhibited the protein kinase A agonist
   forskolin-evoked increase in the frequency of spontaneous excitatory
   postsynaptic currents; the G(i) protein inhibitor N-ethylmaleimide
   canceled the effect of pregnenolone sulfate on PPF. These results
   suggest that pregnenolone sulfate inhibits stimulus-evoked EPSC via
   presynaptic inhibition of protein kinase A in rat prelimbic cortical
   neurons. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   solutions for augmented weighted Tchebycheff network programs,
   subproblems derived from multiple-objective network-programming
   problems. In an interactive solution procedure, a series of augmented
   weighted Tchebycheff network programs need to be solved sequentially to
   find representative nondominated solutions. To speed up the solution
   process using the network structure of the problem, these warm-start
   routines start the solution process of one augmented weighted
   Tchebycheff network program from the optimal solution of the previous
   one. All three warm-start routines use the same strategy but different
   ways of reducing the number of basic flow variables, or equivalently
   increasing the number of basic nonflow variables to construct a basic
   solution. These warm-start routines can be used by any interactive
   procedures to facilitate the solution process of multiple-objective
   network-programming problems. A detailed example is presented. A
   computational experiment is conducted to compare the performance of
   these warm-start routines. A cold-start routine and NETSIDE, specialized
   software for solving network problems with side constraints, are also
   used as references in the experiment. These warm-start routines can save
   substantial computation time.}},

Abstract = {{We study systematically the lowest-energy structures of adatom clusters

   The atomic interactions are modeled by the realistic model potentials

   potential, and Rosato-Guillope-Legrand potential. The results show that
   on some surfaces, with increasing number of adatoms, the lowest-energy
   structures transit from linear chains oriented along the {[}(1) over bar
   10] direction to two-dimensional islands with two rows, and then to
   islands with three rows. On other surfaces, the lowest-energy structures
   are all linear chains for all numbers of adatoms. The competition
   between the nearest-neighbor adatom-adatom interaction and the overall
   interaction of the next-nearest-neighbor and the third neighbor adatoms
   plays a key role in determining the lowest-energy structure.}},

Abstract = {{To prevent in vivo degradation, small peptides are usually expressed in
   fusion proteins from which target peptides can be released by
   proteolytic or chemical reagents. In this report, a modified Ssp dnaB
   mini-intein linked with a chitin binding domain tag was used as a fusion
   partner for production of human brain natriuretic peptide (hBNP), a
   hormone for the treatment of congestive heart failure. The fusion
   protein was expressed as an inclusion body in Escherichia coli. After
   refolding, the fusion protein was purified with a chitin affinity
   column, and dnaB mini-intein mediated peptide-bond hydrolysis was
   triggered by shifting the pH in the chitin column to 7.0 at 25 degrees C
   for 16 h, which led to the release and separation of hBNP from its
   fusion partner. The hBNP sample was further purified with reverse phase
   HPLC and its biological activity was assayed in vitro. It was found that
   hBNP had a potent vasodilatory effect on rabbit aortic strips with an
   EC50 of (1.24 +/- 0.32) x 10(-6) mg/ml, which was similar to that of the
   synthetic BNP standard. The expression strategy described here promises
   to produce small peptides without use of proteolytic or chemical
   reagents. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the dynamic characteristics of an electromagnetic
   bidirectional microactuator by using Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV).
   Particular interests are to study the influences of input current
   (I-coli), burst time (t(b)), nd input energy (E-coli) to the dynamic
   characteristics of membrane displacement (d(m)). The microactuator is
   fully microfabricated by surface micromachining on a single silicon
   wafer. The overall diameter of the microactuator is 1600 mu m and the
   overall thickness is 600 mu m, including the wafer thickness. The
   microactuator consists of three main components: a soft magnetic
   membrane, an Au microcoli, and an integrated Co-Pt magnet on the
   membrane. Two different designs are investigated: double-legs and
   single-leg designs.
   In the experiments the membrane is actuated in free air by applying
   pulses of voltages through the microcoli (V-coli). The results show that
   there is a transition between two distinguished regions: a region when
   d(m) is dependent oil both I-coli and t(b), and the other region when
   d(m) is dependent only on I-coli. The transition happened when t(b)
   approximate to 1/2 center dot f(n) where f(n) is the natural frequency
   of the membrane. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Overall and local deflections of a single span of a continuous sandwich
   plate are evaluated under local contacts with a rigid indenter, at
   relative velocities of 10 and 20 m/s (approximate to 20-40 knots), to
   simulate the effect of impacts that can be applied to ship sandwich
   structures by floating objects or moorings. Laminated carbon-vinyl ester
   face sheets and a H100 PVC foam core, possibly separated from the
   impacted face sheet by a stiff and ductile polyurethane (PUR)
   interlayer, comprise the sandwich plate. As in our previous study of the
   effect of quasi-static contacts (Suvorov, A.P. and Dvorak, G.J. (2005).
   Protection of Sandwich Plates from Low Velocity Impact, Journal of
   Composite Materials (to appear)), the focus is on the evaluation of
   contact forces and deflections of the face sheet and foam core
   interface, and on the membrane or in-plane strains in the face sheet at
   the contact point. These quantities are well-known potential sources of
   damage, causing core crushing, and face sheet delamination and/or
   penetration. As expected, the results show that the magnitudes of these
   quantities depend on both the distance of the contact point from the
   nearest support, and on the initial velocity of the indenter of a given
   mass. Both local face sheet deflections and core interface indentations
   are high if the impact point is within a distance from a support that is
   equal to approximate to 2-3 times the total sandwich plate thickness;
   significantly lower values are found at more distant contact points.
   These deflections are much reduced by replacing the foam core with an
   aluminum honeycomb in the supported region of the plate. However, this
   reinforcement elevates both the contact force and the in-plane strain in
   the face sheet. Therefore, thickening of the exposed face sheets should
   be considered around supports. Most of the kinetic energy is absorbed by
   the core, hence addition of the stiff and ductile PUR interlayer does
   not have as much effect on the results as it had in quasi-static
   contact.}},

Abstract = {{Wild and feral medium-sized mammals were live trapped at two natural
   protected areas within the Mexico City limits to determine antibody
   prevalence for the most common infectious diseases (rabies,
   toxoplasmosis, and canine parvovirus) in dogs and cats. Mammals were
   trapped during the dry (March-April) and rainy seasons (July-August) of
   1996 and 1997. A total of 68 individuals were captured, representing 8
   species: opossums (Didelphis virginiana), ringtails (Bassariscus
   astutus), spotted skunks (Spilogale gracilis), weasels (Mustela
   frenata), rock squirrels (Spermophilus variegatus), Mexican gray
   squirrels (Sciurus aureogaster), feral cats (Felis catus), and feral
   dogs (Canis familiaris). There was marked seroprevalence for parvovirus
   (86.6\%) and lower seroprevalences for both toxoplasma (23.9\%) and
   rabies (17.9\%). There were no significant prevalence differences among
   mammals in both protected areas, which were of contrasting size and
   isolation (i.e., small and isolated versus large and nonisolated). We
   suggest that high seroprevalence of these three infectious agents in
   wild mammals is a result of the high densities of feral dogs and cats in
   the two areas sampled. Feral dogs are able to maintain the infectious
   agents in these localities regardless of the protected area size and
   isolation. However, the native mammals of the small and isolated reserve
   are more vulnerable to infectious diseases because of small population
   size and genetic bottlenecks. Our results indicate that natural areas in
   and around Mexico City are a refugium for latent infectious agents,
   several of which are zoonotic. These findings suggest that conservation
   measures, such as eradication of feral mammals and vaccination programs,
   in the protected areas and surrounding areas could be beneficial.}},

Abstract = {{Deuterated and protonated tetragonal lysozyme crystals are grown using

   Morphological and X-ray diffraction analyses of the deuterated and

   habits, all the crystals grown belong to the tetragonal crystal system.
   The simple forms of lysozyme crystals are revealed. It is shown that the

Abstract = {{In their paper ``Targeting versus Instrument Rules for Monetary
   Policy,{''} McCallum and Nelson critique targeting rules for the
   analysis of monetary policy. Their arguments are rebutted here. First,
   McCallum and Nelson's preference to study the robustness of simple
   monetary policy rules is no reason at all to limit attention to simple
   instrument rules; simple targeting rules may have more desirable
   properties. Second, optimal targeting rules are a compact, robust, and
   structural description of goal-directed monetary policy, analogous to
   the compact, robust, and structural consumption Euler conditions in the
   theory of consumption. They express the very robust condition of
   equality of the marginal rates of substitution and transformation
   between the central bank's target variables. Indeed, they provide
   desirable micro foundations of monetary policy. Third, under realistic
   information assumptions, the instrument rule analog to any targeting
   rule that McCallum and Nelson have proposed results in very large
   instrument rate volatility and is also, for other reasons, inferior to a
   targeting rule.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Free tumor DNA in body fluids may be an important biomarker.
   We tested whether tumor-specific mutated p53 DNA can be detected in
   blood and peritoneal fluid from women with epithelial ovarian cancer.
   Study design: Sequencing of tumor DNA identified somatic p53 mutations.
   Free DNA from matched blood or peritoneal fluid was evaluated for the
   tumor-specific p53 mutation using a ligase detection reaction.
   Results: Sixty-nine of 137 tumors (50\%) had p53 mutations. Plasma or
   serum from 21 (30\%) of the 69 informative cases contained, the
   tumor-specific p53 mutation. Circulating tumor was an independent
   predictor of decreased. survival in multivariate analysis (P = .02). We
   detected tumor DNA in peritoneal fluid in 28 of 30 (93\%) cases,
   including all 6 cases with negative cytology.
   Conclusion: One third of women with ovarian cancer have circulating
   tumor DNA and an associated reduced survival. Free tumor DNA can be
   detected in the majority of peritoneal fluid samples. (c) 2005 Mosby,

Abstract = {{Objectives: This is a European Commission (EC)-funded ongoing study
   known as the LAMS (Latin American Screening) study, where PAP
   smear/liquid-based cytology and screening colposcopy were compared with
   i) three optional screening tools {[}visual inspection with acetic acid
   (VIA), or Lugol's iodine (VILI), cervicography] and with ii) Hybrid
   Capture II from a) conventional samples and from b) self-samples, in
   women at different risk for cervical cancer in Brazil and Argentina.
   Study Design: During 2002-2003, a cohort of 12,107 women attending four
   clinics: Campinas (CA), Sao Paulo (SP), Porto Alegre (PA) and Buenos
   Aires (BA), were interviewed for risk factors, and examined using the 8
   diagnostic arms. Colposcopy was performed for women positive in any test
   and for 5 \% of women with baseline PAP-negative and 20 \% of
   HCII-negatives. All high-grade lesions (CIN2/3) were treated, and
   low-grade CIN are prospectively followed-up. Results: Of the 12,107
   women, the following baseline data are available: epidemiological data
   (n = 11, 996), conventional PAP smears (n = 10,363), LBC, SurePATH (n =
   320), LBC, DNA-Citoliq (n = 1,346), VIA (n = 12.067), VILI (n = 3,061),
   cervicography (n = 279), screening colposcopy (n = 3,437), HCII
   conventional (n = 4,710), HCII self-sampling (n = 246) and cervical
   biopsies (n = 1,524). The four subcohorts differ significantly in all
   their baseline data on the implicated risk factors of cervical cancer,
   consonant with their origin from regions with different cancer
   incidence. Around 95 \% of all PAP smears were negative, with slight
   variations in the prevalence of LSIL and HSIL between the four centers.
   Significant differences were found in the detection rates Of abnormal
   findings in VIA, VILI and colposcopy between the four centers (p =
   0.0001). The prevalence of HPV was practically identical (16.5-18.8 \%)
   in all four cohorts (p = 0.486), with no differences in the relative
   viral loads. Biopsy results were different depending on whether the
   women underwent screening colposcopy (BA) or elective colposcopy
   (others). Conclusion: Four cohorts with significantly different baseline
   data are available, and prospective follow-up of these women permits
   analysis of whether variations in cervical cancer incidence in these
   regions is due to i) different natural history of the precursor lesions,
   or ii) due to different levels of exposure to the known risk factors.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) reduce local airway

   Methods: Adult patients (n = 60; >= 18 years of age) with
   moderate-to-severe asthma were randomized to receive 4 weeks of
   treatment with ciclesonide (CIC), 320 mu g bid (CIC 640), CIC, 640 mu g
   bid (CIC 1280), fluticasone propionate (FP), 440 mu g bid (FP 880), FP
   880 mu g bid (FP 1760), or placebo (PBO) {[}all doses expressed as
   ex-actuator; comparable to ex-valve doses of 800 and 1,600 mu g/d for
   CIC and 1,000 and 2,000 mu g/d for FP, respectively]. Results: After 29
   days of treatment, CIC 640, CIC 1280, and FP 880 had no significant
   effect on the mean serum cortisol area under the curve for 0 to 24 h

   mean serum cortisol AUC0-24h compared to PBO (p = 0.0009; 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI], = 117.5 to - 32.1).
   Results obtained with cosyntropin stimulation revealed no statistically
   significant differences among the groups. The CIC 610 group demonstrated
   a significant increase compared to the PBO group in 24-h urinary
   cortisol levels from baseline at week 4 (p = 0.0224; 95\% CI, 0.0023 to
   0.0283), while the other treatment groups revealed no change in this
   parameter. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was
   similar in all groups, and all adverse events were mild or moderate in
   severity.
   Conclusion: Treatment with moderate and high doses of CIC does not
   result in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis suppression as compared

Abstract = {{Background Segmental pulmonary vein (PV) isolation has been performed to
   eliminate paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). However, this technique
   is not effective in most patients with persistent AF.
   Methods and Results Left atrial catheter ablation (LACA) was performed
   by encircling the left- and right-sided PV 1-2cm from the ostia, guided
   by an electroanatomical mapping system in 16 patients with persistent AF
   (> 1 month). Twelve patients (75\%) had a history of unsuccessful
   transthoracic cardioversion and prophylactic antiarrhythmic drugs.
   Ablation lines were also created in the mitral isthmus and posterior LA.
   PV isolation was also performed for each PV if there were residual PV
   potentials after the LACA. After LACA, 38 PV (59\%) were completely
   isolated, and complete PV isolation was achieved with only a few
   radiofrequency energy applications (2.7 +/- 2.0 min) on a narrow area of
   the PV ostium (24 +/- 15\%) in the remaining PV. The mean procedure time
   was 200 38 min. During the follow-up period (17 +/- 3 months), 12
   patients (75\%) had normal sinus rhythm and were free of symptomatic AF
   with (n = 10) or without antiarrhythmic drugs (n = 2). One patient had a
   stroke just after the procedure. No other complications including PV
   narrowing (> 50\%) occurred.
   Conclusion This approach was effective in persistent AF, however,
   concomitant use of antiarrhythinic drugs was often required.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: To examine the prevalence of different substances used by
   adolescents admitted to hospital emergency departments (ED); to evaluate
   the impact of an ED based brief intervention (BI) on hospital events; to
   compare outcomes for those using `alcohol alone', `alcohol plus illicit
   licit drugs' ('alcohol plus'), or `other drugs' excluding alcohol, and
   investigate the relationship between hazardous alcohol consumption
   patterns and hospital events.
   Design: We used hospital record linkage to follow-up a randomised
   control trial cohort.
   Participants: Adolescents (12-19 years) recruited in ED with
   presentations involving alcohol or other drugs (AOD): 67 received usual
   care and 60 a BI that facilitated attendance at community drug agencies.
   Measurements: Drug-use categories were assigned from the substances used
   at the baseline presentation. Outcomes were assessed as hospital
   admissions plus ED presentations in the 12-month post-intervention.
   `Hazardous' alcohol use was categorised via the AUDIT-3.
   Results: The drug-use categories were `alcohol alone' (n = 67, 53\%),
   `alcohol plus' (n = 31, 24\%) and `other drugs' (n = 28, 22\%). In the
   12-month post-intervention, the randomisation groups had similar numbers
   of AOD hospital events. A Cox regression showed that in the usual care
   but not the BI group, for `other drugs' there was a 8-fold increased
   hazard ('risk') of an AOD hospital event compared with `alcohol alone'
   and a 10-fold increase compared to `alcohol plus'. Each pre-recruitment
   AOD event doubled the hazard of an AOD event. For the 131 group, these
   were not significant predictors. The `other drugs' group had more AOD
   events than either of the other groups. `Hazardous' (77\%) alcohol use
   was common but was not a predictor of AOD hospital events.
   Conclusions: : BI can be delivered in ED and reduce hospital AOD
   morbidity associated with the use of drugs other than alcohol.

   REAIO(3)) = 9:1 and 8:2 (RE = La, Nd and Sm) to control the Curie
   temperature (T-C) of the ferroelectric glass-ceramics. The
   La3+-substituted (9: 1) sample heated at 950 degrees C for 24 h showed a
   broadened epsilon(r)-temperature relationship with substantial lowering
   in T-C to similar to-55 degrees C. The Ba:La ratio in the perovskite
   particles was estimated to be in the range of 4:1-6.7:1, whereas very
   little Al3+ was incorporated into the same particles. It was found that
   the T-C of the glass-ceramics fabricated in our serial study could be
   adjusted by A-site cation substitution in BaTiO3. Tailored glass-ceramic
   samples with room temperature epsilon(r) of 200-300 and Tc of around 0
   degrees C had good microwave tunability of 30-40\% under dc bias voltage

Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{The role of attention in conjoining features of an object has been a
   topic of much debate. Studies using the mismatch negativity (MMN), an
   index of detecting acoustic deviance, suggested that the conjunctions of
   auditory features are preattentively represented in the brain. These
   studies, however, used sequentially presented sounds and thus are not
   directly comparable with visual studies of feature integration.
   Therefore, the current study presented an array of spatially distributed
   sounds to determine whether the auditory features of concurrent sounds
   are correctly conjoined without focal attention directed to the sounds.
   Two types of sounds differing from each other in timbre and pitch were
   repeatedly presented together while subjects were engaged in a visual
   n-back working-memory task and ignored the sounds. Occasional reversals
   of the frequent pitch-timbre combinations elicited MMNs of a very
   similar amplitude and latency irrespective of the task load. This result
   suggested preattentive integration of auditory features. However,
   performance in a subsequent target-search task with the same stimuli
   indicated the occurrence of illusory conjunctions. The discrepancy
   between the results obtained with and without focal attention suggests
   that illusory conjunctions may occur during voluntary access to the
   preattentively encoded object representations. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Basalt-basaltic andesite (< 55 wt \% SiO2) and dacite-rhyolite (66-74 wt
   \% SiO2) are the predominant eruptive products in the Sumisu caldera
   volcano, Izu-Bonin arc, Japan. The most magnesian basalt (8.5\% MgO), as
   well as some of the other basalts, has a low Zr content (20-25 ppm), and
   cannot yield basalts with higher Zr contents (29-40 ppm) through
   fractionation and/or assimilation. The high- and low-Zr basalts have
   different phenocryst assemblages, olivine, plagioclase and pyroxene
   phenocryst chemistries, REE (rare earth element) patterns, and
   fluid-mobile element/immobile element ratios. Estimated primary olivine
   compositions are more magnesian (> F0(91)) in the low-Zr basalts
   compared with those in high-Zr basalts (< F0(89)). The low-Zr basalts
   contain up to 11 vol. \% augite, but many high-Zr basalts are free of
   augite, which appears only in their more differentiated products. The
   low-Zr basalts are considered to be hydrous magmas in which olivine
   crystallizes first followed by augite and plagioclase, whereas the
   high-Zr basalts are dry. The low-Zr basalts have higher U/Th ratios than
   the high-Zr basalts. We suggest that both dry and wet primary basalts
   existed in the Sumisu magmatic system, each having different trace
   element concentrations, mineral assemblages and mineral chemistry. The
   lower contents of Zr and light REE and magnesian primary olivines in the
   wet basalts could have resulted from a higher degree of partial melting
   (similar to 20\%) of a hydrous source mantle compared with similar to
   10\% melting of a dry source mantle. The Sr, Nd and Pb isotope
   compositions of the wet and dry basalts are similar and are limited in
   range. These lines of evidence indicate that a mantle diapir model might
   be applicable to satisfy the configuration of such a mantle source
   region beneath a single volcanic system such as Sumisu.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To compare pain levels as measured by visual analog scale (VAS)
   and analgesic requirement between intercostal and anterior subcostal
   ultrasound (US)-guided biopsy.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy consecutive patients were randomized to
   undergo biopsy via an intercostal (n = 33) or subcostal (n = 37)
   approach. The groups were matched with regard to baseline
   characteristics: mean age, 44 years; age range, 20-70 years; sex, 43
   male and 27 female; and indications of hepatitis C in 69\%, hepatitis B
   in 16\%, and others in 15\%. The VAS score was obtained immediately
   after biopsy and hourly for 4 hours until the patients were discharged.
   Analgesic requirements and postprocedural complications were documented.
   RESULTS: No significant difference in VAS scores was seen between the
   groups. At hours 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, the VAS scores (on a scale of 100)
   in the intercostal and subcostal groups were 10.3 +/- 16.7 versus 11.8
   +/- 16.0 (P=.70), 19.1 +/- 24.0 versus 13.9 +/- 16.2 (P =.30), 11.5 +/-
   14.8 versus 11.8 +/- 15.1 (P=.93), 6.2 +/- 8.9 versus 7.5 +/- 11.5
   (P=.63), and 5.4 +/- 8.2 versus 4.7 +/- 8.5 (P=.72), respectively. The
   average VAS was less than 10. In the intercostal biopsy group, 36.4\% of
   patients required additional analgesia after biopsy, compared with
   27.0\% in the subcostal biopsy group (P=.64). One patient in the
   intercostal group refused to have future follow-up biopsy even if it was
   clinically indicated, compared with no such patients in the subcostal
   biopsy group. No differences in diagnostic samples or major
   complications were seen in either group.
   CONCLUSION: US-guided percutaneous liver biopsy performed with fentanyl
   and midazolam premedication is a well-tolerated procedure with minimal
   patient discomfort. The location of the biopsy does not influence the
   outcome of the procedure.}},

Abstract = {{Although the possible involvement of neurotrophic factors in itchy skins
   of atopic dermatitis has been predicted, the exact mechanism by which
   itch is induced remains unclear. Since nerve growth factor (NGF) has
   crucial effects on development and functions of sensory nerves, we
   determined production of NGF and extension of nerve fibers in skins of
   NC/NgaTnd mice with or without atopic dermatitis. NC/NgaTnd mice
   spontaneously develop atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions when they are
   raised in air-unregulated conventional circumstances. We quantified
   scratching behavior of NC/NgaTnd mice during the development of
   dermatitis using a novel analytical system and compared to clinical skin
   severity scores. A significant correlation between the severity of
   dermatitis and the increase in the number of scratches was identified,
   indicating that scratching behavior may associate with clinical skin
   conditions. NGF contents in the skin lesions of conventional NC/NgaTnd
   mice were significantly higher than those in SPF mice. Positive
   reactions for NGF were observed in keratinocytes and fibroblasts in
   affected skins of conventional NC/NgaTnd mice. Immumohistochemical
   analysis showed the extension of protein gene product 9.5-positive nerve
   fibers from the dermis toward the epidermis at the skin lesions. These
   results suggest that sensory nerves induced by NGF may contribute to
   development of itch, and that NGF produced at the affected site may
   provide abnormal skin sensitivity in atopic dermatitis.}},

   phosphino-oxazolines (PHOX) were synthesized and characterized by
   elemental analysis and IR spectroscopy, and the structures of complexes
   4c-4e were confirmed by the X-ray crystallographic analysis. All
   derivatives showed distorted tetrahedron geometry by the nickel center
   and coordinative atoms. Upon activation with methylaluminoxane (MAO) or
   Et2AlCl, these complexes exhibited considerable to high activity of
   ethylene oligomerization. The ligands environments and reaction
   conditions significantly affect their catalytic activities, while the
   highest oligomerization activity (Up to 1. 18 X 10(6) g center dot
   mol(-1) (Ni) - h(-1)) was observed for 4d at 20 atm of ethylene.
   Incorporation of 2-4 equivalents of PPh3 as auxiliary ligands in the
   4a-f/MAO catalytic systems led to higher activity and longer catalytic
   lifetime. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Importance of family history and implications for cardiovascular and

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF KIDNEY DISEASES}},

Abstract = {{Background Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a
   common and serious cause of hereditary renal disease. The emerging
   possibilities to intervene early in the disease course elevate the
   importance of both accurate and early diagnosis of ADPKD. Family history
   analysis is a simple and inexpensive approach to identifying individuals
   at risk for ADPKD. We hypothesized that advances in knowledge of and
   potential interventions for ADPKD have led to increased use of family
   history screening. Methods: We distributed surveys to 1,527 subjects
   from our ADPKD research database to determine the extent to which
   examination of family history was used to diagnose ADPKD, by birth
   cohort. Results: Six hundred thirty-seven subjects with ADPKD (42\%)
   completed and returned surveys. Family history analysis led to the
   initial ADPKD diagnosis in 49\% of all subjects overall. In the
   birth-cohort analysis, ADPKD was more likely to have been diagnosed in
   individuals born between 1951 and 1974 because of family history (55\%
   versus 38\%; P<0.0002) and patients were younger at diagnosis (27 versus
   39 years; P<0.0001) than individuals born before 1951. Conclusion: In a
   large cohort of subjects with ADPKD, we found increased use of family
   history analysis as a tool for diagnosing ADPKD and earlier age of
   diagnosis in the more recent birth cohort. This trend may reflect
   increased overall awareness of ADPKD by physicians, as well as
   encouraging hypertension and proteinuria treatment outcome data that may
   depend on intervening early in the course of disease.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To investigate the associations of childhood IQ and adult
   social factors, and smoking behaviour, lung function (forced expiratory
   volume in one second; FEV1), and smoking-related outcomes in adulthood.
   Design. Retrospective cohort study.
   Method. Participants were from the Midspan prospective studies conducted
   on Scottish adults in the 1970s. The sample consisted of 938 Midspan
   participants born in 1921 who were successfully matched with their
   cognitive ability test results on the Scottish Mental Survey 1932.
   Results. Structural equation modelling showed that age IIIIQ was not
   directly associated with smoking consumption, but that IQ and adult
   social class had indirect effects on smoking consumption via deprivation
   category. The influence of IQ on FEV1 was partly indirect via social
   class. Gender influenced smoking consumption and also IQ and social
   class. There was a 21\% higher risk of having a smoking-related hospital
   admission, cancer, or death during 25 years of follow-up for each
   standard deviation disadvantage in IQ. Adjustment for adult social
   class, deprivation category, and smoking reduced the association to
   10\%.
   Conclusion. Childhood IQ was associated with social factors which
   influenced lung function in adulthood, but was not associated directly
   with smoking consumption. In future studies, it is important to consider
   other pathways which may account for variance in the link between
   childhood IQ and health in later life.}},

Abstract = {{The deformation and failure response of a long metal beam impacted by a
   rigid, round-nosed projectile is investigated numerically using a newly
   developed ductile fracture locus. Attention is focused on the transition
   of failure modes from the tensile dominated to shear dominated mechanism
   with increasing impact velocities. Effects of material ductility are
   highlighted by introducing two metals: 2024-T351 aluminum alloy and
   Weldox 460 E steel, which represent a less and a more ductile material,
   respectively. It is revealed that tensile tearing is a favorable failure
   mode for both materials at a velocity near the ballistic limit. The
   steel beam tends to break by tensile tearing while the aluminum beam
   fails by shear plugging at an impact velocity well above the ballistic
   limit. The energy dissipated in the target increases with the impact
   velocity, reaches a maximum value at or near the ballistic limit, and
   suddenly decreases just beyond the ballistic limit. The numerical
   findings are consistent with experimental observations given in the
   literature. The present paper provides an insight into the mechanics and
   mechanisms of ductile fracture in rigid mass impact on beam. At the same
   time, it is clearly demonstrated that the new fracture criterion is
   capable of capturing crack formation and distinct failure modes. (c)

Abstract = {{Three different short-chained carboxylic acids, formic, acetic, and
   propionic acid, were compared as additives to increase the green
   strength of wet particle networks produced with the direct coagulation
   casting process, which allows the internal coagulation of a suspension.
   Small acid additions do not alter the favorable low viscosity of the
   stabilized slurry, and yet increase the compressive strength of wet
   coagulated bodies. The strengthening effect increases with increasing
   chain length of the carboxylic acid. The maximum effect was observed
   upon addition of propionic acid (0.3 wt\% to alumina), which resulted in
   a sixfold increase in compressive strength of wet coagulated bodies
   compared with that without propionic acid.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a
   new contrast-dedicated ultrasound technology, contrast-tuned imaging
   (CnTI), implemented on an endovaginal probe and using the
   second-generation contrast agent SonoVue (Bracco International BV,
   Amsterdam, the Netherlands), compared with the standard ultrasound
   examination in different gynecologic diseases. Methods. Eighty-nine
   patients were enrolled in the study in 4 different clinical centers. The
   study included 40 patients with uncertain pelvic adnexal masses, 10
   patients with pelvic masses indicative of recurrences of gynecologic
   tumors, 26 patients with uterine pathologic features, and 13 patients
   with cervical lesions. Results. Application of CnTI technology after the
   SonoVue injection gave a picture of the intralesional
   microvascularization dramatically different from that obtained during
   color Doppler examination. Of the 40 pelvic masses, 15 (37.5 \%) were
   considered benign and 25 (62.5 \%) were considered malignant at B-mode
   and color Doppler examinations. Contrast-enhanced sonography showed no
   intralesional contrast perfusion in 11 (73 \%) of 15 cases, and all
   these were benign at final diagnosis. Of the 4 (27 \%) cases that had
   perfusion, 2 were malignant. Conversely, of the 25 cases with positive
   findings at color Doppler examination and therefore expected to show the
   appearance of contrast tissue-filling morphologic characteristics, 13
   (52 \%) were malignant at final diagnosis. For evaluation of uterine
   pathologic features, the CnTI-SonoVue technology did not appear to be
   superior to the B-mode and color Doppler examinations; however, for the
   evaluation of cervical cancer, CnTI-SonoVue technology revealed a better
   definition of the margins of the neoplastic lesions in 4 (40 \%) of 10
   cases. Condusions. In the evaluation of uncertain pelvic masses, the
   CnTl technology led to an improvement in the ability of the practitioner
   to differentiate benign from malignant adnexal lesions.}},

Abstract = {{We study the effect of the electron-electron interaction on the weak
   localization correction of a ring pierced by a magnetic flux. We compute
   exactly the path integral giving the magnetoconductivity for an isolated
   ring. The results are interpreted in a time representation. This allows
   us to characterize the nature of the phase coherence relaxation in the
   ring. The nature of the relaxation depends on the time regime (diffusive
   or ergodic) but also on the harmonics n of the magnetoconductivity.
   Whereas phase coherence relaxation is non exponential for the harmonic
   n=0, it is always exponential for harmonics n not equal 0. Then we
   consider the case of a ring connected to reservoirs and discuss the
   effect of connecting wires. We recover the behavior of the harmonics
   predicted recently by Ludwig and Mirlin {[}Phys. Rev. B 69, 193306
   (2004)] for a large perimeter (compared to the Nyquist length). We also
   predict a new behaviour when the Nyquist length exceeds the perimeter.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the comparative study of various wavelet filter
   based denoising methods according to different thresholding values
   applied to ultrasound images. An original image is transformed into a
   multi scale wavelet domain and the wavelet coefficients are processed by
   a soft thresholding method. The denoised image is the output image
   obtained from the inverse wavelet transform of the threshold
   coefficients using Donoho's method. It has been observed that such
   denoising methods are effective in the sense that they preserve the edge
   details besides suppressing the noise. The comparative evaluation of the
   denoising performance is shown using statistical significance tests for
   different wavelet filters. Image quality parameters such as peak
   signal-to-noise ratio, normalized mean square error, and correlation
   coefficient have been used to evaluate the performance of wavelet
   filters. The performance has also been compared with the adaptive
   weighted median filtering method. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The media of the rat hepatic portal vein is composed of an internal
   circular muscular layer (CL) and an external longitudinal muscular layer
   (LL). These two perpendicular layers differentiate progressively from
   mesenchymal cells within the first month after birth. In this paper, we
   studied the development of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)
   innervation during post-natal differentiation of the vessel. We show
   that CGRP innervation is already present around the vessel at birth in
   the future adventitia but far from the lumen of the vessel.
   Progressively, CGRP immunoreactive fibers reached first LL then CL. CL
   by itself become only innervated at day 14 after birth. This corresponds
   to the time at which thick filaments (myosin) are visible in electron
   microscopy and desmin visualisable by immunocytochemistry. Furthermore,
   we provide evidence by autoradiography, that binding sites for CGRP are
   transiently expressed on the portal vein media at day 1 and 14 after
   birth. Vascular smooth muscle cells were transfected with constructs
   containing promoters for desmin or smooth muscle myosin heavy chain
   (smMHC). CGRP treatment of the cells significantly increased the
   expression of smMHC. Overall these results suggest that CGRP can
   potentially influence the differentiation of smooth muscle cells from
   the vessel wall. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of four thermal parameters on post-thaw membrane integrity of
   adipose tissue derived adult stem (ADAS) cells after controlled-rate
   freezing was investigated with the help of a two-level four-parameter
   (24) experimental design. The four thermal parameters studied were
   cooling rate (CR), end temperature (ET), hold time (HT), and thawing
   rate (TR). Several passages, including Passage-0 (P0), Passage-1 (P1),
   Passage-2 (P2), Passage-3 (P3), and Passage-4 (P4), obtained from the
   suspended culture of stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of the ADAS cells
   were used for this study. The two levels (low and high) of the four
   parameters {[}CR (1 and 40 degrees C/min); ET (-80 and -20 degrees C);
   HT (1 and 15 min); and TR (10 and 200 degrees C/min)] are chosen in such
   a way that they enclosed all parameter values possible using
   commercially available controlled-rate freezing equipment. Individual
   effect of each parameter on the immediate post-thaw membrane integrity
   was determined through the calculation of parameter effect values (E),
   and any synergy among the parameters on post-thaw membrane integrity was
   assessed through the calculation of two or more parameter interaction
   effect values (I). Nonlinearity in the experimental results was
   represented through the calculation of curvature value (CV). The results
   suggest that for 99\% confidence level the parameters CR and ET have
   considerable effect on post-thaw membrane integrity of all passages of
   ADAS cells. A significant individual effect of TR was observed with P3
   and P4 cells and a significant two-parameter interaction was observed
   between CR-ET for all passages. These observed results will be used as a
   basis to further develop freezing storage protocols of ADAS cells.}},

Journal = {{EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1327-1343}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Due to a lack of data on settling velocities (w(s)) and grain size
   distributions (GSDs) in floodplain environments, sedimentation models
   often use calibrated rather than measured parameters. Since the
   characteristics of suspended matter differ from those of deposited
   sediment, it is impossible to derive the ws and GSD from the latter.
   Therefore, one needs to measure in situ suspended sediment
   concentrations (SSCs), settling velocities, effective grain sizes and
   sedimentation fluxes. For this purpose we used the LISST-ST, a laser
   particle sizer combined with a settling tube. In 2002 (twice) and 2004,
   we located the LISST-ST with an optical backscatter sensor and sediment
   traps in two floodplains in The Netherlands: one along the unembanked
   Ijssel River, another along the embanked Waal River. Measurements
   revealed that the SSC in the floodplains varied in relation to the SSC
   in the river channel. Smaller flocs dominated the SSC, while larger
   flocs dominated the potential sedimentation fluxes. The in situ GSD in
   the Ijssel floodplain was significantly coarser than in the Waal
   floodplain, while the dispersed median grain sizes were equal for both
   floodplains. Therefore, the dispersed median grain size was two to five
   times smaller than the effective one. The in situ grain size exhibited a
   significant positive relationship with w(s), although the w(s) for the
   largest flocs showed high variability. Consequently, the variability in
   sedimentation fluxes was also large. In the actual sedimentation fluxes,
   and hence in sedimentation models, in situ grain sizes up to about 20 mu
   m can be neglected. In floodplain sedimentation models the relation
   between settling velocity and in situ grain size can be used instead of
   Stokes's law, which is only valid for dispersed grain sizes. These
   models should also use adequate data on flow conditions as input, since
   these strongly influence the suspended sediment characteristics.

Abstract = {{A Middle Jurassic fossil forest, thought to have been growing at high
   southern palaeolatitudes on the Gondwana margin, is described from New
   Zealand. Fossil stump horizons are exposed in stratigraphic section
   within the Urawitiki Measures Formation, Murihiku Supergroup. Tree bases
   were preserved by silica permineralisation in a sandy braided river
   setting. Fossil wood is referred to `abietinean-type' and Agathoxylon. A
   total of 238 stumps were mapped with measured diameters allowing tree
   height estimates of 9-40 m. A two-dimensional area (102 m(2)) allows an
   interpretation of tree density (2353 trees/ha), biomass (579 t/ha) and
   stand basal area (146 m(2)). This horizon is interpreted as a highly
   productive, young, dense tree stand probably actively regenerating on a
   flood-cleared surface. Annual growth rings suggest a clearly defined

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PATHOLOGY}},

Volume = {{58}},

Abstract = {{Background: The use of paraffin wax embedded tissue samples as a source
   of DNA for genotype analysis has been limited because of difficulties in
   DNA extraction and single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) analysis.
   Aims: To test the feasibility of applying the combination of a commonly
   used DNA isolation procedure, PureGene, and a high throughput SNP
   analysis method, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-INVADER assay, to
   genotype several types of paraffin wax embedded breast tissues.
   Methods: Twenty formalin fixed, paraffin wax blocks were obtained from
   five participants in the Iowa women's health study. Each participant
   provided several types of tissue including normal lymph node, normal
   nipple/areola tissue, inflammatory/fibrotic breast tissue, or normal
   breast tissue, and tumour tissue.
   Results: Good quality DNA (260/280 ratio >1.6) was obtained from all
   tissues. Normal lymph nodes yielded the largest amount of DNA (97.1 mu
   g). DNA obtained from the samples was tested for a germline C1183T
   polymorphism in the MnSOD gene by three methods - PCR-RFLP ( restriction
   fragment length polymorphism), INVADER assay, and PCR-INVADER assay. Of
   the 20 samples, PCR-RFLP genotyped 16, the PCR-INVADER assay 18, and the
   INVADER assay two. This methodology was then used to analyse five
   additional genotypes and confirmed the general applicability of the
   method.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility of ( 1) using
   several paraffin wax embedded breast tissues as a source of DNA for
   germline genetic analysis, with lymph nodes providing the highest yield,
   and ( 2) using the combination of a common extraction method with a high
   throughput SNP analysis method, the PCR - INVADER assay.}},

   negative electrode used in commercial lithium-ion batteries. It is
   assumed that the significant disorder (atomic mixing and vacancies) that
   occurs in the tetragonal structure of Li9AlSi3 is responsible for this
   interesting property. First principle DFT calculations have been carried

Abstract = {{A duplex real-time qPCR assay was developed for quantifying human
   nuclear and mitochondrial DNA in forensic samples. The nuclear portion
   of the assay utilized amplification of a similar to 170-190bp target
   sequence that spans the repeat region of the TH01 STR locus, and the
   mitochondrial portion of the assay utilized amplification of a 69 by
   target sequence in the ND1 region. Validation studies, performed on an
   ABI 7000 SDS instrument using TaqMan (R) detection, demonstrated that
   both portions of the duplex assay provide suitable quantification
   sensitivity and precision down to 10-15 copies of each genome of
   interest and that neither portion shows cross-reactivity to commonly
   encountered non-human genomes. As part of the validation studies, a
   series of DNase-degraded samples were quantified using three different
   methods: the duplex nuclear-mitochondrial qPCR assay, the ABI
   Quantifiler (TM) Human DNA Quantification Kit qPCR assay, which
   amplifies and detects a 62 by nuclear target sequence, and slot blot
   hybridization. For non-degraded and moderately degraded samples in the
   series, all three methods were suitably accurate for quantifying nuclear
   DNA to achieve successful STR amplifications to yield complete profiles
   using the ABI AmpF/STR (R) Identifiler (TM) kit. However, for highly
   degraded samples, the duplex qPCR assay provided better estimates of
   nuclear template for STR amplification than did either the commercial
   qPCR assay, which overestimated the quantity of STR-sized DNA fragments,
   leading to an increased proportion of undetected alleles at the larger
   STR loci, or slot blot hybridization, which underestimated the quantity
   of nuclear DNA, leading to an increased proportion of STR amplification
   artifacts due to amplification of excess template.}},

   regrets, older people, women, and those living in the former East
   Germany were more likely to recall externally attributed events; younger
   participants, men, West Germans, and the Dutch recalled more internally
   attributed events. Largely, memories related to 4 major themes: (a)
   mistakes, behavior, and bad decisions in general; (b) hard times; (C)
   social relationships; and (d) missed educational opportunities. The
   importance of these themes, however, varied according to age, gender,

Abstract = {{The notion of ``social diversity{''} has become a catchword in French
   urban policy. It designates for instance the purpose of some mechanisms
   of concerted management in the attribution of local authority housing:
   such is the case with the communal charters of housing signed by the
   public housing authorities, the municipality and the prefecture of the
   suburban town of Montreuil (near Paris) in 1997. This system contributes
   in many cases to organizing and legitimizing a selection of candidates
   based on the disqualification of certain household types, often poor or
   coming from a post-colonial immigrant background. The existence of such
   mechanisms is not to be explained solely by today's growing consensus
   over the benefits of having diversified populations coexisting in the
   same area, or the necessity of organizing such coexistence through a
   population policy. This kind of management also stems from the interplay
   of various interests, in which invoking the principle of social
   diversity is a weapon in the struggle for control of the system of
   housing attribution. In this context of heightened competition the
   category of social diversity is becoming institutionalized in the form
   of a ``weak{''} norm. A fuzzy, mixed-bag category with little objective
   basis, it has become the tool of discriminatory practices carried out as
   little publicized arrangements rather than rationalized administrative
   decisions.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW C}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{We analyze coherent Theta(+)Lambda(1520) photoproduction in the gamma d
   interaction near the threshold. We demonstrate that the effect of the
   coherent production becomes manifest in a comparison of the nK(+)
   invariant mass distribution when the pK(-) system is on the Lambda(1520)
   mass. Our model calculations indicate a sizable contribution of resonant
   and nonresonant background processes in the gamma d -> npK(+)K(-)
   reaction that generally exceeds the contribution of the coherent
   resonance channel. However, we find that coherent Theta(+)Lambda(1520)
   photoproduction is enhanced relative to the background processes in the
   forward hemisphere of pK(-) pair photoproduction. Moreover, the
   coherence effect does not depend on the Theta(+) photoproduction
   amplitude and is defined by the probabilities of Lambda(1520)
   photoproduction and the Theta(+)-> NK transition. Therefore, this effect
   may be used as an independent method for studying the production
   mechanism and properties of Theta(+).}},

Abstract = {{This study forms the initial stage of a larger study that will examine
   the underlying reasons why Grade 10 students often produce equations
   that are inaccurate interpretations of mathematical word problems into
   algebraic relationships. Four case studies were undertaken to establish
   a socio-cultural perspective of the influences that could be inducing
   misinterpretation of word problems into equations and two of these cases
   are discussed for the purposes of this article. The study adopts a
   discourse analysis (Gee, 1999; 1992) that aims to identify cultural
   models that are at play in order to pinpoint student perceptions of word
   problems, and to place these appropriately within the social context.
   The data suggest that there is a sequence of events arising from
   cultural models that the students hold and that cause the students to be
   affected in different ways, depending upon which cultural models they
   act. In this study a central model is evident in which the students can
   be seen to position themselves in a situation of relative mathematical
   helplessness. At this stage certain conjectures based largely upon the
   literature are discussed with respect to how students come to position
   themselves in this way. The consequences of this student positioning are
   discussed, particularly with a view to whose interests word problems
   serve.}},

Abstract = {{We present here some new evidence for the occurrence of both
   right-lateral and left-lateral motion along the Mattinata Fault System
   (MAFS), a seismogenic structure in the southern sector of the Gargano
   promontory (Apulia, southern Italy). Right-lateral motion along the MAFS
   is recorded by geomorphic and structural features which suggest that
   dextral shear characterizes the most recent kinematic behaviour of the
   structure. Earlier left-lateral motion along the MAFS has been inferred
   mainly from the occurrence of localized pervasive pressure solution
   surfaces that are consistent with sinistral shear and by the presence of
   the Pantano di Sant' Egidio pull-apart, located in the left-stepping
   overlap zone between two major fault segments of the MAFS.
   Observed displacement values and computed slip-rates also allowed us to
   estimate, for the late dextral motion along the MAFS, a chronological
   interval of activity which is not less than 200 ka. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Agricultural production transforms energy input into energy output in
   the form of harvested products. Under suitable conditions, crops
   produced convert so much solar energy into energy stored in plant
   biomass that the energy input is more than offset. The amount of energy
   fixed in the harvested biomass depends on the yield level and its
   chemical components. The objective of this study was to determine the
   energy efficiency for raising crops under sprinkler irrigation in a
   semi-arid area. The amount of irrigation water applied was 287 mm for
   winter wheat (Triticum aestivum), 489 mm for dry bean (Phaseolus
   vulgaris), and 857 mm for sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) production. The
   total energy consumption was calculated for winter wheat, dry bean, and
   sugar beet production systems including the manufacture of fertilizer
   seeds, plant protection substances, and machinery, and all on-farm
   activities. Energy output in the form of the harvested products was
   calculated using the calorific value of grain, bean, and beet. Total
   energy input was 19,267 MJ/ha for winter wheat, 21,977 MJ/ha for dry
   bean, and 38, 100 MJ/ha for sugar beet plant. The efficiency of energy
   production was computed to be 3.86, 2.37, and 7.74 MJ/MJ, respectively,
   for winter wheat, dry bean, and sugar beet. The calculation of the
   energy efficiency factor of irrigation application revealed that the
   amount of energy obtained through the increase in harvested products due
   to irrigation exceeds 4.85, 3.63, and 11.65 times the energy input
   through irrigation application, respectively, for winter wheat, dry
   bean, and sugar beet. Results of this study indicate that energy input
   for irrigation should be reduced to increase efficiency of energy
   production. In practice, energy requirement for irrigation can be
   reduced up to 78\% by switching from sprinkler irrigation to surface
   irrigation. In our semi-arid area, most of the areas are suitable for
   this type of irrigation. In addition, drip irrigation, micro-irrigation,
   and other new water and energy-saving irrigation technologies should
   also be considered.}},

Abstract = {{The weaving process in a handmade carpet contains independent knots,
   which have a complex structure. A new production method, mechanism, or
   machine for producing knots in handmade carpets has not been developed
   since thousands of years. They are still woven by human hand. Two
   different types of knots are used to form handmade carpets, which are
   called as the Turkish (Gordes knot) and the Persian (Sehna knot) knots.
   In this article, the conceptual design and dimensional synthesis for
   mechanisms used to produce these knots are studied. To generate
   all-acceptable one-degree of freedom (DOF) and two-DOF planar knotting
   mechanism, a systematic methodology is presented. First, the functional
   requirements of the knotting mechanism are established according to the
   problem statement. Some of the functional requirements of the knotting
   mechanism are then translated into the structural characteristics of
   mechanism. On the basis of the requirements and the structural
   considerations, the unwanted mechanism is screened out. Finally, two
   different mechanisms are developed for the knotting mechanism and their
   dimensions are determined by dimensional synthesis method.}},

Abstract = {{Maize (Zea mays) shortages and maize price instability continue to occur
   in Mozambique in spite of policy reforms and great capacity for
   increased production in northern Mozambique. This study measured the
   efficiency of spatial maize price arbitrage in Mozambique's post-reform
   period. Spatial price inefficiency does not seem to explain why food
   shortages continue to occur in Mozambique, suggesting nonprice market
   constraints such as poor infrastructure and poor market institutions as
   more likely explanations. Baulch's spatial efficiency test indicated
   that it is not profitable to ship maize from northern surplus maize
   regions to southern Mozambique. Records of interregional maize shipments
   show that indeed grain is not being shipped from the north to the south.
   Market liberalization may have improved spatial price efficiency, but
   high transfer costs still limit trade and potential benefits from
   freeing markets. Under these circumstances, food shortages and price
   instability are likely to continue.}},

   The stability domain in air is quite narrow and a phase diagram is
   proposed and compared with previous results. Magnetic study confirmed
   the HS state of Mn3+ ions and revealed that the predominant interactions
   are antiferromagnetic. Their strength decreases with x, which can be
   ascribed to a dilution effect, and long-range 3D magnetic ordering
   observed for CuMnO2, disappears for x > 0.05. The crednerite solid
   solutions are p-type semiconductors. Modeling the thermoelectric power
   behavior suggests that charge carriers are Cu2+ holes diffusing in Cu

   We describe a 41-year-old man who presented with the inability to

   symmetric paralysis of bilateral lower limbs. Laboratory studies showed
   profound hypokalemia with renal potassium (K+) wasting, hyperchloremic
   metabolic acidosis, hypophosphatemia with hyperphosphaturia,
   hypouricemia with hyperuricosuria, and glycosuria, consistent with
   Fanconi syndrome. Mild renal insufficiency was also observed. A
   meticulous search for underlying causes of Fanconi syndrome was
   unrevealing. However, a significant amount of aristolochic acid (AA) was
   detected in the consumed Chinese herb mixture (AA-1, 7 mu g/g) for the
   treatment of his leg edema for the past 2 months. His hypokalemia, renal
   insufficiency, and Fanconi syndrome completely resolved 2 months after

Abstract = {{In 1929, a group of editors affiliated with the Austrian Social
   Democratic Party (SDAP) established Der Kuckuck, a magazine modelled in
   content and format on mainstream boulevard weeklies, but directed
   specifically at a working-class public. Der Kuckuck was one of the few
   SDAP publications that attempted to collaborate with its audience,
   introducing within its first year a photography contest open to all
   readers. The photography contest became a signature feature of the
   magazine and was described by the editors as a means to cultivate
   `Arbeiterfotographie' or workers' photography, a term usually associated
   with the pioneering activities of the German communist magazines
   Arbeiter Illustrierte Zeitung and Arbeiterfotograf. This study explores
   the political and aesthetic contours of `Arbeiterfotographie' in an
   Austrian social democratic context.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate physical fitness in
   relation to fatness in urban and rural Greek children by means of
   allometric scaling.
   Methods: The sample consisted of 360 ( 189 urban and 171 rural; age 12.3
   +/- 0.42 years) boys and 247 ( 125 urban and 122 rural; age 12.3 +/-
   0.43 years) girls. The sample was highly representative ( 32 - 64\%) of
   all 12 year old children registered in the prefecture of Trikala,
   Greece. All volunteers were assessed for BMI and \% body fat, as well as
   sit and reach, basketball throw (BT), vertical jump (VJ), handgrip
   strength (HG), 40 m sprint, agility run, and 20 m shuttle run. To
   correct for possible associations between fatness and fitness, a single
   cause allometric scaling was employed using the natural logarithms (ln)
   of fitness parameters that were significantly correlated with the ln
   body fat.
   Results: Independent-samples t tests revealed that VJ ( p< 0.05) was
   significantly higher in boys living in urban settings compared to their
   rural counterparts. Similarly, BT was found to be significantly better (
   p< 0.05) in urban girls, whereas HG was significantly higher ( p< 0.05)
   in rural girls.
   Conclusion: Considering that ( a) only three out of the 14 possible
   cases ( seven fitness parameters for boys and seven for girls) were
   significantly different between urban and rural children, and (b) these
   differences were not uniformly distributed in children living in either
   urban or rural environments, it is concluded that the place of residence
   has no clear impact on physical fitness as studied herein.}},

Abstract = {{A novel moderately thermophilic methanotroph, strain MYHT, was isolated
   from a hot spring in Japan. The isolate grew on methane or methanol at
   37-67 degrees C, and optimally at 57-59 degrees C. It was found to be a
   Gram-negative aerobe, with colourless colonies of non-motile coccoid
   cells, possessing type I intracytoplasmic membranes and regularly
   arranged surface layers of linear (p2) symmetry. Strain MYHTT expressed
   only the particulate methane monooxygenase and employed the ribulose
   monophosphate pathway for formaldehyde assimilation. It is a
   neutrophilic and halotolerant organism capable of growth at pH
   6(.)5-7(.)5 (optimum pH 6(.)8) and in up to 3\% NaCl (optimum 0(.)5-1 \%
   NaCl). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis
   indicated that strain MYHT T is Most Closely related to the thermophilic
   undescribed methanotroph `Methylothermus' HB (91 \% identity) and the
   novel halophilic methanotroph Methylohalobius crimeensis 10Ki(T) (90\%
   identity). Comparative sequence analysis of particulate methane
   monooxygenase (pmoA) genes also confirmed the clustering of strain MYHTT
   with `Methylothermus' HB and Methylohalobius crimeensis 10Ki(T) (98 and
   92 \% derived amino acid sequence identity, respectively). The DNA G + C
   content was 62(.)5 mol\%. The major cellular fatty acids were C-16:0
   (37(.)2\%) and C-18:1 omega 9c (35(.)2\%) and the major polar lipids
   were phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol. The major
   ubiquinone was Q-8. On the basis of comparative phenotypic and genotypic
   characteristics, a new genus and species, Methylothermus thermalis gen.
   nov., sp. nov., is proposed, with MYHTT as the type strain (=VKM
   B-2345(T)=IPOD FERM P-19714(T)).}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical strength of double network (DN) gels consisting of highly
   cross-linked poly(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid) (PAMPS) as
   the first component and linear polyacrylamide (PAAm) as the second
   component has been investigated by varying the molecular weight of the
   second polymer PAAm, M-w. The experimental results reveal that, for
   toughening of the DN gels, (1) M-w is one of the dominant parameters,
   (2) there is a critical value of M-w = 10(6) for a remarkable
   enhancement: (3) the fracture energy of DN gels with a M-w, larger than
   101 reaches a value as high as 10(3) J/m(2). By plotting the strength of
   DN gels (fracture stress sigma and fracture energy G) against a
   characteristic parameter of c{[}eta]. where c is the average
   concentration of PAAm in the DN gels and {[}eta] is the intrinsic
   viscosity of PAAm. it is found that the dramatic increase in the
   mechanical strength of the DN gels occurs above the region where linear
   PAAm chains are entangled with each other. Thus, we conclude that the
   entanglement between the second component PAAm plays an important role
   of the toughening mechanism of DN gels. This result supports the
   heterogeneous model, which predicts the presence of ``voids{''} of the
   first network PAMPS with a size much larger than the radius of the
   second polymer PAAm.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{112}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objectives - The relationship between the frequency of autonomic
   dysfunction (AD) and the severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary
   disease (COPD) has not been exactly known, despite its importance in the
   pathogenesis of COPD. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the relationship
   between the clinical stage severity of the disease and the frequency of
   AD in COPD patients.
   Methods - The frequency and type of AD were determined according to the
   clinical severity of 35 stable COPD patients. The results were compared
   between the mild and moderate-severe COPD groups. Sympathetic system
   (SS) was evaluated with sympathetic skin response (SSR), QT and QTc
   intervals (ms) analyses. Parasympathetic system was evaluated with the
   heart rate interval variations (RRIV).
   Results - For the total group, an AD was detected in 20 patients (57\%),
   a parasympathetic dysfunction (PD) in 14 (40\%), a mixed-type
   dysfunction in five (14\%) and a sympathetic dysfunction (SD) in only
   one patient (3\%). For the 12 mildly affected patients, there were cases
   of isolated SD in only one patient (8.5\%), isolated PD in five (42\%)
   and AD in six patients (50\%). For the 23 moderate-severe COPD patients,
   mixed AD was detected in five patients (22\%), isolated PD in nine
   (39\%) and AD in 14 patients (61\%). There were no significant
   differences between the two patient groups, neither for isolated
   parasympathetic and sympathetic, mixed form nor for total AD (P > 0.05).
   Conclusion - The results suggested that PD was dominant in patients with
   COPD. However, the frequencies of autonomic parasympathetic and
   sympathetic dysfunction did not increase significantly with the severity
   of COPD. The severity of hypoxemia and/or airflow limitation may not be
   the only unique or definite reason for AD in COPD, as there was not an
   exact correlation between the presence of AD and the severity of airflow
   limitation and hypoxemia.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the inverse problem of in-line holography, applied to
   minimally destructive imaging of cold atom clouds. Absorption imaging
   near resonance provides a simple, but destructive measurement of atom
   column density. Imaging off resonance greatly reduces heating, and
   sequential images may be taken. Under the conditions required for
   off-resonant imaging, the generally intractable inverse problem may be
   linearized. A minimally destructive, quantitative and high-resolution
   image of the atom cloud column density is then retrieved from a single
   diffraction pattern.}},

Abstract = {{While characterizing the agents involved in symptornatology of a
   variegated mint, Mentha x gracilis `Variegata', a nursery plant with
   atypical symptoms was examined. This plant, unlike `Variegata', did not
   exhibit yellow vein banding symptoms but instead had distorted and
   crinkled leaves. Molecular tests for the three viruses found in
   `Variegata' clones failed to detect any of these viruses in the plant.
   Double-stranded RNA was extracted and cloned, disclosing the presence of
   two unknown viruses. One of the viruses was a novel member of the family
   Closteroviridae. The complete nucleotide sequence of the virus,
   designated as Mint virus 1, has been obtained. A detection test was
   developed, and revealed the presence of the virus in several other mint
   clones and species. Genomic regions from three additional isolates were
   examined to investigate the genetic diversity of the virus. Genome and
   phylogenctic analysis placed Mint virus I in the genus Closterovirus and

Title = {{The effects of environmental light-dark changes on experimental mild

Volume = {{112}},

Abstract = {{Objectives - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of
   environmental light-dark changes on the outcome of mild traumatic brain
   injury (MTBI) using an experimental rodent model. The functions of
   endogenous and exogenous melatonin on the outcome of injury were also
   investigated
   Methods - Mild traumatic brain injury was experimentally induced in 56
   male Sprague-Dawley rats using a weight-drop device. Animals were
   divided into four groups of 14 each as follows: (i) sham-operated
   (trauma only, normal day-night cycle), (ii) treated with melatonin
   (trauma + melatonin, normal day-night cycle), (iii) darkness-induced
   (trauma + 48 h constant dark), and (iv) treated with melatonin and
   darkness-induced (trauma + 48 h constant dark + melatonin). Melatonin
   (50 mg/kg) was administered, intraperitoneally, immediately after
   trauma. EEG recordings were taken at three time periods (pretrauma,
   immediately after trauma, and 48 h after trauma). Motor functions were
   tested pretrauma, 24 and 48 h post-trauma. Serum melatonin levels were
   determined pretrauma and 48 h post-trauma. Tissue samples from right
   frontal area were taken 48 h after trauma for light and electron
   microscopic examinations.
   Conclusion - Following MTBI light deprivation alone and light
   deprivation in combination with exogenously administered melatonin
   indicated significant neuroprotective effects. Although there may be
   other important pathways, darkness-induced elevation in endogenous
   melatonin secretion appears to play an important role in this
   neuroprotective outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is derived from xanthosine through
   three successive transfers of methyl groups and a single ribose removal
   in coffee plants. The methyl group transfer is catalyzed by
   N-zmethyltransferases, xanthosine methyltransferase (XMT),
   7-methylxanthine methyltransferase (MXMT) and 3,7-dimethylxanthine
   methyltransferase (DXMT). We previously cloned three genes encoding each
   of these N-methyltransferases from coffee plants, and reconstituted the
   final sequence of the caffeine synthetic pathway in vitro. In the
   present study, we simultaneously expressed these coffee genes in tobacco
   plants (Nicotiana tabacum), using a multiple-gene transfer method, and
   confirmed successful caffeine production up to 5 mu g g(-1) fresh weight
   in leaves of the resulting transgenic plants. Their effects on feeding
   behavior of tobacco cutworms (Spodoptera litura), which damage a wide
   range of crops, were then examined. Leaf disc choice test showed that
   caterpillars selectively fed on the wild-type control materials, or
   positively avoided the transgenic materials. The results suggest a novel
   approach to confer self-defense by producing caffeine in planta. A
   second generation of transgenic crops containing caffeine may save labor
   and agricultural costs and also mitigate the environmental load of
   pesticides in future.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism of structure formation in fibrous oxides with complex
   architectonics, including metal oxide nanoparticles, nanopores, and
   microcapillaries, was established. Synthesis of oxide fibres includes
   two stages. In the first stage, thermal transformation of the polymer
   matrix and dissociation of salts with formation of metal oxides take
   place in heat treatment up to 600 degrees C. Structural wan formations
   of the oxides in the fibres and alteration of their physiochemical
   properties take place in the second stage. The oxide fibres have high
   porosity, a developed surface, and high reactivity due to the nanosize
   factor. Based on calculation of the size of the metal oxide
   crystallites, it was found that crystallographic transformations of the
   oxides cause dispersion of matter. The structural transformations of
   fibrous oxides are accompanied by a change in the character of the
   porosity and pore size. The mechanisms obtained can be used to predict
   the properties and regulate manufacturing technology for nanostructural
   fibrous oxide materials.}},

   and thione esters 2 and 4 compared with their oxygen analogues 1 and 3.
   On the contrary, the common nucleophile OH- is much less reactive
   towards 2 and 4 compared with 1 and 3. The effect of changing both the
   electrophilic center and the nucleofugic center oil the reactivity on
   the other oxygen nucleophiles is not so significant: 4-chlorophenoxide
   (4-ClPhO-) is four to six times more reactive in the reactions with
   thiol and thione esters 2 and 4 compared with their oxygen analogues 1
   and 3. The alpha effects exhibited by butan-2,3-dione monoximate (Ox(-))
   and HOO- are strongly dependent on the nature of the electrophilic
   center of the substrates, indicating that the difference in the
   ground-state solvation energy cannot be fully, responsible for the alpha
   effect. Our results clearly emphasize the strong dependence of the a.
   effect oil the substrate Structure, notably, the nature of file
   electrophilic center. The impact of: change in the nucleofuge (1 -> 2)
   and the electrophilic center (3 -> 4) oil reactivity indicates that
   alpha nucleophiles will need to be ``purpose built{''} for
   decontamination and nucleophilic degradation of specific biocides.}},

Abstract = {{1 Isometric contractile responses to carbachol were studied in ileal
   longitudinal smooth muscle strips from wild-type mice and mice
   genetically lacking M-2 or M-3 muscarinic receptors, in order to
   characterize the mechanisms involved in M-2 and M-3 receptor-mediated
   contractile responses.
   2 Single applications of carbachol (0.1-100 mu M) produced
   concentration-dependent contractions in preparations from M-2-knockout
   (KO) and M-3-KO mice, mediated via M-3 and M-2 receptors, respectively,
   as judged by the sensitivity of contractile responses to blockade by the
   M-2-preferring antagonist methoctramine (300 nM) or the M-3-preferring
   antagonist 4-DAMP (30 nM).
   3 The M-2-mediated contractions were mimicked in shape by submaximal
   stimulation with high K+ concentrations (up to 35 mM), almost abolished
   by voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel (VDCC) antagonists or depolarization
   with 140 mM K+ medium, and greatly reduced by pertussis toxin (PTX)
   treatment.
   4 The M-3-mediated contractions were only partially inhibited by VDCC
   antagonists or 140 mM K+-depolarization medium, and remained unaffected
   by PTX treatment. The contractions observed during high K+
   depolarization consisted of different components, either sensitive or
   insensitive to extracellular Ca2+.
   5 The carbachol contractions observed with wild-type preparations
   consisted of PTX-sensitive and -insensitive components. The
   PTX-sensitive component was functionally significant only at low
   carbachol concentrations.
   6 The results suggest that the M-2 receptor, through PTX-sensitive
   mechanisms, induces ileal contractions that depend on voltage-dependent
   Ca2+ entry, especially associated with action potential discharge, and
   that the M-3 receptor, through PTX-insensitive mechanisms, induces
   contractions that depend on voltage-dependent and -independent Ca2+
   entry and intracellular Ca2+ release. In intact tissues coexpressing M-2
   and M-3 receptors, M-2 receptor activity appears functionally relevant
   only when fractional receptor occupation is relatively small.}},

Abstract = {{The Platelia galactomannan enzyme immunoassay is a commercially
   available nonculture method for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis.
   Recently, steps have been taken to improve sensitivity; specifically, a
   low (0.5 to 0.7) galactomannan index (GMI) value to determine positivity
   has been validated by multiple groups. We evaluated the intra-assay and
   interassay reproducibility at low index levels using three different kit
   lots on three different days in three different microbiology
   laboratories. Clinical and spiked sera were blinded and sent with
   galactomannan enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kits to the participating
   laboratories. We also prospectively collected data on all galactomannan
   EIAs performed between 1 September 2003 and 21 July 2004 at the
   University of Washington Medical Center microbiology laboratory to
   assess reproducibility of clinical samples analyzed in ``real time.{''}
   From the multilaboratory study, a total of 836 results were available
   for evaluation. Reproducibility was excellent between laboratories and
   on different days. Significant variability was seen between runs/lots,
   which may in part be associated with different threshold control values
   in different kits. Among the 1,410 clinical samples that were
   prospectively analyzed, 168 (90\%) were confirmed to be positive on
   repeat testing (GMI, >= 0.5). Among the 19 (10.2\%) initially positive
   samples not confirmed on repeat testing, the majority had a GMI at the
   threshold of the assay (between 0.5 and 0.7). Our findings suggest that
   the Platelia galactomannan immunoassay has good reproducibility.
   However, changes in GMI levels when different kit lots are used, and
   single samples with low-positive (GMI of 0.5 to 0.7) indices, should be
   interpreted with caution.}},

Abstract = {{The early stages of development of Bathylagichthys parini Kobyliansky,
   1990 are described for the first time on the basis of 69 larvae
   collected in the fjords of Chilean Patagonia. Morphometric and meristic
   data were obtained from a series of larvae between 5.3 and 25.4 mm in
   body length. Data are presented on the development of pigmentation
   patterns and the sequence of fin formation. The total number of
   vertebrae, fin rays, and branchiostegal rays in the more developed
   larvae coincided with those observed in adults of B. parini described
   for the Pacific Ocean bordering Chile, and Bathylagichthys australis
   Kobyliansky, 1990 from the south central Pacific and Indian oceans.
   Comparative details of the development of the supraorbital bone in
   relation to the orbit are useful in separating both species, as this
   characteristic in the transforming specimen described here is consistent
   with B. parini. Larvae of B. parini are differentiated from other
   species of Bathylagidae in the region by having elliptical eyes with
   ventral choroid tissue in the form of a teardrop and three
   branchiostegal rays instead of two. Also, they develop non-pedunculate
   eyes. Adults of B. parini have been recorded from the SE Pacific at 42
   degrees 59'S, 80 degrees 15'W and also from fjords of southern Chile.}},

Abstract = {{On hillsides of semiarid catchments regular bands of vegetation have
   been observed to form under low rainfall conditions.. Many authors have
   observed the existence of a slope gradient threshold below which no
   banded patterns were observed; this in creases with the mean annual
   rainfall. A simple model for soil moisture balance and vegetation
   growth, explicitly accounting for basic soil physics- is demonstrated
   and discussed. The influence of relevant soil characteristics on
   vegetation patterns and their patchiness is addressed by linear
   stability analysis. The results confirm the experimental evidence of a
   threshold slope gradient depending on the mean annual net water supply,
   and demonstrate the influence of the soil properties (saturated
   conductivity and capillary rise) on the stability condition and on the
   threshold slope. Nevertheless, the concluding remark concerns the
   oversimplified models for vegetation patterns, such as the one discussed
   here, that require properly defined effective soil parameters in order
   to become predictive tools. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The study compared the neural bases of two cognitive control
   operations, interference suppression and response inhibition, between
   children with and children without attention deficit hyperactivity
   disorder ( ADHD).
   Method: Ten children ( 7 - 11 years of age) with combined-type ADHD and
   10 comparison subjects matched for age and gender underwent rapid
   event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI) during
   performance of a modified flanker task. Functional maps were generated
   through group averaging and performance-based correlational analyses.
   Results: Interference suppression in ADHD subjects was characterized by
   reduced engagement of a frontal-striatal-temporal-parietal network that
   subserved healthy performance. In contrast, response inhibition
   performance relied upon different regions in the two groups,
   frontal-striatal in comparison subjects but right superior temporal in
   ADHD children.
   Conclusions: Alteration in the neural basis of two cognitive control
   operations in childhood ADHD was characterized by distinct, rather than
   unitary, patterns of functional abnormality. Greater between-group
   overlap in the neural network activated for interference suppression
   than in response inhibition suggests that components of cognitive
   control are differentially sensitive to ADHD. The ADHD children's
   inability to activate the caudate nucleus constitutes a core abnormality
   in ADHD. Observed functional abnormalities did not result from prolonged
   stimulant exposure, since most children were medication naive.}},

Abstract = {{Anthocyanins are the largest group of plant pigments responsible for

   well-defined stage of flower development. Treatment of detached flowers
   with protein and mRNA synthesis inhibitors, at specific stages of flower
   development, prevented degradation. In addition, treatment of detached
   flowers with cytokinins delayed senescence without changing the rate of
   anthocyanin degradation, suggesting that degradation of anthocyanins is
   not part of the general senescence process of the flowers but rather a
   distinctive and specific pathway. Based on studies on anthocyanin
   degradation in wine and juices, peroxidases are reasonable candidates
   for the in vivo degradation. A significant increase in peroxidase
   activity was shown to correlate in time with the rate of anthocyanin
   degradation. An additional indication that oxidative enzymes are
   involved in the process is the fact that treatment of flowers with
   reducing agents, such as DTT and glutathione, caused inhibition of
   degradation. This study represents the first step in the elucidation of
   the molecular mechanism behind in vivo anthocyanin degradation in
   plants.}},

Abstract = {{Uranium-lead zircon (laser ablation multicollector ICP-MS spot analysis)
   ages from La Caridad porphyry copper deposit in the Nacozari District,
   Northeastern Sonora, Mexico, suggest a short period of magmatism,
   between 55.5 and 52.6 Ma. Two U-Pb ages from the mineralized quartz
   monzonite unit, showing different textural characteristics, yielded
   indistinguishable crystallization ages (similar to 54 Ma), and indicate
   that the intrusion responsible for the mineralization occurred as a
   single large complex unit, instead of multiple pulses of magmatism. Some
   zircons analyzed also show inherited ages in cores recording dates of
   112-124 Ma, 141-166 Ma and 1.4 Ga. The Re-Os molybdenite ages from the
   potassic and phyllic hydrothermal alteration veins yielded identical
   ages within error, 53.6 +/- 0.3 Ma and 53.8 +/- 0.3 Ma, respectively
   (weighted average of 53.7 +/- 0.21 Ma), supporting a restricted period
   for the mineralization. The geochronological data thus indicate a
   short-lived magmatic and hydrothermal system. The inherited zircons of
   Precambrian and Late Jurassic-Mid Cretaceous age found in the intrusive
   rocks of La Caridad deposit, can be explained considering two possible
   scenarios within the tectonic/magmatic evolution of the area. The first
   scenario considers the presence of a Precambrian anorogenic granitic
   basement that is intruded by Mesozoic (Jurassic-Cretaceous) units
   present beneath the La Caridad deposit. The second scenario suggests
   that the Mesozoic Glance Conglomerate Formation of Arizona underlies the
   Palcocene volcanic-igneous pile in the La Caridad area.}},

Abstract = {{Background: QR-333, a topical compound that contains quercetin, a
   flavonoid with aldose reductase inhibitor effects, ascorbyl palmitate,
   and vitamin D-3, was formulated to decrease the oxidative stress that
   contributes to peripheral diabetic neuropathy and thus alleviate its
   symptoms. This proof-of-principle study assessed the efficacy and safety
   of QR-333 against placebo in a small cohort of patients with diabetic
   neuropathy. Methods: This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind
   trial included 34 men and women (21-71 years of age) with Type 1 or 2
   diabetes and diabetic neuropathy who applied QR-333 or placebo (2:1
   ratio), three times daily for 4 weeks, to each foot where symptoms were
   experienced. Five-point scales were used to determine changes from
   baseline to endpoint in symptoms and quality of life (efficacy). Safety
   was assessed through concomitant medications, adverse events, laboratory
   evaluations, and physical examinations. Results: QR-333 reduced the
   severity of numbness, jolting pain, and irritation from baseline values.
   Improvements were also seen in overall and specific quality-of-life
   measures. QR-333 was well tolerated. Eleven patients in the QR-333 group
   reported 23 adverse events (all mild or moderate); 4 in the placebo
   group reported 5 events (all moderate). One patient who applied QR-333
   noted a pricking sensation twice, the only adverse event considered
   possibly related to study treatment. Conclusions: From this preliminary
   safety study, it appears that QR-333 may safely offer relief of symptoms
   of diabetic neuropathy and improve quality of life. These findings
   warrant further investigation of this topical compound. (C) 2005

Abstract = {{The development of neural network models has greatly enhanced the
   comprehension of cognitive phenomena. Here, we show that models using
   multiplicative processing of inputs are both powerful and simple to
   train and understand. We believe they are valuable tools for cognitive
   explorations. Our model can be viewed as a subclass of networks built on
   sigma-pi units and we show how to derive the Kronecker product
   representation from the classical sigma-pi unit. We also show how the
   connectivity requirements of the Kronecker product can be relaxed
   considering statistical arguments. We use the multiplicative network to
   implement what we call an Elman topology, that is, a simple recurrent
   network (SRN) that supports aspects of language processing. As an
   application, we model the appearance of hallucinated voices after
   network damage, and show that we can reproduce results previously
   obtained with SRNs concerning the pathology of schizophrenia. (c) 2005

   several carbohydrates as carbon source. It was not able to reduce
   nitrate. Aesculin hydrolysis was negative. It did not produce urease,
   arginine dihydrolase, gelatinase or beta-galactosidase. The DNA G + C

Abstract = {{Objective
   To compare early and late responses to highly active antiretroviral
   therapy (HAART) in European and non-European HIV-1 infected patients in
   a Dutch cohort.
   Methods
   We retrospectively analysed the response to HAART of 216 previously
   treatment-naive HIV-1-infected patients using the University Medical
   Centre Utrecht HIV database. African (n = 51), Asian (n = 7), and
   Central/South American (n = 6) patients were classified as non-European,
   and others as European (n = 152). Early failure was defined as a viral
   load that remained above 400 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL after 6 months of
   treatment with HAART. Late-phase failure was determined in patients who
   were successfully treated in the early phase and was defined as two
   consecutive viral load measurements above 400 copies/mL, a new
   AIDS-defining event or death.
   Results
   In the early phase, four of 152 (2.6\%) European and eight of 64
   (12.5\%) non-European patients failed HAART. A significant increased
   risk of virological failure in the early phase of treatment was observed
   for non-Europeans as compared to Europeans (odds ratio 4.6; 95\%
   confidence interval 1.1-20.2). Low serum drug levels in the absence of
   resistant virus were often seen at the time of early failure. No
   difference in late-phase failure was observed between the two groups
   (adjusted hazard ratio 0.6; 95\% confidence interval 0.3-1.2).
   Conclusions
   Non-European patients had a 4.6 times higher risk of virological failure
   than their European counterparts in the first 6 months of treatment with
   HAART. This failure seemed to be associated with low serum drug levels
   at the time of failure. However, if HAART was successful in the early
   phase, response rates in the late phase were similar for Europeans and
   non-Europeans.}},

Journal = {{BURNS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was threefold: (1) Assess the pressure loss of two
   types of pressure garments that are used in the treatment of
   hypertrophic scars after burn injury, (2) investigate the influence of
   two different levels of compression on erythema and thickness of burn
   scars and (3) examine the association between erythema and thickness.
   The study was a prospective trial in which 76 burn scars in 60 patients
   were objectively assessed with the Minolta Chromameter CR-300 for
   erythema and with the Dermascan C for thickness of the scar over a
   period of 3 months. Each patient was randomly assigned to a ``normal{''}
   or ``lower{''} compression class treatment, with respectively mean
   values of 15 and 10 mmHg pressure after wearing the garment for 1 month.
   Measurements for both parameters were taken at 0, 1, 2 and 3 months of
   treatment.
   Pressure garments with ``normal{''} compression did lose significantly
   more compression over 1 month (4.82 mmHg) than did the garments from the
   low compression class (2.57 mmHg).
   Scars that were treated with garments from a ``normal{''} compression
   class did score significantly better for thickness compared to the
   ``low{''} compression class. The difference in thickness was most
   evident at 1 month. Thereafter no further significant improvement
   between the two different treatments over time could be obtained. This
   difference was not found for erythema.
   Positive correlations could be found between erythema and thickness
   values at all of the three test points while changes in erythema and
   thickness only correlated significantly after the first month.
   The pattern of change of both parameters correlated at a high level of
   significance after 3 months of treatment.
   These data suggest that pressure garments that deliver a pressure of at
   least 15 mmHg pressure tend to accelerate scar maturation and that
   measurements of the pattern of change of the erythema can be used to
   predict changes in scar thickness and vice versa. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd
