Abstract = {{Increased visceral fat accumulation is a strong predictor of arterial
   hypertension. In this study, we explored the hypothesis that increased
   hepatic portal venous free fatty acid delivery results in increased
   blood pressure. Such an effect might explain the link between visceral
   obesity and hypertension. In nine conscious, instrumented rats, we
   studied the effects of 1-hour infusions of sodium oleate solution into
   the portal and femoral veins and infusions of sodium caprylate solution
   into the portal vein on 3 separate days. Basal blood pressure was not
   significantly different on the 3 study days. Mean arterial pressure
   increased 29+/-4 mm Hg during portal oleate infusion and 13+/-2 mm Hg
   during femoral oleate infusion (both significant increases over basal,
   P<.001). Mean arterial pressure did not change during portal caprylate
   infusion. The increase during portal oleate infusion was greater than
   that during femoral oleate infusion (P=.028). Heart rate rose during all
   three infusions; the increase was greatest during portal oleate infusion
   (334+/-4 to 412+/-2 beats per minute). During portal venous oleate
   infusion in five rats, plasma norepinephrine rose from 2.17+/-0.34 to
   3.58+/-0.50 nmol/L, epinephrine rose from 0.79+/-0.28 to 1.84+/-0.44
   nmol/L, and corticosterone rose from 147+/-55 to 1130+/-289 nmol/L.
   Three rats given portal venous oleate infusions for 1 week had increased
   blood pressure compared with baseline (mean increase, 16+/-4 mm Hg).
   These studies indicate that increases in portal venous fatty acid
   concentrations have significant presser effects, perhaps mediated by
   increased sympathetic tone. Chronic increases in portal venous fatty
   acid levels may be responsible for the hypertension that accompanies
   visceral obesity.}},

Abstract = {{Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a glycoprotein thought to be involved in
   processes leading to mineral formation in tissues like bone and
   cementum. In the rat molar periodontium, several regions are associated
   with the formation of cementum (periodontal ligament, inner part of the
   gingiva), whereas other areas are not (e.g., the outer part of the
   gingiva just beneath the outer oral epithelium). In an attempt to
   establish how the spatial distribution of ALP activity relates to
   cementum formation, we assessed the activity of the enzyme
   quantitatively in the periodontium of the rat maxillary molars, by using
   the indoxyl-tetrazolium salt method. It appeared that the distribution
   of enzyme activity in the Ligament was heterogeneous, indicating local
   variations in the phosphate household. Highest activity was found in
   areas related to mineralization, adjacent to the alveolar bone and
   cementum. Enzyme activity was higher adjacent to cellular cementum than
   to acellular cementum. With respect to acellular cementum, a highly
   significant positive correlation was found between ALP activity and
   cementum thickness, which indicates a close relationship between local
   phosphate production and cementum formation rate. An interesting
   observation in the connective tissue of the gingiva mesial to the first
   molar was a sharp demarcation between an ALP-positive inner part,
   adjacent to the tooth, and an ALP-negative outer part, underneath the
   outer oral epithelium. In the interdental gingiva, the entire connective
   tissue proved positive for the enzyme, suggesting that this region
   consists of the combined inner gingival parts of two adjacent teeth.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper describes a modified TRH stimulation test for the
   diagnosis of canine hypothyroidism. Thyroid function is difficult to
   assess with basal thyroid hormone levels, however bovine TSH is no
   longer available for stimulation tests, and there is considerable
   controversy as to the validity acid practical aspects of a TRH test.
   Therefore we studied in healthy animals the dose-response relationship
   and the kinetics of T4 release after TRH. We could show that the T4
   maximum occured 2-3 h after an optimal dose of 10 mu g TRH/kg
   intravenously. Using this method (blood samples at 0, 2, and 3h) we
   studied 65 dogs with clinical symptoms of hypothyroidism. We were able
   to define criteria to classify 66 \% of the patients to be euthyroid, 23
   \% to be hypothyroid, and 11 \% as ambigous. This diagnosis could be
   verified by the success of a levothyroxin substitution therapy: in 9 out
   of 10 dogs all clinical signs of the disease were reversed after
   treatment. Sequential testing with TSH and TRH of the thyroid function
   in another 9 patients revealed good agreement of the two test
   procedures. From these data we conclude that the TRH stimulation test is
   both practicable and reliable in assessing thyroid function in the dog
   which will be particularly useful in view of the availability of canine
   TSH assays in the near future.}},

   with formic acid in benzene to give the first stable organopalladium
   formates, {[}L(2)Pd(2)(R)2(mu-HCOO)(2)] (1, R = Ph; 2, R = Me). Addition
   of L to 1 and 2 results in the formation of the less stable, but still
   isolable, {[}L(2)Pd(R)(HCOO)] (3, R = Ph; 4, R = Me). Complexes 1-4 have
   been characterized by elemental analysis and NMR and IR spectral data.
   The structure of 2 has been,confirmed by X-ray analysis of its 1:1.5
   benzene solvate: monoclinic, space group P2(1)/n; a = 9.785(4) Angstrom,
   b = 24.909(8) Angstrom, c = 18.854(7) Angstrom, beta = 102.92(3)degrees;
   V = 4479(3) Angstrom, Z = 4; D-calcd = 1.441 g/cm(3); R = 0.044, R(w) =
   0.066. The thermal decomposition of 4-4 in benzene or toluene at 30-55
   degrees C gives CO2, RH, and highly reactive {[}L(n)Pd] (n = 1, 2). An
   exchange between the sigma-Me groups and phenyls of the PPh(3) ligand is
   observed in the course of the thermal decomposition of 2 in toluene at
   55 degrees C. The thermolysis of 1 in the presence of PhI gives rise to
   {[}L(2)Pd(2)(Ph)(2)(mu-I)(2)] (5); likewise, the decomposition of 2 in
   the presence of Mel furnishes {[}L(2)Pd(2)(Me)(2)(mu-I)(2)] (6).
   However, when 1 is decomposed in the presence of Mel, both 5 and 6 are
   formed, with the ratio of 5 to 6 being higher at higher concentrations
   of MeI. A similar effect is observed when 2 is thermolyzed in the
   presence of PhI. This `'reverse'' selectivity leads to the recognition
   of two distinct mechanisms governing the Pd-catalyzed reductive
   dehalogenation of aryl halides with formate anion.}},

Abstract = {{Apoclada, a genus of woody bamboos endemic to the southern half of
   Brazil, includes three species, A. arenicola, A. cannavieira, and A.
   simplex. A fourth species, A. diversa, was found to be based on a
   teratological specimen of A. simplex and is, therefore, included within
   it. Cladistic analysis based primarily on morphological and anatomical
   characters was conducted within the genus. The presence of multiple
   primary branch buds in the midculm branch nodes constitutes an
   autapomorphy for the genus. Lack of fusoid cells may also be an
   autapomorphy for the genus. The two cerrado endemics, A, arenicola and
   A. cannavieira, are hypothesized to share a more recent common ancestor
   with each other than either shares with A. simplex. Synapomorphies
   supporting the clade of the two cerrado species include fire adaptation
   and unforked stomatal papillae. All three species each have at least one
   autapomorphy and are considered to be monophyletic. Mapped

Abstract = {{A case of pneumocephalus in a 45-year-old male with undifferentiated
   rhinopharyngeal carcinoma is described. The patient was initially
   subjected to radiotherapy and then to transmaxillary resection and a
   second course of stereotactic radiotherapy for recurrent disease.
   Lastly, the patient was treated with chemotherapy because of
   local-regional disease progression, After two cycles of cisplatin,
   adria-blastine and bleomycin, the patient suddenly entered in coma.
   Cerebral CT scan evidenced the presence of air in the frontal and
   lateral cornua, in the subarachnoid space of the base cisternae
   extending to the 7th cervical vertebra. After 8 months of a clinical
   stationary condition, the patient died. The various treatments used are
   critically reviewed, and modern therapeutic approaches for the neoplasm
   and the toxicity involved are discussed. We conclude that in
   nasopharyngeal carcinoma, for patients who relapse after radiotherapy,
   successive focal-regional therapies (surgery, re-irradation) should be
   carefully evaluated to avoid demolishing treatments, which are burdened
   with severe side effects that might influence the quality of life with
   only slight improvement of overall survival. Furthermore, the presence
   of persistant aqueous rhinorrhea in these patients should be carefully
   evaluated, because it could be an early symptom of a cerebrospinal fluid
   leak.}},

   calculations utilizing the RHF/3-21G{*} and RHF/6-31G{*} basis sets. The

   Since the gauche has twice the multiplicity of the trans form it is
   unlikely that the trans conformer will be detected in the fluid phases
   at room temperature. This is supported by the fact that no infrared or
   Raman bands were found to vanish in the spectra of the crystalline

   It was therefore concluded that the Fox equation should be used only as

Abstract = {{The heterogeneity of schizophrenia constitutes an impediment in the
   identification of reliable biological markers of the illness and
   aetiological factors. The two syndrome concept of the illness has proved
   a powerful stimulus in this endeavour. There is however evidence now to
   regard this construct as inadequate and in need of refinement. Using a
   sample of young patients with early onset of illness who fulfilled the
   Research Diagnostic Criteria for schizophrenia, we have shown that three
   rather than two dimensions better describe the pathology of the illness.
   The results of factor analysis showed these syndromes, termed
   disorganization, positive, and negative syndromes, to account for 65\%
   of the total variance of the psychopathology of the disorder. The
   negative syndrome was associated with disturbed pre-morbid functioning
   while the disorganization syndrome bore significant association with
   early onset of illness, poorer socio-educational attainment, and
   impairment on neuropsychological tests, especially those designed to
   evaluate frontal lobe functioning. The positive syndrome was not
   associated with any of the assessed variables. These results provide
   strong support for the validity of the three-syndrome construct even
   among a sample of non-institutionalized patients.}},

   factors of Bk distribution between the PbO2-containing resin and
   CH3CN-HNO3-TOPO solutions are considerably lower than the distribution
   factors of other TPEs, which is due to oxidation of Bk(III) into Bk(IV).
   This fact can be used for separation of Bk(IV) from other TPEs with a

Abstract = {{Global mapped data of reflected radiation in the visible (0.63 mu m) and
   near-infrared (0.85 mu m) wavebands of the Advanced Very High Resolution
   Radiometer (AVHRR) onboard National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration satellites have been collected as the global vegetation
   index (GVI) dataset since 1982. Its primary objective has been
   vegetation studies (hence its title) using the normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI) calculated from the visible and near-IR data.
   The second-generation GVI, which started in April 1985, has also
   included brightness temperatures in the thermal IR (11 and 12 mu m) and
   the associated observation-illumination geometry. This multiyear,
   multispectral, multisatellite dataset is a unique tool for global land
   studies. At the same time, it raises challenging remote sensing and data
   management problems with respect to uniformity in time, enhancement of
   signal-to-noise ratio, retrieval of geophysical parameters from
   satellite radiances, and large data volumes. The authors explored a
   four-level generic structure for processing AVHRR data-the first two
   levels being remote sensing oriented and the other two directed at
   environmental studies-and will describe the present status of each
   level. The uniformity of GVI data was improved by applying an updated
   calibration, and noise was reduced by applying a more accurate
   cloud-screening procedure. In addition to the enhanced weekly data
   (recalibrated with appended quality/cloud flags), the available land
   environmental products include monthly 0.15 degrees-resolution global
   maps of top-of-theatmosphere visible and near-IR reflectances, NDVI,
   brightness temperatures, and a precipitable water index for April
   1985-September 1994. For the first time, a 5-yr monthly climatology
   (means and standard deviations) of each quantity was produced. These
   products show strong potential for detecting and analyzing largescale
   spatial and seasonal land variability. The data can also be used for
   educational purposes to illustrate the annual global dynamics of
   vegetation cover, albedo, temperature, and water vapor. Development of
   the GVI data product contributes to the activities of the International
   Geosphere-Biosphere Programme and Global Energy and Water Cycle
   Experiment and, in particular, to the International Satellite Land
   Surface Climatology Project. Monthly standardized anomalies of the GVI
   variables have been calculated for April 1985-present and are routinely
   produced on UNIX workstations, thus providing a prototype land
   monitoring system. Standardized anomalies clearly indicate that strong
   signals at the land surface, such as droughts and floods and their
   teleconnections with such global environmental phenomena as El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation, can be detected and analyzed. The monitoring
   of relatively small year-to-year variability is, however, contingent on
   the removal of residual trends/noise in GVI data, which are of the order
   of the analyzed effects.}},

Abstract = {{In standard parameter bounding identification a time-domain bound on the
   noise signal is used to construct parameter bounds. One of the
   properties of this standard approach is that there is no consistency if
   a conservative noise bound has been chosen. It is shown that alternative
   bounds on the noise signal give rise to consistent parameter bounding
   identification methods; i.e., asymptotically in the number of data
   samples, the feasible parameter set converges to the true parameter
   vector. The first alternative noise bound that is introduced is a bound
   on the cross-covariance between the noise and some instrumental (input)
   signal. The noise bound is represented by a small number of linear
   inequalities, which can be used in parameter bounding by linear
   programming. It is shown that there is consistency under fairly general
   conditions, even when a conservative bound has been chosen.
   Additionally, a procedure is presented to estimate the cross-covariance
   bound from data. Similar consistency results are shown for two other
   types of noise bounds: a bound on the discrete Fourier transform of the
   noise in combination with sinusoidal excitation, and a time-domain bound
   on the noise after measurement averaging with periodic excitation.}},

   were as likely to occur subsequent to a failure event as an ischemic
   event; for both encainide-flecainide and moricizine, the vast majority
   of excess deaths appeared to be the result of an increase in arrhythmia

Abstract = {{Within the past 11 years, 11 patients with opsoclonus and myoclonus,
   with or without a history of neuroblastoma, have been admitted to
   Children's Memorial Hospital, Eight of the 11 children had an occult
   neuroblastoma, Eight children have had subsequent delayed development
   with motor incoordination and speech delay (7 with neuroblastoma, 1
   without). Nine of 11 children initially were treated with ACTH, 1 child
   was treated with prednisone, and 1 was not treated, Nine of the 10
   children who were treated had recurrences of symptoms during the gradual
   withdrawal or discontinuation of ACTH, Often the ACTH had to be
   restarted or increased, although several times the episodes were
   self-limited, not requiring treatment after ACTH was withdrawn, We found
   prednisone was ineffective in controlling opsoclonus-myoclonus
   regardless of etiology, The majority of children with
   opsoclonus-myoclonus, regardless of etiology, have developmental delay,
   more severe and at a higher rate than previously reported, When a
   neuroblastoma was present, tumor removal did not improve symptoms.
   Although limited in size, our study indicates patients with

Abstract = {{This paper seeks to increase our understanding on the fluid mechanics
   and heat transfer in a transitional mixed convection flow between two
   vertical plates. Direct numerical simulation by the spectral method,
   with a weak formulation, is used to solve the transient 3-D
   Navier-Stokes equations and energy equation. Initial disturbances
   consist of the finite-amplitude 2-D Tollmien-Schlichting wave and two
   3-D oblique waves. The transition phenomena in a mixed-convection flow
   can be significantly different from the isothermal flow. Disturbance
   competitions among different modes are also found to be different from
   those known for an isothermal flow. In a mixed-convection flow, there
   exist thresholds for the low-mode Fourier. waves. The intensified
   vortices are concentrated left of the central surface between the two
   plates. Hairpin vortices are formed with high Ri. Based on the flow
   visualization, the lambda vortices are found to be staggered on the
   surfaces parallel to the plates. The Ri number seems to be the main
   parameter governing the transition mechanism. The Nu number is found to
   increase during transition.}},

Abstract = {{One to three coexisting micas with relatively high barium content,
   particularly in grain rims where coexisting celsian or hyalophane are
   present, have been found in jadeitites, albitites, and micaceous rocks
   from a serpentinite-matrix melange along the Motagua Valley of
   Guatemala. Barian phengitic muscovite and/or phlogopite, with 0.4 to
   over 4 wt. \% BaO, (+/- paragonite) are found in the jadeitites. Barian
   phengite, from 1.2 to 8.9 wt. \% BaO (0.25 cats per interlayer site),
   dominates in mica-rich rocks where celsian, cymrite, hyalophane and
   barite are minor but common. Compared to other reports of barian micas
   coexisting with Ba phases, the BaO values here are lower, probably due
   to low contents of Cr, Ti and Mn, lower formation temperatures and
   higher formation pressures. Barium content in phengite always exceeds
   that in coexisting phlogopite (D-Ph/Phl(Ba) = 1.2 to 9.5) which is
   likely due to the steric effects of high Mg and Si content in phengite
   and low Fe, Mn, and Ti in phlogopite. Coexisting paragonite and late
   stage preiswerkite have low but not always negligible barium content, as
   high as 0.3 wt. \% BaO.
   The exchange (BaAlK-1Si-1)-Al-{[}4] is most commonly observed for zoning
   of Ba in micas. However, correlated phengite exchange,
   (MgSiAl-1Al-1)-Mg-{[}6]-Si-{[}4]-Al-{[}6]-Al-{[}4], in certain rocks
   leads to an effective Ba-{[}6](Mg,Fe2+)(K-1Al-1)-Al-{[}6] exchange which
   indicates a positive P/T growth trajectory and a pressure-volume
   limitation for increased tetrahedral aluminum in the mica structure.}},

Abstract = {{Ammonia transport in cropping systems can affect atmospheric pollution,
   soil-plant N relationships, and crop N-use efficiency. The purpose of
   this study was to evaluate the N dynamics of a corn (Zea mays L.,
   Pioneer hybrid 3379) cropping system and determine the effect of NH3
   transport and crop NH3 compensation point on N relations in the crop.
   Soil and plant N measurements were made during the growing season along
   with plant-atmosphere NH3 transport using flux-gradient
   micrometeorological techniques. The crop generally emitted NH3
   throughout the season when the atmospheric NH3 concentrations were near
   background levels. During periods of high atmospheric NH3
   concentrations, the crop absorbed significant amounts of NH3 from the
   atmosphere. Net seasonal NH3 transport was determined to be a small
   loss, based on the number of measurement periods throughout the growing
   season; however, N isotope studies in a nearby field estimated
   significant NH3 losses. Nitrogen isotope studies cannot account for the
   substitution of (NH3)-N-14 absorbed from the atmosphere for volatilized
   (NH3)-N-15. These results indicate that care must be taken when using N
   isotopes to evaluate N losses from cropping systems when plants are
   actively growing. Nitrous oxide flux was measured late in the cropping
   season, but showed small denitrification losses during the measurement
   period. The crop NH3 compensation point varied during the time of day
   and with respect to soil-plant-atmosphere influence. Net NH3 transport
   accounted for little of the N lost from this cropping system.}},

   P-9-P-14 interpeak latencies did not change, while the P-14-N-18 and
   P-14-N-20 intervals tended to be slightly prolonged on the severely
   affected side. The amplitude ratios of P-14 and N-20, evaluated by
   dividing the amplitude on the severely affected side by that on the
   unaffected or less severely affected side, were significantly smaller
   than that of the cervical N-13/P-13 component. The amplitude ratios of
   N-18 and N-13/P-13 did not differ significantly, and a preserved N-18
   With a depressed P-14 in 2 cases indicates separate generators. A
   characteristic change of P-14 in medial medullary infarction is that its

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine whether adolescent girls with
   panic attacks not selected on the basis of seeking treatment, have the
   associated symptomatology that characterizes patients with panic
   symptoms from clinical samples. The sample consisted of 713 sixth- and
   seventh-grade girls who were administered a structured interview and
   questionnaire to assess panic symptoms, agoraphobic avoidance, school
   refusal, depression, and substance use. The 40 subjects reporting panic
   attacks were matched for age, pubertal status, and ethnicity with 120
   comparison subjects. School refusal and depressive symptoms were more
   common among those having experienced a panic attack compared with those
   in the matched comparison group. Agoraphobic avoidance and substance use
   were not associated with panic. If replicated, panic attacks should be
   considered in the differential diagnosis for young adolescent girls
   presenting with school refusal, particularly since adolescents rarely
   volunteer symptoms of panic.}},

Abstract = {{High-technology markets represent unique problems for organizational
   buyers and, in turn, for their existing and potential vendors. These
   problems are due to high levels of uncertainty and the presence of
   switching costs tied to existing technologies or vendors. The authors
   focus on two aspects of buyer decision making in such markets: (1)
   whether buyers include new vendors at the consideration stage of the
   process and (2) whether they switch to new vendors at the choice stage.
   Using survey data from organizational buyers' purchases of computer
   workstation equipment, the authors present a joint test of the
   antecedent conditions that influence the two processes. Based on a
   sequential legit model, they show that individual antecedents have
   different effects on consideration and switching behavior. The authors
   then discuss the implications of their study for the literatures on
   high-technology markets and organizational buyer behavior.}},

   a `'pressure apophysis''. The muscle forces acting on the trochanter
   apophysis can be combined as a trochanteric resultant R(T) This
   Stimulates a lateral-cranial growth of the trochanter apophysis. The

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: Periocular injection of corticosteroids is a common treatment
   for vision loss in patients with intermediate uveitis. However, this
   treatment has the potential for serious side effects. We sought to
   determine the effects of such injections in a series of patients.
   METHODS: We reviewed charts of 20 consecutive patients (20 eyes, 43
   injections) who had received posterior subtenon injections of
   triamcinolone acetonide for treatment of intermediate uveitis. We
   collected data on visual outcome and side effects.
   RESULTS: Median follow-up was 23.5 months (range, one to 50 months).
   Snellen visual acuity improved by at least two lines in 12 (67\%) of 18
   patients who were examined after initial injection. Median time to
   improvement was three weeks. Patients with visual improvement had a
   median age of 29.0 years, compared with 41.5 years for nonresponders (P
   = .024), There was a weak association between response to treatment and
   a history of not smoking (P = .073) after correction for patient age.
   Increase of intraocular pressure (> 21 mm Hg) occurred in six patients
   (30\%), with onset at a median of three weeks after initial injection;
   the median interval to peak increase (median, 32 mm Hg; range, 25 to 40
   mm Hg) was 14 weeks after the injection.
   CONCLUSIONS: A subtenon injection of triamcinolone acetonide appears to
   be an effective treatment for decreased vision associated with
   intermediate uveitis but may contribute to increase of intraocular
   pressure in some patients with this disorder.}},

   step of rat hepatocarcinogenesis. We have also shown that SCEs return to
   normal values during the promotion and the progression stages. In the
   present study, we evaluated the clastogenic activity of
   diethylnitrosamine (DEN) during initiation, promotion and progression of
   rat hepatocarcinogenesis. We measured, at various times after DEN
   administration, the number of micronuclei (MN) produced by the mitotic
   response to partial hepatectomy. The results established that the DEN
   treatment induces a great number of preclastogenic lesions. In
   subcarcinogenic conditions (initiation alone), the number of MN
   expressed after partial hepatectomy remains high regardless of the time
   interval between the end of the DEN treatment and the operation. In this
   condition, the preclastogenic lesions persist for up to 1 year after the
   DEN administration is discontinued. Conversely, in carcinogenic
   conditions (initiation + promotion + progression), the number of MN
   expressed after partial hepatectomy decreases during the promotion and
   progression stages. These observations indicate that promotion and
   progression but not initiation are associated with the expression of
   persistent preclastogenic lesions, resulting in the production of
   chromosomally abnormal hepatocytes.}},

Abstract = {{During the thermal processing of thin films in which low intensity line
   heat sources are used, extended processing times are often required to
   reach steady state (similar to 15 sec). In addition, the melting of the
   him may occur some time after processing has begun, and therefore there
   is no initial melting condition within the film. Tn such cases, computer
   simulations may become very time consuming, and the development of an
   efficient computational method which incorporates the initial formation
   of the melt during processing is necessary, A general technique was
   developed to accurately model two-dimensional heat conduction in a
   multilayer film structure with one-dimensional phase change in one of
   the thin films. These conditions frequently exist in thin film thermal
   processing when the thermal gradient through the thickness of the
   melting film can be considered negligible. The method involves an
   implicit formulation of the modified enthalpy method. The solid/liquid
   interface energy-balance equation is taken into account which allows the
   exact location of the interface to be tracked within a control volume. A
   comparison is made between the explicit and implicit modified methods to
   test efficiency and accuracy. The implicit method is then applied to the
   zone-melting recrystallization of a silicon thin film in a multilayer
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{The issue of whether a traumatic but occult cervical spine fracture can
   exist has generated significant debate in emergency medicine. The
   profound clinical and legal implications of missing an unstable cervical
   spine injury are well known to the emergency care provider. An elderly
   patient who satisfies all of the rigorous criteria for this type of
   injury is discussed. The patient experienced delayed subluxation of her
   acute odontoid fracture during a flexion/extension examination completed
   in the ED, with resultant development of cervical discomfort. Elderly
   victims of trauma with an appropriate mechanism of injury should be
   suspected of subtle or occult neck injuries.}},

   leptomeningeal dissemination. In these patients intracerebral glioma
   tissues obtained at operation and/or autopsy displayed localized

   expressed in the tumor vessels, tumor stroma, and the cytoplasm of tumor
   cells to a high degree throughout all the leptomeningeal tumor tissues
   obtained at autopsy, whereas there was much less expression of GFAP in

Abstract = {{We analyze high quality digital waveform data at stations in Japan from
   the POSEIDON and IRIS broad-band seismograph networks. The analysis of
   multiple ScS waves of the deep event beneath Sakhalin on 12 May 1990
   shows that the orientation of the principal axis of horizontal ScSn
   particle motion is rotated clockwise from NWN-SES to N-S as the number
   of reflections increases. This suggests that the attenuation of the EW
   comp onent is higher than that of th e NS component of ScS waves. The
   spectral ratio ScS2/ScS1 differs between the two horizontal components.
   We estimate the quality factor Qscs of the whole mantle for each
   horizontal component using the decay rate of spectral ratio of
   bandpassed ScS1 and ScS2 phases in the frequency range from 0.01 to 0.03
   Hz. We obtain a higher average Qscs for the N-S component(141 +/- 8)
   than that for the BW component (91 +/- 5). That is, the E-W component
   attenuates more than the N-S component. For upcoming ScS waves the N-S
   direction is nearly parallel to the strike of the subducting slab
   beneath the mantle wedge in the Japanese islands, and the E-W is
   perpendicular to the strike. The up-welling and downgoing flow in the
   mantle wedge due to drag caused by the subduction is likely to cause the
   difference in attenuation between the two directions, in other words,
   azimuthal attenuation anisotropy.}},

Abstract = {{Al-Ni alloy films with an Al to Ni atomic ratio greater than 0.79 were
   prepared via an alternate sputter deposition technique. The formation of
   the alloy films was attributed to the interdiffusion and reaction
   between Al and Ni atoms by the adatom substitution. The crystal
   structures are all in accordance with the equilibrium phase diagram when
   the Al to Ni atomic ratio is greater than 2.30. The film with Al to Ni
   atomic ratio 2.30 is composed of Ni2Al3 and NiAl. A complete NiAl film
   was obtained when the Al to Ni atomic ratio is less than 1.53. The
   crystal structure of the film was reverted to Ni-Al equilibrium phases
   when the -100 V substrate bias was applied during deposition. The films
   with a NiAl structure showed {[}100] and {[}110] preferred orientations
   on the Si and glass substrates, respectively, disregarding the
   application of bias. The application of substrate bias significantly
   reduced the O and N contents and prevented the Al from oxidization.
   However, bias caused an incorporation of Ar and a lowering of Al content
   in the films was also observed. The decrease in Al content by the
   application of bias was attributed to the easier sublimation of Al
   adatoms from the surface than that from the Ni adatoms. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{Objectives. The aim of our study was to compare measurements of
   pulmonary venous Bow velocity obtained either by transesophageal Doppler
   echocardiography or by intravascular catheter Doppler velocimetry.
   Furthermore, the relation among pulmonary venous flow velocity, left
   atrial compliance and left atrial pressure was evaluated.
   Background. Data about the relation between left atrial pressure and
   pulmonary venous Bow velocity are controversial.
   Methods. A total of 32 patients undergoing elective open heart surgery
   for coronary artery bypass grafting were included prospectively in the
   study. Pulmonary venous Bow velocity (Doppler catheter) and left atrial
   pressure (microtip pressure transducer) were recorded simultaneously
   with recordings of pulmonary venous Bow velocity obtained by
   transesophageal Doppler echocardiography.
   Results. Agreement between Doppler catheter and Doppler
   echocardiographic measurements of pulmonary venous Bow velocity (n = 18
   patients) was analyzed using the Bland-Altmann technique, The 95\%
   limits of agreement were -0.16 to +0.11 mis for systolic peak velocity,
   -0.14 to +0.09 m/s far diastolic peak velocity and -0.12 to +0.10 m/s
   for atrial peak velocity. The closest agreement between both methods was
   found for the ratio of systolic to diastolic peak velocity, the ratio of
   systolic to diastolic flow duration and the time fi om Q deflection on
   the electrocardiogram to maximal Bow velocity. Mean left atrial pressure
   was strongly correlated with the ratio of systolic to diastolic peak
   velocity (r = -0.829), systolic velocity-time integral (r = -0.653),
   time to maximal flow velocity (r = 0.844) and the ratio of systolic to
   diastolic flow duration (r = -0.556). The ratio of systolic to diastolic
   peak velocity and the time to maximal flow velocity were identified as
   strong independent predictors of mean left atrial pressure. Left atrial
   compliance was not found to be an independent predictor of mean left
   atrial pressure.
   Conclusions. Flow velocity in the left upper pulmonary vein can be
   reliably recorded by transesophageal pulsed wave Doppler
   echocardiography. Our data reveal further evidence that mean left atrial
   pressure can be estimated by the pattern of pulmonary venous Bow
   velocity.}},

Abstract = {{Much specialized knowledge is involved in the diagnosis of a mastitis
   problem at the herd level. Because of their problem-solving capacities,
   knowledge-based systems can be very useful to support the diagnosis of
   mastitis problems in the herd. Conditional causal models with multiple
   layers are used as a representation scheme for the development of a
   knowledge-based system for diagnosing mastitis problems. Construction of
   models requires extensive cooperation between the knowledge engineer and
   the domain expert. The first layer consists of three overview models:
   the general overview conditional causal model, the contagious overview
   conditional causal model, and the environmental overview conditional
   causal model, giving a causal description of the pathways through which
   mastitis problems can occur. The conditional causal model for primary
   udder defense and the conditional causal model for host defense are
   attached to the overview models at the second layer, and the conditional
   causal model for deep primary udder defense is attached to the
   conditional causal model for the primary udder defense at the third
   layer. Based on quantitative user input, the system determines the
   qualitative values of the nodes that are used for reasoning. The
   developed models showed that conditional causal models are a good method
   for modeling the mechanisms involved in a mastitis problem. The system
   needs to be extended in order to be useful in practical circumstances.}},

Abstract = {{A model has been developed for simulating the effects of backscatter
   from scatterers advected with a mean background wind. This model has
   been designed to be as simple yet as realistic as possible, allowing the
   simulation of both spaced antenna and Doppler radars, and includes
   features such as aspect sensitivity, gravity wave perturbations, and
   turbulent motions. The model simulates the characteristics of radar
   backscatter very well at both MF and VHF. Results of the application of
   the full correlation analysis to model data generated for the spaced
   antenna configuration are presented, revealing good agreement with the
   model input velocity. The effects of the sampling time upon the full
   correlation analysis are investigated, suggesting an upper limit for the
   successful application of the technique. The triangle size effect of the
   full correlation analysis is also investigated, confirming that the
   major cause is the failure to properly compensate for the effects of
   noise. The application of techniques for the estimation of turbulent
   velocities and aspect sensitivity from model-generated data have also
   proven successful.}},

Abstract = {{In clinical application of rotary blood pumps, flow obstruction as a
   result of suction of the inflow cannula, kinking of tubing, or thrombus
   formation occurs quite frequently. Early detection of such problems is
   essential to avoid hemolysis, tissue degradation, or release of thrombi
   to the patient. A program was developed for automatic observation of
   pump performance, tubing resistance, and suction effects, which requires
   only the measurement of already available parameters (i.e., pump speed,
   pump flow, aortic pressure). The software is based on Visual-C and
   provides a user surface formatted in Windows. Pump flow, its time
   derivate, and the relationship between the pulsatile component and the
   mean graft flow are observed to detect suction in the left atrium.
   Furthermore, the generated pressure head is predicted from pump speed,
   graft flow, and the resistance of tubing/cannula and compared with the
   actually measured aortic pressure. An alarm sounds if a given limit
   between prediction and measurement is exceeded. In a mock circulation,
   suction events were detected in more than 95\% with a mean deviation of
   actual aortic pressure from its predicted value of less than 5\%. For in
   vivo application, even incomplete suction could be detected reliably in
   more than 90\% of events. This system improves and standardizes
   monitoring of pump performance; it should therefore lead to greater
   safety during application of such devices.}},

Abstract = {{A single 250-mu g dose of the Mel-14 mAb to L-selectin greatly
   diminished the extent of L-selectin expression on lymphocytes and
   decreased (60 to 90\%) the massive cellular recruitment to the cervical
   and mediastinal lymph nodes that follows intranasal infection of naive
   C57BL/6 mice with Sendai virus. The numbers of CD8(+) CTL precursors in
   the mediastinal lymph nodes were considerably reduced on day 7, when
   compared with virus-infected mice given a control rat IgG2a, but potent
   CTL effecters were present in the lungs of both groups by day 10 after
   infection, and the overall magnitude of CTL precursor generation was not
   obviously compromised. The early dominance of Sendai virus-specific IgM
   Ab-forming cells was prolonged in the Mel-14-treated mice, whereas
   plasma cells producing virus-specific IgA were abnormally prominent in
   the lymph nodes but not in the spleen. The kinetics of virus-specific
   Ab-forming cells generation and the serum Ab response for the various
   IgG isotypes were also delayed, Thus, though L-selectin is clearly
   important for the localization of naive lymphocytes to regional lymph
   nodes, the Mel-14-treated mouse san still deal effectively with a virus
   that causes productive infection only in the respiratory tract. The
   spleen, where L-selectin does not determine lymphocyte trafficking, is a
   major site for the compensatory T cell and B cell responses.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To compare the upper gastrointestinal disease profiles of
   Helicobacter pylori-infected patients drawn from two distinct regions of
   China, one with a low incidence of gastric cancer (Guangzhou) and the
   other with a high incidence of gastric cancer (Lanzhou). The
   age-standardized prevalence of H. pylori within the populations of these
   two cities was similar (similar to 56\%). In these patient groups, the
   prevalence of different gastrointestinal disease states and the
   occurrence and severity of gastritis, gastric atrophy, and intestinal
   metaplasia were compared. Methods: This study was based on consecutive
   patients: 265 from Guangzhou and 275 from Lanzhou. The grading of
   gastritis and the detection of H. pylori was determined by histology
   using the `'Sydney System''. Results: The ratio of cases of duodenal to
   gastric ulceration for the two cities was: Guangzhou 14:1 and Lanzhou
   3:1. Gastric cancer was more prevalent in the patients from Lanzhou
   (9.8\%) than from Guangzhou (3\%). In nonulcer dyspepsia patients from
   Guangzhou, gastritis was predominantly antral, whereas, in Lanzhou,
   gastritis was predominantly uniform. The amount and severity of atrophy
   was significantly greater in Lanzhou compared with Guangzhou.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of atrophy, rather than age of acquisition
   and prevalence of H. pylori infection, appears to be a marker of the
   major upper gastrointestinal disease profiles of a region. Development
   of atrophy, although apparently related to H. pylori infection, may be a
   multifactorial condition. Differences in diet, as seen between Guangzhou
   and Lanzhou, may be important in this regard. Understanding the factors
   leading to the development of atrophy may enhance our understanding of
   processes leading to gastric malignancy.}},

Abstract = {{Geographically decentralized planning and management is an emerging
   theme within the health sector in many OECD countries. Advocates of
   decentralization argue that providing greater authority to local
   decision-making bodies can improve both the technical and allocative
   efficiency with,which health care systems operate. Using concepts drawn
   from organizational theory and the economics of organizations, we
   examine the potential of centralized and decentralized planning and
   management structures to be efficient in light of the informational
   problems that must be overcome to allocate resources efficiently. We
   focus in particular on the need to integrate information regarding: (1)
   the effectiveness and efficiency of alternative clinical interventions
   and of alternative ways organize the delivery of health care; (2) the
   needs, values, and preferences in the population; and (3) local
   circumstances that affect delivery of care across regions. informational
   concerns suggest that decentralized structures have greater potential to
   be efficient. We then briefly discuss some principles for the design of
   decentralized structures to aid in realizing these potential efficiency
   gains.}},

Abstract = {{In diabetes, loss of renal arteriolar smooth muscle cell contractility
   leads to intraglomerular hypertension. In glomeruli isolated from
   streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats, the mesangial cells (smooth
   muscle-like) display loss of contractile responsiveness to angiotensin
   II. This study examines the mechanistic relationship between altered
   mesangial cell contractility and vasopressor hormone-stimulated Ca2+
   signaling in high glucose. Glomeruli were isolated from normal or
   STZ-induced diabetic rats to observe ex vivo mesangial cell contractile
   function. Also, rat mesangial cells were cultured (10-20 passages) in
   normal (5.6 mmol/l) or high (10-25.6 mmol/l) glucose for 1-5 days.
   Reduction of glomerular volume and decreased planar surface area of
   cultured mesangial cells in response to vasoconstrictor stimulation over
   60 min were measured by videomicroscopy and personal computer-based
   morphometry. Contraction of glomenruli isolated from STZ-administered
   rats in response to endothelin (ET)-1 (0.1 mu mol/l) or the Ca2+
   ionophore A23187 (5 mu mol/l) was impaired significantly compared with
   that in normal glucose. In the presence of arginine vasopressin (AW)
   (1.0 mu mol/l) or ET-1 (0.1 mu mol/l), mesangial cells demonstrated a
   dose-dependent loss of contractile response to increasing glucose
   concentrations (5.6-25.6 mmol/l) within 24 h of high-glucose exposure,
   which was sustained for 5 days. Mesangial cells in high glucose were
   consistently smaller in size compared with those in normal glucose.
   Mesangial cells were preloaded with myo-{[}2-H-3]inositol and
   intracellular {[}H-3] inositol phosphate release in response to AVP (1.0
   mu mol/l) was analyzed by Dowex chromatography. Comparing cells in
   normal (5.6 mmol/l) versus high (25.6 mmol/l) glucose, we observed no
   significant difference in stimulated inositol phosphate levels from 10
   to 60 s. The Ca2+-signaling response of cultured mesangial cells
   preloaded with Fura 2 or Indo 1 was measured by spectrofluorometry.
   After culture in 25.6 mmol/l glucose, 0.1 mu mol/l AVP or 0.1 mu mol/l
   ET-1 stimulated a cytosolic Ca2+ signal, with first and second phases,
   identical to that exhibited by mesangial cells in normal glucose.
   Fluorescence imaging of cultured mesangial cell cytoskeletal filamentous
   actin (F-actin) stained with rhodamine-phalloidin demonstrated reduced
   F-actin staining in the basal state and loss of the normal F-actin
   disassembly response to ET-1 in high glucose. Glomerular mesangial cells
   display glucose-induced altered contraction and F-actin disassembly to
   vasoactive stimuli, which occur in the presence of normal Ca2+
   signaling.}},

   adopted to free the clusters from being rigid. It is found that the
   scaling exponent is independent of not only the shapes of the clusters,

Abstract = {{The Garford bulb anchor is a modified cable geometry developed and

   (Fig. 1). Laboratory cable pull tests indicate that the bond capacity of
   the 25 mm Garford bulb anchor is comparable to the nutcase -cable, in
   excess of the birdcage cable, and significantly higher than standard
   7-wire strand. Ifs comparative advantage over the latter ir most
   significant for tests at low radial confinement and high wafer:cement
   ratio grout, which corresponds to operational conditions of low quality,
   rock (i.e. weak, highly fractured rock masses, foliated hanging walls
   failed ground, etc.) and poor installation quality control (perhaps the
   most common explanation for cable bolt failures). It ir under such
   conditions that cable bolting ir often ineffective. The most impressive
   result is that for a reduction of the effective rock mass modulus by a
   factor of five, the Garford bulb cable capacity remains virtually
   unchanged.}},

Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{724-730}},

Abstract = {{Background - Quality of life (QOL) is commonly measured in asthma
   clinical trials by a questionnaire given before and after treatment. A
   structured asthma QOL daily diary provides more restricted information
   but on a daily basis. The validity and use of such a QOL diary was
   examined in a clinical trial in which two asthma treatments were
   compared.
   Methods - The effects of low dose inhaled steroid (400 mu g
   beclomethasone dipropionate, BDP) combined with the long acting beta(2)
   agonist salmeterol (100 mu g) (n = 220) was compared with high dose
   inhaled steroid (1000 mu g BDP) (n = 206) in asthmatic outpatients in a
   double blind, parallel group study. Outcome measures consisted of a
   combined diary for peak expiratory flow (PEF) rate, symptoms, and
   problems, and an asthma-specific QOL questionnaire, the Living with
   Asthma Questionnaire.
   Results - The QOL diary correlated with the QOL questionnaire for both
   cross sectional and longitudinal assessments. Cross sectional
   correlations with PEF were higher for the QOL questionnaire than the QOL
   diary, but longitudinal correlations with PEF were higher for the diary
   than the questionnaire. Treatment with low dose steroid/salmeterol
   compared with high dose steroid produced better lung function, better
   QOL as measured by diary, and reduced night time wakenings, but
   treatment differences were not obtained with the QOL questionnaire nor
   for daytime symptoms. Diary assessed QOL was a better predictor of low
   PEF than diary assessed symptoms. Compliance with diary completion was
   good but there were floor or ceiling effects in the QOL diary records of
   about 25\% of patients.
   Conclusions - Structured QOL diaries are valid instruments that appear
   to be more responsive to longitudinal change in clinical trials than a
   QOL questionnaire, but QOL questionnaires provide a more sensitive cross
   sectional measure of disease severity. Floor and ceiling effects are
   found in some patients' QOL diaries which limit their usefulness. QOL
   diary problem events occur during the troughs of a peak flow graph,
   while symptoms are more widely distributed with respect to peak flow.}},

   melting occurs downstream from this point, compacted solid polymer can
   be wedged into the start of the barrier entrance. For some barrier

   High project performance is linked to a broad approach to resolving
   critical problems, merging deep technical knowledge with a detailed
   understanding of the specific environment in which the new technologies
   would be applied.  Effective organizations are characterized by a

   scheme is employed to extend the semiempirical PM3 method to the

   compensating for wobble-induced cone offsets. This poor performance is
   attributed to the very conservative cone control gains selected before
   launch. Thus the cone control gains were redesigned. The simulation
   results, the in-flight confirmation test, and the more recent
   optical-navigation pictures of the Ida asteroid all indicated that
   tremendous improvement in the scan-platform performance in compensating
   for the cone offsets has been achieved using the new gains, at no

Abstract = {{The classical `hypnotoxin theory' was followed by extensive search for
   an endogenous sleep substance. Brain tissues and body fluids of sleeping
   and sleep-deprived animals contained active sleep-inducing factors like
   the sleep-promoting substance (SPS). Uridine and oxidized glutathione
   (GSSG), two components of SPS, seem to regulate physiological sleep
   differentially. Uridine may facilitate the inhibitory neurotransmission
   at the synaptic level of the GABA(A)-uridine receptor complex. In
   contrast, GSSG may inhibit the excitatory neurotransmission at the
   synaptic level of the glutamate receptor. Thus, the two SPS components
   promote sleep by exerting a complementary action on the two major
   neurotransmitter systems in the brain that have mutually reciprocal
   functions. Further, among multidimentional functions of sleep, uridine
   may contribute to recover the activity of neurons, while glutathione may
   counteract excitotoxic events. Hence sleep at the behavioral level is a
   process of neuronal restitution and detoxification at the cellular
   level. Such a concept can be regarded as a modern version of the
   Ishimori-Pieron's hypnotoxin theory proposed early in this century.}},

Abstract = {{A PLL synthesizer with a short frequency switching time applicable to
   frequency hopped spread spectrum (FH-SS) communications is proposed in
   this paper. Switching output frequencies at high speed is difficult in a
   conventional PLL because of the low-pass filters in the loop. In
   contrast to this, a sample hold-type phase comparer that does not
   require a low-pass filter is used in the proposed PLL. In addition, an
   output frequency is converged instantaneously by giving an initial value
   to the PLL during frequency switching. An initial value corresponding to
   each frequency can be obtained from a phase difference of the normal
   state of the PLL at the same frequency as that of the preceding cycle
   because the frequency transition of the propagation wave of FH-SS
   communications is cyclical. Analysis of the errors of the proposed PLL
   show that the maximum error is the phase lag of VCO that occurs when an
   initial value is given. It is difficult to increase the hopping
   frequency because the switching time is shortened. While it is difficult
   to increase the hopping frequency since the PLL response is delayed when
   the PLL time constant is large, the effect of this error is slight. A
   method for compensating for the error due to this phase lag is proposed
   here. In addition, it is shown that this method allows the hopping
   frequency to be increased up to one-third of the reference frequency.}},

   of pancreatic beta-cell function in OLETF rats, and that insulin
   resistance seemed closely related to fat deposition in the abdominal
   cavity.

Abstract = {{It is essentially important to remove the dissolved oxygen (DO) in the
   ultrapure water for the future ultralarge scale integration (ULSI). We
   have found the existence of the big driving force for the oxygen
   diffusion through tube materials that increases the DO concentration.
   The DO concentration through the perfluoro alkoxide (PFA) tube rapidly
   increased with decreasing the flow rate of the ultrapure water. On the
   other hand, the DO concentration through the polyvinyliden fluoride
   (PVDF) tube that is a low oxygen permeability material did not increase
   with decreasing the flow rate. Based on this finding, we have developed
   the nitrogen gas bubbling deaerator made of PVDF as a point of use
   purifier. In this system, the residual DO concentration reached 0.2 ppb
   at a gas-liquid ratio of 1.2 m(3)/m(3) at each bubbling tower that is
   ten times smaller than the previously reported one. Furthermore, other
   contaminations in the ultrapure water do not increase after this

Abstract = {{The K-sam gene was originally cloned from KATO-III human gastric cancer
   cells and Is identical to the bek or keratinocyte growth factor (KGF)
   receptor (KGFR) or fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 gene. K-sam
   generates several variant transcripts by alternative splicing, and the
   most abundant K-sam transcript in KATO-III cells was cloned as the
   K-sam-IIC3 cDNA, which has the KGF-binding motif and a short carboxyl
   terminus lacking a putative phospholipase C-gamma 1 association site,
   Tyr-769. The K-sam-IIC3 cDNA was distinct from the K-sam-IIC1 cDNA,
   which was the same as the previously reported KGFR cDNA. The K-sam-IIC1
   product contains a long carboxyl terminus with Tyr-769. K-sam-IIC3
   showed greater transforming activity in NIH 3T3 cells than did
   K-sam-IIC1, and in gastric cancer cell lines in general, the level of
   K-sam-IIC3 mRNA was greater than that of K-sam-IIC1 mRNA. Here we report
   that the K-sam-IIC3 product was less autophosphorylated than the
   K-sam-IIC1 product in NIH 3T3 transfectants. K-sam-IIC1 transfected
   keratinocytes showed a stronger mitogenic response to KGF than did
   K-sam-IIC1 transfectants. Moreover, K-sam-IIC3-transfected L6 myoblast
   cells hardly differentiated when cultured in differentiation inducing
   medium and growth was not significantly affected, while K-sam-IIC1
   transfectants showed a differentiated phenotype,vith a reduced growth
   rate. These data indicate the difference in the signal transduction
   mediated by two KGFR type K-sam variants generated by alternative
   splicing which might he involved in certain differentiation and
   carcinogenesis scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. This study aimed to 1) compare in vitro intravascular
   ultrasound images of human pulmonary arteries with corresponding
   histologic sections, and 2) correlate the relation between intravascular
   ultrasound findings and Heath-Edwards pathologic grade of pulmonary
   vascular changes.
   Background. The pathologic assessment of the pulmonary vascular bed is
   essential for diagnosis and management of congenital heart disease with
   pulmonary hypertension.
   Methods. We evaluated and compared intravascular ultrasound images with
   histologic findings at identical sites in 40 pulmonary artery segments
   from 17 autopsy studies: group 1 = 7 patients with pulmonary
   hypertension (Heath Edwards grade I to V, 20 segments); group 2 = 10
   patients without cardiopulmonary disease (20 segments).
   Results. In group 2, the pulmonary artery wall echo consisted of a
   single layer. In group 1, I) all segments of pulmonary arteries from
   patients with pulmonary hypertension showed a three-layered appearance;
   2) in patients with mild pulmonary hypertension (Heath-Edwards grades I
   and II), intravascular ultrasound demonstrated increased thickness of
   the echoluscent zone due to medial hypertrophy with no intimal reaction;
   3) patients with severe pulmonary hypertension (Heath Edwards grade III
   or higher) had intravascular ultrasound findings of increased medial
   thickness and a bright inner layer from intimal hyperplasia; 4) percent
   wall thickness derived from intravascular ultrasound showed a
   significant correlation with that determined by histologic examination
   (r = 0.89, p = 0.0001, n = 20).
   Conclusions. Changes observed with intravascular ultrasound imaging
   correlate well with histopathologic grade. Thus, intravascular
   ultrasound may have significant utility in the evaluation of pulmonary
   vascular morphology in patients with pulmonary hypertension.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effect of the zinc-cimetidine complex on the healing
   of acetic acid-induced gastric ulcers in rats. When the effects of test
   drugs were assessed on the 15th day after acetic acid injection, the
   zinc-cimetidine complex at oral doses of 15.0 (11.4 mg as cimetidine),
   30.0 and 60.0 mg/kg twice daily promoted the ulcer healing in a
   dose-dependent manner. Cimetidine was effective at oral doses of over
   45.4 mg/kg twice daily. ZnCl2 was ineffective on ail ulcer parameters.
   The effect of the combination of cimetidine and ZnCl2 was similar to
   that of cimetidine alone. The zinc-cimetidine complex had already
   inhibited the increase in thiobarbituric acid reactants in the ulcerated
   region before the ulcer-healing effect of this compound was recognized.
   A single oral administration of the complex at 15 and 30 mg/kg to normal
   rats was ineffective in inhibiting acid secretion and in increasing
   serum gastrin levels, although cimetidine was markedly effective on both
   parameters. These results indicate that the zinc-cimetidine complex at
   about 1/4 the dose of cimetidine was as effective as cimetidine when the
   ulcer-healing effects of both compounds were compared with the same dose
   of cimetidine. In addition, the ulcer-healing effect of this complex may
   be due, at least in part, to the inhibition of lipid peroxidation but
   not due to the inhibition of acid secretion or the trophic effect of
   gastrin.}},

   Recorded data of these irregularities form a basis to develop track

   paper random field models for vertical irregularity data obtained from
   Indian railways has been presented. It is shown that irregularity in the
   vertical profile can be modeled as stationary Gaussian random field,
   which can be defined in terms of the power spectral density (PSD)
   function. Such a model can predict the values of peak amplitudes in a
   given track length. Further, the absolute vertical profile of the left

   this in describing the input matrix of multiaxle vehicles is discussed.}},

   reaction-diffusion bistable model, with the aim of analyzing the effect
   of boundary conditions on the formation and stability of stationary

Abstract = {{Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of inducing
   premature parturition on the composition of colostrum and milk and the
   effects of dietary fat supplementation on colostrum and milk composition
   from premature and delayed farrowing sows. In Trial 1, eight sows were
   allowed to farrow naturally (d 114, NF sows) and eight sows were induced
   to farrow (IF sows) prematurely by injection of prostaglandin Fa, on d
   112 of gestation. Average fat content of sow's milk during the first 12
   h postpartum was lower for IF than for NF sows (P < .05), as was overall
   mean fat percentage(P < .05). In Trial 2, 53 sows were randomly assigned
   in a 2 (diets) x 5 (parturition treatments) factorial experiment.
   Dietary treatments fed during the last 2 wk of gestation and throughout
   lactation were control diet and added fat diet (control diet plus 10\%
   corn oil). Parturition treatments included 1) natural farrowing (d 114),
   induction of parturition with prostaglandin F-2 alpha on 2) d 110, 3) d
   111, or 4) d 112 of gestation, and 5) delay of parturition with
   progesterone followed by injection of prostaglandin on d 115. The added
   fat diet increased milk fat percentage compared with the control diet (P
   < .01). Colostral fat percentage was reduced by induction of premature
   farrowing (d 110 or 111) in sows fed the control diet but was unaffected
   in sows fed added dietary fat (interaction, P < .05). Mean fat content
   of colostrum was not reduced in groups receiving the added fat diet that
   were induced to farrow prematurely. In sows with delayed parturition,
   colostral immunoglobulin G concentrations were lower for the group fed
   the added fat diet than for the group fed the control diet (P < .05).
   Addition of fat to sow diets during late gestation and lactation may
   help maintain high colostral energy for newborn pigs when sows are
   induced to farrow prematurely.}},

Abstract = {{Epidemiological data suggest that the lower the BP, the lower the
   cardiovascular risk. This is true across a broad range of BP levels,
   including those considered `normal'; more than half of all
   cardiovascular events attributed to raised BP occur when DBP is less
   than or equal to 95 mmHg. The belief that lowering BP too far is harmful
   is based on the hypothesis of a J-shaped relationship between BP and
   risk of cardiovascular disease. The weight of evidence now clearly
   suggests, however, that the J-shaped curve is not a consequence of
   treatment, but of underlying cardiovascular dysfunction that reduces BP
   and increases morbidity and mortality. Current prospective observational
   data give no evidence of a threshold BP below which there is no further
   reduction in cardiovascular disease risk. The average BP reductions in
   randomised trials are 5-6 mmHg (diastolic) and 10-12 mmHg (systolic),
   which would be expected to reduce the incidence of stroke by 35\% and of
   coronary heart disease by 21\%. If average BP reductions were doubled,
   prospective observational studies suggest the cardiovascular risk would
   be reduced by a further 15-20\%.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the extent of HIV-1 genetic variation in Indian
   patients.
   Design: To avoid any bias in selecting viral variants, HIV-1 DNA was
   amplified directly from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of
   patients and sequenced. Genetic similarity between Indian sequences and
   other geographic isolates was analysed by phylogenetic analysis
   algorithms.
   Methods: A fragment encompassing the C2/V3-V5 regions of HIV-1 gp120 was
   amplified from the lymphocyte DNA of 12 Indian patients. Multiple clones
   from each patient were sequenced. Nucleotide sequences encompassing
   about 650 base pairs were aligned for the Indian and other
   geographically distinct isolates. Inter-isolate relationships were
   analysed by means of distance, parsimony and neighbour-joining
   algorithms.
   Results: Nucleotide sequence comparisons showed low interpatient
   variation. Amino-acid comparisons revealed a high degree of homology
   between Indian sequences in this study and those studied earlier. On
   distance and parsimony trees, most of the Indian sequences clustered
   together as subtype C. However, sequences from three patients also
   showed significant homologies and phylogenetic clustering outside of
   subtype C.
   Conclusions: The predominant strain of HIV-1 in India belongs to subtype
   C and little interpatient nucleotide sequence divergence in the majority
   of cases suggests recent spread of HIV-1 in this region. This study also
   presents the first evidence for non-C subtypes in the Indian population
   with two epidemiologically linked samples remaining unclassified for any
   existing env subtype. The presence of variant subtypes in Indian
   patients sheds light on the transmission routes of HIV-1 to India and
   emphasizes the need to include these sequences in vaccine development
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Almost without exception, recent studies of the Parthenon frieze have
   accepted W.B.  Dinsmoor's arrangement of the south frieze.  In his
   important contribution to our understanding of the problems of
   arrangement, however, the assignment of eight blocks to the victims of
   the south frieze is shown here to be based on an error.  On technical
   and compositional grounds, this article largely reinstates the sequence
   first proposed by Adolph Michaelis, which employs only seven blocks, and
   goes on to consider the implications of this for the pedestrian sequence
   of the south frieze as a whole.  The block that is released from the
   procession of victims may be allocated to a conjectured group of
   hydriaphoroi, balancing the four shown on the north frieze.  Further, if
   it is accepted that the so-called pinax-bearers of the south frieze are,
   in fact, kithara-players like those on the north, then the long friezes
   of the Parthenon may be seen to parallel each other.  Both consist,
   therefore, of a sequence of horsemen, chariots, elders, musicians,
   hydria-bearers, tray-bearers, and victims.}},

Abstract = {{Soft tissue architecture including muscle insertions were studied in the
   shoulder region by dissecting three male cadavers. These dissections
   demonstrated that m. supraspinatus and mm. infraspinatus/teres minor
   were located in two separate, closed compartments limited by bony walls
   and tense stiff fascia. M. supraspinatus was composed of two parts which
   differed with respect to attachment site, fibre orientation, and muscle
   structure although they were similar with respect to muscle fibre
   length. Muscle structure, fascia and insertion sites should be taken
   into account in biomechanical modeling of the shoulder. Intramuscular
   pressures in the shoulder muscles were recorded in healthy females
   during voluntary isometric contractions performed in various arm
   positions, and at different contraction levels and measuring depths.
   Intramuscular pressure in m. supraspinatus during 30 degrees shoulder
   abduction: 58 (33-70) mmHg, exceeded the intramuscular pressure during
   30 degrees flexion: 29 (7-40) mmHg. In m. infraspinatus lower values
   were registered. A simple relation between intramuscular pressure and
   measuring depth did not exist in the soft tissue above fossa
   supraspinata. During contractions a steep increase in intramuscular
   pressure was seen at a depth corresponding to the transition from m.
   trapezius to m. supraspinatus. The intramuscular pressure measurements
   showed wide regional heterogeneity at the same measuring depth during
   contractions, which is Likely to be due to the complex anatomy found in
   this region. The results show the significance of the anatomy for the
   increase in intramuscular pressure during contractions. This in turn may
   impair muscle blood flow and thus affect muscle function over prolonged
   periods of time.}},

   more strongly associated with vertebral fracture than standard PA BMD or

Title = {{THE FULLY-COUPLED MODEL FOR ROCK ENGINEERING SYSTEMS}},

Year = {{1995}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces the fully-coupled model (FCM), The model is
   developed from rock engineering systems (RES) concepts and graph theory,
   The basic device used in the RES approach is the interaction matrix: for
   any rock mechanics or rock engineering problem, the relevant state
   variables of the system are listed along the leading diagonal of the
   matrix-and the relations between each pair of variables, i.e. the binary
   mechanisms, are identified in the off-diagonal boxes. The interaction
   matrix can contain any number of state variables, depending on the
   engineering objective and level of analysis required.
   The FCM considers the interaction matrix as a mechanism network, Graph
   theory is used to assess the contributions of all the mechanisms in all
   the pathways, a key feature being the identification of mechanism
   feedback loops and their stability, The (uncoupled) binary interaction
   matrix is thus transformed into a (fully-coupled) global interaction
   matrix, The system outputs for any problem being modelled are then
   obtained from the system inputs via the global interaction matrix,
   Advantages of the FCM in the context of rock engineering are that the
   primary state variables of the system, the binary interactions, all the
   mechanism pathways, each step in the coupling process, and the
   consequential evolution of the matrix values can be clearly identified.
   The FCM has been developed initially with linear mechanisms, Five
   numerical examples of the linear FCM are given, simultaneous equations,
   spring structures, a pressurized thick cylinder, a six-variable dam
   system and a nine-variable pressure tunnel system, Using these examples,
   we demonstrate that the outputs resulting from any input perturbations
   can be rapidly assessed with the FCM, We also indicate how the FCM can
   be extended to include non-linear mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{The hypothesis was tested that plasma from ischemic hindlimbs
   facilitates hypertension. Ischemia-induced hypertension was generated in
   rats by infrarenal aortic cross clamping for 5 h after which plasma was
   obtained from femoral vein blood. In vitro contractile activity of naive
   aortic rings incubated for 2 h in plasma collected from ischemic rats
   demonstrated reduced relaxation to acetylcholine and nitroglycerin.
   Methylene blue (10(-5) M) induced greater contraction in rings incubated
   in control vs. ischemic plasma, suggesting that endogenous guanylate
   cyclase activity is decreased by ischemic plasma. However,
   8-bromo-guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) relaxed equally
   strips incubated in ischemic or control plasma. Acetylcholine-induced
   nitrite release was significantly lower in ischemic vs. control
   plasma-incubated strips (8.6 +/- 2.7 vs. 28.2 +/- 2.3 ng/10 mg tissue
   wt, respectively). The impaired relaxation to acetylcholine in ischemic
   plasma-incubated rings was significantly increased by L-arginine but not
   by prior treatment of ischemic plasma with heating or superoxide
   dismutase and catalase. These findings suggest the impaired relaxation
   is mediated through inhibition of the nitric oxide-eGMP pathway.
   Prolonged blunting of vasodilation by ischemic plasma may therefore
   contribute to maintenance of a sustained vasoconstriction and ischemic
   hypertension.}},

Abstract = {{It is common in cost-effectiveness analyses of health care to only
   include health care costs, with the argument that some fictive `health
   care budget' should be used to maximize the health effects. This paper
   provides a criticism of the `health care budget' approach to
   cost-effectiveness analysis of health care. It is argued that the
   approach is ad hoc and lacks theoretical foundation. The approach is
   also inconsistent with using a fixed budget as the decision rule for
   cost-effectiveness analysis. That is the case unless only costs that
   fall into a single annual actual budget are included in the analysis,
   which would mean that any costs paid by the patients should be excluded
   as well as any future cost changes and all costs that fall on other
   budgets. Furthermore the prices facing the budget holder should be used,
   rather than opportunity costs, It is concluded that the `health care
   budget' perspective should be abandoned and the societal perspective
   reinstated in economic evaluation of health care.}},

   The positions of the source and observation points can be almost
   arbitrary. The line integral representation yields the exact same result
   as the conventional surface radiation integral; however, it is
   potentially less time consuming and particularly useful when the
   physical optics field can be augmented by a fringe wave contribution as
   calculated from physical theory of diffraction equivalent edge currents.
   The final expression for the line integral representation is lengthy but
   involves only simple functions and is thus suited for numerical
   calculation. To illustrate the exactness of the line integral
   representation, comparisons of numerical results obtained from the
   surface and the line integral representations are performed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper argues for the relevance and importance of the policy
   financial and fiscal incentives in Southern Italy. This policy made a
   considerable contribution to development in the South in the past but it
   is widely criticized today with unconvincing arguments. It is said that
   in the last twenty years supply-side constraints mean that public
   subsidies to the South do not foster an increase in production in South
   but rather give rise to imports from the rest of the country. The
   incentives policy ri the most suitable to removing such constraints
   because it fosters capital accumulation in the South. Moreover, the
   policy is still effective for overcoming the North-South divide because
   it can be implemented on a non-discretionary basis. The final part of
   the paper discusses the current orientation of the European Union's

Abstract = {{We have previously observed that, in normal awake subjects passively
   hyperventilated with intermittent positive-pressure ventilation
   delivered through nasal access (nIPPV), the glottis could interfere with
   the ventilation. We report on data obtained in the same subjects during
   stable sleep. In all cases, the glottis was continuously observed
   through a fiber-optic bronchoscope, and other indexes were also
   continuously recorded. Mechanical ventilation was progressively
   increased up to 30 l/min. We have observed during passive nIPPV in
   stable sleep that increases in delivered minute ventilation (V over dot
   E(d)) resulted in progressive narrowing of the glottic aperture, with
   increases in inspiratory resistance and progressive reductions in the
   percentage of the delivered tidal volume effectively reaching the lungs.
   For a given level of V over dot E(d), comparisons showed that the
   glottis was significantly narrower during sleep than during wakefulness
   and that the glottis was significantly narrower during stage 2 than
   during stages 3/4 non-rapid-eye-movement sleep. Moreover, when CO2 is
   added to the inspired air, glottic aperture increased in five of nine
   trials without changes in sleep stage. We also observed a significant
   negative correlation between glottic width and the V over dot E(D),
   independent of the CO2 level. We conclude that during nIPPV glottis
   narrowing results in a decrease in the proportion of the delivered tidal
   volume reaching the lungs.}},

Abstract = {{Platelet activation is accompanied by characteristic morphological
   changes: smooth-disc platelets become more spherical in shape and
   develop pseudopods. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether
   plate lets change after extracorporeal bypass. Twenty-two patients
   undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were studied prior to anesthesia
   and immediately after the operation. Platelets activated by different
   agonists were monitored simultaneously for morphological changes, ATP
   release and aggregation. While shape change measured before surgery was
   large, it was significantly reduced after bypass surgery (p < 0.01);
   morphological changes were quicker postoperatively. Several other
   parameters also changed: the time lapse between administration of the
   agonist and the start of ATP secretion decrease significantly (p <
   0.01). After activation with high concentrations of ADP, ATP release was
   significantly increased (p < 0.01). On the other hand, less ATP was
   released after platelet activation with collagen and arachidonic acid,
   suggesting a change in platelet adhesion or a downregulation of
   endoperoxide synthesis. In our study, the importance of preactivation
   change in shape, estimated quantitatively by percent loss in ability of
   changing shape, can be compared using various agonists, with
   proportional defects in release and aggregation. These data provide
   evidence for different intrinsic levels in platelet defects after CPB.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous samplings of atmospheric aerosols and gaseous precursors
   (SO2, HNO3, NH3) were conducted during an 18-month period in Sapporo,
   Japan. The monthly mean mass concentration of particles less than 10 mu
   m in diameter (suspended particulate matter: SPM) and their chemical
   composition were measured for aerosols collected at two sites located in
   northern and southwestern regions of the urban area. In the central part
   of the city, two-week mean concentrations of SO2, HNO3 and NH3 were
   measured by using tandem filter packs. Seasonal variations of the SPM
   mass concentrations and composition are discussed along with the results
   of the gas measurements.
   In both northern and southwestern regions of the urban area, than 85\%
   of the mass concentration of SPM is characterized by considering eight
   major components (elemental carbon, particulate organics, SO42-, NO3-,
   Cl-, NH4+, Na+ and soil particles). The concentration of elemental
   carbon indicates a winter maximum and summer minimum at both sites.
   Excess SO42- concentrations at the two sites exhibit very similar values
   throughout the year. An analysis of the concentration of SO2 suggests
   that the existence of secondarily formed sulfate in the atmosphere may
   contribute to this feature. Values of NO3- and NH4+ exhibit marked
   seasonal variations: winter maxima and summer minima. By comparison with
   the concentration of total inorganic nitrate ({[}NO3-] in aerosols +
   {[}HNO3]) measured in the central part of the city, the variations of
   NO3- and NH4+ are attributed to the change in the gas-particle phase
   between HNO3, NH3 and NH4NO3. The measurements of total ammonia
   ({[}NH4+] in aerosols + {[}NH3]) suggest that, in urban area,
   significant ammonia sources exist other than the ground surface. From
   the molar equivalence of Na+ and Cl-, it was found that the Cl- in SPM
   aerosols is mostly derived from sea salt; the contribution from NH4Cl is
   small, even in winter. Furthermore, the measured seasonal variation of
   Cl- was largely influenced by the chlorine loss from sea salt.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical and experimental investigations were made of the properties
   of simple glass-capillary converters (GCCs), which can be used to
   transport soft x-ray (SXR) beams and alter their cross sections. The
   conditions during propagation of SXR beams in a capillary were
   considered for an arbitrary position of a compact source, relative to
   the position of the entry face of the capillary. The characteristics of
   transport of SXR beams in a close-packed capillary bundle were also
   studied. An experimental investigation was made of the dependences of
   the GCC efficiency and transmission, and also of the SXR beam divergence
   at the exit from GCCs of different types, on the wavelength and on the
   distance from the source to the entry face of a GCC. A reasonable
   agreement between the calculated and experimental data was achieved. It
   was found experimentally that a pinhole camera with a GCC could be used
   in pinhole photography of dense hot plasmas. This method can deliver
   plasma images without the distorting influence of hard xrays emitted by
   a plasma. Simple and inexpensive bundle GCCs are suitable in those cases
   when the use of multilayer x-ray mirrors of zone plates is undesirable.}},

   assessed by point counting. Percent necrosis was > 28\% in the common
   bile duct of rats receiving DAPM bile compared to < 5\% in rats

Abstract = {{The steroid-sparing capacity of methotrexate in asthmatics is still
   being debated. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect
   of low-dose methotrexate on steroid consumption in patients with severe
   asthma, who require very high doses of systemic corticosteroids. We
   conducted a randomized, double-blind, parallel clinical trial in 24
   patients with long-standing asthma. After a 3-week run-in period,
   patients received a 16-week course of either 15 mg of oral methotrexate
   weekly or matched placebo in addition to their previous asthma therapy.
   The daily steroid dose (at run-in 30 +/- 14 mg/day in the methotrexate
   group; 25 +/- 9 mg/day in the placebo group (NS)) decreased by 24\% in
   the methotrexate group (p < 0.01) and by 5\% in the placebo group (NS)
   during weeks 9-16 of the treatment period when compared with run-in
   values. However, there was no difference in steroid consumption between
   the two groups at any time. We conclude that in patients with severe
   asthma who require very high doses of systemic corticosteroids,
   short-term treatment with methotrexate allows only a marginal steroid
   reduction. Our study does not support the use of methotrexate as a
   steroid-sparing agent in asthmatics.}},

Abstract = {{Questionnaire-based assessment of dietary intake may be invalidated in
   case-control studies by biases of recall, reporting or interviewing.
   Biomarkers, free of such biases, can be useful adjunct measures if they
   themselves are not affected by the event under investigation.
   Consequently, we studied the stability of the fatty acid composition of
   the red blood cell (RBC) membrane during a 1-week period, in 20 patients
   aged 40-74 years after an acute myocardial infarction (MI). Statistical
   analysis that accounted for a repeated measures design with missing data
   was undertaken for five fatty acids: C16:0, C18:1, C18:2, C20:5 and
   C22:6. All fatty acids showed change over the 7 day period. Individuals
   tended to maintain their relative ranking over time as reflected by
   correlations between time points of between 0.85 to 0.90, with the
   exception of C16:0 in which correlations were lower and inconsistent.
   Over the first 24 hr from admission all fatty acids except C20:5 showed
   evidence of a statistically significant change. However over the first 7
   hr C18:1, C18:2, C20:5 and C22:6 exhibited stability whereas C16:0
   altered. We conclude that the fatty acid composition of the RBC membrane
   appears to change soon after an acute MI. Consequently, case-control
   studies may be biased towards positive associations for C16:0 and
   inverse associations for C18:2 and C20:5, i.e. consistent with
   conventional predictions. However, if blood samples are drawn within 6
   hr of admission, bias in estimation of C18:1, C18:2, C20:5 and C22:6 may
   be unimportant.}},

   Materials and Methods: Three patients suspected on clinical and
   conventional radiological grounds of having vascular and
   tracheobronchial anomalies were examined using SCT. Three-dimensional
   images were reconstructed using a surface rendering technique.
   Results: In one case the diagnosis of complete double aortic arch was
   confirmed by angiography. In the other two patients the SCT and 3D
   reconstruction established the diagnosis of pulmonary sling and right
   aortic arch associated with left aberrant subclavian artery and
   angiography could be avoided.

   >10,000 MW) is 3\%, well within the range appropriate for
   geochronological purposes. The average intrashell variation in the total
   amino acid concentration (Sigma{[}aa]) of the HMW is 5\%, somewhat
   better than for the total acid hydrolysate (TOTAL) Of the same samples
   (7\%). To evaluate the relation between molecular weight and the rate of
   isoleucine epimerization, three molecular-weight fractions were
   separated using gel filtration, plus the naturally hydrolyzed free
   fraction (FREE), for each of four fossil eggshells. AIle/Ile increases
   with decreasing molecular weight in all shells, with a ca. sixfold to
   ninefold difference in ratios between the HMW and FREE, and a ca.
   fivefold difference between the HMW and TOTAL. Although linear
   correlations between aIle/Ile measured in each molecular-weight fraction
   and in the TOTAL are all highly significant (r greater than or equal to
   0.951), the relation between the extent of epimerization in the HMW and
   in the TOTAL is best expressed as an exponential function (r = 0.951).
   This relation is consistent with the idea that, as the epimerization
   reaction approaches equilibrium in the TOTAL (ca. aIle/Ile > 1.1), its
   rate decreases beyond that of the HMW. The amino acid composition
   (relative percent of eight amino acids or combinations of amino acids)
   is more uniform in the HMW of the four samples compared to
   lower-molecular-weight fractions. The greater `'compositional
   stability'' of the HMW indicates that it contains a residuum of
   macromolecules that have not been affected by the diagenetically driven
   changes observed in lower-molecular-weight fractions.}},

Abstract = {{A number of neurohumoral processes are activated in heart failure,
   including an increase in the plasma concentration of epinephrine.
   Radiotracer methods were applied in 42 patients with severe heart
   failure and 31 healthy volunteers to ascertain the rate at which
   epinephrine is released to plasma and to evaluate the contribution of
   extra-adrenal sources. The increase in arterial plasma epinephrine
   observed in the heart failure patients was explained principally by a
   34\% (P < 0.001) reduction in the whole body clearance rate of
   epinephrine from plasma. Regional venous sampling from the heart, lungs,
   and hepatomesenteric beds was performed in a subgroup of the study
   population, revealing a significant increase in the release rate of
   epinephrine to plasma from these organs in heart failure which accounted
   for 26\% of the whole body plasma epinephrine appearance rate. To
   establish whether the cardiac epinephrine release was of neuronal
   origin, a physical (cycling) or mental (difficult mental arithmetic)
   stressor was applied as a sympathoexcitatory stimulus, given that a
   proportional release of norepinephrine and epinephrine could be expected
   if sympathetic nerves were the source. These interventions caused
   significant increases in the regional spillover of norepinephrine to
   plasma but not that of epinephrine. These findings suggest that
   nonadrenal tissues contribute significantly to the whole body
   epinephrine release rate in heart failure and that this may arise from a
   site other than sympathetic neurons.}},

Abstract = {{The role of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in the
   epizootiology of anaplasmosis in the southeastern United States was
   examined through retrospective and prospective serosurveys and by
   experimental infection studies. No serum antibody reactive to Anaplasma
   marginale was detected with an indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay
   from any of 1,376 free-ranging deer sampled from 1968 through 1990 from
   13 states and Puerto Rico. Thirty-one additional deer from three bovine
   anaplasmosis enzootic premises also were negative by IFA and
   Giemsa-stained blood films. Three captive deer given A. marginale
   intravenously developed antibodies 38 to 41 days post-inoculation (DPI)
   and remained seropositive for the duration of the study (161 to 287
   DPI). At 42 DPI, rickettsemias of approximately 0.0001\% infected
   erythrocytes were observed in all three deer using a DNA probe; low
   rickettsemias (maximum 0.01\%) persisted through 56, 63, and 87 DPI,
   respectively. One deer had a recrudescent infection from 126 to 146 DPI
   (maximum rickettsemia 0.001\%). We believe that white-tailed deer in the
   southeastern United States, even though susceptible to A. marginale
   infection, are not exposed naturally, even at enzootic sites.
   Furthermore, white-tailed deer did not develop rickettsemias sufficient
   to support mechanical transmission by biting flies, which is believed to
   be the primary means of anaplasmosis transmission in this region.}},

   varying the hammer mass, the hammer velocity, the plate mass, and the
   plate area. At these study sites, seismic amplitudes depend on
   plate-surface area and on hammer mass but not heavily on hammer velocity
   or plate mass. Furthermore, although the total bandwidth of the recorded
   data was independent of source parameter changes, the peak frequency at
   one site was increased approximately 40 Hz by increasing the area of the
   plate. The results indicate that the effects of modifying the source
   parameters for the sledgehammer are site-dependent. The experiments

   in normoxic and hypoxic cultured astrocytes with and without FBP

   increased CO2 production by the pentose phosphate pathway. Labeled FBP
   produced very small amounts of CO2. Lactate production from {[}1-, and
   6-C-14]glucose increased similarly during hypoxic hypoxia; the increase
   was independent of added FBP. Labeled lactate from {[}U-C-14]FBP was

Abstract = {{Potential roles of germinal center (GC) T cells in immune memory were
   investigated by examining T cells in GCs lymph nodes (LNs) following
   immunization with myelin basic protein (MBP), MBP preferentially
   stimulates T cells expressing the V(beta)8 TCR family in B10.PL mice. By
   staining lymph nodes with peanut agglutinin, GCs were first identified 8
   days after immunization and could still be detected 50 days later, When
   T cells within GCs were examined at Day 8, the majority (>90\%) were
   CD45RB-negative and a large percentage (20\%) had already proliferated
   several days before as determined by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)
   incorporation, When BrdU(+) V(beta)8(+) cells were examined in various
   areas of LNs 3 and 8 weeks after immunization, BrdU(+) V(beta)8(+) cells
   were approximately fourfold more frequent in GCs than other areas of
   LNs. When GCs were examined for IL-4 mRNA(+) cells using an in situ
   hybridization method, only 0.01\% of GC cells expressed IL-4 mRNA,
   corresponding to about 1\% of GC T cells, Shortly following
   restimulation with MBP, the frequency of cells expressing IL-4 mRNA
   increased fivefold. Taken together, these findings indicate that GC T
   cells possess characteristics associated with memory T cells. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{Most family studies of psychiatric illness ascertain probands through
   treatment facilities. If psychiatric illness in relatives influences the
   probability of treatment seeking, then the risk of illness in the
   relatives of treated probands will not be representative of the risk of
   illness in all probands. We have investigated this question in a
   population-based sample of female twins with a lifetime history of
   DSM-III-R defined major depression (MD) (N = 753), 36\% of whom reported
   seeking professional help for their depression. Logistic and Cox
   regression methods were used. Treatment seeking for MD was significantly
   associated with age, education, comorbidity with anxiety disorders,
   degree of impairment and number of symptoms. Controlling for these
   predictors, treatment seeking was significantly predicted by the
   presence of one or more relatives with a lifetime diagnosis of MD (OR =
   1.62). The probability of treatment seeking for MD in the proband was
   significantly increased if the affected relative: (i) had an onset of
   their MD prior that of the proband and; (ii) themselves sought treatment
   for their depression. Seeking treatment in this epidemiological sample
   of depressed women was associated with a 32\% increase in risk of MD in
   relatives. Selecting probands for family studies from treated
   populations may select for families with an increased rate of illness.
   For MD, this artefact can explain only a modest proportion of the
   familial aggregation observed in prior family studies that utilized
   treated probands.}},

Abstract = {{The crystallization of minory amorphous constituents in liquid phase
   sintered ceramics, for example in Si3N4, is usually accompanied by a
   volume change. The resulting mismatch between crystallizing second phase

   formation of transformation stresses. The strain energy stored in the
   stress field reduces the thermodynamic driving force of crystallization.
   The coupling of crystallization, stress formation and relaxation is
   modelled. The extended duration of the crystallization process due to an
   intermediate stress induced decrease of the crystallization rate is
   assessed. The properties of amorphous grain boundary films are discussed
   with respect to stress relaxation and creep resistance at high

Title = {{BIODYNAMIC RESPONSE OF THE HAND-ARM SYSTEM TO VIBRATION FROM AN IMPACT
   HAMMER AND A GRINDER}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ERGONOMICS}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The dynamic response of the hand/arm system due to exposure of two types
   of vibrations, one from an impact hammer and one from a grinder, were
   studied. The aim of the investigation was to study whether the dynamic
   response was dependent of the type of exposure and/or the frequency of
   the vibration. The dynamic responses studied were driving point
   impedance, transfer function from handle to finger, wrist and elbow. The
   energy per time (dissipated power) absorbed in the hand-arm system as
   well as the influences of grip and push forces on the impedance were
   also studied.
   When grip and push forces were kept constant, no differences were found,
   in either transfer function or driving-point impedance, between impact
   and harmonic exposure. Increasing grip as well as push forces increased
   the impedance, both in resonance frequency and in magnitude. This means
   that the dissipated power depends on both (1) frequency contents of the
   vibration and (2) forces (grip and push).
   Exposures with predominantly lower frequencies (< 50 Hz) caused a
   greater load on the elbow and shoulder joints than exposures with higher
   frequencies (greater than or equal to 100 Hz). Up to about 250 Hz, the
   finger acts like a rigid body. When people exert force they tighten
   their muscles and this means that their hand-arm acts like a `'stiffer
   spring'' and thus increases the resonance frequency. The hand-arm system
   is also a non-linear system.
   Relevance to industry The paper discusses the dynamic response of the
   hand-arm system to exposure of vibration from an impact tool (impact
   hammer) and a non-impact tool (grinder). Factors like frequency content
   of the vibration, and grip and push forces influence the energy absorbed
   in the hand-arm system. Whenever possible, a tool that requires low grip
   and push forces should be used. This can be helpful in choosing the
   proper tool for the job.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Congenital bronchoesophageal fistulas have rarely been
   reported. Presented here is the 14-year experience of our hospital with
   this lesion.
   Methods. The study comprises 13 patients; 9 had a Braimbridge type II
   fistula; 2, a type I fistula; and 2, a type IV fistula. The most
   frequent site of communication was between the middle esophagus and the
   right lower lobe of the lung, especially the superior segment. A
   fistulectomy, with or without pulmonary resection, was performed on each
   patient.
   Results. All patients had complete relief of symptoms. No operative
   complications were observed.
   Conclusions. Congenital bronchoesophageal fistulas in adults are usually
   diagnosed by an esophagography. Symptoms are often nonspecific, and the
   possibility of a congenital bronchoesophageal fistula should be
   considered in patients who complain of long-standing unexplainable
   respiratory symptoms such as coughing and frequent pulmonary infections.
   The surgical intervention is relatively simple. In many cases, a
   fistulectomy with simple closure of the openings in both the esophagus
   and the bronchus is all that is required. Pulmonary resection is needed
   in some patients with severe bronchiectasis and recurrent pneumonitis.}},

Abstract = {{Factor analysis of infrared spectra of poly(vinylidene
   fluoride)-poly(methyl methacrylate) blends indicates the presence of
   specific interactions in the melt state. The presence of a band at 882
   cm(-1) in the interaction spectrum of the melted blend indicates that
   trails sequences of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) in the melt state
   can increase upon addition of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), which is
   highly responsible for the preferential formation of the beta phase upon
   quenching the melted blends. The drastic reduction of the rate of
   crystallization upon addition of PMMA is another cause which favours the
   formation of the beta crystalline phase. The critical quenching
   temperature above which the formation of the beta phase was rapidly
   reduced is 0 degrees C for neat PVDF, whereas it was found to be 30 or
   55 degrees C for the PVDF-PMMA blends. The percentage of PMMA which
   gives the maximum beta-phase content was found to be around 20 wt.\%. It
   was not PMMA, but the solvent dimethylformamide which affected the
   crystalline form of PVDF in the case of the samples solvent-cast and
   annealed. A new method to determine the contents of alpha- and
   beta-phases in the PVDF-PMMA blends was proposed and used to estimate
   more quantitatively the effects of quenching temperature and composition
   on the crystalline structure of PVDF in the blends.}},

Abstract = {{An ultrasensitive HPLC method has been developed for measuring NADP(+),
   NADPH, NAD(+), and NADH. A simple, rapid reaction of the oxidized
   nucleotides with cyanide in basic solution leads to two stable
   fluorescent products and allows all four nucleotides to be separated and
   quantitated on one chromatogram. Furthermore, only one extraction is
   needed, rather than prior procedures which require one acid extraction
   (for oxidized species) and one basic extraction (for reduced species).
   This method is particularly useful in quantitating pyridine
   dinucleotides in rodent brain, where no current method is adequate to
   quantitate the small amounts contained in various brain regions. The
   assay is sensitive enough to measure individual brain regions down to 10
   mg of tissue. Due to the involvement of NAD(P)H enzymatic systems in
   combating oxidative stress it is important to be able to assess levels
   regionally in brain diseases. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Like much of the Third World, Caribbean countries have in recent years
   aggressively pursued an industrial policy that seeks to attract foreign
   industrialists to produce for export. Researchers, although frequently
   lacking evidence for key variables and their interrelationships, have
   rendered an unwarranted final judgment that the current development
   model is negative for the Caribbean. In response, this paper develops a
   broad framework for understanding the constraints on, and the potential
   of, Caribbean industrial policy. The framework (1) situates the
   prevailing industrial policy among interrelated issues, such as
   Caribbean development strategy, debt, trade, race, gender, and
   technology; (2) highlights important concerns for which we thus far lack
   details, such as the performance of domestic manufacturers and the full
   costs of industrial policy; and (3) provides an organizational tool for
   empirically informed research on industrial policy in developing
   countries. The framework offers a pessimistic interim evaluation of
   Caribbean industrial policy, suggesting many reasons why it is unlikely
   to repay host societies with social development. It leaves open the
   possibility, however, that further empirically informed analysis will
   find that the prospects are more favorable in some countries, and for
   more specific goals, such as expanded industrial export opportunities,
   economic diversification, and the acquisition of managerial skills.}},

Abstract = {{Eicosanoids such as prostaglandins (PG), leukotrienes (LT) and lipoxins
   (LX) have been shown to be potent immunoregulatory molecules in mammals.
   To determine if they have similar roles in `lower' animals, rainbow
   trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were immunized with either sheep
   erythrocytes or Aeromonas salmonicida in the presence or absence of the
   stable analogue of PGE(2), 16,16-dimethyl-PGE(2), and the number of
   plaque-forming cells (PFC) or specific antibody levels determined. The
   higher dose of 16,16-dimethyl-PGE(2) (200 mu g/kg body weight) caused a
   significant reduction in both PFC number and antibody titre compared
   with the control. The effect of PGE(2), PGE(3), 16,16-dimethyl-PGE(2),
   LTB(4), LTB(5), LXA(4), 12-HETE and 12-HEPE on PFC generation following
   the in vitro challenge of trout splenocytes with sheep erythrocytes was
   also determined. All of the prostaglandins tested showed a
   dose-dependent inhibition of PFC after 11 days in culture, while of the
   remaining eicosanoids only LXA(4) had any effect on PFC number, with a
   dose-dependent stimulatory effect. The cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor,
   indomethacin, also caused a stimulation in the number of PFC generated,
   with a maximal effect at c. 25 mu M, while the lipooxygenase inhibitors,
   esculetin and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (5-I00 mu M), had no significant
   effect on PFC generation at all concentrations tested. The present
   results show that, as in mammals, prostaglandins and the cyclo-oxygenase
   pathway are also important in the regulation of the piscine humoral
   immune response. Of the lipoxygenase products tested, however, only
   LXA(4) had any significant effect on PFC generation, suggesting that
   these compounds have only a limited role to play in immune regulation in
   this organism. Overall this work shows that eicosanoids have a long
   evolutionary history in immunoregulation, probably dating back at least
   to the appearance of bony fish some 400 million years ago.}},

   with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction shortly after AMI,
   medical history, infarct complication, and survival were accounted for
   in all patients screened for entry. A total of 7,001 consecutive
   enzyme-confirmed AMIs were screened for entry in 27 Danish coronary care
   units. The 1-year mortality of all screened AMI cases was 23\% (95\%
   confidence interval 22\% to 24\%). The target population of the TRACE
   trial were patients with LV systolic dysfunction (echocardio-graphically
   determined wail motion index less than or equal to 1.2, n = 2,606)

   3\% and 24 +/- 2\%, respectively. The result of the TRACE study will be
   applicable to two thirds of the patients with LV systolic dysfunction;
   however, even with this high figure, care should be taken in
   extrapolating the result to the general population with reduced LV
   function after AMI since the group excluded from the study had a higher
   mortality than those who were included.}},

Abstract = {{The receptors responsible for avid alveolar macrophage (AM) phagocytosis

   This study used flow cytometry to quantitate the effects of a panel of

   unopsonized environmental dusts (titanium dioxide, TiO2; iron oxide,
   Fe2O3; alpha-quartz, SiO2; diesel engine exhaust dust) or fluorescent
   latex beads. Polyanionic ligands of the macrophage scavenger receptor
   (SR) for acetylated-LDL caused marked inhibition of AM binding of the
   oxide particles and latex beads (e.g., TiO2 binding; polyinosinic acid
   (polyl), 10 mu g/ml: 70.2 +/- 1.5\% inhibition, mean +/- SE, n = 11). In
   contrast, no inhibition was seen with the polyanions heparin and
   chondroitin sulfate (chond-S), or dextran, consistent with the known
   inhibitor profile of macrophage SRs for acetylated-LDL. AM uptake of
   latex or SiO2 beads instilled into lungs of hamsters was inhibited by
   administration of polyl but not chondroitin sulfate (AM beads per cell:
   control, 6.1 +/- 0.7; polyl, 3.5 +/- 0.2; chond-S, 5.1 +/- 0.7, n
   greater than or equal to 4, p < 0.05 for control vs polyl) indicating
   macrophage SRs operate in vivo as well as in vitro. In contrast, AM
   binding of the carbonaceous diesel dust particles was not inhibited by
   any ligand tested. AM uptake of unopsonized TiO2, SR ligands or
   acetylated LDL caused no significant activation of AM respiratory burst
   or TNF production, consistent with past observations that
   opsonin-independent phagocytosis of inert particles by normal AMs is not
   accompanied by pro-inflammatory activation. These data implicate
   macrophage-type SRs in AM binding of charged environmental particles and
   indicate that distinct mechanisms mediate binding of carbonaceous dusts.}},

Abstract = {{In the area of radical surgical treatment of gastric carcinoma, extended

   dissection-becoming increasingly important. One indication for extended
   gastrectomy is intramural or transmural infiltration of neighboring
   organs or the gross presence of metastatic involvement of the lymph
   nodes associated with the celiac trunk, splenic artery, or splenic
   hilum. Because the mortality rate associated with extended gastrectomy
   is hardly any higher than that for nonextended gastrectomy, the
   indication for the former may be generously applied. The prognostically
   most unfavorable case is histologic evidence of transmural infiltration
   of neighboring organs (pT4). Multiorgan resection with improved
   systematic extension of lymph node dissection is of greatest benefit to
   patients with inflammatory adhesion of the stomach to neighboring organs
   or pN2 lymph node metastases. Intramural infiltration of the esophagus
   can be treated by including the thoracic part of the esophagus in the
   gastric resection done via an abdominothoracic approach, ensuring an
   appropriate margin of clearance, with no significant worsening of the

Abstract = {{Computer users often must view large amounts of information through
   video displays which are physically limited in size. Although some
   methods, which automatically display/erase information units based on
   their degrees of importance, have been proposed, they lack an ability to
   keep the total amount of displayed information nearly constant. We
   propose a new method for information display based on fractal theory. By
   regarding the information structures used in computers as complex
   objects, we can abstract these objects as well as control their amount.
   Using our method, (1) the total amount of information is kept nearly
   constant even when users change their focuses of attention and (2) this
   amount can be set flexibly. Through mathematical analysis, we show our
   method's ability to control the amount. An application to program
   display is also shown. When this method is applied to the display of
   structured programs, it provides fisheye-like views which integrate
   local details around the focal point and major landmarks further away.}},

Abstract = {{The surface theological properties of dough (components) were determined
   in order to estimate the effect of these properties on
   disproportionation and coalescence of gas bubbles in bread dough. Three
   different systems were studied as a model for the gas-dough interface: a
   diluted aqueous dough dispersion, gluten and wheat lipids spread on
   water. The surface dilational modulus, E, and tan theta of these systems
   were determined as a function of frequency using a modified Langmuir
   trough. Values of E and tan theta found were: 35-100 mN/m and 0.7-0.2,
   resp., for dough dispersions, 20-45 mN/m and 0.4-0.15, resp., for
   gluten, and 20-90 mN/m and 1.3-0.1, resp., for lipids in the frequency
   range tested at room temperature. On the assumption that the gas-dough
   interface is comparable either to the surface of the dough dispersions
   tested or to a water surface with spread gluten, it was shown that
   disproportionation of gas bubbles in dough can be retarded but not
   prevented. Wheat lipids present in the right concentration in the
   surface can prevent this foam stabilising mechanism to a larger extent.
   The surface dilational modulus as well as the surface tension during
   continuous expansion of dough dispersions were also determined at 45
   degrees C. The surface dilational modulus of a dough dispersion at 45
   degrees C was 7-25 mN/m, which was approximately 5 times smaller than at
   room temperature. Results of surface tension measurements during
   continuous expansion in a Langmuir trough showed that values for surface
   tension were only slightly higher than at equilibrium (ca. 2 mN/m) at 45
   degrees C and at deformation rates of the surface comparable to those at
   oven rise. These results suggest that thin dough films at higher
   temperatures will be less stable than at room temperature. Implications
   in relation with coalescence in dough are discussed. No significant
   differences in surface theological properties of dough dispersions of
   wheats with different bread-making qualities were found in the
   sinusoidal oscillation tests nor in the continuous expansion tests.
   Surface rheological properties, therefore, appear not to be the main
   factor responsible for differences in baking quality amongst different
   wheats. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited}},

   algorithm that finds the most preferred alternative of a decision maker
   (DM) assuming only that the DM has a monotonic utility function. The
   algorithm divides the criteria space into a number of smaller subspaces
   and then uses the ideal points of these subspaces to eliminate
   alternatives. We also develop a more efficient version of the algorithm
   for the more restrictive case of a monotonic quasiconcave utility
   function. We present favorable computational results in terms of the
   required number of pairwise comparisons for both versions of the
   algorithm. We then develop a general algorithm that first identifies the
   type of the DM's utility function and then employs the approach that is
   compatible with the identified utility function type. We also present
   computational results for the general algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The goal of this study was to quantify changes in uterine
   volume during and after chemotherapy for breast cancer.
   Materials and Methods: Fifty-eight patients (mean age 42 years) with
   advanced breast cancer undergoing treatment with FLAC (5-fluorouracil,
   leucovorin, Adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide) were studied with serial
   pelvic CT. The transverse, anteroposterior, and sagittal measurements of
   the uterus were taken in each of the CT scans. The uterine volumes were
   calculated, normalized to baseline volumes, and graphically displayed
   for each patient. The temporal changes in uterine volume were correlated
   to the dates of chemotherapy administration and menstrual status.
   Results: There was a striking and consistent loss of uterine volume with
   chemotherapy. This phenomenon was observed in 55 (95\%) of the 58
   patients. The mean minimum uterine volume was 58.3 +/- 20.2\% compared
   with the baseline. This loss of uterine volume began after the
   administration of the first cycle of chemotherapy and progressed during
   subsequent cycles. It coincided with loss of normal menses in all
   patients. After completion of chemotherapy, there was a recovery of the
   uterine volume in 12 of the 16 patients who had follow-up CT. The mean
   recovery uterine volume was 108.4 +/- 49.8\% of baseline, Menses
   recovered in four of these.
   Conclusion: Chemotherapy causes loss of uterine volume, which usually
   recovers after the withdrawal of chemotherapy in premenopausal women.
   This change should not be mistaken for a therapeutic response of primary
   or secondary malignancy within the uterus or be confused with subsequent
   uterine changes due to tamoxifen.}},

   and occludin. Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells in situ in chickens
   and late chick embryos expressed all of the tight junctional proteins
   examined, showing that tight junctions seal the cell borders of chick
   RPE cells in vivo. On the other hand, RPE cells isolated from late chick
   embryos and transferred in vitro did not express occludin, ZO-1 and 7H6
   antigen. The effects of differentiation-inducing agents, such as
   retinoic acid, dexamethasone and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were tested.
   Only DMSO induced an increase in transepithelial electrical resistance
   (TER) in a time-dependent manner. Under supplementation with DMSO,
   immunofluorescently demonstrable occludin and ZO-1 were induced
   progressively at cell borders in parallel with the increase in TER that
   occurred with decreases in inulin and dextran permeability. Electron
   microscopically tight junction-like junctional apparatus were induced in
   RPE cells. These results indicated that tight junctions of RPE cells
   play an important role in the formation of the BRB. (C) 1995 Academic

   multiple regression analyses showed that ash weight is the major
   determinant of DXA BMC (adjusted r(2) = 0.98, RMS residual = 3.61 g).
   The intercept was not significantly different from zero. DXA BMC
   measurements of other piglets under various clinical situations showed
   no significant effect from the use of cotton blanket, diaper, or
   positioning (prone, supine, lateral). In vivo replication of DXA BMC
   measurements of infants at a postnatal age of from 1-350 days showed a

   IMAGING - A PRACTICAL APPROACH BASED ON SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE INDEXES}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to define an optimal strategy for the
   tomographic reconstruction procedure in routine brain single-photon
   emission tomography (SPET) studies, including the number of projections,
   filter function and matrix size. A set of projection data with different
   count densities was obtained from a technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene
   amine oxime (Tc-99m-HMPAO) brain SPET acquisition from one volunteer.
   The projections were reconstructed with different filters and the
   quality of the reconstructed images was determined using both a
   subjective observer rating score and the Gilbert index. For each count
   density, the observers' choice corresponded to images with the lowest
   Gilbert index. The noise level in brain SPET sections was estimated and
   correlated with the fractal dimension. The results of this study
   indicate that although noise represents a fundamental component of brain
   SPET imaging, image quality also depends on the reconstructed spatial
   resolution. Image quality is satisfactorily described by fractal
   dimension. In addition the optimal filter function depends on the
   available count density. For high count levels, optimal reconstruction
   may be obtained by using a high-resolution matrix and a slightly
   smoother reconstruction filter. When count densities are low, best
   results are obtained by using a low-resolution matrix and a sharper
   filter. Finally, this study suggests that image quality is not
   influenced by the number of projections for equivalent count densities.
   These results were confirmed by 30 HMPAO brain SPET studies acquired in
   a routine clinical setting.}},

Abstract = {{Rheological measurements of electro-magneto-rheological (EMR) fluids
   were carried out by use of modified parallel-plate rheometers equipped

   field either parallel or perpendicular to each other were applied to a
   suspension of spherical iron particles under a constant shear flow. The
   EMR effects, evaluated as the stress increase induced by these fields,
   were compared. It was found that the parallel field gives a marked EMR
   effect in the spherical iron suspension and that the crossed field also
   results in an EMR effect though the increase of stress value under the
   crossed field is not so large. The difference in these EMR effects has
   been interpreted in terms of the different orientations of the dispersed
   particles toward the field directions. Similar experiments using a
   suspension of needle-like iron particles have also indicated that
   particle orientation plays a major role in the EMR effects.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the performance of traffic capacity and handover
   frequency in a DS/CDMA system under imperfect handover. The effect
   experienced when the number of base stations observed by the personal
   station is restricted is estimated. Furthermore, the effect of handover
   hysteresis also is considered. Simulation models are presented which can
   evaluate the traffic capacity and the handover frequency under these
   imperfections. System performance is evaluated by computer simulations
   using these models.
   It is found that if the number of observed base stations is 3 and the
   standard deviation a of short-distance medium value variance is 6 dB,
   the reverse-link traffic capacity is reduced to about 90 percent and the
   forward-link traffic capacity is reduced to about 85 percent, while the
   handover frequency is about 90 percent of the frequency of the
   short-distance medium value variance.
   It is found also that if the handover hysteresis is 4 dB and a is 6 dB,
   the reverse-link traffic capacity is reduced by about 10 percent while
   the handover frequency is about 60 percent of the frequency of the

Abstract = {{The strength-toughness-microstructure relationship in relation to the
   micromechanics of a fracture process has been investigated in the weld
   joints of two alloys: 0.5 Mo and 2.25 Cr-1 Mo steels. These alloys are
   extensively used to fabricate super-heater tubes, boilers, piping, gas
   lines, etc., by welding. The applications require high temperature and
   pressure to be maintained during service. The crack initiation toughness
   and tearing resistance were evaluated using crack tip opening
   displacement/J-integral parameters at different temperatures.
   Quantitative analysis of micro-structure and fracture surfaces was used
   to study the micromechanics of fracture process in the heat-affected
   zone (HAZ) of the alloys. Molybdenum steel exhibited a higher percentage
   of ferrite and lower martensite content, while the other steel showed
   aligned carbide as the major constituent. The higher hardness and
   strength values in the HAZ and welding zone (WZ) of Cr-Mo steel,
   compared to molybdenum steel, may be attributed to the higher amount of
   martensite phase in the alloy. The higher initiation toughness at 200
   degrees C in both the alloys was reflected in the larger dimple size,
   compared to the size observed at room temperature. A tendency for void
   sheet formation was noticed in both alloys. Acicular ferrite and
   martensite appeared to be the most influential constituents affecting
   tearing resistance and initiation toughness.}},

   approximately 10 mu m in diameter with reniform or polymorphic nuclei
   and slightly eosinophilic cytoplasm when stained with Giemsa. Electron
   microscopy revealed that the cytoplasm contained numerous oval granules,
   some of which contained a dense rod-shaped core. The neutrophilic
   granulocytes readily formed conjugates with the human target cells and
   rapidly killed them. The neutrophilic granulocytes killed human derived
   target cells better than murine derived target cells. Inhibition of
   cytotoxicity by catalase suggested that the production of H2O2 is

Abstract = {{Stratlingite (2CaO . Al2O3 . SiO2 . 8H(2)O) is a complex calcium
   aluminosilicate hydrate commonly associated with the hydration of

   Stratlingite can coexist with the hydrogarnet solid solution
   {[}hydrogarnet (3CaO . Al2O2 . 6H(2)O)-katoite (3CaO . Al2O3 . SiO2 .
   4H2O)] and calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H). Since stratlingite is
   present in many blended cements, the knowledge of stratlingite's
   characteristic silicate anion structure and how aluminum is accommodated
   by the structure is important, Phase pure stratlingite samples have been
   synthesized from oxides in the presence of excess water and from
   metakaolinite, calcium aluminate cement, CaO, NaOH, and water, The
   samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and then
   further examined using Si-29, With and without cross-polarization (CP),
   and Al-27 solid-state magic angle nuclear magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy (MASNMR), For the most part, NMR data for these
   stratlingites corroborate structural information available in the
   literature, The aluminum atoms are both tetrahedrally and octahedrally
   coordinated, and the silicon atoms exist predominantly as Q(2),
   Q(2)(1A1), and Q(2)(2AI) species, The presence of alkali affects the

Abstract = {{This randomized double-blind study in 342 mildly to moderately
   depressive outpatients investigated the antidepressant effectiveness and
   speed of action of lorazepam, alprazolam and amitriptyline versus
   placebo. Six weeks of drug treatment were followed by a drug taper
   period, a control period with placebo and a control period without
   placebo, of 2 weeks duration each. Clinical improvement was assessed by
   rating scales (Clinical Global Impressions, Hamilton Rating Scales for
   Depression and Anxiety) and patient's self-ratings (Patient's Global
   Impressions, Self-rating Depression Scale and Visual Analogue Scale). At
   the end of week 6 all active drugs showed similar efficacy which was
   significantly superior to placebo. Compared to placebo, onset of
   efficacy was earlier on benzodiazepines than on amitriptyline. While
   tapering by decreasing the dosage, replacing drug with placebo and
   finally discontinuing placebo, clear withdrawal phenomena were not seen,
   but 20\% of patients, equally distributed to all treatment groups, did
   not want to stop taking tablets after replacing drug with placebo.
   Drop-out rate during the treatment period was very low (9\%).
   Significantly interfering adverse effects were seen in 27 patients,
   without predominance in one of the active drug groups.}},

Abstract = {{Roxithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic with a spectrum of activity
   similar to erythromycin. Roxithromycin has been shown to have a
   favourable pharmacokinetic profile with more reliable absorption and
   higher, prolonged plasma and tissue concentrations compared with
   erythromycin. The pharmacokinetics and dialysis clearance of
   roxithromycin were studied in twelve patients with end-stage renal
   disease on continuous ambulatory perionteal dialysis. Following a single
   300 mg oral dose, multiple blood, dialysate and urine samples were
   collected over 48 h and assayed for roxithromycin by a microbiological
   method. Peak plasma concentrations were attained between 0 . 5 and 5 h,
   and ranged from 2 . 3 to 6 . 8 mg/L. The mean elimination half-life was
   20 . 6 +/- 8 . 7 h, compared with 10 to 14 h previously reported in
   healthy volunteers given a single 300 mg dose. Plasma clearance relative
   to bioavailability (Cl-p/F) ranged from 37 . 3 to 118 . 3 mL/min, The
   percentage of the dose recovered in the dialysate and net dialysis
   clearance were low, ranging from 1 . 0 to 3 . 1\% and 0 . 9 to 1 . 8
   mL/min, respectively. Only 1\% of the dose was recovered in the urine.
   These results demonstrate that roxithromycin is not substantially
   removed by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, and its
   elimination is prolonged in renal failure, possibly due to impaired
   nonrenal elimination.}},

Abstract = {{Male fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator Bose) have visual control systems that
   enable them to track other crabs in front or behind, and to keep
   potential predators to the side, where escape is easiest. The system for
   tracking conspecifics appears to be double, with a low-gain
   velocity-sensitive mechanism operating over about a 90 degrees range,
   backed up by a position-sensitive mechanism at the ends of this range
   which is responsible for recentring the target. This system has separate
   front and rear ranges, with a gap in the direction of the claw. The
   crabs separately fixate the burrow entrance, keeping it in the direction
   opposite the claw. Predator evasion employs two systems simultaneously.
   An open-loop mechanism directs the crab's translatory movements directly
   away from the stimulus, and a rotational mechanism using continuous
   feedback turns the crab so that the stimulus is kept at near 90 degrees
   to the body axis. Both systems are sensitive to the angular position of
   the stimulus, not its velocity. Eye movements have little or no role in
   object tracking. An attempt is made to list Uca's known visual control
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Studies by the US Geological Survey (USGS) of uranium mill tailings
   (UMT) have focused on characterizing the forms in which radionuclides
   are retained and identifying factors influencing the release of
   radionuclides to air and water. Selective extraction studies and studies
   of radionuclide sorption by and leaching from components of UMT showed
   alkaline earth sulfate and hydrous ferric oxides to be important hosts
   of radium-226 (Ra-226) in UMT. Extrapolating from studies of barite
   dissolution in anerobic lake sediments, the leaching of Ra-226 from UMT
   by sulfate-reducing bacteria was investigated; a marked increase in
   Ra-226 release to aqueous solution as compared to sterile controls was
   demonstrated. A similar action of iron(III)-reducing bacteria was later
   shown. Ion exchangers such as clay minerals can also promote the
   dissolution of host-phase minerals and thereby influence the fate of
   radionuclides such as Ra-226. Radon release studies examined particle
   size and ore composition as variables. Aggregation of UMT particles was
   shown to mask the higher emanating fraction of finer particles. Studies
   of various ores and ore components showed that UMT cannot be assumed to
   have the same radon-release characteristics as their precursor ores, nor
   can Ra-226 retained by various substrates be assumed to emanate the same
   fraction of radon. Over the last decade, USGS research directed at
   offsite mobility of radionuclides from uranium mining and milling
   processes has focused on six areas: the Midnite Mine in Washington;
   Ralston Creek and Reservoir, Colorado; sites near Canon City, Colorado;
   the Monument Valley District of Arizona and Utah; the Cameron District
   of Arizona; and the Puerco River basin of Arizona and New Mexico.}},

Abstract = {{Several barrier epithelia such as renal collecting duct, urinary
   bladder, and gastric mucosa maintain high osmotic pH and solute
   gradients between body compartments and the blood by means of apical
   membranes of exceptionally low permeabilities. Although the mechanisms
   underlying these low permeabilities have been only poorly defined, low
   fluidity of the apical membrane has been postulated. The solubility
   diffusion model predicts that lower membrane fluidity will reduce
   permeability by reducing the ability of permeant molecules to diffuse
   through the lipid bilayer. However, little data compare membrane
   fluidity with permeability properties, and it is unclear whether
   fluidity determines permeability to all, or only some substances. We
   therefore studied the permeabilities of a series of artificial large
   unilamellar vesicles (LUV) of eight different compositions, exhibiting a
   range of fluidities encountered in biological membranes. Cholesterol and
   sphingomyelin content and acyl chain saturation were varied to create a
   range of fluidities. LUV anisotropy was measured as steady state
   fluorescence polarization of the lipophilic probe DPH. LUV
   permeabilities were determined by monitoring concentration-dependent or
   pH-sensitive quenching of entrapped carboxyfluorescein on a stopped-flow
   fluorimeter. The relation between DPH anisotropy and permeability to
   water, urea, acetamide, and NH3 was well fit in each instance by single
   exponential functions (r > 0.96), with lower fluidity corresponding to
   lower permeability. By contrast, proton permeability correlated only
   weakly with fluidity. We conclude that membrane fluidity determines
   permeability to most nonionic substances and that transmembrane proton
   flux occurs in a manner distinct from flux of other substances.}},

Abstract = {{Mixtures of carbon dioxide and krypton gases were codeposited from the

   Under equilibrium conditions phase separation occurs. If diffusion is
   suppressed, solids with extremely short coherence lengths were found in
   the concentration range of 30-70 mol\% Kr. The simulation allows to
   reproduce this disorder. It is due to internal distortions rather than
   to grain size effects. The addition of krypton reduces the
   quadrupole-quadrupole interaction. This leads to orientational and to
   centre-of-gravity disorder. The properties of CO2:Kr are discussed in
   comparison with the well known quadrupole glass N-2:Ar For the molecular
   dynamics simulation a flexible model of the CO2 was adopted. This

   beta Pictoris, making use of new observations obtained by the Goddard
   High-Resolution Spectrograph aboard the Hubble Space Telescope and using
   modern methods of atmospheric modeling and spectral synthesis. We derive
   stellar parameters appropriate to its spectral type (T-eff = 8200 +/-
   150 K, log g = 4.25 + 0.1) including a normal (solar) metallicity. When
   dated by comparison with current evolutionary tracks, we find that (1)
   the star is apparently `'underluminous''-a situation we attribute to
   (gray) extinction by the disk-and (2) the star is either a
   pre-main-sequence (PMS) star nearing the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS),
   or it is a main-sequence star older than 0.3 Gyr. Given the apparent
   youth of the disk as inferred from its high density, we judge the PMS
   interpretation as most likely.}},

Abstract = {{We propose two different macroscopic dynamics to describe the decay of
   metastable phases in many-particle systems with local interactions.
   These dynamics depend on the macroscopic order parameter m through the
   restricted free energy F(m) and are designed to give the correct
   equilibrium distribution for m. The connection between macroscopic
   dynamics and the underlying microscopic dynamic is considered in the
   context of a projection-operator formalism. Application to the
   square-lattice nearest-neighbor Ising ferromagnet gives good agreement
   with droplet theory and Monte Carlo simulations of the underlying
   microscopic dynamic. This includes quantitative agreement for the
   exponential dependence of the lifetime {[}tau] on the inverse of the
   applied field H, and the observation of distinct field regions in which
   Lambda = d ln{[}tau]/d\textbackslash{}H\textbackslash{}(1-d) depends
   differently on \textbackslash{}H\textbackslash{}. In addition, at very
   low temperatures we observe oscillatory behavior of Lambda with respect
   to \textbackslash{}H\textbackslash{}, which is due to the discreteness
   of the lattice and in agreement with rigorous results, Similarities and
   differences between this work and earlier works on finite Ising models
   in the fixed-magnetization ensemble are discussed.}},

   or glial fibrillary acidic protein. Throughout the stages studied, the
   expression of cytokeratin was strong. Vimentin expression, on the other
   hand, changed during the stages studied. In our youngest embryos,
   vimentin could be detected only in the peripheral cells of the
   notochord, During development, a distinct increase occurred in vimentin
   expression, and in the oldest embryos, all notochord cells showed bright
   vimentin-specific fluorescence. Simultaneously with this modification, a
   change occured in the expression of desmosomal proteins: The notochord
   cells expressed desmoplakins abundantly during early stages, but weakly
   or not at all during later stages. Correspondingly, electron microscopy
   of the same stages showed a striking decrease in the number of
   desmosomes between notochord cells. Our results confirm that, during
   early development, the notochord displays features specific for
   epithelial cells. This accords with the view that notochord is of
   epithelial origin. The modifications observed in the expression of IF
   and desmosomal proteins were temporally correlated with developmentally
   regulated atrophy of the notochord, The programmed regression of the
   notochord cells is thus associated with a switch from a predominantly
   epithelial phenotype to a more mesenchymal one.}},

Abstract = {{Differences in cytokeratin expression of clinically normal buccal mucosa
   were studied in 50 healthy women by indirect immunofluorescence staining
   with monoclonal antibodies. The subjects were divided into four groups:
   control group (N = 18), smokers (N = 8), oral contraceptive users (N =
   8) and smokers receiving oral contraceptives (N = 16). Our findings
   indicate that cytokeratin expression in noncornified stratified
   epithelium is not influenced by smoking or oestradiol/progesterone
   treatment. Only cytokeratin No. 19 showed variable patterns of
   expression but the differences could not be ascribed to smoking or
   contraceptives. Cytokeratin No. 19 gave a positive reaction in the basal
   and suprabasal layers in 34 subjects (68\%). In 9 (18\%) specimens, the
   staining was positive in the basal cells and showed a positive
   heterogeneous cytoplasmic reaction in the suprabasal cells.
   Interestingly, cytokeratin No. 7 was recognized in all epithelial cells
   except the basal cells. Our results suggest that changes in the serum
   oestradiol levels do not affect the cytokeratin pattern in buccal
   mucosa.}},

   Observatory during 18 moonless nights in the years 1989, 1990, 1991, and
   1993. Most of the measurements were performed in eight intermediate band
   filters between 350 nm and 820 nm. A set of measurements was obtained in
   the broad band UBV RI filters during three nights in 1990. Typically 10
   to 20 readings were obtained each night for one or two fixed positions
   (fixed in or, delta), selected to be free of stars down to a limiting
   magnitude of about B = 20. The sky brightnesses were calibrated using
   standard stars. We discuss the sky brightness variations both during
   individual nights and from year to year and compare the observed sky
   brightnesses to measurements from other observatory sites. We have found
   that the long-term variations are well correlated with the solar
   activity, for which the 10.7 cm radio flux is used as a measure.}},

   All the patients had clinical and radiological review at about six weeks

   Pain and reflex sympathetic dystrophy were more frequent after Kapandji
   fixation and early mobilisation, but the range of motion was better
   although this became statistically insignificant after six weeks, The

Abstract = {{A double layer system of polyurethane rubber and a metal foil was
   described by calculation and experiment. There is a significant increase
   in erosion resistance of a carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic component by
   application of this system and the experimental results correlate with
   theoretical estimations. Among the investigated materials surface layers
   of titanium and a titanium aluminium alloy respectively possess the best
   resistance in the range of all angles of incidence. The polyurethane
   rubber also exhibits a very good erosion behaviour under conditions of
   normal impact as well as at shallow impact angles at room temperature,
   So the rubber takes care of a good emergency running quality after a
   destruction of the metal foil. It was found that the relative erosion
   rate of the protective metal layer decreases with increasing thickness
   of the rubber. A thickness of about 0,5-0,7 mm of the protective metal
   layer is sufficient in practice. The titanium foil should have a
   thickness of about 100 - 200 mu m for the design life because if the
   metal foil is too weak it will undergo destruction rather fast under
   laboratory conditions, There is no change of the well-known erosion
   mechanisms with the formation of walls around the places of normal
   impacts as well as grooving and machining at shallow impact angles by
   application of the double layer system. An increase in temperature up to
   80 degrees C doesn't cause any change of the erosion rate of the
   investigated metal foils in the double layer system but will influence
   the erosion of the polyurethane rubber alone. The galvanic deposition of
   nickel is another way for the use of the double layer system especially
   for components with a complex geometric shape.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the accuracy of diagnosing anterior cruciate
   ligament (ACL) tears with axial MR imaging.
   Materials and Methods: Two blinded independent observers retrospectively
   reviewed axial T2 weighted or FSE fat suppressed imaging of the knee
   from 47 patients, Arthroscopy had demonstrated a complete tear of the
   ACL in 25 patients and a normal ACL in 22 patients. The two criteria
   used to diagnose ACL tears on sequential axial imaging were (a) lack of
   visualization of the ACL in its expected course or (b) focal increased
   signal in the expected course of the ACL.
   Results: Observer 1 demonstrated a sensitivity of 92\% (23 of 25) and a
   specificity of 100\% (22 of 22) in diagnosing ACL tears (chi(2) = 39.6,
   P < 0.001). Observer 2 demonstrated a sensitivity of 92\% (23 of 25) and
   a specificity of 82\% (18 of 22) in diagnosing ACL tears (chi(2) = 26.1,
   p < 0.001). The Kappa value was 0.75 (agreement in 41 of 47 cases),
   indicating a high degree of intraobserver agreement.
   Conclusion: Axial T2 weighted or FSE fat suppressed imaging provides an
   accurate means of confirming the diagnosis of ACL tears.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the phenomenon of cavity formation through an
   analysis of the problem of a plane circular elastic inclusion embedded
   in an unbounded elastic matrix subject to a remote equibiaxial load.
   Consistent with infinitesimal strain kinematics, nonlinear behavior is
   confined to a cohesive zone so that inclusion-matrix interaction is
   characterized by a nonlinear interface force-interface separation law
   requiring a characteristic length for its prescription. Equilibrium
   solutions for both rotationally symmetric and nonsymmetric cavity shapes
   are sought based on an integral equation formulation together with known
   elasticity solutions for circular domains. For values of remote load,
   interface strength and elastic moduli within certain bounds only
   rotationally symmetric cavities occur under decreasing characteristic
   length-inclusion radius ratio. At other parameter values the existence
   of nonsymmetric cavities is studied by performing a linearized
   bifurcation analysis about the rotationally symmetric equilibrium state.
   A post bifurcation analysis is carried out by reducing the governing
   integral equations to a truncated set of nonlinear algebraic equations
   and analysing those. Stability of equilibrium states is assessed with
   the Hadamard stability definition. Calculations for the interfacial
   tractions are carried out as well. The study reveals that rotationally
   symmetric cavities must give way to the abrupt formation of stable
   nonsymmetric cavities when the interface force attains its maximum
   value. Thus, the phenomenon of ductile decohesion, or the gradual
   opening of a cavity coincident with an unloading of the interface,
   cannot occur (for the system being studied) without artificially
   constraining the inclusion against rigid displacement.}},

Abstract = {{We describe six children with acute decreases in heart rate temporally
   related to amphotericin B administration. All patients had achieved
   their maximal dose within 3 to 4 days. Heart-rate drops occurred as
   early as day 3 but could be delayed up to day 7 after start of therapy.
   The mean heart rate dropped from 104 +/- 8/min (range 96 to 114) to 62
   +/- 8/min (range 48 to 72) (P = 0.0001). A slower heart rate than
   baseline was noted during the entire duration of drug administration,
   from 60 minutes of starting the infusion to 220 minutes (mean 120 +/-
   40) after discontinuation of the infusion. This reaction was noted in
   six of 90 (6.7\%) patients who had amphotericin. These six children were
   compared with six age-matched children who received the drug but in whom
   such changes in heart rate did not develop. The method of administration
   of amphotericin B was similar in both patients and controls, starting
   with 0.25 mg/kg/day and increasing by 0.25 mg/kg/day up to 1 mg/kg/day.
   Children with heart-rate drop received amphotericin for 4.6 +/- 1.8
   days, significantly shorter than their controls (12.6 +/- 6.9 days) (P =
   0.02), suggesting that this adverse effect has led to early
   discontinuation of amphotericin therapy. Physicians and nurses caring
   for children receiving amphotericin B should be aware of this potential
   adverse effect, which can be serious in a patient with an underlying
   heart condition or in a patient who is already on heart-rate-lowering
   drugs.}},

   the means and coefficients of variation of the following red cell (RBC)

   pattern characterized by much larger coefficients of variation of the Hb
   content and volume distributions than of the Hb concentration and
   relative lytic tonicity distributions. From analysis of the factors that
   determine those RBC properties, the patterns were interpreted as
   reflecting previously unrecognized statistical proportionalities between
   cell osmolyte content, Hb content, and membrane area. The possible
   origin of these statistical links was analyzed by considering
   alternative models with and without the participation of regulatory
   processes during cell maturation. A model was shown to be feasible in
   which mature RBC variability with proportional volume, area, and Hb

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To review information regarding the dual and interdependent
   drug-nutrient interaction between phenytoin and folic acid and other
   literature involving phenytoin and folic acid.
   DATA SOURCES: Information was retrieved from a MEDLINE search of
   English-language literature conducted from 1983 (time of the last
   review) to March 1995. Search terms included folic acid, phenytoin, and
   folic acid deficiency. Additional references were obtained from Current
   Contents and from the bibliographies of the retrieved references.
   STUDY SELECTION: All human studies examining the effects of phenytoin on
   serum folate concentrations and folic acid supplementation on serum
   phenytoin concentrations were selected. These included studies of
   patients with epilepsy and healthy volunteers as well as case reports.
   Case reports were included because of the extensive length of time
   needed to study this drug interaction.
   DATA EXTRACTION: Data extracted included gender, dosing, serum folate
   concentrations if available, pharmacokinetics, and adverse events.
   DATA SYNTHESIS: Serum folate decreases when phenytoin therapy is
   initiated alone with no folate supplementation. Folic acid
   supplementation in folate-deficient patients with epilepsy changes the
   pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, usually leading to lower serum phenytoin
   concentrations and possible seizure breakthrough. Folate is hypothesized
   to be a cofactor in phenytoin metabolism and may be responsible for the
   `'pseudo-steady-state,'' which is a concentration where phenytoin
   appears to be at steady-state, but in reality, is not. Phenytoin and
   folic acid therapy initiated concomitantly prevents decreased folate and
   phenytoin obtains steady-state concentrations sooner.
   CONCLUSIONS: Folic acid supplementation should be initiated each time
   phenytoin therapy commences because of the hypothesized cofactor
   mechanism, decreased adverse effects associated with folate deficiency,
   and better seizure control with no perturbation of phenytoin
   pharmacokinetics.}},

   sequences; these two methods, and the compatibility method, were used to
   analyze the aligned nucleotide sequences. Essentially identical

   from both the pol gene nucleotide and RT amino acid sequences, which
   divided the 55 retroelements into six major groups. The reliability of

Abstract = {{The knowledge of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) has greatly
   expanded during the last few years, and TFPI is now established as a
   coagulation inhibitor of great importance. Its main role seems to be
   inhibition of small amounts of tissue factor which probably is essential
   for maintaining a normal hemostatic balance. The acceleration of TFPl's
   inhibitory effect by heparin, the TFPI release caused by heparin
   injection, and TFPl's heparin affinity may greatly contribute to the
   anticoagulant properties of the endothelium, and may be particularly
   important for the outcome of vascular injury. The information provided
   by one single measurement of plasma TFPI in a patient is difficult to
   interpret, but serial measurements during the course of a disease may
   signal the prognosis. Recombinant TFPI has proved effective in the
   treatment of experimental disseminated intravascular coagulation sepsis,
   and thrombosis. Whether TFPI or TFPI derivatives will be as effective in
   the treatment of patients remains to be determined.}},

Abstract = {{Contaminated allograft donor tissue represents a potential source of
   infection unique to keratoplasty.  We prospectively studied perilimbal
   cultures of drowning victims over 30 months to determine if the ocular
   surface flora of drowning victims was unique.  Twenty-eight donor eyes
   were cultured from 14 drowning victims.  Ninety-three percent of limbal
   cultures were positive for one or more organisms, compared to results of
   a previous study of surface contamination of donor globes in which 65\%
   were found to be culture positive.  Fifty-seven percent (16 of 28) of
   donor eyes grew at least one streptococcal species, while 46\% (13 of
   28) grew two or more streptococcal species.  A previous study identified
   streptococcal species in 7.9\% of perilimbal cultures from nondrowning
   donor eyes, which demonstrates the unique effect of drowning on the
   ocular flora.  The incidence of gram-negative isolates was also markedly
   higher in drowning victims, compared to previous studies of donor
   globes.  This prospective study has shown that the ocular surface flora
   of drowning victims harbors markedly increased numbers of streptococcal
   species as well as gram-negative organisms.  These findings demand
   careful globe decontamination, and emphasize the need for appropriate
   antibiotic coverage in corneal storage media.}},

   Reproducible amplified DNA fragments of 11 isolates showed obviously
   inter- or intra-specific polymorphisms, enabling us to differentiate
   easily the nematode species and isolates. Combining RAPD-PCR fragments
   with the examination of morphological characters of infective juveniles
   and 1st-generation males, we identified isolate OH1S, collected from
   Newport, Oregon, as S. feltiae; isolate OS21, collected from Grants

Abstract = {{Cytochrome oxidase is the terminal enzyme in the mitochondrial
   respiratory chain engaged in oxidative metabolism and energy production.
   In mammals, the holoenzyme is composed of 13 subunits encoded by both
   nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. The goal of the present study was to
   compare the effect of afferent impulse blockade on the expression of
   these two genomes at the subunit protein level. It also aimed to
   determine the correlation between the level of cytochrome oxidase
   activity and the relative amount of subunit proteins. Relative enzyme
   activity was analysed histochemically, and relative amounts of subunits
   IV (nuclear-encoded) and II/III (mitochondrial-derived) proteins were
   obtained immunohistochemically by anti-subunit IV and anti-subunit
   II/III antibodies in the lateral geniculate nucleus and the primary
   visual cortex of adult monkeys. In the normal visual centers, similar
   staining patterns were found for all three markers. After three and
   seven days of tetrodotoxin treatment, levels of enzyme activity and
   subunit proteins declined disproportionately in the deprived laminae of
   the visual center. Densitometric analysis indicates that changes in
   enzyme activity and subunit IV proteins were significantly greater than
   those of subunit II/III proteins (P < 0.01). The finding that nuclear
   and mitochondrial genomes are disproportionately regulated at subunit
   protein levels by neuronal activity implies that the two genomes operate
   under different regulatory mechanisms. Changes in subunit IV paralleled
   most closely those of cytochrome oxidase activity (coefficient of
   determination r(2) = 0.95). This suggests that nuclear-derived subunit
   IV protein may play a pivotal role in controlling cytochrome oxidase
   holoenzyme activity.}},

Abstract = {{A novel interface to connect a capillary electrophoresis (CE) system
   with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometric (ICPMS) detector
   is reported here. The interface was built using a direct injection

   concentrically inside the fused-silica DIN sample introduction
   capillary. A makeup liquid was pumped at a now rate of 15 mu L/min into
   the fused-silica DIN sample transfer capillary via a connector. The
   makeup liquid flowing outside the CE capillary sewed two purposes: (a)
   it established continuous and stable electrical contact at the exit
   (grounding) terminus of the CE capillary, and (b) it allowed the DIN
   system to be optimized independently of the CE system for efficient
   sample introduction to the ICPMS system. The makeup liquid along with
   the liquid from the electroosmotic now generated inside the CE capillary
   was nebulized by the DIN system directly into the ICP torch. The
   CE/DIN-ICPMS system was evaluated using test samples containing selected
   alkali, alkaline-earth, and heavy metal ions, as well as selenium
   {[}Se(IV) and Se(VI)], and various inorganic and organic arsenic
   species. The preliminary results show that the CE/DIN-ICPMS system can

   parachloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid (PCMBS) were found to be potent
   inhibitors of both enzymes. Transferase activities were restored when
   DEPC- or PCMBS-modified proteins were incubated with hydroxylamine or
   DTT, respectively, suggesting specific modifications of histidyl and
   sulfhydryl residues. Inactivation by DIDS was consistent with lysyl
   modification. The arginine and serine specific reagents, 2,3-butanedione
   (2,3-BD) and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF), and the other thiol
   specific modifier N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) had no effect on the two
   transferases. Loss of enzymic activity for both proteins followed
   pseudo-first-order kinetics with respect to time and reagent
   concentration. Double-log plots of pseudo-first-order rate constants
   versus inhibitor concentration yielded slope values of 1.95 (HQT), 2.68
   (I-IST) with DEPC, 2.91 (HQT), 1.89 (HST) with DIDS, 2.75 (HQT) and 1.77
   (HST) with PCMBS. This suggests the modification of at least two
   histidyl, three lysyl and three cysteyl residues at each active site of
   HQT, and three histidyl, two lysyl and two cysteyl at each active site
   of HST. For both transferases, substrate interaction kinetic patterns,
   obtained using p-coumaroyl-CoA (p-C-CoA) as phenolic substrate, were
   consistent with a quasi-independent hi hi random mechanism for
   catalysis.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes the influence of the baby on the process and
   duration of breastfeeding. A qualitative study of the experience of
   breastfeeding provided rich, contextual descriptions of breastfeeding in
   the lives of five families before and after the birth of their first
   babies. Knowledge, skill, and support of family and friends influenced
   breastfeeding duration, but only in the presence of baby satisfaction.
   The characteristics associated with baby satisfaction were competent
   sucking, `'easiness,'' and stamina. Based on these findings, it appears
   that, to be successful, `'it takes two to breastfeed.'' Breastfeeding
   education should include much more information on the contribution of
   the baby to the process of breastfeeding. Health care providers should
   be skilled in both infant breastfeeding assessment and interventions to
   facilitate successful breastfeeding.}},

Abstract = {{Williams syndrome (WS) is generally characterized by mental deficiency,
   gregarious personality, dysmorphic facies, supravalvular aortic
   stenosis, and idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia. Patients with WS show
   allelic loss of elastin (ELN), exhibiting a submicroscopic deletion, at
   7q11.23, detectable by FISH. Hemizygosity is likely the cause of
   vascular abnormalities in WS patients. A series of 235 patients was
   studied, and molecular cytogenetic deletions were seen in 96\% of
   patients with classic WS. Patients included 195 solicited through the
   Williams Syndrome Association (WSA), plus 40 clinical cytogenetics cases
   referred by primary-care physicians. Photographs and medical records of
   most WSA subjects were reviewed, and patients were identified as
   `'classic'' (n = 114) of `'uncertain'' (n = 39). An additional 42 WSA
   patients were evaluated without clinical information. FISH was performed
   with biotinylated ELN cosmids on metaphase cells from immortalized
   lymphoblastoid lines from WSA patients and after high-resolution banding
   analysis on clinical referral patients. An alpha-satellite probe for
   chromosome 7 was included in hybridizations, as an internal control.
   Ninety-six percent of the patients with classic WS showed a deletion in
   one ELN allele; four of these did not show a deletion. Of the uncertain
   WS patients, only 3 of 39 showed a deletion. Of the 42 who were not
   classified phenotypically, because of lack of clinical information, 25
   patients (60\%) showed a deletion. Thirty-eight percent (15/40) of
   clinical cytogenetics cases showed an ELN deletion and no cytogenetic
   deletion by banded analysis. These results support the usefulness of
   FISH for the detection of elastin deletions as an initial diagnostic
   assay for WS.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Most patients with endometrial carcinoma present with stage I
   disease and it is this group of patients in which prognostic factors
   have been studied, so that therapy can be tailored to the risks for
   recurrence. The papillary serous endometrial cancer and clear cell
   cancers have a poor prognosis but these comprise only a small proportion
   of endometrial cancer patients. The current surgical staging system for
   endometrial cancer is based on previously identified intra and
   extra-uterine factors that influence the prognosis. However, much of the
   information regarding prognosis, such as histologic type and grade,
   evidence of disease beyond the uterus and receptor-status can be gleaned
   from careful preoperative assessment of these patients. Information
   regarding ploidy and receptor status is available from curettage
   specimens and, with increasing use of hysteroscopy and/or vaginal
   ultrasound a more precise assessment of the extent of the disease in the
   uterine cavity and involvement of the cervix may be possible, although
   the uterine extent of the disease does not play the prognostic role that
   was anticipated formerly. A major concern regarding surgical staging has
   been the fact that many of these patients are elderly and obese with
   significant medical problems. There is the imminent risk that the pelvic
   and para-aortic node dissection (rather than sampling) may increase
   morbidity. More studies have shown that this might not be a factor with
   sampling. But does it suffice? Similarly, concerns have been expressed
   regarding those patients who may require postoperative radiation which
   may be compromised by postoperative adhesions, bladder, intestine and
   ureteral problems. It is yet to be demonstrated that in diseases
   extending outside the pelvis, the currently available treatment affects
   survival. Undoubtedly, recurrence patterns will be affected but clear
   demonstration of survival advantage is not available, eventually will
   never be. The concepts of treatment of advanced disease with spread
   outside the pelvis should undergo rethinking in the way that control of
   the existing disease rather than eradicating it by all means might offer
   better chances for life quality, life expectancy albeit limited, in
   cancer patients.}},

Abstract = {{To study the interaction of the TCR with its ligand, the complex of a
   MHC molecule and an antigenic peptide, we modified a TCR contact residue
   of a H-2K(d)-restricted antigenic peptide with photoreactive
   4-azidabenzoic acid. The photoreactive group was a critical component of
   the epitope recognized by CTL clones derived from mice immunized with
   such a peptide derivative. The majority of these clones expressed V beta
   1-encoded beta chains that were paired with J alpha TA28-encoded a
   chains. For one of these TCR, the photoaffinity labeled sites were
   mapped on the a chain as a J alpha TA28-encoded tryptophan and on the
   beta chain as a residue of the C' strand of V beta 1. Molecular modeling
   of this TCR suggested the presence of a hydrophobic pocket that harbors
   this tryptophan as well as a tyrosine on the C' strand of V beta 1
   between which the photoreactive side chain inserts. It is concluded that
   this avid binding principle may account for the preferential selection
   of V beta 1 and J alpha TA28-encoded TCR.}},

   element partitioning is mainly controlled by the ionic radius criterion,
   with smaller Y, Gd, and U ions having a preference for zirconolite and
   the larger Ce and Nd ions favoring perovskite. Average relative

Abstract = {{Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is the most common
   hereditary form of colorectal cancer (CRC), accounting for approximately
   10\% of the total CRC burden. HNPCC lacks premonitory physical stigmata,
   thereby making the family history crucial for diagnosis. Advances in
   molecular genetics during the past 2 years have led to the cloning of
   four HNPCC genes (MHS2, MLH1, PMS1 and PMS2). It is now possible to
   provide presymptomatic DNA testing followed by genetic counselling for
   gene carriers. Some studies have shown that adenomas in HNPCC are
   larger, more villous, and have more high grade dysplasia than sporadic
   cases, suggesting an accelerated adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Given the
   early age of onset and proximal predominance of CRC, we initiate
   colonoscopy at age 20-25 years and we recommend that it be performed
   every 1-2 years. The wealth of clinical and molecular genetic knowledge
   currently available to physicians about HNPCC can be used effectively
   for cancer control.}},

Abstract = {{Growth and flowering of shoots of `Mercedes' rose was investigated as a
   function of the level and spectral quality of photosynthetic photon flux
   (PPP). Experiments were performed with single-shoot plants decapitated
   above the two most basal leaves with five leaflets. The development of
   the two lateral shoots emerging from the axillary buds of these leaves
   was studied for 4 to 6 weeks. To discriminate between the effects of
   irradiance and light quality, plants were grown in growth chambers in
   which PPF and its spectral composition could be controlled. At a
   photoperiod of 12 hours, the length, weight, and flowering of the shoots
   strongly increased with irradiance. The growth and number of flowering
   shoots were always higher for the uppermost than for the second shoot.
   At the highest PPF (270 mu mol . m(-2). s(-1)), flowering occurred in
   89\% and 33\% of the uppermost and second shoots, respectively. At an
   irradiance level of 90 mu mol . m(-2). s(-1), these percentages were 6\%
   and 0\%. Although length and dry weight of both types of shoots were
   significantly increased by reducing the amount of blue light at constant
   PPF, flower development was not affected. In a second experiment, plants
   grown in while tight (12 h/day) received a short treatment with
   low-intensity red or far-red light at the end of each photoperiod. An
   end-of-day treatment with red light resulted in significantly more
   flowering shoots than far-red. The red far-red reversibility of this
   flowering response indicates the involvement of the photoreceptor
   phytochrome.}},

Abstract = {{The Geelwal Karoo heavy-mineral placer is situated in an active beach
   environment along the rugged southern Namaqualand coast of South Africa.
   The geomorphology of the coast is controlled by resistant Precambrian
   and Palaeozoic basement rocks, which also dictate the narrow, elongate
   geometry and limited 10 km strike length of this strandline deposit. Ore
   reserves are small compared to the multi-million tonne analogous
   Quaternary sands elsewhere in the world. However, the locally high,
   total heavy mineral content and the favourable ore to gangue mineral
   ratio, coupled with the possibility of replenishment style mining, makes
   this an attractive resource. Garnet and ilmenite are the dominant heavy
   minerals followed by pyroxene, zircon, rutile and titaniferous
   alteration products after ilmenite. The high Ti content of ilmenite
   (51\%) and predominantly almandine garnet suggest metamorphic source
   rocks, most Likely part of the Namaqualand Metamorphic Complex. These
   rocks are considered to be the primary source. However, after numerous
   stages of reworking, large quantities of heavy minerals are concentrated
   in the Neogene marine terraces along the west coast. The 35 m terrace, a
   local, heavy, mineral-rich palaeostrandline, acted as a point source and
   supplied vast quantities to the coastal environment. A J-bay shaped
   headland to the south prevented excessive dispersion of the minerals by
   the strong northward-directed littoral drift. This allowed wave action
   to transport, concentrate and re-deposit the heavy minerals in their
   present beach environment at Geelwal Karoo.}},

Abstract = {{A mass in the axilla of a 47-year-old woman was biopsied and resected.
   The mass was composed of a loosely distributed population of spindle
   cells that were immunoreactive for smooth-muscle actin.
   Ultrastructurally, the cells possessed abundant endoplasmic reticulum,
   and some contained peripheral smooth muscle myofilaments, establishing
   that they were myofibroblasts. Mitotic activity was sparse, there was no
   cytologic atypia, and by flow cytometry the tumor was diploid with a low
   S phase. A diagnosis of myofibroblastoma was favored, although the
   possibility of a low-grade sarcoma could not be excluded. There has not
   been any indication of recurrence over a 4-month period of follow-up.}},

Abstract = {{The fibronectin receptor, alpha(5) beta(1), may be involved in many
   aspects of early development, including migration of endodermal and
   mesodermal cells during formation of the placenta, trophoblastic
   outgrowth in culture, and development of an invasive phenotype by fetal
   cytotrophoblasts. In contrast to the human blastocyst, the bovine
   blastocyst elongates in the uterine lumen for several days until it
   begins attachment, and the fetal trophoblast limits its invasion to the
   maternal epithelium. Fibronectin receptor expression was characterized
   in bovine embryos before and after their attachment to the uterus.
   Initially, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was conducted with
   degenerate oligonucleotide primers to isolate bovine cDNAs for the
   alpha(5) and beta(1) subunits. Bovine-specific primers were then
   constructed to assay for alpha(5) and beta(1) mRNA expression in embryo
   RNA during the morula through the attachment stages using
   reverse-transcriptase PCR. Northern blot analysis was used to quantify
   mRNA levels from Days 15 to 21. Integrin and fibronectin protein
   expression was assessed by immu nohistochemical examination of embryo
   sections. Both alpha(5) and beta(1) subunit mRNAs were expressed
   throughout the stages examined. Expression of both subunit proteins was
   found in the endoderm at Day 14 but not at Day 18 or later. Fibronectin
   reactivity was not present at any of the stages examined. Between Days
   18 and 21, beta(1)-reactivity appeared on the lateral surfaces of the
   trophoblast cells. Day 24 trophoblast binucleate cells showed intense
   staining with the beta(1) antibody, suggesting that a beta(1)-integrin
   is involved in binucleate cell migration.}},

Abstract = {{The expression of alpha5 beta1 (alpha 5 beta 1) integrin and its
   extracellular ligand fibronectin was studied immunohistochemically in 23
   cases of Dupuytren's disease using an immunoperoxidase method for light
   microscopic visualization. All cases consisted of multiple nodules
   showing a variable degree of cellularity and fibrosis. Depending on the
   histological appearance of these nodules, each case was assigned to the
   three following phases: proliferative, involutional and residual. Alpha5
   beta 1 integrin was detected in the highly cellular areas of both
   proliferative and involutional phases where fibronectin was
   simultaneously expressed in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Diversely
   alpha 5 beta 1 and fibronectin disappeared from the hypocellular areas
   of involutional phase, undergoing fibrotic transformation, and from the
   fibrotic connective tissue of residual phases. These findings indicate
   that the expression pattern of alpha 5 beta 1 integrin correlates with
   the presence in the ECM of the corresponding ligand fibronectin during
   the different phases of Dupuytren's disease. We suggest that alpha 5
   beta 1 integrin, linking fibronectin to stromal cells of both
   proliferative and involutional phases, may be involved in the
   contractile processes occuring in Dupuytren's disease.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To compare the reproductive performance of Indian versus
   white women in IVF.
   Design: Controlled comparative clinical study.
   Setting: In vitro fertilization center based in university department in
   large tertiary level hospital.
   Patients: Results from first IVF treatment cycles in 44 Indian patients
   were compared with results from 88 white patients, matched by age and
   body mass index, over the same treatment year. The patients were
   selected from a prospectively collected IVF databank.
   Interventions: Standard luteal-phase start long GnRH analogue regime.
   Ovarian stimulation with FSH and hMG. Transvaginal ultrasound-guided
   oocyte recovery. In vitro fertilization and ET following established
   protocols.
   Main Outcome Measures: Rates of abandoned cycles, egg retrievals, ETs,
   clinical pregnancies, miscarriages, and live births were compared in the
   first IVF treatment cycle. Cumulative pregnancy rates (PRs) over three
   cycles in the two groups of patients were also compared.
   Results: More cycles were abandoned in the Indian than in the white
   group: 22.7\% versus 9.1\%. The Indian live birth rate per cycle was
   worse: 9.1\% versus 22.7\%. The performance of the two groups was
   otherwise similar: ovarian stimulation with hMG and FSH required 26.0
   ampules in the Indian group versus 24.6 ampules in the white group, mean
   number of follicles on the day of egg retrieval 8.7 versus 8.7, mean
   number of eggs 5.9 versus 5.8, fertilization rate 82.4\% versus 82.5 \%;
   ET rate 73.5\% versus 82.5, mean number of embryos transferred 2.1
   versus 1.8, and clinical PR per cycle started 18.2\% versus 27.3\%.
   Conclusions: Under the same IVF regime, Indians performed worse than
   whites at the stage of ovarian stimulation (higher rate of abandoned
   cycles for poor response) and in live birth rate. Cumulative conception
   and live birth rates also tended to be worse in Indians than in whites.}},

Abstract = {{Bipolar disorder and alcoholism are familial disorders. The

   admitted patients with either bipolar disorder or/and alcoholism;
   relatives of the patients (in total 728 relatives directly interviewed)

   familial components underlying bipolar disorder and alcoholism was not
   observed if the analysis was restricted to `pure' diagnostic groups.
   Excess comorbidity between bipolar disorder and alcoholism was observed
   in relatives. Multiple sources for this excess of comorbidity between
   major affective disorders and alcoholism in families of probands with
   bipolar disorder are likely; in particular, we found evidence for a
   distinct subgroup of comorbid cases with familial comorbidity; however,
   excess comorbidity was also found in absence of familial loading with

   recombinant progesterone receptor A form (PR-A). The compounds tested
   were progesterone, Promegestone (R5020), Mifepristone (RU486), ZK98,734,
   Onapristone (ZK98,299), 11 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, 11
   alpha-progesterone hemisuccinate, androsterone, etiocholanolone, 5
   alpha- and 5 beta-pregnane-3,20-diones, and 20 alpha- and 20 beta
   -hydroxyprogesterones. The K-i values for these ligands were determined
   by competitive binding assays using radiolabelled progesterone as the
   binding site ligand. For anti-progesterone antibodies (e.g. DB3 and
   11/32), only progesterone (3.6-8.8 nM), the 11 alpha-derivatives
   (1.0-5.5 nM) used to prepare the immunogen and the two 5-pregnanediones
   (20.9-45.1 nM) were bound with high affinity. For PR-A, high affinity
   binding was found with receptor agonists (K-i = 1.1-6.2 nM), both 5- and
   20-reduced metabolites, and antagonists (0.6-28.0 nM), but not with the
   11 alpha-derivatives (950 nM-1.0 mu M). In contrast, the PPBPs displayed
   high affinity interactions with progesterone (3.5-4.2 nM) and both 5
   alpha- and 20 alpha-reduced metabolites (2.4-3.4 nM). Binding with the
   beta-isomers and R5020 was less pronounced (22-170 nM) and there was no
   evidence of high affinity binding with PR antagonists (> 1.0 mu M).
   Analogs with the 17-keto group did not bind to any of the binders
   studied. Thus, commonalities among the three types of protein binders
   were their comparable binding affinities for progesterone (3.5-8.8 nM)
   and 5-pregnanedione isomers (2.4-330 nM), and a lack of binding for two
   C17-keto steroids (androsterone and etiocholanolone). The results imply
   that the tertiary features of the binding domain of these three types of
   proteins are sufficiently different to result in unique binding
   structures.}},

Abstract = {{Oscillatory secretion of insulin has been observed in many different

   possible model for oscillatory secretion from the perifused,

   uptake of glucose by GLUT transporters, the rate of glucose metabolism
   within the cell, and the effect of glucose on the rate of insulin
   secretion. Putative feedback by insulin on the rate of glucose transport
   into the cells is treated phenomenologically and leads to insulin
   oscillations similar to those observed experimentally in HIT cells. The
   resulting set of ordinary differential equations is simplified by
   time-scale analysis to a two-variable set of ordinary differential
   equations. Because of this simplification we can explore, in great
   detail, the characteristics of the oscillations and their sensitivity to
   parameter variation using phase plane analysis.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The corneal sighting center is defined by the intersection
   of the line of sight with the anterior corneal surface and is usually
   found by measuring angle lambda, between the pupillary axis and the line
   of sight. It is to be determined if a measurement of the pupil offset in
   the corneal map of videokeratography might be used instead of angle
   lambda to provide a practical clinical method for finding the corneal
   sighting center.
   METHOD: Two-dimensional angle lambda measurements were made in a group
   of 17 young adult Caucasian subjects under natural pupil conditions,
   using an apparatus designed for this purpose, and were compared to
   measurements of the corneal sighting center position as located by
   videokeratography.
   RESULTS: The correlation between angle lambda as measured directly and
   the pupil offset as measured by videokeratography was 0.84, which is
   statistically and clinically significant.
   CONCLUSIONS: The position of the corneal sighting center may be found
   relative to the corneal reflex of a fixated light by using the distance
   and direction of the pupil offset in the corneal map of
   videokeratography, or indirectly by taking 0.6 times the same value and
   measuring in the opposite direction from the pupillary axis, The latter
   method does not require active fixation by the patient.}},

Abstract = {{Strenuously exercising Thoroughbreds exhibit a dramatic increase in
   pulmonary capillary blood pressure, which contributes to stress failure
   of pulmonary capillaries resulting in exercise induced pulmonary
   haemorrhage (EIPH). One strategy to prevent EIPH is, therefore, to lower
   the pulmonary capillary blood pressure of exercising horses. Recent work
   in several species suggests that nitric oxide plays a significant role
   in maintaining low vascular resistance in the pulmonary circulation;
   however, the effects of nitrovasodilators (which work via the same
   mechanism as nitric oxide) on equine pulmonary circulation have not been
   examined, The present study examined the effects of glyceryl trinitrate
   (nitroglycerin) on right atrial and pulmonary vascular pressures in 7
   healthy sound Thoroughbred horses, Freshly prepared nitroglycerin
   solution was infused for 240 s into the right atrium of quietly standing
   Thoroughbreds at dose rates of 350, 700, 1400 and 2100 g/min in a
   randomised manner, Ah infusions were performed in duplicate, Heart rate,
   right atrial, pulmonary artery, pulmonary capillary and pulmonary artery
   wedge pressures were determined preinfusion, at 30 s intervals during
   nitroglycerin infusions and at 60 s post infusion, Measurements were
   made using catheter mounted manometers whose in vivo signals had been
   matched with fluid-filled systems referenced at the level of the point
   of the shoulder, It was observed that nitroglycerin infusions caused a
   dose related increase in heart rate while dose related reductions
   occurred in the mean right atrial, pulmonary artery, pulmonary artery
   wedge and pulmonary capillary pressures, At 2100 mu g/min, nitroglycerin
   induced reduction in pulmonary artery wedge pressure was significantly
   greater than that in the pulmonary artery pressure, It is concluded that
   (i) pulmonary vascular bed of quietly standing horses has a certain
   basal vasomotor tone which was unmasked by nitroglycerin infusions (ii)
   nitroglycerin may have a more potent dilator effect on equine pulmonary
   veins than on the arteries.}},

Abstract = {{Different strategies for the prevention and control of tuberculosis in
   facilities providing long-term care (LTCF) to the elderly were proposed
   by the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) and the Quebec Ministry of
   Health and Social Services (MHSS). Controversies regarding the screening
   and chemoprophylaxis of tuberculosis in the elderly were reviewed, the
   epidemiology of tuberculosis in the United States and Quebec was
   compared and the number of cases expected annually was estimated from
   estimates available in the literature. Method: Fifty-five scientific
   articles and official documents identified in the Medline database were
   analyzed. Results: U.S. epidemiologic data support screening and
   chemoprophylaxis but in Quebec, the absence of reported increase risk in
   LTCF explains the reservations of the MHSS. According to our estimates,
   expected cases of tuberculosis might be underestimated. Conclusion: In
   Quebec, the best strategy to control tuberculosis is not yet obvious. A
   precise estimation of the number of undiagnosed cases in this
   environment would help clarify the dilemma.}},

Abstract = {{Mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain (beta MyHC) induce hypertrophic
   cardiomyopathy (HCM), cardiac hypertrophy, and sarcomere disarray, with
   the latter being the characteristic hallmark. Thus, we sought to
   determine whether expression of mutant beta MyHC in adult feline cardiac
   myocytes, a species known to develop HCM with a phenotype identical to
   that in humans, induces sarcomere disarray. A full-length beta MyHC cDNA
   was cloned from a human heart cDNA library, and an HCM-causing mutation
   (Arg(403)Gln) was induced in the beta MyHC cDNA by site-directed
   mutagenesis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The normal and mutant
   beta MyHC cDNAs were cloned into p Delta E1spIB shuttle vector,
   downstream from a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Replication-deficient
   recombinant adenoviral constructs (Ad5/CMV/beta MyHC-N and Ad5/CMV/beta
   MyHC-403) were generated through homologous recombination of p Delta
   E1spIB/CMV/beta MyHC-N or Ad5/CMV/beta MyHC-403 and pBHG10 after
   cotransfection in 293 host cells. Infection of COS-1 cells with the beta
   MyHC construct resulted in the expression of a full-length myosin
   protein. Efficiency of infection of isolated adult cardiac myocytes was
   >95\%. Expression of the beta MyHC constructs into mRNA at 48 hours
   after infection of feline cardiac myocytes was confirmed by reverse
   transcription-PCR. The net total protein and beta-myosin synthesis were
   determined by using the amount of incorporation of {[}H-3]phenylalanine
   into total protein and beta-myosin, respectively. Although the total
   amount of protein synthesis was equal among experimental groups, the net
   myosin synthesis at 48 hours was greater in cardiac myocytes infected
   with normal or mutant beta MyHC constructs than control myocytes or
   those infected with vector alone (P<.05). Electron microscopic
   examination showed only minor changes in the structure of sarcomeres in
   all experimental groups at 48 hours after infection. However, disruption
   of the sarcomeric structures at 120 hours after infection with the
   mutant beta MyHC construct was observed in approximate to 50\% of the
   myocytes examined, whereas the structure of the sarcomeres remained
   largely intact in myocytes infected with normal beta MyHC construct,
   adenoviral vector alone, or control cardiocytes. Similar results were
   confirmed by immunofluorescence using MF-20 antibody to myosin. The
   results of this study indicate that disruption of sarcomere assembly and
   myofibrillar organization due to mutant beta MyHC protein is the primary
   defect in HCM.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, we proposed a new high frequency transformer that could allow
   the manufacture of small power supplies. In this paper, we propose a
   thin film transformer for small electronic devices, and apply the
   integral equation method to analyze this transformer. Both the primary
   and secondary coils of the film transformer are arranged coaxially on
   one layer and multiply laminated. The operation principal of the
   transformer is based on the skin effect and the mutual effect between
   the coils at high frequency. Because of the coaxially arranged coils,
   the magnetic field of the transformer can be modeled with an
   axisymmetric assumption, Using the model, we evaluate the
   electromagnetic field and calculate the lumped circuit parameters, i.e.,
   inductance and resistance, which are compared with experimental values.
   A fairly good agreement is obtained, Thus, the applied method is quite
   useful for design and investigation of the thin film transformer.}},

Abstract = {{In order to identify antigens from Eimeria acervulina eliciting
   cell-mediated as well as humoral immune responses, merozoite and
   sporozoite fractions were separated by electrophoresis and injected into
   chickens. Coccidia-specific antibody titers, lymphocyte proliferation,
   and interferon production were measured to determine whether the
   inoculations sensitized the chickens to merozoites and sporozoites.
   Several fractions from merozoites and sporozoites induced humoral or
   cell-mediated responses. Merozoite fraction 4 (molecular weight {[}MW]
   12,700-18,400) had the most consistent high interferon production; it
   also had good antibody production after challenge but not before
   challenge. Merozoite fraction 3 (MW 18,400-29,000) elicited high
   antibody titers and modest proliferation. Merozoite fraction 2 (MW
   29,000-43,000) elicited consistently high proliferation; however,
   antibody responses were normal and interferon production was lower than
   that in the control. Merozoite fraction 5 (MW 6000-12,700) results were
   modest for all three parameters. Sporozoite fractions 5 and 6 (MW
   12,700-29,000) elicited good antibody titers after challenge. The only
   sporozoite fraction that showed any interferon induction, fraction 2 (MW
   69,000-200,000), also elicited good proliferation, although it did not
   stimulate antibody production. Sporozoite fraction 1 (>200,000 MW) had
   very high proliferation potential. These findings support the hypothesis
   that different antigens preferentially elicited different T-cell
   responses.}},

Abstract = {{A questionnaire was mailed to the 404 small manufacturing firms in
   middle Tennessee. This article is based on the 123 questionnaires that
   were returned. The survey was developed to test a conceptual framework
   which describes the technology transfer process from public agencies to
   small manufacturers. The paper suggests that selecting technology is
   part of the strategic planning process. External variables such as
   competition and internal variables such as production problems are
   correlated with awareness of, prior use of, and plans for use of the
   transfer agents. The article concludes that although there is little
   awareness of these agencies by small businesses, the prior use of these
   agencies will lead to the future use of them. In addition, sales growth
   and response to foreign competition are significantly correlated with
   awareness of, prior use of, and plans for using the agencies. The speed
   of change in technological development and level of technical
   sophistication both in the industry and the firm were correlated with
   the awareness of, prior use of, and plans for using the agencies.
   Suggestions for improving the network between small businesses and these

Abstract = {{A new approach to evaluate protein structure (3D)-sequence (1D)
   compatibility has been developed. This approach uses four functions:
   side-chain packing, solvation, hydrogen-bonding, and local structure
   functions. The side-chain packing function takes into account not only
   inter-residue distance but also inter-residue contact and angle.
   Parameters defining the functions were statistically derived from 101
   proteins with known 3D structures. The functions are combined to give a
   score quantifying the 3D-1D compatibility, The ability to identify the
   native structure of a protein among a large number of incorrect
   structures was tested. For 69 out of the 70 proteins examined, the
   native structures were successfully identified. Particularly, the
   side-chain packing function showed clear improvement over our previous
   function. The only unsuccessful case was observed for cytochrome c(3)
   containing four haems; such prosthetic groups were ignored in the
   calculation. In addition to the above functions, two procedures for
   removing membrane-spanning regions and estimating electrostatic
   interactions were also adopted. A sequence for which membrane-spanning
   regions were predicted was considered incompatible with a structure
   irrespective of the compatibility score, A method to calculate the
   electrostatic interaction energy was developed and used for the
   detection of electrostatistically undesirable interactions between
   residues of a sequence threaded onto a structure. These procedures
   greatly help to remove false positives in the 3D-1D compatibility

Abstract = {{The accumulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) after the exposure of
   cells or organisms to-elevated temperatures is well established. It is
   also known that a variety of other environmental and cellular metabolic
   stressors can induce HSP synthesis. However, few studies have
   investigated the effect of cold temperature on HSP expression. Here we
   report that exposure of Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice to cold
   ambient temperatures results in a tissue-selective induction of HSPs in
   brown adipose tissue (BAT) coincident with the induction of
   mitochondrial uncoupling protein synthesis. Cold-induced HSP expression
   is associated with enhanced binding of heat shock transcription factors
   to DNA, similar to that which occurs after exposure of cells or tissues
   to heat-and other metabolic stresses. Adrenergic receptor antagonists
   were found to block cold-induced HSP70 expression in BAT, whereas
   adrenergic agonists induced BAT HSP expression in the absence of cold
   exposure. These findings suggest that norepinephrine, released in
   response to cold exposure, induces HSP expression in BAT. Norepinephrine
   appears to initiate transcription of HSP genes after binding to BAT
   adrenergic receptors through, as yet, undetermined signal transduction
   pathways. Thermogenesis results from an increase in activity and
   synthesis of several metabolic enzymes in BAT of animals exposed to cold
   challenge. The concomitant increase in HSPs may function to facilitate
   the translocation and activity of the enzymes involved in this process.}},

Abstract = {{A Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell-elongating toxin produced by

   The purified toxin had an isolelectric point (pi) of 3.7 and a molecular
   weight of 70 000 in a single band on isoelectric focusing (IEF) gels and
   SDS-PAGE gels, respectively. The N-terminal sequence, amino acids 1-20,
   and the amino acid content were determined from Western blots of the 70
   kDa band. No homology with any known microbial toxin was found. CHO cell
   activity was not neutralized by antiserum to cholera toxin (anti-CT),
   and the toxin did not react with anti-CT on Western blots. The toxin did
   not increase cyclic AMP, cyclic GMP, or prostaglandin E(2) levels in CHO
   cells. No cytotoxic activity was observed. Intragastric administration
   of purified toxin (5x10(4) and 5x10(8) CHO cell units) induced
   intestinal fluid accumulation in infant mice. These results suggest that
   this toxin may be a novel cytotonic toxin distinct from previously

   Approximately 20\% of the atoms in ta-C are sp(2) hybridized and the

   optical properties of the material. In the present investigation, we use
   50 keV C+ and 200 keV Xe+ ion implantation to damage the structure in a
   controlled manner. The structure of the ta-C following ion irradiation
   is monitored using the dose dependence of the electrical conductivity,
   Raman spectroscopy, electron diffraction, and electron energy-loss
   spectroscopy. It is shown that the damage is predominantly reflected in
   an increased concentration of sp(2)-bonded sites. With increasing dose,
   the structure is observed to change from an essentially tetrahedral
   network containing sp(2) sites as `'defects'' to an essentially
   sp(2)-bonded structure in which there is a high degree of in-plane

Abstract = {{In the first of three experiments, eight ovariectomised Greyface ewes
   primed with exogenous progesterone were used to provide quantitative
   data on the effects of two contrasting feeding levels (0.3 vs. 1.4 X
   maintenance) on plasma progesterone concentrations. Over the 9 day study
   period, mean ( +/- SEM) daily progesterone concentrations were 4.3 +/-
   0.13 and 3.3 +/- 0.17 mu g 1(-1) for the low and high feeding regimens,
   respectively (P = 0.06), indicating that high feed intake suppressed
   circulating progesterone levels. The second experiment examined the
   effect in superovulated Finn-Dorset ewes of a diet supplying either 0.6
   (Group L, n = 8) or 2.3 (Group H, n = 8) times their daily energy needs
   for maintenance, from 1 day before introduction of exogenous
   progesterone to the time of insemination, on plasma progesterone
   concentrations and the viability of ova recovered 4 days after
   insemination. Mean ( +/- SEM) plasma progesterone concentrations were
   4.5 +/- 0.17 mu g 1(-1) and 2.8 +/- 0.16 mu g 1(-1) for L and H ewes,
   respectively, during the 12 day priming period (P < 0.001). Eight hours
   after progesterone withdrawal, levels had fallen to 0.9 +/- 0.06 mu g
   1(-1) and 0.8 +/- 0.07 mu g 1(-1), respectively, then rose to 17.8 +/-
   3.01 mu g 1(-1) and 12.9 +/- 2.50 mu g 1(-1) (P > 0.10) at ovum
   collection. Intervals (mean +/- SEM) to oestrous onset (14.5 +/- 0.38 h)
   and the luteinising hormone (LH) surge (27.1 +/- 0.98 h) were unaffected
   by feed intake. Mean (+/- SEM) ovulation rates (8.1 +/- 1.57 vs. 7.8 +/-
   1.10) and numbers of ova recovered (5.0 +/- 1.39 vs. 4.8 +/- 1.11) were
   also similar for each group. However, the proportions of ova considered
   viable (over 32 cells) at recovery were 0.53 and 0.22 for L and H
   groups, respectively (P < 0.005). Following 72 h culture (Tissue Culture
   Medium-199 (M199) + 10\% foetal calf serum (FCS)), 0.55 and 0.27,
   respectively, had developed to blastocysts (P < 0.025). Of ova assessed
   as viable at recovery, similar proportions (0.86 vs. 0.75) from L and H
   treatments developed to blastocysts, with corresponding nuclei counts
   (mean +/- SEM) of 55 +/- 5.2 and 55 +/- 13.2. The third experiment used
   12 superovulated Greyface ewes, each offered a different feed level
   within the range 0.6-2.5 X maintenance, to determine the nature of the
   relationship between feeding level, pre-ovulatory progesterone
   concentrations and ovum development at Day 2 following insemination and
   subsequently during 7 day co-culture (M199 + FCS). Increases in feeding
   level were accompanied by linear decreases in plasma progesterone (r(2)
   = 0.79, P < 0.001), the interval to oestrous onset (r(2) = 0.52, P <
   0.01) and timing of the LH surge (r(2) = 0.32, P < 0.06). Although
   undetectable at ovum collection, and somewhat equivocal after 4 day
   culture, high feeding levels prior to ovulation reduced the proportion
   of ova (0.16 vs. 0.58) developing to or beyond the expanding blastocyst
   stage after 7 day culture. Quantitative indices of cell division and
   protein synthesis confirmed this. In conclusion, excessive feeding
   during follicular recruitment and oocyte maturation in superovulated
   ewes imparts a legacy of embryonic loss and developmental retardation.}},

Abstract = {{Aims-This study was carried out to compare the effects of continuous
   wave infrared laser radiation on pigmented and albino rabbit retinas at
   two wavelengths: 810 nm (diode) and 1064 nm (Nd:YAG).
   Methods-Transpupillary laser pulses were applied with a spot size of 200
   mu m and durations of 200 ms (pigmented rabbits) and 0.5-1 s (albino
   rabbits). Light and electron microscopic analyses were performed
   immediately after exposure.
   Results-In pigmented rabbits, threshold lesions were induced using a
   power of 100 mW with the diode and 200 mW with the Nd:YAG lasers. Damage
   was incurred by the retinal pigment epithelium with extension into the
   superficial and mid choroid posteriorly and into the outer retina
   anteriorly. In albino rabbits, lesions of comparable anteroposterior
   extension were identified using a power of 10 W with the Nd:YAG laser.
   Using diode laser irradiation, a maximum power output of 1.2 W failed to
   produce discernible lesions.
   Conclusions-The observed patterns of morphological damage are produced
   by complex tissue radiation interactions. In pigmented animals, this was
   primarily related to absorption of radiant energy by melanin within the
   retinal pigment epithelium and the choroidal melanocytes. In albino
   rabbits, laser induced effects occurred as a consequence of multiple
   scattering, together with absorption within haemoglobin and possibly
   also within tissue water. The data obtained provide further insight into
   the biological mechanisms arising from retinal photocoagulation with
   near infrared lasers.}},

Abstract = {{The North Fork of Long Island is a peninsula whose freshwater supply
   consists of several lenses of fresh ground water that are surrounded by

   surface-geophysical techniques at several sites to provide
   ground-conductivity data that were, in turn, used to estimate the depth
   to the freshwater-saltwater interface. Surveys were made during the
   spring and fall of 1989. Wells drilled during 1989 provided some
   verification of geophysical interpretations.
   Geophysical-data interpretations were based on conceptual models with
   two, three, and four conductivity layers; the three-layer concept
   produced interpretations that best matched geophysical measurements at
   all sites. The surface geophysical techniques were successful in
   interpreting depth to saline ground water. Interpreted depths to the
   freshwater-saltwater interface were compared to assess seasonal changes;
   the interpreted differences were small and within the range of error of
   the survey techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Serrations develop in the grain boundaries (GB) of many metals and
   alloys as a result of local migrations to absorb dislocation walls. The
   serrations form only under deformation conditions where the subgrains
   reach about 2-10 mu m in diameter; the conditions of temperature and
   strain rate depend on the metal and the effects of alloying on dynamic
   recovery. The small serrations evidently diminish GB sliding, making
   lattice deformation rate controlling. If the conditions are changed to
   produce lower strain rates, then initial serrations increase the creep
   life. In alloys with limited dynamic recovery, the serrations are also
   related to initiation of dynamic recrystallization, which is very
   important in preventing progression of GB cracking, and thus increasing
   the ductility in hot-forming operations. The formation of serrations or
   of a necklace of fine recrystallized grains along the GB of large grains
   (with good creep resistance) are noted for improving fatigue resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Six patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapsing after

   interferon-alpha 2b to stimulate graft-versus-leukemia reactions.
   Additionally, donor mononuclear cells were infused with or without
   interleukin-2 as first-line treatment or upon failure of
   interferon-alpha 2b in 5 patients. Two patients developed clinical acute
   graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after a combination of donor leukocytes
   and interferon-alpha, and one developed de novo chronic GVHD after
   interleukin-2 and interferon-alpha. Complete remission was attained in 4
   patients whereas 2 patients showed no response. Two of the responding
   patients relapsed rapidly. Four patients died of a combination of
   complications of immunotherapy and progressive disease. Two patients are
   alive in remission with chronic GVHD (Karnofsky performance scores of
   80\%) 8 and 18 months after immunotherapy, We conclude that
   cytokine-mediated immunotherapy with or without donor cell infusions may
   be effective in some cases of AML relapsing after allogeneic BMT, and
   may result in long-term survival. With limited data, it appears that
   development of chronic GVHD after immunotherapy is essential for

   Ongoing protein synthesis does not seem to be required for the initial
   induction of IL-8 gene expression. However, the rate of transient
   induction kinetics was modulated by cycloheximide (CHX) indicating that
   secondary response genes are involved in the regulation of IL-8 RNA
   levels. Repression of the induced IL-8 mRNA by 21 h PMA-treatment was
   due to reduced transcriptional activity of the gene. In HL60 cells
   stimulated for 1.5 and 21 h the half-lives of the IL-8 transcripts were
   markedly increased, suggesting the presence of negatively-acting

   immunohistochemistry to be densely innervated by calcitonin gene related
   peptide (CGRP) immunoreactive nerve fibers spreading around the medial
   meningeal artery and its branches. Electrical stimulation of the dural
   surface (10-20 V, 5-10 Hz, 10-30 min) caused a depletion of
   CGRP-immunopositive fibers, suggesting a release of CGRP. The dural
   blood flow around branches of the medial meningeal artery was also
   monitored with a laser Doppler flowmeter. Short periods (30 s) of
   electrical stimulation with parameters that presumably released CORP
   from nerve fibers caused a repeatable and constant increase of the blood
   flow for 1-2 min. This evoked increase could dose dependently be
   inhibited by topical application of the CGRP antagonist hCGRP(8-37).
   Accordingly, administration of hCGRP increased the basal blood flow. We
   conclude that stimulation of trigeminal afferents innervating the dura
   mater releases CGRP from peptidergic afferent terminals, thereby causing
   vasodilatation and increasing the meningeal blood flow, an important
   element of neurogenic inflammation.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the slow signal of apparent O-2 release under brief
   light flashes by using mutants of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 which
   lacked CP43 and D1. The slow signal was present at higher amplitudes in
   the mutants. It was inhibited by starving the mutants of glucose
   (>90\%), by 10 mM NaN3 (85\%) and by boiling samples for 2 min (100\%).
   In the mutants and in the wild-type, the slow signal was 95\% inhibited
   by the combination of DBMIB
   (2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone) and HQNO
   (2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide). In the wild type, the addition
   of DCMU (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea) or CCCP
   (carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone) completely inhibited
   photosynthetic O-2 evolution, yet failed to inhibit the slow signal. We
   explain the kinetics of the wild-type signal as a positive deflection
   due to the inhibition of respiration by PS I activity, and a negative
   deflection due to the stimulation of respiration by electrons
   originating from PS II. We found no evidence of a `meta-stable S-3' in
   Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 that could contribute to the slow signal of
   apparent O-2 release. We present a calculation which involves only
   averaging, division and subtraction, that can remove the contribution of
   the slow signal from the true photosynthetic O-2 Signal and provide up
   to a 10-fold improved accuracy of the S-state models.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the effect of intramuscular injections of recombinant bovine

   Latin square design to receive 0, 1, or 5 mg of recombinant bovine
   interferon-tau intramuscularly on d 9, 12, or 15 of the estrous cycle.
   Rectal temperatures were measured, and blood was collected just prior to
   injection, at hourly intervals for 8 h, and at 10 and 12 h after
   injection. Treatment with 1 and 5 mg of recombinant bovine
   interferon-tau caused a rise in body temperature that peaked at 6 h
   (39.5 +/- .13 degrees C) and 4 h (40.3 +/- .13 degrees C), respectively.
   Analysis of homogeneity of regression for response curves indicated that
   5 mg of recombinant bovine interferon-tau decreased plasma progesterone
   concentrations. This effect was not detected for the 1-mg dose of
   recombinant bovine interferon-tau. Intramuscular administration of 5 mg
   of recombinant bovine interferon-tau caused a hyperthermic response that
   was temporally associated with the decrease in plasma progesterone.
   Intramuscular administration of 1 mg of recombinant bovine
   interferon-tau caused a slight rise in temperature occurring 4 h later
   than that caused by 5 mg of recombinant bovine interferon-tau, and no
   decrease in plasma progesterone was detected. Recombinant bovine
   interferon-tau, administered at a 1-mg dose, warrants further study to
   determine whether it will alter survival rate of cattle embryos.}},

Abstract = {{The addition of an imaging filter to a cold field-emission TEM has led
   to the development of new techniques based on the analysis of the
   zero-loss or a specific energy-loss signal. For example, the removal of
   inelastically scattered electrons can improve the fringe contrast in
   coherent CBED patterns from relatively thick crystals. Similarly, this
   energy-filtering is essential for the accurate measurement of low-order
   structure factors by CBED pattern matching. Studies of convergent-beam
   patterns recorded at specific core-loss energies show that they contain
   chemically sensitive features. In addition, hybrid modes of operation
   have been developed that allow spectrum-images and spectrum-diffraction
   patterns to be obtained. New results are presented that show the use of
   these techniques. Finally, it is argued that energy-filtering should
   lead to improvements in critical-voltage measurements, lattice-parameter
   determination and in the resolution of branch cluster information.}},

Abstract = {{The disorders of social context as a rule have consequences for the
   family, especially for those families that are heterogeneous on all
   bases. National, religious, racial and other features (regional, party
   membership etc.) in mixed and intermixed marriages have been selected
   for this research as significant indicators through which these
   disorders are manifested with lesser or greater consequences. Disorders
   of social context can appear as a result of many different reasons, one
   of them being war, the threat of war, direct or indirect war danger or
   war situations of different intensity. The author examines the explicit
   and implicit consequences of these states caused by the disorders of
   social context, for indicators of such disorders the author selected
   mixed marriages which used to form, by the end of the eighties, over a
   quarter of all marriages contracted in Croatia per year.
   Methodologically, mixed marriages as indicators of disorders in social
   context are an extraordinary research innovation, since marriages in
   general, and especially mixed marriages can be considered as indicators
   with both positive and negative tendencies (marriage and divorce). The
   conclusions drawn by the author as the result of analysis of numerous
   data and tables are convincing and much more complex than the author
   choses to comment upon. He stresses that the display of numerous data
   had priority over extensive commentary and minute presentation of
   possible meaning of specific data, because in interpreting the factors
   of disorder of social context one might make an error which could have
   grave consequences on such disorders. The results of research indicate
   beyond doubt that multicultural, multiconfessional, multinational
   societies have perceptible indicators in social context. Croatia as a
   multicultural and multinational state in these but in many other
   indicators as well must recognize numerous elements for defining its
   population policy and developmental measures that could sustain
   demographic development. Unfortunately, the author concludes, Croatian
   science is insufficient in research which could clarify numerous
   unknowns of the family in multicultural social complexes, and especially
   of the contemporary Croatian family within the context of the country's
   new reality.}},

Abstract = {{The penetration of fluconazole into female genital tissue was examined
   in this study in which fluconazole was administered intravenously for 60
   minutes at a dose of 200mg to patients undergoing total abdominal
   hysterectomy, at 1 to 51 hours prior to surgery. During surgery, the
   blood, uterus, ovary and oviduct were sampled, and the fluconazole
   concentrations in each tissue were determined by high-performance liquid
   chromatography. The peak serum concentrations reached approximately 6.1
   mg/L 1 hour after beginning the drip infusion. At each time after the
   infusion, the concentrations in the portio vaginalis, cervix uteri,
   myometrium, endometrium, ovary and oviduct were higher than those in the
   serum: the peak concentrations in tissue ranged from 6.4 to 9.5 mu g/g
   about 1 hour after beginning the drip infusion. Thus, the penetration of
   fluconazole into gynaecological tissue appeared to be similar to or
   slightly higher than those in serum samples. Fluconazole can rapidly
   penetrate from plasma into the female genital organs, supporting the
   high efficacy of fluconazole against gynaecological fungal infections.}},

Abstract = {{The outer membrane of various Escherichia coli strains overproducing
   periplasmic alkaline phosphatase was found to be permeable not only to
   the enzyme, but also to ethidium ions, which normally do not penetrate
   into gram-negative bacteria. In the absence of the outer membrane
   lipoprotein, the permeability of the membrane to these compounds and its
   sensitivity to membranotropic agents increase, indicating a role of the
   lipoprotein in the barrier properties of the outer membrane. A negative
   correlation was revealed between the contents of lipoprotein and
   lipopolysaccharide in the outer membrane and between their content and
   alkaline phosphatase secretion into the medium. It is suggested that the
   increased permeability of the Escherichia coli outer membrane during
   overproduction of the secreted protein is due to impaired biogenesis of
   membrane components.}},

Abstract = {{T47D human breast carcinoma cells and the chicken oviduct were used to
   study the structure of the nonactivated progesterone receptor (PR)
   complex. Immunoprecipitation of PR (B form) from cytosol extracts was
   performed using monoclonal antibody PR6, a cross-reactive antibody
   prepared to chicken PR. Analysis of the PR complex by sodium dodecyl
   sulfate gels and Western immunoblotting revealed the presence of several
   specific copurifying proteins. Consistent with previous reports, the two
   heat shock proteins, hsp90 and hsp70, were shown to be present. A third
   59-kilo-dalton (kDa) protein observed previously was confirmed to be p59
   (also called hsp56 or FKBP52), which has been shown to bind the
   immunosuppressant drug FK506. Two additional PR-associated proteins were
   observed that had not been previously recognized with human PR. These
   have molecular masses of 54-kDa and 23-kDa and have been shown by
   Western blotting to be related to the proteins p54 and p23 that are
   associated with chicken PR. P23 is a novel protein of unknown function
   and p54 or FKBP54 has been recently shown to be another FK506-binding
   protein related to p59. Finally, the cyclosporin A-binding protein,
   CyP-40, could be detected in isolated chicken PR complexes and in PR
   complexes that were reconstituted in vitro, but this protein was not
   detected in human PR complexes, which are less stable than chicken PR
   complexes in cytosol extracts. The functional significance of FK506 and
   cyclosporin A-binding proteins to hormone action was tested using a T47D
   cell line that contained a progestin reporter gene, MMTV-CAT. Treatment
   with cyclosporin A had no effect on the basal level of CAT expression,
   but it caused a dramatic increase in the sensitivity and magnitude of
   the response to the synthetic progestin, R5020. The enhanced response
   elicited by drug treatment was blocked by the antiprogestin RU486
   indicating that this effect was receptor-mediated, While cyclosporin A
   enhanced progestin action in T47D cells, it inhibited a PR/reporter gene
   system in L cells. The drugs FK506 and rapamycin had no effect on
   progestin action in T47D cells, but they stimulated glucocorticoid
   action in T47D cells. Thus, the effects of these immunosuppressant drugs
   vary with the cell type and hormonal system that is tested. Whether
   these drug effects relate directly to the immunophilins bound in
   receptor complexes remains unknown.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to evaluate if a retreatment with natural
   human interferon alpha could lead to a recovery of the therapeutic
   responsiveness in nonresponder patients with chronic hepatitis C who did
   (9 cases) or did not (14 cases) develop anti-interferon neutralizing
   antibodies while on treatment with recombinant interferon alpha2a.
   During retreatment, no patient developed detectable levels of
   neutralizing antibodies to natural interferon. At the end of
   retreatment, 6/9 positive patients showed a complete response to natural
   interferon Therapy, while only 1/14 negative patients had a partial
   response. These data suggest that a second course of treatment with the
   natural preparation may be useful in patients who failed to respond to
   an earlier course of recombinant interferon, particularly the
   anti-interferon positive patients who showed hepatitis reactivation
   after an initial response concomitantly with antibody appearance.
   Conversely, a second course of natural interferon therapy might be
   useless in cases in which the lack of response is not associated to
   antibody development.}},

Abstract = {{Fetal alcohol syndrome produces defects that parallel abnormalities
   associated with early iron deficiency. Hence, we examined the effects of
   prenatal exposure to ethanol on iron, transferrin, and ferritin
   concentrations. The subjects were the offspring of pregnant rats fed an
   ethanol-containing diet (Et), pair-fed an isocaloric control diet (Ct),
   or fed chow and water. The amounts of iron, transferrin, and ferritin
   were assessed in three CNS regions (cerebral cortex, subcortical
   forebrain, and brainstem). in all three segments of the control rats,
   iron, transferrin, and ferritin levels decreased during the first 2
   postnatal weeks, reached a minimum during week 3, and then rose to adult
   levels. This pattern was delayed by ethanol treatment, e.g., the minimal
   concentrations in iron, transferrin, and ferritin in the Et-treated rats
   were achieved later (3 days, 7 days, and 2 weeks, respectively) than
   they were in the Ct-treated rats. Ethanol-induced alterations in iron
   homeostasis persisted into adulthood; iron concentration was reduced,
   transferrin concentration was unaffected, and ferritin concentration was
   increased. The net result was that the timely delivery and
   bioavailability of iron were compromised by ethanol exposure. The
   defects in iron regulation are permanent and may underlie
   ethanol-induced abnormalities in iron-dependent growth processes such as
   myelination.}},

   Design: Prospective randomised non-blinded control trial.
   Setting Regional vascular surgery unit.
   Materials: Seventeen patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were
   ramdomised either to receive fibrin sealant as a topical haemostatic
   agent at the arteriotomy suture line or to act as control.
   Outcome measures: Time taken to achieve haemostasis at the suture line.
   Intraoperative blood loss. Total operative time.
   Results: The median time to achieve haemostasis was 5.5 min (range 4-31
   min) in the treatment group and 19 min (range 10-47 min) in the control
   group. This difference was statistically significant p < 0.005 by
   Mann-Whitney test. There was no statistical difference in total
   operative rime. Operative blood loss was lower in the treatment group
   (median 420ml, range 300-500ml) than in the control group (median 550ml,
   range 350-1200ml) but this difference was not statistically significant.

Abstract = {{Tonoplast vesicles were isolated from tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum
   Mill.) fruit pericarp and purified on a discontinuous sucrose gradient.
   ATPase activity was inhibited by nitrate and bafilomycin A(1), but was
   insensitive to vanadate and azide. PPase hydrolytic activity was
   inhibited by NaF brit was insensitive to nitrate, bafilomycin A(t),
   vanadate and azide. Kinetic studies of PPase activity gave an apparent
   K-m for PPi of 18 mu M. Identical distributions of bafilomycin- and
   NO3--sensitive ATPase activities within continuous sucrose density
   gradients, confirmed that bafilomycin-sensitive ATPase activity is a
   suitable marker for the tonoplast. By comparing the distribution of
   bafilomycin-sensitive ATPase activity with that of PPase activity, it
   was possible to locate the PPase enzyme exclusively at the tonoplast.
   The apparent density of the tonoplast did not change during fruit
   development. Measurements of tonoplast PPase and ATPase activities
   during fruit development over a 35-day period revealed an 80\% reduction
   in PPase specific activity and a small decrease in ATPase specific
   activity. ATP- and PPi-dependent Delta pH generation was measured by the
   quenching of quinacrine fluorescence in tonoplast vesicles prepared on a
   discontinuous Dextran gradient. No H+ efflux was detected on the
   addition of sucrose to energized vesicles. Therefore a H+/sucrose
   antiport may not be the mechanism of sucrose uptake at the tomato fruit
   tonoplast. Similar results were obtained with glucose, fructose and
   sorbitol. The lack of ATP (or PPi) stimulation of {[}C-14]-sucrose
   uptake also suggested that an antiport was not involved. Initial uptake
   rates of radiolabelled glucose and fructose were almost double that for
   sucrose. The inhibition of hexose uptake by p-chloromercuribenzene
   sulphonate (PCMBS) implicated the involvement of a carrier. Therefore
   storage of hexose in the tomato fruit vacuole and maintenance of a
   downhill sucrose concentration gradient into sink cells is likely to be
   regulated by the activity of sucrose metabolizing enzymes, rather than
   by energy-requiring uptake mechanisms at the tonoplast.}},

Abstract = {{Model calculations of circumsolar dust are conducted taking into account
   the increased ion drag due to the interaction of F-coronal dust with
   CMEs inside 8R(s). The choice of 8R(s) is not arbitrary, after
   considering the severe plasma environment inside this region. Dust
   particles are allowed to spiral inward towards the Sun via the
   Poynting-Robertson drag, and the characteristics of the CMEs are applied
   in order to numerically compute the increased ion drag on F-coronal
   dust. The results show that the spiraling time would roughly be cut in
   half for dust particles inside 8R(s). Differences in the spiraling time
   due to the dependence of the magnitude of increased ion drag on dust
   particle size, creates separation on the heliocentric distance of the
   orbits of small (> 10 mu m) vs. larger particles. This result could
   create conditions where a dust ring or rings may appear as a transient
   feature, which would explain former citing of such dust rings by
   observers and their absence by others.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the role of an energy-dense diet liquefied with amylase of
   germinated wheat flour (ARF) in increasing the energy intake in children
   with acute diarrhoea and its effect on the course of diarrhoea, 95
   children aged 6-23 months were randomized to receive either an ARF
   treated liquid porridge (test diet) or an unaltered thick porridge
   (control-1) or a porridge diluted with extra water (control-2). The
   children were rehydrated with rice-based oral rehydration solution (ORS)
   and intravenous acetate solution (if needed) and the study diets were
   offered 4 times a day for four days. In addition, they received a milk
   cereal mixture and breast feeding ad libitum. Intake was calculated by
   subtracting the left-over from the amount offered. Intake (ORS, IV, and
   food) and output (stool, urine, and vomiting) were summarized 8 hourly.
   The mean +/- SD total energy intake (kJ/kg.d) from porridge in the test,
   control-1 and control-2 groups were 414 +/- 97, 355 +/- 120, and 351 +/-
   73 respectively (difference between mean, 95\% CI: test vs control-1 =
   59, 5-114 and test vs control-2 = 63, 20-106). Breastmilk intake was
   similar in the three groups. There was no difference in stool output,
   ORS intake, and duration of diarrhoea among the three groups. However,
   vomiting was more marked in the test and control-2 group who had
   increased volume intake of liquid meals compared to control-1 group. The
   results suggest that energy intake can be increased in children during
   acute diarrhoea using liquefied high energy porridge and its use did not
   worsen the diarrhoea.}},

   the T cells infiltrating to LG, which is the other major target organ of
   SS. Total RNA was extracted from fresh LG and SG biopsy samples, and
   peripheral blood mononuclear cells from five SS patients, and converted
   to cDNA. TCR V beta gene repertoire was then assessed with quantitative
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Oligoclonality was studied by
   sequencing V-D-J junctional regions of the PCR products. The TCR V beta
   gene usage in LG was diverse in every patient irrespective of disease
   duration, and similar to that of peripheral lymphocytes from a
   corresponding patient. The junctional region sequences of over-expressed
   V beta families in LG T cells were heterogeneous. We did not find any
   identical clones shared by LG, SG and peripheral blood. These results
   showed that the infiltrating T cells in LG of SS patients are
   polyclonal, and LG and SG do not share the same dominant T cell
   clonotypes. These suggest that TCR-targeted disease manipulation may
   have a limited effect on SS.}},

Abstract = {{To characterize the clinical profile and the prognostic factors of the
   epilepsy due to parenchymal neurocysticercosis (NCC) 143 patients were
   analysed. Patients (62 men, 81 women) had a mean age at epilepsy onset
   of 29 years (range 2-71), mean epilepsy duration of 16 years (range
   1-58) and mean follow-up of 5.2 years. Seizures were generalised
   tonic-clonic (GTC) in 50 patients (35\%), simple partial (SP) in 66
   (46\%) and complex partial (CP) in 27 (19\%). Epilepsy began as a single
   seizure in 73\% and as a cluster of seizures or status epilepticus in
   27\%. Seizures were controlled in 64\% of patients. Multivariate
   analysis revealed that significant prognostic factors associated with
   seizure control were type of seizures and age at epilepsy onset. Control
   is more likely in GTC and SP seizures and in patients with a higher age
   at seizures onset. Our analysis establishes that epilepsy due to NCC is
   a heterogeneous syndrome concerning age and mode of onset, seizure type,
   duration of epilepsy and pattern of evolution probably related with
   different pathogenic mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Persons with brain injuries demonstrate an inconsistency in functioning
   over time and circumstances that requires a consideration of factors in
   addition to the size and location of the acquired brain lesions. A
   multi-factor account is presented in which neuropsychological disability
   on any occasion is attributed to some combination of neuropsychological
   deficits plus one or more of four personal factors (negative thinking,
   tension-arousal, fatigue, physical symptoms) and three situational
   factors (demands for complex attention, demands for rapid processing,
   external distractions). Citing pertinent research the paper discusses
   the development of, and possible mechanisms of influence by, these seven
   factors. It then broadly prescribes clinical interventions that might
   assist clients to reduce their adverse effects. It is suggested that the
   scope of brain injury rehabilitation be extended to include training
   clients to identify and manage non-organic conditions that may combine
   with direct brain injury effects to compromise productive work,
   complicate social relationships, or render the affected person less able
   to cope with stress.}},

   affected by heat treatments. Whey proteins from goat's milk were more
   denatured than those from cow's milk on samples heated at temperatures
   higher than 75 degrees C. A good relationship was established between
   whey protein denaturation and RCT in cow's milk. Dialysis of cow's milk
   against an excess of goat's milk decrease the RCT of raw and heated

Abstract = {{Studies on brain slices and homogenates suggest that chronic lithium
   treatment affects the activity of adenylate cyclases in the brain. To
   investigate whether chronic lithium administration influences the cyclic
   AMP (cAMP) synthesis in vivo, we have used microdialysis to assess
   lithium-induced alterations in extracellular concentrations of cAMP in
   the dorsal hippocampus of freely moving rats. Local infusion of
   noradrenaline or forskolin through the microdialysis probes produced
   rapid increases in the extracellular concentrations of cAMP in the
   dorsal hippocampus. Lithium administration for 4 weeks (serum lithium
   concentration of 0.8 +/- 0.11 mmol/L) did not affect the baseline levels
   of cAMP. However, in rats fed a lithium-supplemented diet,
   noradrenaline- and forskolin-induced enhancement of cAMP levels was
   decreased in the dorsal hippocampus. The rats were videotaped 18 min
   before and 27 min after initiating the introduction of noradrenaline and
   forskolin into the dorsal hippocampus. The infusion of agonists induced
   a moderate behavioral excitation. Rats treated with lithium were less
   active compared with the control rats. Taken together, these data
   confirm that chronic lithium administration affects the cAMP signaling
   system in the brain of living animals, presumably by interfering with a
   site beyond the receptor level.}},

Abstract = {{Morphological and ultrastructural features of the salivary glands and
   proboscises of Placobdella ornata, Placobdella parasitica, and
   Desserobdella picta were studied by light and electron microscopy.
   Chemical composition of the salivary cells was investigated using a
   variety of histochemical techniques. Placobdella ornata and P.
   parasitica have compact salivary glands with discrete pairs of anterior
   and posterior glands, while the salivary cells contain one mucous and
   three proteinaceous secretions. Salivary glands of D. picta are
   diffusely arranged and contain two mucous and two proteinaceous
   secretions. A cobalt-lysine forward-filling technique revealed that
   individual salivary cells consist of a roughly spherical soma and an
   elongated ductule. The majority of the internal space in a salivary soma
   is densely packed with spherical secretory granules which displace the
   cytoplasm to the periphery of the cell. Bundles of individual ductules
   enter the base of the proboscis on opposite sides and extend anteriorly.
   The ductules, also packed with secretory granules, are surrounded by
   microtubules associated with agranular endoplasmic reticulum, and merge
   with deep invaginations of the proboscis cuticle. The secretory granules
   are released at the end of these invaginations or pores. Pores were
   found on the tip, along the body, and on the luminal wall of the
   proboscises in all three species. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of comedo carcinoma in the intraductal component is an
   important pathologic feature for predicting local recurrence after
   breast conserving treatment. Furthermore, the c-erbB-2 gene is
   frequently overexpressed in comedo carcinoma and it correlates well with
   gene amplification. This study revealed that 77.0\% of the c-erbB-2
   amplification positive tumors had intraductal lesions of the comedo
   type; while only 6.7\% of the amplification negative tumors had comedo
   carcinoma (X(2)=106.6, p<0.0001). Accordingly, when c-erbB-2
   amplification is detected in the invasive tumor, intraductal lesions
   which may co-exist in the tumor are likely to be comedo carcinoma. To
   predict the presence of comedo type intraductal carcinoma, c-erbB-2 gene
   amplification was analysed by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
   from small samples of fine-needle aspiration biopsies. Breast tumors
   from ten patients were analysed and one had a 3.4-fold amplification of
   c-erbB-2 gene. The pathological appearance of this case was pure ductal
   carcinoma in situ with comedo carcinoma. The preoperative detection of
   c-erbB-2 gene amplification by PCR will be a useful means of selecting
   patients at high risk for local recurrence after breast conserving
   treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The West Midlands Regional Children's Tumour Research Group holds
   high-quality data from 1957 on all childhood cancers in the West
   Midlands Health Authority region. Since it has been reported that
   malignant germ cell tumours are increasing in incidence in the
   north-west of England, we undertook to examine rates in this region and
   to map the distribution of cases in order to assess any geographical
   changes in incidence rates. We identified a total of 102 malignant germ
   cell tumours (MGCTs) between 1957 and 1992. The average age-standardised
   rate was 1.6 per million per year in the period 1957-74 and 3.6 per
   million per year during 1975-92, a significant increase (P=0.0004).
   Particular increases were noted in older children (10-14 years);
   P=0.0002) and in yolk sac (endodermal sinus) tumours (P=0.004). A small
   excess was also observed in Asian children when compared with other
   diagnoses. Geographical analysis showed particularly higher rates at
   health district level in the West Midlands conurbation as compared with
   the other areas in the period 1975-92. These factors suggest the
   possibility that industrial/urban or population effects may be
   implicated in the observed increase in childhood MGCT and we recommend
   these areas for further studies.}},

Abstract = {{In situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) studies were done on three
   metal hydride electrodes, LaNi5, LaNi4.8Sn0.2, La0.8Ce0.2Ni4.8Sn0.2, in
   6M KOH. Ex situ measurements were also made on dry uncycled electrodes
   and on material from an La0.8Ce0.2Ni4.8Sn0.2, electrode that had been
   cycled 25 times. Comparison of the in situ XAS at the Ni K and at the La
   L(3) edge of charged and discharged electrodes indicates large changes
   in the electronic and structural characteristics on introduction of
   hydrogen. Results at the Ce L(3) edge in La0.8Ce0.2Ni4.8Sn0.2 show a
   transition from a mixed valent or to a gamma-like Ce state as the
   lattice expands during charge. Ex situ x-ray absorption near-edge
   structures (XANES) at the Ni K edge indicate that the additions of
   either Ce or Sn fill empty Ni 3d states. The Ni K edge extended x-ray
   absorption fine structures (EXAFS) for all three alloys in the dry
   uncharged state were similar, indicating that minor substitutions for
   either the A or B component do not substantially change the structure.
   The Sn substitution causes an increase both in a and c axis as evidenced
   from increase in the Ni-Ni and the Ni-La distances. Partial substitution
   of La by Ce causes a slight contraction in the Ni-La distance. The Ni
   XANES and EXAFS indicate that about 6\% of the Ni in the
   La0.8Ce0.2N4.8Sn0.2 corroded after 25 cycles. Ce XANES on the cycled
   electrode indicates some corrosion of Ce and the formation of Ce (III)
   state. The results indicate that XAS is a very useful technique for the
   study of alloy hydrides, particularly the role of electronic structure,
   the environment around minor constituents, and the corrosion of
   individual components.}},

Abstract = {{The cost of immunising cattle against East Coast fever by the infection
   and treatment method has been calculated for a pilot scheme in Kaloleni
   Division of the Coast Province of Kenya by using a spreadsheet model,
   The cost was calculated to be KSh 544 (US\$ 25) per animal (in 1990
   values), If a farmer were to bear all this cost, immunisation would be
   financially profitable in grade cattle, but the benefits of immunisation
   would not be sufficient to justify the immunisation of zebu cattle. For
   these animals, the cost of immunisation mould have to be in the range of
   KSh 230 to KSh 415 per animal, or the farm-gate price of milk would have
   to increase by at least 80 per cent from KSh 7.50 to 13.50/litre, or the
   government would have to subsidise the cost either partially or fully,
   The first two possibilities are realistic, because the costs of routine
   immunisation are likely to be lower than for the pilot scheme, and
   because the increasing demand for milk is likely to push up prices in
   the liberalised markets, If both the grade and zebu cattle in Kaloleni
   Division were targets for immunisation, it is estimated that there would
   be 14,500 head for immunisation annually, costing an estimated KSh 8
   million, The spreadsheet model used to assess the economics of
   immunisation in the Kaloleni Division could be applied to determine the
   government or private veterinary service charges for immunisation that
   would be financially profitable to farmers in a defined cattle
   production system in any division, district or country, The model could
   also be used to estimate the annual total number of cattle for
   immunisation in a target cattle production system and thus help with the
   financial planning for the exercise.}},

Abstract = {{The antioxidant dihydrolipoic acid has been shown to reduce hypoxic and
   excitotoxic neuronal damage in vitro. In the present study, we tested
   whether pretreatment with alpha-lipoic acid, which presumably allows
   endogenous formation of dihydrolipoic acid, can protect cultured neurons
   against injury caused by cyanide, glutamate, or iron ions, using the
   trypan blue exclusion method to determine neuronal damage. One hour of
   preincubation with dihydrolipoic acid (1 mu M), but not with
   alpha-lipoic acid, reduced damage of neurons from chick embryo
   telencephalon caused by 1 mM sodium cyanide or iron ions. alpha-lipoic
   acid (1 mu M) reduced cyanide-induced neuronal damage when added 24 h
   before hypoxia, and pretreatment with alpha-lipoic acid for >24 h
   enhanced this neuroprotective effect. Both the R- and the S-enantiomer
   of alpha-lipoic acid exerted a similar neuroprotective effect.
   Pretreatment with alpha-lipoic acid (1 mu M) from the day of prating
   onward prevented the degeneration of chick embryo telencephalic neurons
   that had been exposed to Fe2+/Fe3+. alpha-lipoic acid (1 mu M) added to
   the culture medium the day of plating also reduced neuronal injury
   induced by 1 mM L-glutamate in rat hippocampal cultures, whereas 30 min
   of preincubation with alpha-lipoic acid failed to attenuate
   glutamate-induced neuronal damage. Our results indicate that
   neuroprotection by prolonged pretreatment with alpha-lipoic acid is
   probably due to the radical scavenger properties of endogenously formed
   dihydrolipoic acid.}},

   this disease using memantine as an example, Evidence is presented
   indicating that this class of compound is neuroprotective in preclinical
   models of subchronic glutamate toxicity without producing side effects
   characteristic for other classes of NMDA receptor antagonist This is
   attributed to their fast blocking kinetics and strong voltage
   dependency, Memantine also produces symptomatological improvement of
   cognition in animal models, The mechanism of action of this effect is
   still unclear but might be related to an enhancement of AMPA receptor
   mediated neurotransmission. In patients with dementia syndrome of

Abstract = {{We have examined the thermodynamics of the carbothermic reduction of
   metal oxides in either nitrogen or argon atmospheres. The reaction,
   which is given generally by (where the M denotes metal) M(x)O(y) + C (+
   N-2;) -> \{M(x)'N-y', M(x)''C-y'', M\} + CO, is highly endothermic and
   proceeds at temperatures from 1300 to 2350 K for the systems considered.
   Exploratory experimental studies were conducted in a solar furnace using
   concentrated solar radiation. The nature of the solid-phase products was
   determined by X-ray powder diffraction. Nitrides (AIN, TIN, Si3N4, ZrN)
   were formed for systems run in N-2: carbides (Al4C3, TiC, SiC, CaC2)
   were formed for runs in Ar; and metals (Mg, Zn) were obtained from their
   oxides in an Ar atmosphere. The use of solar energy as the source of
   high-temperature process heat offers the possibility of reducing
   emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants to the environment
   when it replaces the burning of a fuel for process heat. Furthermore,
   the availability of process beat al very high temperatures may make
   alternative processes economically feasible.}},

Abstract = {{1,4-Dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, which have a rapid onset and
   short duration of action, tend to increase sympathetic activity, which
   may limit the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy when used for
   the treatment of hypertension. This study compares the effects of the
   shorter-acting formulation of nifedipine (PA) with longer-acting
   felodipine (ER) on 24-h blood pressure and left ventricular mass in
   patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. Subjects were
   randomly allocated to receive nifedipine (n = 52) or felodipine (n = 56)
   over 8 weeks at increasing doses until the sitting office diastolic
   blood pressure (DBP) was < 90 mm Hg. An ambulatory blood pressure (ABP)
   recording and echocardiogram were performed at baseline and upon
   completion of the study. At the end of the dosing interval, felodipine
   lowered office DBP (mm Hg) by -18 +/- 12/14 +/- 1 compared to -14 +/-
   2/11 +/- 1 for nifedipine (P less than or equal to .05). Mean 24-h ABP
   was reduced (P <.001) by felodipine (-15 +/- 1/-10 a 1 mm Hg) and
   nifedipine (-15 +/- 1/-9 +/- 2 mm Hg). However, nifedipine caused an
   apparent biphasic response with felodipine reducing (P <.05) blood
   pressure more in the early afternoon compared to nifedipine. Left
   ventricular mass index was significantly reduced (P <.01) by felodipine
   (-6 +/- 1 g/m(2)), but not by nifedipine. Once-daily administration of
   felodipine achieves a more consistent control of blood pressure compared
   to twice-daily nifedipine and may be associated with a greater reduction
   in left ventricular mass.}},

Abstract = {{Measles virus (MV), human immunodeficiency virus, Epstein-Barr virus,
   and other leukotropic viruses can modulate the expression of leukocyte
   function antigen 1 (LFA-1) on the surface of infected and nearby
   leukocytes. This ability to induce changes in LFA-1 expression may play
   an important role in the pathogenesis of these viruses. However, the
   mechanism(s) involved in virus-mediated regulation of LFA-1 is unknown.
   Evidence is presented in this report that it is the MV hemagglutinin (H)
   protein that initiates up-regulation of LFA-1 expression in leukocyte
   cultures infected with this virus. Indeed, comparison of the abilities
   of different MV strains to modulate LFA-1 expression, examination of
   published nucleotide sequences for the H proteins of different vaccine
   strains, and competitive inhibition assays using oligopeptides
   homologous or heterologous to a region of the H protein gene
   encompassing amino acid 116 (from the amino terminus) all suggest that
   it is this portion of the H protein that is responsible for MV-induced
   alteration of LFA-1. These comparisons also support the hypothesis that
   there is a relationship between the abilities of different MV strains to
   alter LFA-1 expression and their pathogenic potentials.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay that
   could effectively reduce the time period required to screen and select
   for Gall Midge-resistant rice lines under held conditions. The primers
   for the assay were designed on the basis of sequence information of two
   phenotype specific random amplified polymorphic DNA fragments which were
   found to be tightly linked to Gall Midge biotype-1 resistance gene
   (Gm2). The two RAPD fragments, F8(1700) in the susceptible parent
   `ARC6650' and F10(600) in the resistant parent `Phalguna', were
   identified after screening 5450 loci using 520 random primers on genomic
   DNAs of `ARC6650' and `Phalguna'. These primers, when used in a
   multiplexed PCR, amplified specifically a 1.7-kb and 0.6-kb fragment in
   the susceptible and resistant parents, respectively. When this assay was
   performed on genomic DNAs of 44 recombinant inbred lines derived from
   `ARC6650' x `Phalguna' and 5 lines derived from other crosses where one
   of the parents was `Phalguna', `ARC6650' or their derivatives, the
   primers amplified a 1.7-kb fragment in all of the susceptible lines or a
   0.6-kb fragment in all of the resistant ones. These markers can be of
   potential use in the marker-aided selection of Gall Midge biotype-1
   resistant phenotypes. As screening for resistance can now be conducted
   independent of the availability of insects, the breeding of resistant
   varieties can be hastened.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Stress perfusion imaging is useful in risk stratification of
   patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. In the current
   era of managed health care, there is a need to provide data on patient
   outcome.
   Methods and results. This study examined the impact of exercise
   single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) thallium imaging on
   patient management (the subsequent need for coronary angiography and
   revascularization) and outcome (the occurrence of hard cardiac events
   defined as cardiac death or nonfatal acute myocardial infarction) in
   2700 patients who were being evaluated for diagnostic purposes. None of
   the patients had previous coronary angiography, coronary
   revascularization, or Q-wave myocardial infarction. The SPECT images
   were normal in 2027 patients (group 1) and abnormal in 673 patients
   (group 2). Within 6 months after thallium imaging 53 patients in group 1
   (3\%) and 242 patients in group 2 (36\%) underwent coronary angiography
   (p = 0.0001). The patients who underwent coronary angiography had higher
   pretest probability of coronary disease (group 1) or more perfusion
   defects (group 2) than patients who did not (p = 0.0001 each). Coronary
   revascularization within 3 months of coronary angiography was performed
   in 1 of the 53 patients (2\%) in group 1 and in 87 of 242 patients
   (30\%) in group 2 (p = 0.0001). Among the remaining patients who had
   coronary angiography but were medically treated there were no hard
   cardiac events in group 1 but there were 15 events in group 2 (p =
   0.02).
   Conclusions. The results of exercise SPECT thallium imaging are
   important in patient management and outcome. Coronary angiography,
   coronary revascularization and events are rare in patients with normal
   exercise SPECT thallium images.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, there are no simple one-step methods available to remove
   ribonucleases (RNases) from solution; however, such is imperative for
   researchers working with ribonucleic acids (RNAs) because RNases can
   destroy RNA. We report a simple means to remove RNase from solution. The
   scheme is based on the encapsulation of a new RNase inhibitor,
   poly{[}2'-O-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)]poly-(adenylic acid) (DNP-poly(A)),
   within porous tetramethoxy-silane- (TMOS) or tetraethoxysilane- (TEOS)
   based sol-gel-derived silica particles that are used to form a small
   bioaffinity column. We investigate the activity, binding capacity, and
   stability of the hybrid DNP-poly(A)/sol-gel-derived bioaffinity
   material. Radioactivity and fluorometric assays are used to determine
   the response of the sol-gel entrapped DNP-poly(A) to a variety of
   RNases. The results clearly demonstrate that DNP-poly(A) entrapped
   with;in the sol-gel matrix is active and binds to all RNases tested,
   There is minimal(<6\%) leaching of the DNP-poly(A) from the column, The
   DNP-poly(A)-doped sol-gel-derived particles do not require hydrated
   storage conditions. Biocolumn performance and stability are comparable
   for DNP-poly(A)-doped TMOS- and TEOS-derived materials, Sodium chloride
   can be used to regenerated the DNP-poly(A) column, The binding capacity
   of the biocolumn decreases over time; however, the binding capacity of a
   2-month-old DNP-poly(A)-doped biocolumn is several orders of magnitude
   greater than the typical levels of RNase encountered in contaminated
   solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We assessed the utility of spontaneous and
   gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-stimulated serum luteinizing
   hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels measured by
   new immunochemiluminometric assays in the evaluation and monitoring of
   precocious puberty,
   Methods: We evaluated serum gonadotropin values from intravenous GnRH
   stimulation tests in 49 girls with clinical signs suggesting central
   precocious puberty (CPP). Because GnRH-stimulated LH has been considered
   the standard for diagnosing CPP, we used it as the basis for comparison
   with GnRH-stimulated FSH levels and spontaneous LH and FSH measured by
   immunochemiluminometric assay.
   Results: Twenty-six patients had a peak serum LH value above the +2 SD
   threshold for normal prepubertal female subjects (LH > 5 IU/L). The
   GnRH-stimulated FSH values had a narrow range and did not discriminate
   patients with CPP. In contrast, elevations in spontaneous LH and FSH
   were found to be specific for CPP. Spontaneous LH levels correlated
   strongly with peak stimulated LH levels in subjects with precocious
   puberty (r = 0.79) or in control subjects (r = 0.93, both p < 0.0001).
   Spontaneous LH levels in excess of 0.1 IU/L detected true puberty with
   94\% sensitivity and 88\% specificity. Random LH levels in excess of 0.3
   IU/L had 100\% specificity for CPP,
   Conclusions: The GnRH-stimulated FSH levels do not adequately
   differentiate children with and without CPP and have limited utility in
   the evaluation of precocious puberty. Spontaneous FSH levels are
   elevated in CPP with fair sensitivity and marked specificity, Elevated
   random LH, measured by third-generation assay such as
   immunochemiluminometric assay, is strongly correlated with and highly
   predictive of elevated peak GnRH-stimulated LH, and is a useful
   screening fool for CPP.}},

Abstract = {{Synamphibolite facies Archean gold mineralization in the Mt. York
   District, Pilbara Craton, Western Australia, is hosted in metamorphosed
   banded iron formation (Main Hill - Breccia Hill prospect), amphibolites,
   and ultramafic schists (Zakanaka prospect). Mineralization at Main Hill
   occurs in quartz breccias with sulfide matrices and in altered wall rock
   adjacent to quartz-biotite-amphibole+/-clinopyroxene veins. Alteration
   associated with quartz veins is zoned, with biotite-pyrrhotite vein
   selvedges and a distal calcic-amphibole, arsenopyrite - lollingite zone.
   Hydrothermal biotite and actinolite have highest Mg/(Mg + Fe) ratios
   where associated with abundant sulfarsenides in the distal alteration
   zone. Whole-rock geochemical analyses and calculated metasomatic
   reactions indicate the addition of K, Al, S, As, Au, Ag, and Ni during
   hydrothermal alteration. Mineralization at Zakanaka is characterized by
   a broad wall rock alteration halo of biotite-amphibole, and zoned
   quartz-calc silicate veins proximal to ore. Wall rock adjacent to the
   veins contains pyrrhotite, pyrite, and gold. The alteration is explained
   by K-metasomatism distal to mineralization and K and Ca metasomatism
   proximal to mineralization. Balanced metasomatic reactions and
   mass-balance calculations indicate addition of K and depletion of Na,
   Ca, Mg, and Fe in distal alteration zones and addition of K, Ca, Mg, Fe,
   and Ti in proximal zones. Gold precipitation at both prospects occurred
   through loss of S, and possibly As, from the ore fluid during
   sulfidation reactions with Fe-rich amphiboles and biotites to form
   Mg-enriched equivalents and sulfarsenides. Changes in the oxidation
   state of the ore fluid may have enhanced gold precipitation, though pH
   changes are unlikely to have been important. The controls on
   mineralization are thus similar to those at many lower temperature,
   mesothermal deposits. The lack of consistently increasing Mg ratios of
   calc-silicate phases with increasing intensity of alteration and
   sulfidation at Main Hill may be the result of coupled substitutions in
   amphiboles and biotites during infiltration of a fluid with high-S, but
   low-As, activities.}},

Abstract = {{In Soviet-type economies, commodity prices were distorted as part of the
   redistributive system of the state, but with the transition, prices have
   been liberalised and taxes made more uniform. Has this change adversely
   affected the distribution of purchasing power? The paper develops a new
   method of measuring the distributional impact of price changes by
   computing the distributional characteristics of commodities from
   household budget survey data, and applies it to Hungary and the United
   Kingdom, finding that the distributional impacts over the past decade
   were negligible and not significantly different from zero in both cases.}},

Abstract = {{During embryonic development, the components of the avian immune system
   undergo ontogeny in several distinct organs, including the bone marrow,
   spleen, thymus, and bursa of Fabricius. This process is regulated and
   controlled by the complex interactions of various cytokines and
   colony-stimulating factors (CSF). The objective was to examine the
   action of two different sources of hematopoietic growth factors,
   spleen-conditioned media (SCM) and chick embryo extract (CEE), on the
   proliferation of hematopoietic cells from various organs and on the
   differentiation of progenitor cells in semisolid culture. Spleen and
   bone marrow cells obtained at Day 16 of incubation responded in a
   dose-dependent manner to the addition of SCM and CEE alone or in
   combination. No proliferative effect of SCM was observed on cells
   obtained from embryonic thymus or bursa. Clonal analysis of bone marrow
   and spleen cells suggested that CEE may contain the avian equivalents of
   stem cell factor, interleukin-3, granulocyte-macrophage CSF,
   granulocyte-CSF, and macrophage-CSF. Clonal analysis of SCM cultures
   suggested that in addition to myelomonocytic growth factor, which
   affects primarily macrophage-granulocyte lineages, a
   thrombocyte-CSF-like activity was also apparent. The SCM alone tended to
   act upon committed late progenitors. The combination of CEE and SCM
   amplified the size and the total number of colonies obtained and
   appeared to act synergistically upon progenitors with a high level of
   proliferative potential. This response on young progenitors was
   confirmed when cells were cultured in CEE and SCM prior to clonal
   analysis. These results document the presence of thrombocyte CSF in SCM
   and the effect of both CEE and SCM on the proliferative differentiation
   of avian embryonic hematopoietic progenitors.}},

Abstract = {{Ten young male adults (mean age 46.9 +/- 1.2 yrs) with 9.2 +/- 1.4 years
   of weight training experience and the ability to parallel squat at least
   1.5 times their body mass were selected as subjects. The exercise
   session consisted of sets of 10 repetitions at 65\% 1-RM of the parallel
   leg squat, with a cadence of one rep every 6 sec and 3 min rest between
   sets, to muscular failure. The average subject lifted a total of 9711
   +/- 1576 kg during 98 +/- 14 reps for a total work output of 72.5 +/-
   10.5 kJ before muscular failure occurred. Mean oxygen consumption during
   exercise was 1.58 +/- 0.06 l/min at 42.5 +/- 2.0\% peak VO2. A strong
   leukocytosis, lymphocytosis, and lymphocytopenia, similar to what has
   been reported following high-intensity cardiorespiratory exercise, were
   measured following leg squat exercise. Con A-stimulated lymphocyte
   proliferation (unadjusted) rose 50\% above preexercise levels (p =
   0.07), but when these data were adjusted on a per T cell (CD3(+)) basis,
   no change from rest was observed. Natural killer cell cytotoxic activity
   (NKCA), when adjusted on a per NK cell (CD56(+)) basis, was decreased
   about 40\% below preexercise levels for at least 2 h post-exercise. No
   significant increase in cortisol was seen after exercise, although
   norepinephrine and epinephrine increased moderately (465\% and 133\%,
   respectively), immediately following exercise. The data demonstrate that
   leg squat exercise to muscular failure results in a very similar immune
   response to that associated with intense endurance exercise, despite a
   lower mean oxygen consumption and only a moderate hormonal response.}},

Abstract = {{Evoked cortical responses to two kinds of auditory stimuli (rare and

   in stage 2 of NREM sleep is accompanied by some endogenous cognitive
   components of the event-related potential.
   All the 7 subjects examined in this sleep state failed to provide the
   correct behavioral response to auditory stimuli, but a K-complex was
   evoked more frequently by rare stimuli than by frequent stimuli. EEG
   segments in stage 2 were averaged separately according to the presence
   or absence of K-complexes emerging just after the stimulation. In cases
   where K-complexes did not emerge, a long-lasting negative potential of
   relatively low voltage appeared in the difference wave, which was
   obtained by subtracting the averaged EEG for frequent stimuli from that
   for rare stimuli.
   In cases where K-complexes emerged, a similar long-lasting negative
   potential of large amplitude appeared in the difference wave. These data
   may indicate that a K-complex evoked by an external stimulus is
   accompanied by a potential related to a cognitive process, which appears
   with greater amplitude in cases where a K-complex is evoked.}},

Abstract = {{The discovery that mast cells are a potential source of cytokines has
   suggested new ways in which mast cells can act in immunological and
   inflammatory responses. In this study we have used the HMC-1 cell line
   as a model for human mast cells to study the constitutive and inducible
   mRNA expression of interleukins, colony-stimulating factors,
   interferons, tumour necrosis factors alpha and beta, tumour growth
   factor beta and platelet-derived growth factor A and B. We found that
   HMC-1 cells constitutively expressed mRNA for TNF-alpha and TGF-beta,
   and a low level of M-CSF. After treatment with the phorbol ester TPA or
   the calcium ionophore ionomycin expression of several cytokines, i.e.
   IL-I beta, IL-3, IL-6, GM-CSF, TNF-beta and PDGF-A, could be detected.
   Both TPA and ionomycin induced the same set of cytokines, but the effect
   of TPA was more prominent. The relative induction was calculated to be
   70X for IL-1 beta and IL-3, 30X for GM-CSF and PDGF-A and 3-10X for
   IL-6, M-CSF and TNF-beta. This study shows that human mast cells have
   the capacity to express not only cytokines mediating an immune response
   but also cytokines affecting other cell types, e.g. fibroblasts and
   endothelial cells, involved in later steps of the inflammatory response.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To perform ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in
   high school students and to compare the 24-hour values with casual blood
   pressure (BP).
   Methods: Ambulatory BP monitoring was carried out in 190 high school
   students, 15 or 16 years of age, with elevated casual BP during the
   first examination at school for hypertension; 66 had elevated casual BP
   at both the first and the second examinations (group H1), and 124
   students were normotensive at the second examination (group H2).
   Sixty-two students who were consistently normotensive served as control
   subjects (group N). Average BPs for the 24-hour period, the awake period
   (10 AM to 10 PM), and the sleeping period (1 AM to 6 AM) were
   calculated.
   Results: Average BP for each period was significantly higher in group H1
   than in group N. Average BP in group H2 for these periods was
   intermediate between those of group H1 and of group N. The casual BP had
   a significant positive correlation with the average BP during the awake
   period (r = 0.55, p<0.01 for systolic BP; r=0.37, p<0.01 for diastolic
   BP). In most subjects the casual BP readings were higher than BP during

   Conclusions: Casual BP measurements correlated with 24-hour BP, but they
   tended to be higher than the measurements obtained during 24-hour ABPM.}},

Abstract = {{One hundred and seventy-two patients at The Methodist Hospital in
   Houston, Texas, were placed on BioMedicus centrifugal ventricular
   support. One hundred thirty-nine patients were male and 33 were female
   with a mean age of 59.7 years. Reasons for support were postcardiotomy
   cardiac failure (129 patients), cardiac allograft failure (17 patients),
   bridge to transplantation (IO patients), resuscitation (7 patients),
   postpercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty emergent (2
   patients), and other (7 patients). Support was by left ventricular
   assist device in 108 patients, right ventricular assist device in 20
   patients, and biventricular assist device in 44 patients. Eighty-four
   patients (48.8\%) were weaned from the ventricular assist device, and 88
   patients (51.2\%) were not weaned. Thirty-four patients (20.0\%) were
   discharged from the hospital, Complications included coagulopathy, renal
   insufficiency/failure, respiratory insufficiency/failure, neurological
   deficits, sepsis, arrhythmias, and device-related complications. Overall
   causes of death were ventricular failure (55.1\%), triage (13.0\%),
   arrhythmias (9.4\%), graft failure (5.9\%), coagulopathy (4.3\%), sepsis
   syndrome (2.9\%), device-related (0.7\%), and other (0.7\%). BioMedicus
   centrifugal ventricular support can be implemented rapidly and easily.
   Device-related complications are few (1.2\%), and it is relatively
   inexpensive when compared with other ventricular assist systems. This
   series demonstrates that a substantial number of patients may benefit
   from temporary centrifugal ventricular support.}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption of Sb on InAs(110) was studied for room temperature (RT)
   deposition and subsequent annealing using high-resolution soft X-ray
   photoemission (SXPS). A line shape analysis of the Sb 4d core level
   emission reveals that the Sb deposition at RT does not lead to perfectly
   ordered growth of the first monolayer. Subsequent annealing, however,
   results in a highly ordered first monolayer which is stable up to 620 K.
   This was confirmed by the Sb 4d core level emission line shape
   consisting of two well resolved chemically shifted components, which can
   be assigned to two different adsorption sites in the epitaxial Sb
   monolayer. The changes of surface band bending were determined as a
   function of Sb coverage and annealing temperature revealing that an
   accumulation layer was formed. The geometrical structure of the
   epitaxial Sb monolayers was investigated using low-energy photoelectron
   diffraction, i.e. the intensity of the Sb 4d core level emission was
   monitored as a function of polar angles and photon energy. The resulting
   patterns which show strong variations for both components are compared
   to calculations using a multiple scattering cluster model for different
   adsorption models of the Sb monolayer.}},

   I comprised 34 patients in whom all of the medial structures were
   ruptured (parallel and oblique fibers of the superficial medial
   collateral ligament and the posteromedial capsule) and were treated
   operatively. In Group II (12 patients), the superficial medial ligament
   fibers only were ruptured and these were treated nonoperatively. All
   patients started an immediate motion and rehabilitation prog ram.
   Forty-four patients returned for followup at a mean of 5.3 years (range,
   2 to 8.9) postoperatively. The results were assessed using the
   Cincinnati Knee Rating System. At followup, 20 knees (59\%) in Group I
   and 9 knees (73\%) in Group II had less than 3 mm of increased
   displacement on KT-1000 arthrometer testing (134 N). The overall rate of
   anterior cruciate ligament graft failure was 15\%:six (18\%) in Group I
   and one (8\%) in Group II. No patient had more than 2 mm of increase on
   valgus stress testing at 5 degrees or 25 degrees of knee flexion. The
   overall ratings were as follows: Group 1, 20 knees (58\%) excellent or
   good and 14 knees (42\%) fair or poor; and Group II, 11 knees (91\%)
   excellent or good and one knee (9\%) fair. Knee motion complications and

Abstract = {{Injury and trauma are major inducers of the acute-phase response. Among
   the major cytokine mediators of this response is interleukin-6, which is
   considered to be an early indicator of tissue damage following trauma.
   We have previously reported, in a group of children undergoing a single
   abdominal surgical procedure, the early induction of interleukin-1
   receptor antagonist following the commencement of surgery. In the
   present study, we investigated the production of cytokines IL-1ra, IL-1
   beta, and IL-6 in patients undergoing a range of surgical procedures to
   examine whether IL-1ra release is a general phenomenon or is restricted
   to certain categories of surgery. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and
   polymorphonuclear leukocytes from patients were studied as a possible
   source of induced IL-1ra, IL-1ra and IL-6 were induced in 44 and 53 of
   the 73 patients, respectively. Induction of these cytokines was
   associated with major operative procedures of the abdomen and thorax and
   in hip replacement. Levels of these two cytokines varied widely within
   the different surgical categories. IL-1ra reached maximum levels before
   IL-6 in 18 patients and at the same time in 20 patients. IL-1 beta
   levels were induced in only 6 patients. Endotoxin levels were not
   detected in association with induction of IL-1ra. IL-1ra was not
   upregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells or polymorphonuclear
   leukocytes obtained from patients following surgery suggesting that
   these cells are not the source of plasma IL-1ra induced following
   trauma. These results provide new insights into the regulation of IL-1ra
   in vivo in humans. They show that IL-1ra can be induced as an
   early-response cytokine following major trauma in the absence of an
   infectious etiology. (C) 1995 Academic Press,Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Two-stage tubular lenses (Supertrons) focused and transported intense
   electron beams (similar to 2 kA, similar to 340 keV, similar to 10 ns)
   for lens separation of similar to 17 mm or less. In this range the
   second lens focused electron beams whose angle of incidence with the
   axis of the lens was less than the critical value of similar to 34
   degrees. The first and second lenses were 40 and 13 mm long,
   respectively, with an inner diameter of 20 mm and a wall thickness of
   similar to 1.5 mm. The lenses were made from Bi-based powder-pressed
   materials. Neon gas was introduced into the diode gap and into the bore
   of the lenses at pressures on the order of 0.1 Torr. The experimental
   results suggest that adjacent lenses should be positioned closer than
   the value of their inner diameter, and are each sufficiently long in the
   axial direction if longer than the value of their radii.}},

Abstract = {{In vivo and in vitro antitumor activities of macromolecular prodrugs of
   doxorubicin (DXR) using 6-O-carboxymethylchitin (CM-chitin) as a carrier
   polymer were investigated. In order to determine the effect of a spacer
   group between a drug and a carrier polymer on the antitumor activity, we
   employed two different spacer groups, a lysosomal digestible
   tetrapeptide (Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly) and a simple hydrophobic pentamethylene
   to immobilize DXR molecules to CM-chitin. The cytotoxic activity of the
   conjugates obtained were investigated against four kinds of tumor cell
   lines, p388D(1) lymphocytic leukemia, L1210 leukemia HLE human hepatoma
   and Hela utrocervical carcinoma cell in vitro The
   CM-chitin/Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly/DXR conjugate 1 with lysosomal digestible
   tetrapeptide spacer groups showed slightly higher in vitro cytotoxic
   activity against these tumor cells than CM-chitin/C-5/DXR conjugate 2
   with a simple pentamethylene spacer group. However, the cytotoxic
   activity of these two conjugates was weaker than that of the free DXR.
   The survival effects of these conjugates were investigated against p388
   lymphocytic leukemia bearing mice in vivo by intraperitoneal (i.p.)
   implantation and intravenous (i.v.) injection. Although these conjugates
   did not show very high cytotoxic activities in vitro compared with the
   free DXR, conjugate 1, with the lysosomal digestible tetrapeptide spacer
   groups, exhibited survival effects against p388 lymphocytic leukemia in
   mice i.p./i.v. However, conjugate 2, with the simple pentamethylene
   spacer group, did not show any survival effects under the same
   conditions. These conjugates did not display an acute toxicity in the
   high dose ranges.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of various curing pressures (resulting in different void

   been examined. Thermogravimetry and mechanical spectrometry were used to
   determine the initial water content of prepregs and the dependence of
   viscosity on temperature. The pressure conditions were defined with
   respect to these preliminary test results. A set of curing pressure
   routes was then designed to produce unidirectional laminates with void
   contents between 0.3 and 10 vol\%. The mechanical properties of
   unidirectional laminates depend on the void content and this results in
   the determination of an optimal curing pressure route which involves
   minimizing the void content, while the mechanical properties are kept at
   their maximum level. To allow generalization of the experimental
   results, this study has been performed on two different composite
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of photoperiod on metabolism of 16,17-{[}H-3(2)]GA(19) and
   1,2-{[}H-3(2)]GA(1) applied to intact seedlings of Salix pentandra, was
   investigated. No difference was found in conversion of
   16,17-{[}H-3(2)]GA(19) to 16,17-{[}H-3(2)]GA(20) and
   16,17-{[}H-3(2)]GA(1) or in metabolism of 1,2-{[}H-3(2)]GA(1) to
   {[}H-3]GA(8) between plants grown in continuous light and plants exposed
   for 14 days to a 12-h photoperiod. Also, leaf discs from plants grown in
   long or short days, converted 16,17-{[}H-3(2)]GA(19) both in light and
   darkness. These data on metabolism of 16,17-{[}H-3(2)]GA(19) contrast
   with previous results, which have indicated a photoperiodic control of
   the metabolism of GA(19) to GA(20) in S. pentandra.
   Presence of these applied labelled GAs and their metabolites in
   different parts of seedlings was recorded, after application to intact
   seedlings as well as to isolated plant parts. When
   16,17-{[}H-3(2)]GA(19) was applied through the roots of intact plants,
   the relative amounts of 16,17-{[}H-3(2)]GA(1) present in leaves and
   shoot apices were higher than in roots and stems. In corresponding
   experiments with 1,2-{[}H-3(2)]CA(1), relatively higher amounts of
   {[}H-3]GA(8) were found in roots and stems than in leaves and shoot
   apices. Twenty-four hours after application of 16,17-{[}H-3(2)]GA(19) to
   isolated plant parts, 16,17-{[}H-3(2)]GA(20) and 16,17-{[}H-3(2)]GA(1),
   were found in leaves and roots, but not in internodes. Incubation of
   isolated plant parts with 1,2-{[}H-3(2)]GA(1) for 24 h resulted in
   presence of {[}H-3]GA(8) in all parts.
   The results mentioned above were obtained by monitoring metabolites by
   HPLC with on-line radio counting. The conversions of 17-{[}H-2(2)]GA(19)
   to 17-{[}H-2(2)]GA(20) and 17-{[}H-2(2)]GA(1) in shoot apices and whole
   seedlings, and of 17-{[}H-2(2)]GA(1) to 17-{[}H-2(2)]GA(8) in whole
   seedlings, were confirmed by GC-MS.}},

Abstract = {{In freshly isolated fetal guinea pig type II pneumocytes, zinc uptake is
   time and temperature dependent. Two pathways of uptake exist, resulting
   in a rapid phase that reaches a steady state within 30 s and a slower
   linear phase that does not attain a steady state within 60 min. Both
   processes exhibit saturation kinetics. The rapid phase has a maximal
   zinc uptake of 60.7 +/- 9.3 pmol . 10(6) cells(-1). 30 s(-1) and an
   apparent affinity (K-t) of 13.7 +/- 5.4 mu M. The maximum velocity of
   uptake (V-max) of the slower phase is 24.6 +/-: 1.9 pmol . 10(6)
   cells(-1) min(-1) with a K-t of 22.0 +/- 3.6 mu M. Epinephrine,
   terbutaline, dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, and
   dexamethasone have no significant effect on zinc uptake, while
   arachidonic acid (AA) stimulates. Dose-response data of AA-stimulated
   zinc uptake gives an apparent K-0.5 Of 0.42 +/- 0.01 mu M and a Hill
   coefficient of 1. The maximal uptake in the rapid phase is significantly
   increased to 146.8 +/- 12.4 pmol . 10(6) cells(-1) 30 s(-1) and in the
   slow phase, the V-max for zinc uptake is also significantly increased to
   33.0 +/- 1.8 pmol . 10(6) cells(-1) min(-1) by 10 mu M AA. However, the
   K-t values in both processes remain unchanged after AA stimulation. The
   effect is not mediated by either leukotrienes or prostaglandins but can
   be mimicked by other unsaturated fatty acids.}},

Abstract = {{Dual-energy gamma radiation systems are currently used to simultaneously
   determine either the dry bulk density of a porous medium and the
   volumetric content of one fluid, the volumetric fluid contents of two
   fluids, or the salt concentration and volumetric mater content. In this
   paper an error analysis based on the well-known error propagation
   formula is presented for all three types of measurements. For each
   application, formulae are derived that calculate the variance of a
   measured variable as a function of the observed count rates, attenuation
   coefficients, and path length. These formulae can be implemented in data
   acquisition or postprocessing programs. In addition, formulae are
   presented that relate the variance to the values of the measured
   variables, measurement counting time, calibration counting time, path
   lengths, source intensities, and attenuation coefficients. The latter
   formulae benefit experimental design. The effect of counting and
   calibration time, attenuation coefficients, source strengths, and path
   lengths on the probable error are demonstrated. For each type of
   measurement, experiments are conducted to test the validity of the
   presented theory. It was shown that, in general, the difference between
   the measured value and the true value of a variable is less than 1
   standard deviation.}},

Abstract = {{The method of pH shift measuring by means of pH microelectrode was
   applied for measurements of hydrogen ion fluxes across a planar bilayer
   lipid membrane (BLM) in the presence of potassium ion ionophore
   valinomycin and protonophore carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone
   (CCCP) under conditions of voltage clamp. It was shown that at a clamped
   BLM voltage, CCCP-induced H+ flux increased significantly after addition
   of valinomycin and depended on the potassium ion concentration. The
   voltage dependence of the flux was determined in the range of +/-150 mV
   under the conditions of both symmetrical KCl and KCl gradient.
   Surprisingly, at the clamped zero voltage on BLM, a significant hydrogen
   ion flux was observed in the presence of KCl gradient and both
   valinomycin and CCCP. This was interpreted as an induction of
   nonelectrogenic K+/H+ exchange in the presence of valinomycin and CCCP
   presumably through the formation of electrically neutral complexes of
   these two ionophores and K+ (H+) ions: valinomycin-K+-CCCP- and possibly

Abstract = {{Background. Ventricular fibrillation after declamping of the aorta after
   cardioplegic arrest is commonly managed by direct-current countershock.
   However, in coronary artery bypass grafting, placement of the electrodes
   can cause mechanical damage to the grafts and anastomoses, and the
   surgical procedure must be interrupted. As an alternative, intraaortic
   infusion of potassium chloride through the arterial line from the
   heart-lung machine was investigated.
   Methods. In a series of 100 patients with postischemic ventricular
   fibrillation (group P), 20 mmol of potassium chloride (plus 10 mmol
   later if necessary) was added to the oxygenator reservoir and perfused
   through the arterial line into the proximal aorta. The results were
   compared with those in a matched control group of 100 patients primarily
   treated with direct-current countershock (group DC).
   Results. In group P, the ventricular fibrillation was effectively
   converted to a supraventricular rhythm in 82\% of the patients. The
   remaining 18 patients required significantly (p < 0.005) fewer electric
   shocks than the patients in group DC. Serum K+ levels were slightly
   elevated for a short period after the potassium chloride infusion.
   Otherwise there were no significant differences in regard to incidence
   of heart block, temporary epicardial pacing, myocardial infarction, or
   atrial fibrillation between the two groups.
   Conclusions. Conversion of postischemic ventricular fibrillation with
   potassium chloride administered through the arterial line from the
   heart-lung machine is an effective, gentle, and convenient method. No
   side effects were noted.}},

Abstract = {{A modification of a colorimetric assay was used to determine synovial
   fluid total and individual sulphated-glycosaminoglycan concentration in
   various clinical presentations of joint disease in horses.
   Concentrations of synovial fluid and serum sulphated-glycosaminoglycan
   (GAG) were measured by the 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) dye assay
   in normal horses (n = 49), horses with acute (n = 26) or chronic. (n =
   27) joint disease (defined by clinical, radiographic, and
   clinicopathological parameters), and horses with cartilaginous lesions
   at diagnostic arthroscopy, but with normal radiographs and synovial
   fluid (n = 9). Horses with acute joint disease were subdivided into
   moderate acute (n = 21) and severe acute (n = 5) joint disease on the
   basis of synovial fluid analysis and clinical examination. Horses with
   chronic joint disease were subdivided into mild chronic (n = 9),
   moderate chronic (n = 10), and severe chronic (n = 8) joint disease on
   the basis of synovial fluid analysis, clinical examination, and
   radiographic findings. The concentrations of chondroitin sulphate (CS)
   and keratan sulphate (KS) were analyzed in each sample following
   sequential enzymatic digestion of the sample with chondroitinase or
   keratanase In addition, the concentration of hyaluronate (HA) in each
   sample was determined by a colorimetric assay following digestion of the
   sample with microbial hyaluronidase. Synovial fluid sulphated-GAG
   concentration (mean +/- SEM) was significantly increased (P <0.05) in
   horses with moderate acute (106.4 mu g/mL +/- 11.7 mu g/mL), severe
   acute (159.0 mu g/mL +/- 47.7 mu g/mL), moderate chronic (78.3 mu g/mL
   +/- 9.4 mu g/mL), and severe chronic (122.9 mu g/mL +/- 22.5 mu g/mL)
   joint pathology and in horses with detectable cartilaginous arthroscopic
   lesions (67.2 mu g/mL +/- 11.6 mu g/mL), but without synovitis or
   radiographic abnormalities as compared with synovial fluid sulphated-GAG
   of normal horses (25.6 mu g/mL +/- 2.6 mu g/mL). Synovial fluid CS
   concentrations (mean +/- SEM) were significantly increased in horses
   with moderate acute (74.9 mu g/mL +/- 7.7 mu g/mL), severe acute (94.8
   mu g/mL +/- 19.8 mu g/mL), moderate chronic (45.5 mu g/mL +/- 7.8 mu
   g/mL), and severe chronic (87.9 mu g/mL +/- 17.7 mu g/mL) joint
   pathology and in horses with detectable cartilaginous arthroscopic
   lesions (47.9 mu g/mL +/- 7.5 mu g/mL), but without synovitis or
   radiographic abnormalities as compared with normal horse synovial fluid
   CS concentration (12.1 mu g/mL +/- 2.7 mu g/mL). In contrast, the
   synovial fluid KS concentration (mean +/- SEM) was increased only in
   horses with moderate chronic (25.2 mu g/mL +/- 5.1 mu g/mL) and severe
   chronic (30.3 mu g/mL +/- 5.7 mu g/mL) joint disease when compared with
   synovial fluid KS concentration in normal horses (7.6 mu g/mL +/- 1.2 mu
   g/mL). When compared with normal, there was no significant difference in
   serum levels of sulphated-GAGs in any category of joint disease and no
   significant difference in the mean concentration of synovial fluid HA in
   any category of joint disease. As measured by standard synovial fluid
   analysis, there were significant correlations (P <0.0001) between the
   concentration of synovial fluid sulphated-GAG and synovial fluid white
   blood cell count (r = 0.38) and total protein (r = 0.54). There was no
   correlation between the concentrations of synovial fluid sulphated-GAG
   and synovial fluid HA or between the concentrations of synovial fluid
   sulphated-GAG and serum sulphated-GAG.}},

Abstract = {{The tracheal isolation of Ureaplasma urealyticum from critically ill
   infants was investigated to determine if the organism was associated
   with an inflammatory response. Twenty nine neonates consecutively
   admitted for acute respiratory disease, with birthweights of < 1301 g
   and no evidence of viral, chlamydial, or bacterial infections, were
   identified. Culture results for ureaplasmas were correlated with white
   cell counts and clinical and radiographic features. Sixteen infants had
   tracheal aspirates and/or blood specimens positive for U urealyticum.
   Pneumonia was diagnosed more frequently in the U urealyticum positive
   infants than in the 13 who were negative for the organism. The mean
   total white cell count, absolute neutrophil, and band form counts were
   significantly higher in the U urealyticum positive group than in the
   negative group.
   These data suggest that U urealyticum can induce an inflammatory
   response in selected individuals who present with clinical,
   radiographic, and, in some instances, histological features of
   pneumonia.}},

Abstract = {{This study compared three programs for reproductive management of the
   postpartum period for reproductive performance and net economic benefit
   within three dairy herds (n = 1624 cows). Cows on one program received
   PGF(alpha) injection at 25 to 32 d postpartum for reproductive therapy,
   and cows on a second program received additional PGF(2 alpha) at 39 to
   46 d postpartum for synchronization of estrus. These programs were
   compared with a postpartum program of rectal palpation based on
   veterinary intervention. Survival analysis indicated that cows receiving
   PGF(2 alpha) for reproductive therapy and synchronization of estrus had
   an 11\% higher rate of first Al and 10\% higher rate of pregnancy than
   did cows receiving the rectal palpation. No differences existed between
   the cows receiving rectal palpation and those receiving the PGF(2
   alpha). Because overall conception rates and conception rates at first
   Al did not differ among programs, the improved reproductive performance
   of cows receiving PGF(2 alpha) for both therapy and synchronization may
   be attributed to greater synchronization of estrus, which resulted in
   improved estrus detection. A partial budget indicated that the PGF(2
   alpha) programs were less expensive than the rectal palpation program.
   When PGF(2 alpha) was used for postpartum reproductive therapy and
   synchronization of estrus, reproductive performance and net economic
   benefit were increased compared with those of the other programs.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. Magnetic resonance angiography with three-dimensional
   surface rendering was performed to determine its value in assessing
   anatomic detail in patients with suspected aortic aneurysms.
   Background. Dacron patch aortoplasty repair of coarctation of the aorta
   carries an inherent risk of aneurysm development. Sudden death from
   aortic rupture prompted discontinuing this operation and evaluating 39
   patients (16 girls; mean age 6.3 years, range 10 days to 14.5 years)
   undergoing repair between January 1976 and October 1987. The aorta
   ruptured in 10 patients; 6 died at a mean interval of 8.1 years (range
   0.75 to 12.4) after repair. All 33 survivors were inter-viewed and
   examined.
   Methods. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 26
   patients, magnetic resonance angiography in 18. Angiographic slices were
   used to reconstruct three-dimensional images. No catheterization or
   contrast angiography was performed. Surgical intervention was based on
   clinical findings and magnetic resonance images.
   Results. Twenty patients (II girls) developed aneurysms, of which nine
   were detected in patients studied by magnetic resonance. Ruptures
   occurred in eight female patients, three of whom were pregnant. Surface
   renderings accurately defined aortic anatomy or aneurysms in all
   patients. On follow up, no aneurysms have been detected in patients with
   negative magnetic resonance study results. Precise anatomic correlation
   with operative findings was reported.
   Conclusions. Magnetic resonance angiography with three-dimensional
   surface rendering provides noninvasive, radiation-free and contrast
   agent-free high resolution images of the thoracic aorta These images can
   be reviewed and have three dimensional form and perspective. These
   techniques were preferred over invasive angiography by surgeons and
   clinicians as definitive, risk-free procedures before surgical
   intervention.}},

Abstract = {{We report striking immunodominance in the neutralizing antibody
   responses of major histocompatibility complex congenic mice to natural
   infection with influenza virus (H3N2 subtype), as deduced by sequencing
   the hemagglutinin (HA) genes of monoclonal antibody (mAb)-selected
   mutant viruses. A majority of mAb, established from individual BALB/c
   (H-2(d)) mice, select mutant viruses containing the same single amino
   acid substitution in the membrane distal ectodomain, HA1 198 A-->E,
   whereas changes at either HA1 158 G-->E or HA1 198 A-->E are selected
   for by mAb from BALB.K (H-2(k)) donors. The structural basis for
   immunodominance, and potential diversity of progenitor B cells, was
   investigated by sequence analysis of H and L chain gene rearrangements
   in mAb specific for HA1 158 or HA1 198. No correlation was found between
   antibody specificity and V-H or V-L gene usage, and a minimum of three
   to six progenitor cells contributed to the individual's repertoire for a
   single antigenic site. However, in a further analysis of the HA1
   158-specific antibody response of CBA/Ca (H-2(k)) donors, there was
   highly restricted light chain gene usage. Focusing of the immune
   repertoire to limited regions of the HA molecule during a primary viral
   infection may be a significant factor in immune pressure for antigenic
   variation, particularly since there is no evident restriction in the
   antibody response to immunization.}},

Abstract = {{ABC triblock and random methacrylic polyampholytes of molecular weight
   4,000 g mol(-1) with various base-neutral-acid compositions were
   examined for their phase separation behavior, each in an aqueous mixture
   with poly(vinyl alcohol) of molecular weight 10,000 g mol(-1). Potassium
   chloride concentration and solution pH were varied and the phase
   behavior was mapped on the pH-(KCl) space. The block copolymers
   presented a much broader phase separation region than the random
   copolymers. This difference may reflect the effect of the structure of
   the block copolymers which leads to the formation of micelles in
   solution. The two-phase region of the block copolymers extended over the
   whole range of potassium chloride concentrations employed in this study,
   from 0.0 to 0.75 M, and covered the pH range from two pH units below the
   polyampholyte isoelectric point up to two units above, with the
   exception of the points at alkaline pH without added salt. The two-phase
   region of the random copolymers extended from 0.0 to 0.1 M KCl and
   covered at most one unit in pH, centered near the isoelectric point. The
   two-phase region of the block copolymers comprised two regimes: the low
   salt concentration regime characterized by a compact polyampholyte
   precipitate in equilibrium with a low-viscosity poly(vinyl alcohol)
   phase; the high salt concentration and alkaline pH regime characterized
   by two coexisting low-viscosity phases. The one-phase region of the
   block copolymers extended in the acidic pH range and covered the whole
   salt concentration range. The ion type effect on the phase behavior of
   block polyampholytes was related to the position of the ion in the
   Hofmeister series: high concentrations of salt of low salting out
   ability resulted in a transition from a two- to a one-phase system.}},

Abstract = {{Bereavement and mourning are normal reactions to the loss of a loved
   one, characterized by specific ideas, affects, and behavior, evolving
   spontaneously towards resolution. This syndrome, classified as a non
   mental disorder (DSM IV), ressembles depression. Up to now, there was no
   instrument for an objective assessment The general objective of this
   work was to present the french version of the Texas Revised Inventory of
   Grief, or TRIG (Faschingbauer, De Vaul \& Zisook, 1981), designed to
   evaluate the intensity of the reaction to the loss of a loved one. Our
   population is composed of 154 adults of the general population (74
   females and 80 males) of the age of 25 to 35 years. A principal
   component analysis gave us a general factor of grief (28\% VT) which
   gathers emotional reaction to the bereavement The factorial analysis
   with Varimax Rotations confirmed the existence of two specific types of
   grief. These are `'past behavior'' (reaction at the time of loss) factor
   (37\% VT), `'present feelings'' (at the time of assessment by TRIG)
   factor (31\% VT). Furthermore, another factor of `'related facts'' (32\%
   VT) appeared to be in relation with the aptitude of coping. These
   results allowed us to construct a valid questionnaire of 25 items
   measuring 3 types of bereavement reactions.}},

Abstract = {{The Neotectonic Polls graben and adjacent Pegia half-graben in west
   Cyprus are extensional basins developed within the convergent tectonic
   regime of the Eastern Mediterranean. Both basins contain an early fill
   of Miocene carbonates including reef limestones. Messinian extension,
   oriented ENE-WSW, produced the asymmetrically faulted Polls graben
   structure. Evaporites were deposited in the south of the area while
   unconformity surfaces developed in the north. Pliocene marls and chalks
   were then deposited in a relatively quiescent phase in the north of the
   graben, while faulting continued into the Early Pliocene in the south.
   Plio-Pleistocene to Recent sediments record regional uplift of Cyprus.
   Contemporaneous NNE-SSW-oriented extension formed the Pegia half-graben
   and renewed minor faulting in the Polls graben.
   The extensional structures of the Polls graben system are thought to
   result from extension above a subduction zone located south of Cyprus,
   driven by subduction `roll-back' and trench migration. Accelerated
   convergence and rapid roll-back during Late Miocene times caused the
   first stage of extension, whilst the Plio-Pleistocene faulting was
   driven by differential extension in the overriding plate as the
   Eratosthenes Seamount collided with the trench and locally impeded
   subduction. The Polls graben system may provide a model for the early
   stages of development of major supra-subduction zone extensional areas
   such as the Aegean region.}},

Abstract = {{Two experiments were performed in a hedgerow vineyard, in June (after
   end of blossom) and July (full vegetation development) to assess the
   influence of spray application rate and air output on the spray
   distribution from an axial-fan sprayer. Measurements were performed by
   fluorometry, using Brilliant Sulpha Flavine as a tracer.
   Increasing spray application rate and air output both led to higher
   losses to the ground and lower deposition on the foliage. However,
   differences were statistically significant only in the July experiment.
   Losses to the soil ranged from 34.5 to 36.8\% for the lower spray rates
   (313-391 l/ha), and from 41.3 to 48.9\% for the medium spray rate
   (648-782 l/ha) treatments. Losses due to drift outside the experimental
   plots and deposition on branches, shoots and poles ranged from 6.5 to
   10.5\% for the lower air output (7.0 m(3)/s), and from 7.8 to 19.8\% for
   the higher air output (8.6 m(3)/s). The highest deposition on the
   foliage was recorded for the combination of a low spray rate and a low
   airflow rate (54.2 to 56.7\%). Deposits per unit leaf surface were
   invariably lower in the middle (1.2 to 1.6 m high), denser part of the
   canopy. However, differences between heights were lower than in a
   previous experiment. (C) 1995 Silsoe Research Institute}},

Abstract = {{Species-specific molecular markers were designed to assist in the
   identification of closely related black spruce (Picea mariana {[}B.S.P.]
   Mill) and red spruce (P. rubens Sarg.) in northeastern North America.
   Trees from six provenances of black spruce and three provenances of red
   spruce were sampled from outside the sympatric zone. They were first
   classified using a composite index of five qualitative morphological
   traits. The species-specific genetic markers were developed using random
   amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPD) and a combination of bulk sample and
   individual tree analyses. Each species bulk sample was constructed from
   DNAs obtained from 12 trees that were from outside the sympatric zone
   and showed a morphological composite index specific of each species. A
   total of 161 primers were screened with the bulk samples. From these, 52
   primers showing segregating fingerprints were further screened with the
   individual trees. Most of the markers observed were shared by the two
   species, and there was less diversity in P. rubens. A small number of
   markers were found to be monomorphic or nearly monomorphic and specific
   to either P. mariana or P. rubens. These markers remained
   species-specific when F-1 progenies derived from independent
   intraspecific crosses were screened, and they were subsequently found to
   co-segregate in hybrids derived from independent interspecific crosses
   here used as controls.}},

Abstract = {{The bombardment of metal surfaces under conditions of erosion, or
   corrosion-affected erosion where the corrosion component is small
   compared with erosion, leads to substantial physical rearrangement of
   that surface. It has been found that impingement normal to the surface
   induces a random pattern of hills and valleys, whereas impingement at an
   angle to the surface produces a pattern of ripples, aligned across the
   direction of the erosive stream.
   Recently, it has been found that, after long times at high temperature,
   a hill and valley pattern produced by normal erosive impact transforms
   into a ripple pattern by alignment of the hills and valleys in each
   metal grain. In this, the individual grains show patterns of ripples
   that lie at different orientations in the different grains, suggesting
   that this is determined by the slip system of the crystal.
   Currently, this phenomenon is being studied using polycrystalline nickel
   and a nickel bicrystal in order to determine the mechanism by which the
   ripple pattern evolves and which determines the orientation of the
   ripples.}},

Abstract = {{Fruit firmness and membrane lipid composition were evaluated in outer
   cortical tissue of `Golden Delicious' apples, which were
   pressure-infiltrated with distilled water, or 2 or 4\% CaCl2 solutions
   at harvest. After six months storage at 0 degrees, fruit were held at 20
   degrees for 1, 7 or 14 days and then evaluated. During storage at 0
   degrees, firmness had decreased by 20\% in water-infiltrated fruit, but
   by only 6\% in fruit infiltrated with 4\% CaCl2. During the span of 7 to
   14 days at 20 degrees, firmness decreased more rapidly in
   water-infiltrated fruit compared with CaCl2-infiltrated fruit.
   Reductions in specific phospholipids (primarily phosphatidylcholine,
   phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol) occurred after
   transfer to 20 degrees but were largely independent of the infiltration
   treatment. Steryl glycosides, acylated steryl glycosides,
   monogalactosyldiacylglycerol and digalactosyldiacylglycerol
   concentrations were positively correlated to CaCl2 concentration of
   infiltration solutions, and a large, transient increase (35-37\%) in
   acylated steryl glycoside concentration occurred during the first 7 days
   at 20 degrees in CaCl2-infiltrated fruit. In contrast, acylated steryl
   glycosides decreased by 19\% in water-infiltrated fruit over the same
   time interval. Overall, the results indicate that CaCl2 infiltration may
   delay galactolipid breakdown, increase the rate of sterol conjugation,
   and thus affect membrane organization and function during postharvest
   life of apple fruit.}},

Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{69}},

Abstract = {{We studied the ionic permeability of cGMP-dependent currents in membrane
   patches detached from the outer segment of retinal cone and rod
   photoreceptors. Reversal potentials measured in membranes exposed to
   symmetric Na+ but with varying cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations reveal
   that the permeability ratio, PCa/PNa, is higher in the cGMP-gated
   channels of cones (7.6 +/- 0.8) than in those of rods (3.1 +/- 1.0).
   Ca2+ blocks both channels in a voltage-dependent manner. At any Ca2+
   concentration, the channel block is maximal near the ionic reversal
   potential. The maximal block is essentially identical in channels of
   cones and rods with respect to its extent and voltage and Ca2+
   dependence. The Ca2+ block is relieved by voltage, but the features of
   this relief differ markedly between rods and cones. Whereas the
   Boltzmann distribution function describes the relief of block by
   hyperpolarizing voltages, any given voltage is more effective in
   relieving the Ca2+ block in cones than in rods. Similarly, depolarizing
   voltages more effectively relieve Ca2+ block in cones than in rods. Our
   results suggest that channels contain two binding sites for Ca2+, one of
   which is similar in the two receptor types. The second site either
   interacts more strongly with Ca2+ than the first one or it is located
   differently in the membrane, so as to be less sensitive to membrane
   voltage. The channels in rods and cones differ in the features of this
   second site. The difference in Ca2+ permeability between the channels is
   likely to result in light-dependent changes in cytoplasmic Ca2+
   concentration that are larger and faster in cones than in rods. The
   functional differences between channels, therefore, may be critically
   important in explaining the differences in the phototransduction signal
   of the two photoreceptor types.}},

Abstract = {{The univariate and multivariate study of variation for phenotypic
   plasticity is central to providing a clear understanding of hypotheses
   about the genetic control and evolution of reaction norms in natural
   populations. Arabidopsis thaliana is an ideal organism for the study of
   Genotype x Environment interactions (i.e., genetic variation for
   plasticity), because of the ease with which it can be grown in large
   numbers and due to the amount of information already available on its
   genetics, physiology and developmental biology. In this paper, we report
   on the plasticity, genetic Variation and G x E interactions of four
   populations of A. thaliana in response to three environmental gradients
   (water, light and nutrients), each characterized by four levels of the
   controlled parameter. We measured nine traits and obtained their
   reaction norms. Path analysis was used to study the plasticity of
   character correlations. We found a tendency for A. thaliana reaction
   norms to be linear (either flat, i.e. no plasticity, or with a
   significant slope), in accordance with previous studies. We detected
   substantial amounts of genetic variation for plasticity in the light and
   nutrient gradients, but not in the water gradient. Dramatic
   restructuring of character correlations was induced by changes in
   environmental conditions, although some paths tended to be stable
   irrespective of the environment, thereby suggesting some degree of
   canalization.}},

   with the optimum range of 4-8 mu g/ml. The binding of somatostatin to
   its mucosal receptor was inhibited by lipopolysaccharide from H. pylori.
   The inhibitory effect was proportional to the concentration of
   lipopolysaccharide up to 50 mu g/ml and reached a maximum of 94.1\%
   inhibition. The results suggest that H. pylori, through its
   lipopolysaccharide, is capable of interfering with somatostatin
   regulatory effect on gastric mucosal G-cell function.}},

Abstract = {{5-Propyl-5-deaza and 5-butyl-5-deaza analogues of classical antifolates
   were synthesized by extensions of a previously reported general route
   which proceeds through
   2,4-diamino-5-alkylpyrido{[}2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carbonitrile
   intermediates followed by reductive condensation with diethyl
   N-4-(aminobenzoyl)-L-glutamate to give diethyl esters of
   5-alkyl-5-deazaaminopterin types. N-10-Methyl derivatives, i.e.,
   derivatives of 5-alkyl-5-deazamethotexate, were also prepared by
   reductive methylation of the N-10-H compounds.
   5-Ethyl-5-deazamethotexate was prepared using an alternative route
   through 6-(bromomethyl)-2,4-diamino-5 -ethylpyrido {[}2,3-d]pyrimidine.
   These antifolates were evaluated for inhibition of dihydrofolate
   reductase (DHFR) from L1210 cells, their effect on L1210 and S180 tumor
   cell growth in culture, and carrier-mediated transport through L1210
   cell membranes. Inhibitory effect on DHFR was lowered relative to
   methotrexate in 5-propyl-5-deazaaminopterin and
   5-propyl-5-deazamethotrexate by 2- to 3-fold (K-i = 9.3 and 11.7 pM,
   respectively, vs. 4.3 pM for methotrexate) and by 17- to 18-fold in
   5-butyl-5-deazaaminopterin and 5-butyl-5-deazamethotrexate (K-i = 74 and
   78 pM, respectively). Molecular modeling using graphics derived from
   human DHFR show the propyl and butyl compounds interacting with the
   enzyme in conformations that account for these slight decreases in
   binding.}},

Abstract = {{A model of associating multipolar fluid is introduced. It is a
   one-component fluid with dipole-dipole and anisotropic intracore sticky
   interaction. The Mayer function of associative sticky interaction
   consists of the spherically symmetric part and the terms of dipolar and
   spin-spin symmetry. This model of anisotropic penetrable dipolar hard
   spheres permits the formation of dimer and higher-order n-mer species.
   Specific orientation-dependent correlations which result from the
   association of the monomers influence the structural, dielectric, and
   thermodynamic properties. The model is analytically solved within the
   mean spherical approximation. It is shown that the solution reduces to a
   linear combination of the solutions for the model of overlapping hard
   spheres of Cummings and Stell. This mapping is similar to that obtained
   by Wertheim for the dipolar hard-sphere model {[}M. S. Wertheim, J.

Abstract = {{Strengthening of concrete structures in flexure with externally
   epoxy-bonded carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminates is
   becoming an increasingly popular retrofit technique among researchers

   topic of this paper. First, considering the statistical character of the
   design variables (geometry, material properties), the effect of changes
   in these variables on the flexural capacity of CFRP-strengthened members
   is established. Variabilities in concrete strength and CFRP failure
   strain and area fraction are most influencial on flexural strength.
   Next, strength reduction factors are derived, with the aim of achieving
   a uniform reliability index of about three over a broad spectrum of
   design conditions. A general strength reduction factor phi = 0.80 is
   proposed. Finally, the effect of each design variable on the reliability
   of the system is examined and quantified in terms of the reliability
   index.}},

Abstract = {{Aims and background: Recombinant alpha-interferon has been shown to be
   effective in essential thrombocythemia and in thrombocytosis associated
   with other myeloproliferative disorders, Patients and methods:
   Twenty-five untreated patients were enrolled in our study from May 1989
   to April 1992. Recombinant alpha interferon-ab was administered at an
   initial dose of 2 megaunits (MU)/m(2) three times a week at escalating
   doses to 5 MU/m(2) or the maximum tolerated dose. The mean follow-up for
   patients still in treatment at the time of this report was 35.9 months
   (range, 24-63). Results: Fourteen patients (56\%) had achieved a
   complete remission by a mean time of 152 days; 6 patients (24\%) had
   achieved a good partial remission by a mean of 180 days, In addition to
   the favorable effect on platelet count, a marked improvement in clinical
   symptoms was observed. Treatment had to be discontinued in 9 patients
   (36\%), 5 for toxicity (3 neurologic, 1 anemia and 1 severe
   hypertriglyceridemia) at a median of 155 days from the beginning of
   therapy (range, 39-400). Four patients refused to continue therapy
   because of low tolerance (flu-like syndrome) at mean of 160 days from
   the beginning of therapy (range, 34-301). Conclusions: In our study,
   lower doses were administered compared with previous short-time trials.
   The present data show that interferon is an effective alternative to
   cytostatic agents In long-term treatment of patients with essential
   thrombocythemia, even when used at lower dosages.}},

Abstract = {{Most theories of deduction have assumed that linguistic processes
   transduce from language into an internal representation and back again,

   this article it is proposed that for deduction tasks for which the

   untrained participants involves repeatedly reencoding the problem, a
   type of behavior referred to here as verbal reasoning. It is shown that
   model theory accounts of behavior on most deduction tasks are consistent
   with verbal reasoning and that verbal reasoning can account for detailed
   behavior in a single task; a computational model of syllogistic
   reasoning-VR-base on linguistic mechanisms is presented. VR models all
   of the standard phenomena, makes a number of accurate novel predictions,
   and fits the behavior of individual participants with an accuracy that

Abstract = {{In this paper we describe several elementary constructions of 4-, 8- and
   16-dimensional locally compact affine planes. The new planes share many
   properties with the classical ones and are very easy to handle. Among
   the new planes we find translation planes, planes that are constructed
   by gluing together two halves of different translation planes,
   4-dimensional shift planes, etc. We discuss various applications of our
   constructions, e.g. the construction of 8- and 16-dimensional affine
   planes with a point-transitive collineation group which are neither
   translation planes nor dual translation planes, the proof that a
   2-dimensional affine plane that can be coordinatized by a linear ternary
   field with continuous ternary operation can be embedded in 4-, 8- and
   16-dimensional planes, the construction of 4-dimensional non-classical
   planes that admit at the same time orthogonal and non-orthogonal
   polarities. We also consider which of our planes have `tangent
   translation planes' in all their points. In a final section we
   generalize the Knarr-Weigand criterion for topological ternary fields.}},

Abstract = {{The Garcia-Solomon two-dimensional model was used to study the effect of
   doubled carbon-dioxide on the middle atmosphere. The model. has been
   improved to include non-LTE CO2 cooling in the 15 micron band above 70
   km and new chemical heating and heating efficiencies. The effect of
   doubling CO2 on the temperature is found to be large at the stratopause
   (about 10-12K cooling) and at the mesopause (about 6-12K cooling). In
   the stratosphere, dynamical feedbacks on the heating rate caused by the
   temperature changes are small compared to the radiative changes while in
   the mesosphere they can be large. In fact, calculations with the present
   dynamical heating rates used in the doubled CO2 energy equation indicate
   that the radiative forcing alone could cause a temperature increase of
   about 10K in the polar summer mesopause region. The dynamical feedbacks
   which oppose this positive radiative forcing are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim was to compare the clinical efficacy of lansoprazole
   with the efficacies of ranitidine and famotidine in order to rank this
   drug in the hierarchy of duodenal ulcer treatments.
   Methods: All randomized clinical trials in which lansoprazole was used
   to treat patients with duodenal ulceration were reviewed. The
   meta-analysis included a quality assessment for each trial. The main
   criterion chosen for the meta-analysis was the endoscopic healing rate
   at 4 weeks; other criteria were the healing rate at 2 weeks and the
   absence of pain at 2 and 4 weeks. Statistical methods used were the Der
   Simonian and Laird method and the method of Peto et al. A sensitivity
   analysis was performed according to the H-2 blocker type (famotidine or
   ranitidine). Odds ratios against histamine-receptor blockers were used
   to compare lansoprazole indirectly with omeprazole and other drugs.
   Results: Five double-blind trials were identified including 848
   patients. The mean 4-week healing rate in patients treated with
   lansoprazole was 85\%, which was significantly higher than the healing
   rate in patients treated with H-2-receptor blockers (75\%). This
   difference of 10\% was significant (P<0.01)according to the Der Simonian
   method, and the corresponding odds ratio of 2.27 (95\% confidence
   interval 1.5-3.2) was significant according to the Peto method (P<0.01).
   There was also a significant difference in favour of lansoprazole for
   2-week healing rates (mean difference 20\%, P<0.01) and for the
   percentage of patients without pain at 2 weeks (mean difference 8\%;
   P<0.02). Indirect comparisons of 4-week healing rates showed no
   difference between 30 mg lansoprazole and 20 mg omeprazole and confirmed
   that both drugs had a greater efficacy than ranitidine, famotidine,
   nizatidine, cimetidine or sucralfate.
   Conclusion: This meta-analysis showed that 30 mg lansoprazole was more
   effective in producing healing at 2 and 4 weeks than ranitidine or
   famotidine. Lansoprazole also led to a greater reduction in the
   percentage of patients free of pain at 2 weeks. The efficacy of
   lansoprazole was not different from that of omeprazole.}},

Abstract = {{In recent studies (Spencer and Christy, 1990; and Spencer et al., 1990)
   it is suggested that observations at 53.74 GHz made by the Microwave
   Sounding Unit (MSU), flown on NOAA operational weather satellites, can
   yield a precise estimate of global mean temperature and its change as a
   function of time. Hansen and Wilson (1993) question their interpretation
   of temporal changes on the grounds that the microwave observations could
   be influenced by the opacity of the variable constituents in the
   atmosphere. This issue has broad interest because of the importance of
   detection of global climatic change.
   In order to help resolve this issue, in this study we utilize a
   radiative transfer model to simulate: (a) the observations of MSU
   Channel 1 (Ch. 1) at 50.3 GHz, in the weakly absorbing region of the 60
   GHz molecular oxygen absorption band; and (b) the observations of MSU
   Channel 2 (Ch. 2) at 53.74 GHz, in the moderately strong absorption
   region of the same band. This radiative transfer model includes
   extinction due to clouds and rain in addition to absorption due to
   molecular oxygen and water vapor.
   The model simulations show that, over the oceans, extinction due to rain
   and clouds in Ch. 1 causes an increase in brightness temperature, while
   in Ch. 2 it causes a decrease. Over the land, however, both Ch. 1 and
   Ch. 2 show a decrease in brightness temperature due to rain and cloud
   extinction. These theoretical results are consistent with simultaneous
   observations in Ch. 1 and Ch. 2 made by MSU. Based on theory and
   observations we infer that a substantial number of the MSU observations
   at 53.74 GHz used by Spencer et al. contain rain and cloud
   contamination. As a result, their MSU derived global mean temperatures
   and long term trend is questionable.}},

   amounts of a sample containing 90\% of liver isoform adding to a serum
   sample from a patient with Paget's disease showed a cross reactivity of

Abstract = {{As we move into the 21st century, anthropology has enjoyed the diffusion
   of its knowledge into public discourse and into the discussions of other
   professions.' Within the academe, the American Anthropological
   Association recently adjusted the traditional four field approach
   (linguistic, biological/physical, cultural and archaeology) to include
   practice as a fifth field. Almost everyone in the international
   community at some level is struggling to make sense of how to balance
   economic priorities with environmental concerns. While science can
   attempt to evaluate the functions and risks confronting human and
   environmental systems, solutions to the major issues ultimately will
   require public choice and public responsibility. This reality raises
   important questions regarding what do we need to protect, how, at what
   cost, and who else should be involved in making these essentially
   value-based decisions. Here anthropology, through its broad approach,
   holistic perspective and field-based methods, can contribute in
   substantial ways.}},

Abstract = {{Four experiments are reported that examine attentional control in the

   responses to the onset of a monaurally presented pure tone that was
   preceded by a pure-tone cue.  On a valid trial, the cue was presented in
   the same ear as the target; on an invalid trial, it was presented in the
   contralateral ear to the target; and on a neutral trial, it was
   presented in both ears.  Overall performance was facilitated on valid
   trials in comparison with invalid trials.  In later experiments, the
   subjects made choice decisions about the location of the target, and
   significant cuing effects were found relative to the neutral condition. 
   Finally, performance was assessed in the presence of central (spoken)
   word cues.  Here, the content of the cue specified the likely location
   of the target.  Under these conditions, costs and benefits were found
   over a range of cue-target stimulus onset asynchronies.  The results are

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine whether the anorexia
   following epinephrine and glucose IP injections is due to the activation
   of mechanisms of satiety. Epinephrine (100 mu g . kg(-1)) and glucose (4
   g . kg(-1)) were injected IP in rats. In control sessions for
   epinephrine test, rats received IP saline, and IM epinephrine. In
   control sessions for the glucose test, rats received IP NaCl, isoosmotic
   to the glucose solution. Food intake or taste reactivity to a sucrose
   solution was recorded after these treatments. Epinephrine and glucose
   decreased food intake by 75\% (p < 0.001), and 49\% (p < 0.01), compared
   to their controls. No change of taste reactivity responses was observed
   with any of these treatments. Twelve-hour fasting did not modify the
   general taste reactivity responses when compared to the responses evoked
   in rats fed ad lib. These results might be explained by the fact that
   anorexia could be obtained by a suppression of hunger without the
   activation of the mechanisms of satiety. This in turn would imply a
   possible dissociation between the signals and physiological pathways
   normally involved in hunger and satiety.}},

Abstract = {{We have imaged mica coated with thin gelatin films in water, propanol,
   and mixtures of these two liquids by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The
   elastic modulus (Young's modulus) can be tuned from 20 kPa to more than
   0.1 GPa depending on the ratio of propanol to water. The resolution is
   best in pure propanol, on the order of 20 nm, and becomes worse for the
   softer samples. The degradation in resolution can be understood by
   considering the elastic indentation of the gelatin caused by the AFM
   tip. This indentation becomes larger and thus the contact area becomes
   larger the softer the sample is. Therefore this study may be used to
   estimate the resolution to be expected with an AFM on other soft
   samples, such as cells. Nondestructive imaging was possible only by
   imaging at forces <1 nN. This was difficult to achieve in contact mode
   because of drift in the zero load deflection of the cantilever,
   supposedly caused by temperature drift, but straightforward in tapping
   mode.}},

Abstract = {{1. In human platelet-rich plasma, platelet aggregation induced in vitro
   by collagen (10 mu g/ml) or thrombin (50 mU/ml) was dose-dependently
   inhibited by increasing concentrations of prostacyclin or of the new
   derivative
   (+/-)(5E)-13,14-didehydro-omega-hexanor(1-hydroxycyclohexyl)-9a-carbapro
   stacyclin (MM-706) with an IC50 of 20-50 nM and 250-500 nM,
   respectively. In human platelets loaded with fura-2, the intracellular
   rise of {[}Ca2+] induced by thrombin was dose-dependently inhibited by
   MM-706 with an approximate IC50 of 100 mu M.
   2. In rabbit isolated femoral artery, MM-706 (10 nM-10 mu M) was
   completely ineffective in relaxing the vessel, which was different to
   prostacyclin which was able to relax vessels at the same concentrations.
   3. In in vitro guinea-pig ileum, prostacyclin produced a contractile
   effect in the concentration range 1 nM-10 mu M, but the derivative
   MM-706 was ineffective at the same concentrations. Preventive addition
   of MM-706 did not inhibit prostacyclin contraction.
   4. On isolated guinea-pig tracheal preparation, prostacyclin induced a
   concentration-dependent contraction but the new compound MM-706 showed a
   lower activity, in the concentration range 10 nM-10 mu M. The activity
   of prostacyclin was not affected by the contemporary presence of MM-706.
   5. It is concluded that MM-706 is a prostacyclin analogue with
   antiaggregating properties but without evident effects on smooth muscle
   of different regions.}},

Abstract = {{Thirty-four asymptomatic children, ages 5-35 mo, were studied to compare
   the conjunctival impression cytology technique with the relative dose
   response test in detection of subclinical vitamin A deficiency.
   Conjunctival smears were collected from the infero-temporal-bulbar
   conjunctiva of each eye with a strip of cellulose acetate filter paper
   and transferred onto a glass slide. Venous blood was drawn at 0 and 5 h
   after administration of an oral dose of 1000 mu g of retinol palmitate
   (relative dose response test). An increase in serum retinol
   concentration (greater than or equal to 20\%) in the 5-h value was
   considered indicative of an inadequate liver store of vitamin A and
   hence subclinical vitamin A deficiency. Of the 34 children, 26 (76.5\%)
   had moderate to severe protein-energy malnutrition. Only three children
   (9\%) had abnormal conjunctival impression cytology, whereas 23 (68\%)
   had abnormal relative dose response. Even more striking was the finding
   that only two of the 23 children with abnormal relative dose response
   had abnormal conjunctival impression cytology. The results suggest that
   the conjunctival impression cytology test has poor agreement with the
   relative dose response test results in assessing vitamin A status in
   young children. If relative dose response is considered an acceptable
   reference method for assessing vitamin A status, then the conjunctival
   impression cytology test cannot be considered a valid measure of
   subclinical vitamin A deficiency in this population.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrastructural changes in myocardial tissue were studied in 21 patients
   undergoing elective aorta-coronary bypass operation, The patients were
   randomized into two groups, with 10 of them receiving continuous
   retrograde warm and 11 continuous retrograde mild hypothermic blood
   cardioplegia, Biopsy specimens for electron microscopy were taken from
   the apical part of the left ventricle before and at the end of the
   aortic crossclamp period and after reperfusion of the myocardium. The
   ultrastructural changes were analyzed with use of a semiquantitative
   scoring system and classified as mild, moderate, or severe, Slight
   ultrastructural changes were found in both groups even before the aortic
   crossclamp period, At the end of the aortic crossclamp period the most
   prominent ultrastructural changes were mitochondrial swelling, damage of
   capillary endothelium, and clearing of the nucleoplasm or margination of
   chromatin, but some enlargement in intercalated discs was also
   discernible, Reperfusion of the myocardium for 15 minutes somewhat
   further increased the overall score of the ultrastructural changes, Two
   patients in the warm cardioplegia group had a perioperative myocardial
   infarction, and this may be one reason for the higher postoperative
   creatine kinase MB efflux in this patient group, Despite this finding,
   no major differences in the ultrastructural changes between the two
   cardioplegia groups could be observed. We conclude that only mild to
   moderate and principally reversible ultrastructural changes occur in
   myocardium during continuous retrograde warm and mild hypothermic blood
   cardioplegia for coronary bypass operation.}},

Abstract = {{Familial hemiplegic migraine and its associated signs and symptoms have
   previously been well described. The condition demonstrates autosomal
   dominant inheritance and has been recently assigned to a locus on
   chromosome 19. Previous reports of familial hemiplegic migraine have
   indicated that expression always occurs early in life. We describe a
   patient who presented with multiple episodes of reversible hemiplegia
   followed by headache at the age of 75. Seven other family members were
   found to have been affected in a similar manner. We believe this case
   represents a unique description of familial hemiplegic migraine
   presenting in later life.}},

Abstract = {{To characterize the mineralized nodules produced by rat periodontal
   ligament (PDL) cells in vitro, we have studied the synthesis and
   distribution of mineralized tissue proteins at various stages of nodule
   formation. PDL cells were obtained from coagulum in the socket at 2 days
   after tooth extraction and cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium
   (DMEM) containing 10\% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Confluent
   cells were grown in the presence of ascorbic acid (50 mu g/ml),
   dexamethasone (5 mu M), and beta-glycerophosphate (10 mM) for 3 weeks.
   Four stages showing distinct morphological characteristics during
   development of mineralized nodules were identified. Protein synthesis
   and deposition of proteins into the matrix were studied during these
   stages by metabolic labeling with {[}S-35]methionine for 24 hours. Large
   quantities of SPARC (secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine) were
   synthesized by confluent cells but decreased during the progress of
   mineralized nodule formation. Two forms of osteopontin (OPN) (67 kDa and
   61 kDa) were synthesized in comparable quantities by confluent cells;
   OPN and bone sialoprotein (BSP) were induced by dexamethasone and
   represented the major proteins in the mineralized matrix. The 67 kDa
   form of OPN was the predominant species in the mineralized matrix. Both
   OPN and BSP were localized by immunogold electron microscopy on globular
   as well as fused electron-dense structures at sites of tissue
   mineralization.}},

   ann(60)phl(40), ann(40)phl(60), and ann(20)phl(80) and ann(0)phl(100))
   were synthesized hydrothermally under controlled oxygen fugacity
   conditions. Lattice parameters a(0) and b(0) show a distinct linear
   decrease with increasing Mg content. With increasing ferric iron content
   a deviation from this linear trend is observed especially within iron
   rich samples. The tetrahedral rotation angle alpha increases smoothly
   from 0 degrees in annite to 9.1 degrees in phlogopite. Mossbauer spectra
   show Fe2+ and Fe3+ on the octahedral MI and M2 sites and partially also
   Fe3+ on the tetrahedral site. There is a smooth increase of the
   quadrupole splitting on both the MI and the M2 site going from annite to
   phlogopite, probably due to changes in the lattice contribution to the
   electric field gradient, assuming a positive correlation between
   quadrupole splitting and distortion. Fe3+ contents, as determined by
   Mossbauer spectroscopy, versus oxygen fugacity shows that, depending on
   the composition of the micas, minimum amounts of Fe3+ are present. For
   ann(80)phl(20) this minimum amount of Fe3+ is about 8\% decreasing to
   about 1-2\% Fe3+ for ann(20)phl(80).
   The molar volume of each solid solution member has been estimated from
   the determined relations of the molar volume versus \% Fe3+ contents,
   extrapolated back to 0\% Fe3+. Plotting these volumes as a function of
   X(phl) shows that negative excess volume occur in the annite-phlogopite
   join, with the maximum deviation from ideality around X(phl)=0.3.
   Margules volume parameters have been constrained as:
   Wv, AnnPhl=0.018+/-0.016 J/(bar.mol) and Wv, PhlAnn=-0.391+/-0.025

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of determination of the light-field
   intensity in conditions of plane geometry of a scattering material
   layer. Discussing theoretically well-studied problems, namely,
   small-angle light reflection from media with sharply anisotropic
   scattering on separate centers, light reflection from a semiinfinite
   medium in conditions of isotropic scattering, P-1-approximation, and
   others, we demonstrate considerable difficulties connected with boundary
   conditions in the solution of different problems in the theory of
   optical radiation transfer. In order to overcome these difficulties, we
   propose an original method of separation of light fluxes. The essence of
   this method is in representing the intensities of both ascending and
   descending radiation as series. According to this method, instead of
   expanding the intensities in the multiplicity of collisions, we use
   expansions in the number of events that imply the sign reversal of the
   projection of the photon velocity on the direction normal to the
   boundaries of the scattering medium. We derive equations for independent
   calculation of ascending and descending radiation fluxes. Moreover,
   boundary conditions on material surfaces are exactly fulfilled for any
   approximate method of solving these equations. Taking a simple
   bidirectional scattering phase function as an example, we analytically
   calculate the ascending and descending radiation in a material layer
   with a finite thickness and partial fluxes of various multiplicities. We
   analytically calculated the Green's function in a medium with isotropic
   scattering and the Green's function that corresponds to the standard
   small-angle approximation in media with sharply anisotropic scattering.
   For the Henyey-Greenstein scattering law, we obtain a simple analytical
   expression for the intensity of transmitted radiation under oblique
   incidence of a light flux upon a material surface.}},

Abstract = {{Moment resisting frames located at the perimeter of buildings are often
   designed to provide the required earthquake resistance for the building.
   In some countries, these frames are often constructed incorporating
   precast reinforced concrete elements that are connected with
   cast-in-place concrete joints. The aim of such construction is to
   emulate the behavior of conventional cast-in-place reinforced concrete
   structures. Such construction incorporating precast concrete elements
   requires demonstration that the structure shows levels of stiffness,
   strength, ductility and energy dissipation characteristics that are at
   least equal to those of the emulated monolithic system. This paper
   presents results of tests on six subassemblages typical of perimeter
   frames. Four units were connected at the beam midspan. The two remaining
   units had the connections at the beam-to-column joint region. The
   subassemblages were tested under quasi-static cyclic reversed loading.
   The results show that the connection detail can be successfully designed
   and constructed to emulate cast-in-place construction.}},

Abstract = {{The sleep patterns of two groups of children with autism, one with
   moderate to severe intellectual handicap, and one with mild handicap to
   normal IQ level, were compared with those of children without autism.
   Parents completed 14 day sleep diaries and questionnaires. Results
   suggested that at some stage during childhood, particularly under 8
   years of age, the majority of children with autism will experience deep
   problems. These problems are likely to be severe in many cases and will
   generally include one or more of extreme sleep latencies; lengthy
   periods of night waking; shortened night sleep; and early morning
   waking. Such problems may have some specificity for autism as they
   appear to be rare in non-handicapped children and in children with mild
   degrees of intellectual handicap. It is likely that sleep problems in
   early childhood are related to the severe social difficulties present in
   autism and the consequent inability of these children to use social cues
   to synchronise their sleep/wake cycle. Continued sleep difficulties at
   older ages and with higher IQ may also be related to arousal and anxiety
   factors.}},

   bifunctional enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK-2)/
   fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase-2) have been studied by
   site-directed mutagenesis. In recombinant rat liver PFK-2/ FBPase-2,
   mutation of Arg-225 to Ser increased the K-m of PFK-2 for
   fructose-6-phosphate (Fru-6-P) 7-fold at pH 6 and decreased PFK-2
   activity at suboptimal substrate concentrations between pH 6 and 9.5.
   The mutation had no effect on the V-max. of PFK-2 or on the K-m of PFK-2
   for MgATP. The mutation also increased the V-max. of FBPase-2 4-fold
   without changing the K, for Fru-2,6-P-2 or IC50 of Fru-6-P. These
   findings are in agreement with a previous study {[}Rider and Hue (1992)
   Eur. J. Biochem. 207, 967-972] on the protection by Fru-6-P of the
   labelling of Arg-225 by phenylglyoxal, and suggest that Arg-225
   participates in Fru-6-P binding. In recombinant rat muscle PFK-2/
   FBPase-2, mutation of Arg-104 to Ser increased the K-m for Fru-6-P
   60-fold, increased the IC,, of citrate, increased the V-max. 1.5-3-fold
   at pH 8.5 and altered the pH profile of PFK-2 activity. It did not
   affect the K-m of PFK-2 for MgATP. The mutation also decreased the
   V-max. of FBPase-2 3-fold, increased the K-m for Fru-2,6-P-2 70-fold and
   increased the IC50 of Fru-6-P at least 300-fold. Although the dimeric
   structure was maintained in the mutant, its PFK-2 activity was more
   Sensitive towards inactivation by guanidinium chloride than the
   wild-type enzyme activity. The findings indicate that Arg-104 is
   involved in Fru-6-P binding in the PFK-2 domain and that it might also
   bind citrate. Structural changes resulting from the mutation might be
   responsible for the changes in kinetic properties of FBPase-2.}},

   same population of striatal neurons. Moreover, inhibition of
   haloperidol-induced c-fos expression by intrastriatal injection of
   antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides complimentary either to
   bases 109-126 or 127-144 of c-fos attenuated the subsequent increase in
   neurotensin/neuromedin N messenger RNA. However, injection of a sense
   phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide corresponding to bases 127-144 of
   c-fos did not reduce haloperidol-induced c-fos or neurotensin/neuromedin
   N expression. Furthermore, constitutive expression of Jun-like
   immunoreactivity in the striatum was not reduced by either the sense or
   antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides. Similarly, the sense
   and antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide failed to reduce
   proenkephalin messenger RNA, which is located in the same striatal
   neurons that express haloperidol-induced neurotensin/neuromedin N
   messenger RNA. Lastly, haloperidol-induced increases in nerve growth
   factor I-A-, JunB- and FosB-like immunoreactivity and fosB messenger RNA
   were not decreased by intrastriatal injection of either the sense or
   antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides.
   These results indicate that the antisense phosphorothioate
   oligodeoxynucleotides attenuated haloperidol-induced
   neurotensin/neuromedin N expression by selectively reducing c-fos
   expression and emphasize the potential importance of immediate-early
   gene induction in the mechanism of action of this antipsychotic drug.}},

Abstract = {{Burkholderia cepacia (basonym Pseudomonas cepacia), the type species of
   the new genus Burkholderia, is of interest, not only because of its
   broad catabolic capacity and its ability to antagonize soil-borne plant
   pathogens, but also because of its causative role in infections in man,
   which are particularly evident in patients with cystic fibrosis. A
   physical map of the 8.1 Mb genome of the B. cepacia type-strain ATCC
   25416 was constructed by applying two-dimensional pulsed-field gel
   electrophoresis techniques. Placed onto the macrorestriction map were 38
   SpeI, 11 SwaI, 11 PacI, 11 PmeI and six I-CeuI sites, resulting in an
   average resolution of 105 kbp. Random single-hit linearization by
   irradiation and restriction mapping uncovered the presence of four
   circular replicons of 3.65 Mb, 3.17 Mb, 1.07 Mb and 200 kbp in size. The
   largest replicon harbours four rrn operons while the other two
   Megabase-size replicons each contain a single rrn operon, suggesting
   that the genome has three chromosomes and a large plasmid. Within the
   beta subdivision of proteobacteria, the existence of multiple replicons
   is not confined to B. cepacia. The phylogenetically related species
   Burkholderia glumae, Burkholderia pickettii, Burkholderia solanacearum,
   Alcaligenes eutrophus and the so far unassigned Pseudomonas glathei were
   also found to harbour more than one Megabase-size replicon.}},

Abstract = {{Rhizopine (L -3-O-methyl-scyllo -inosamine; 3-O-MSI) synthesis (mos) and
   catabolism (moc) genes were originally isolated from Rhizobium meliloti
   strain L5-30 Murphy et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 84:493,
   1987). These genes have been postulated to give a competitive advantage
   to this strain in the rhizosphere, since the ability to utilize the
   unusual nutritional mediator rhizopine as nitrogen and carbon source
   appears to be correlated with the ability of Moc(+) bacteria to
   efficiently infect alfalfa plants, This study examines the distribution
   of rhizopine catabolism (moc) genes among different soil bacteria. By
   using oligonucleotide primers homologous to the moc genes and the
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR), moc genes were shown to be absent from
   a random collection of 100 different soil isolates, However, screening
   50 different electrophoretic type strains of a worldwide R. meliloti
   collection (Eardly et al., Appl. Environ, Microbiol, 56:187, 1990)
   revealed the presence of moc genes in three additional strains, S33,
   102F51, and 74B3. These three strains were found to be able to
   synthesize rhizopine in planta (Mos(+)) and to catabolize it (Moc(+)).
   To determine the relatedness of the Mos(+)/Moc(+) strains to each other
   and to other R. meliloti strains, we used the rep-PCR method to generate
   genomic fingerprints, and to create a phylogenetic tree with the help of
   an optical imaging system and data analysis program (AMBIS), Because of
   the apparent infrequent occurrence of moc genes among soil bacteria, we
   suggest that the use of moc genes as a selectable marker trait for
   tracking genetically manipulated organisms is feasible.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a proof that given a dilute concentration of aerosol
   particles in an infinite, periodic, cellular flow field, arbitrarily
   small inertial effects are sufficient to induce almost all particles to
   settle. It is shown that when inertia is taken as a small parameter, the
   equations of particle motion admit a slow manifold that is globally
   attracting. The proof proceeds by analyzing the motion on this slow
   manifold, wherein the flow is a small perturbation of the equation
   governing the motion of fluid particles. The perturbation is supplied by
   the inertia, which here occurs as a regular parameter. Further, it is
   shown that settling particles approach a finite number of attracting
   periodic paths. The structure of the set of attracting paths, including
   the nature of possible bifurcations of these paths and the resulting
   stability changes, is examined via a symmetric one-dimensional map
   derived from the flow.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. This study was designed to develop a methodology that would
   measure the monomer conversion of dental restorative resins without the
   use of an infrared spectrometer.
   Methods. Specimens were prepared from heat-cured TEGDMA/MMA copolymers
   consisting of 0,20,40,60, 80 and 100 mole\% TEGDMA. The pre- and
   post-cure volumes of bar-shaped specimens (45 x 7 x 1 mm) and thin films
   were measured. The cure of the thin specimens was determined using
   changes in resin volume as well as by an infrared spectroscopic method.
   The cure of thin specimens of a commercially available unfilled bonding
   resin was also determined using the shrinkage method and by conventional
   infrared spectroscopic methods.
   Results. There was no difference (p = 0.0617) between cure values of the
   commercial resin using either conventional IR methods or the shrinkage
   methods. For each copolymer combination of thin films, there was also no
   significant difference in the extent of cure between the IR method used
   and the shrinkage method presented (lowest p-value 0.29). The cure of
   TEGDMA/MMA copolymer bar specimens demonstrated a decreasing trend of
   cure with increasing proportion of TEGDMA, and had cure values which
   were similar to others reported in the literature.
   Significance. The evidence from this study demonstrated that the
   specimen volume method can be used to determine the extent of resin cure
   of thin film or bulk resin specimens. This method represents an easily
   performed procedure that can be used by all investigators without
   expensive equipment.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of anoxia exposure (2 or 12 h at 5 degrees C) on the
   tissue-specific responses by enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism were
   analyzed in the mantle, gill, hepatopancreas, and adductor muscle of the
   intertidal bivalve Geukensia demissus demissus. Reversible enzyme
   phosphorylation has been identified in other species of marine molluscs
   as a mechanism for coordinating the suppression of metabolic rate and
   the redirection of carbon into fermentative pathways under anoxic
   conditions. The present study shows patterns of response response to
   anoxia by five enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism, including glycogen
   synthetase (GS) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), whose responses to
   anoxia have not before been analyzed in marine molluscs. Anoxia-induced
   changes in properties, consistent with reversible phosphorylation
   modification of the enzymes, were found for pyruvate kinase (PK) and PDH
   in all tissues and in selected tissues for glycogen phosphorylase (GP)
   and GS. However phosphofructokinase did not appear to be modified in any
   tissue during anoxia. Within 2 h of anoxia exposure, PK showed a sharp
   drop in the activity ratio (at subsaturating vs. saturating PEP
   concentrations) that indicated a stable modification of enzyme K-m for
   PEP; for example, in the gill, the ratio (determined at 0.75 and 7.5 mM
   PEP) fell from 0.39 +/- 0.08 for aerobic controls to 0.08 +/- 0.01 after
   2 h anoxia. The percentage of PDH in the active a form also dropped
   significantly, in anoxia from 80\%-84\% PDHa in controls to 65\%-75\%
   PDHa in anoxic tissues. Changes in both of these enzymes are consistent
   with anoxia-induced metabolic rate suppression. By contrast, anoxia
   exposure increased GP activity in the gill and adductor muscle,
   indicating a need for increased glycogenolysis during anoxia in these
   tissues. Total phosphorylase (a + b) activity increased in both tissues,
   as did the percentage of a in the adductor; for example, in the
   adductor, active GPa content rose from 0.09 +/- 0.02 U/g wet wt in
   controls to 0.24 + 0.01 U/g wet wt after 2 h and to 0.16 +/- 0.02 U/g
   wet wt after 12 h of anoxia exposure. Glycogen synthetase behaved
   oppositely in hepatopancreas, showing a significant decrease in total
   activity in 12-h anoxic tissue, but GS was unaffected by anoxia in the
   gill Or the adductor muscle. In the mantle, oppositely directed changes
   in total GS activity and the percentage active resulted in no net change
   in the activity of the active I farm during anoxia.}},

Abstract = {{Effective control of tuberculosis transmission in vulnerable population

   has undermined the ability to quickly identify antimicrobial resistance.
   These studies describe a mycobacterial. growth assay based on
   microencapsulation technology used in conjunction with flow cytometric
   analysis. Mycobacteria were encapsulated in agarose gel microdrops
   approximately 25 mu m in diameter, and felony growth was monitored by
   using flow cytometry to evaluate the intensity of auramine staining
   after culture for various times at 37 degrees C. By this method, colony
   growth of Mycobacterium bovis and M. smegmatis could be quantified
   within 1 to 3 days after encapsulation. Inhibition of growth by rifampin
   and isoniazid was also evaluated in this time period, and the presence
   of an isoniazid-resistant subpopulation representing 3\% of the total
   microorganisms could be detected. This use of encapsulation and flow
   cytometry has the potential to facilitate rapid and automated evaluation
   of inhibition of growth by antimicrobial agents and shorten the time

Abstract = {{The relationship between the extractability of collagen by enzymatic
   digestion and the degree of nonenzymatic glycation of collagen was
   examined in the aorta and skin from 38 subjects without diabetes
   mellitus (mean age: 62.3 +/- 20.2 years). Samples were obtained from the
   aortic media (M), lesion-free intima (I), atherosclerotic intima (A) and
   dermis of the skin (S). Collagen was extracted first by incubation with
   1/50 (enzyme/substrate weight ratio) pepsin at 4 degrees C for 24 h
   (P-fraction) and then by incubation with 1/10 (enzyme/substrate weight
   ratio) pepsin at room temperature for 24 h (EP-fraction). The
   pepsin-insoluble precipitates were digested by incubation with 270 units
   of bacterial collagenase at 37 degrees C for 24 h (PIS-fraction).
   Collagen contents, ketoamines and collagen-linked fluorescence (CLF)
   were measured in each fraction. The amount of ketoamines and the level
   of CLF correlated inversely with the susceptibility of collagen to
   pepsin digestion in various tissues, including M, I, A and S. These
   values were highest in both the P- and EP-fractions of M, which
   contained the least amount of collagen extracted by pepsin digestion. In
   contrast, they were lowest in S, where the concentration of collagen
   extracted by pepsin digestion was greatest among all of the tissue
   samples. Atherosclerotic intima (A) and aortic media (M) showed an
   age-related increase in the total amount of collagen digested with
   pepsin and collagenase, which depended mainly on an increase in the
   content of pepsin-insoluble collagen. Although the total amount of
   collagen did not increase with advancing age in I or S, collagen in I
   and S became progressingly resistant to pepsin digestion. These results
   suggest that the age-related decrease in the susceptibility of collagen
   to pepsin digestion may be due to nonenzymatic glycation in
   atherosclerotic lesions as well as normal tissues, including the aortic
   media, lesion-free intima and skin. The level of CLF significantly
   increased with age in the P-fraction and/or EP fraction of M, I and S.
   However, there was no relationship between the level of CLF and the
   subject's age in A. Thus, the accumulation of advanced glycation
   endproducts (AGEs) on collagen fibers may be partially responsible for
   the increase in collagen matrix in atherosclerotic lesions of subjects
   without diabetes mellitus.}},

   with the highest dose, suggesting the progressive development of
   tolerance. The modification observed for 100 mg kg(-1) was accompanied

   resection of the jejunal-ileal segment. Rats received one of four
   chemically defined solid diets prepared by using casein, two casein
   hydrolysates of different peptide size distributions, or free amino
   acids simulating casein and identical in all other components for 12 d,
   starting 3 d after surgery. Semipaired feeding was used to ensure that
   the same quantity of food was ingested by each group and as a
   consequence, nitrogen and energy intakes were reduced to 63\% of that
   obtained with ad libitum feeding of the casein diet to intact rats. No
   significant differences were demonstrable in food ingestion, weight
   gain, nitrogen balance, or morphometric data for the remaining jejunal
   and ileal segments (number of cells/villus, number of cells/crypt, and
   crypt cell mitosis rate). These data demonstrate that the extent of
   polymerization of the protein nitrogen source did not affect the
   hyperplastic adaptative process of the rat. Additional studies in humans
   are necessary to determine whether intact protein diets can be used
   first as a nitrogen source in nutritional support of patients with a
   nonspecific hyperplastic response to surgical resection before the use
   of expensive hydrolysates and the more expensive amino acid mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{To a great extent coatings for structural applications have been
   developed by a combination of insight and empiricism. This approach has
   failed to provide a scientific and systematic base for future design and
   development of new and/or improved coatings. The difficulty arises from
   the innumerable process and structural parameters that need to be
   understood and controlled accurately. Therefore, it is essential that
   future improvements or development of novel coatings take a
   multidisciplinary approach using fundamental principles related to
   equilibrium thermodynamics and process kinetics. Discussion is centered
   on the utilization of such an approach to formulate concepts that can
   aid in the design and development of tailored coatings. Specific
   examples of several coating systems currently under development are
   discussed. The intent is to show that the total solution to the
   systematic development of customized coatings requires a combination of
   both fundamental analysis and a pragmatic process optimization approach.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the efficacy of a hypo-osmolar and a standard (World Health
   Organization) oral rehydration salt (ORS) solution in persistent
   diarrhoea, a randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in 55
   children. After a 1-day observation period the children were assigned to
   one of three solutions: standard ORS (WHO-ORS) (osmolality 311
   mosmol/l), hypo-osmolar ORS containing L-alanine and glucose (osmolality
   255 mosmol/l) and iv polyelectrolyte solutions (osmolality 293 mosmol/l)
   for ongoing replacement of stool loss for the next 4 days. Excellent
   acceptability of ORS (101-160 ml/kg body weight/day) by the children was
   observed. There were no significant differences in the total intake of
   solutions and food, and frequency of stools among the groups. Stool
   outputs were significantly less in infants receiving hypo-osmolar ORS
   than in those receiving WHO-ORS for 0-24 h (p = 0.04), 0-48 h (p =
   0.01), 0-72 h (p = 0.04) and 0-96 h (p = 0.03). The results indicate a
   sufficient scope of ORS practice in persistent diarrhoea. Furthermore,
   we found that a hypo-osmolar ORS containing L-alanine and glucose is as
   efficacious as an iv solution and more effective than WHO-ORS for
   replacement of ongoing stool loss in persistent diarrhoea.}},

Abstract = {{The maintenance of angina control was assessed in this multicenter
   (three sites), randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. Patients
   with stable angina pectoris receiving twice-daily sustained-release (SR)
   diltiazem were switched to equivalent doses of once-daily
   controlled-delivery (CD) diltiazem or to diltiazem SR. Patients who were
   switched from diltiazem SR to diltiazem CD (n = 28) experienced a 5\%
   increase in time to termination (p = 0.0004) on the exercise tolerance
   test (ETT), as well as an 8\% improvement in time to onset of angina (p
   < 0.0001) on the ETT. A similar trend was observed in patients
   randomized to diltiazem SR (n = 7), which suggested a training effect,
   and, therefore, equal efficacy between diltiazem SR and diltiazem CD.
   During exercise testing in the diltiazem SR baseline phase, 77\% of the
   patients did not experience angina, whereas 60\% of the patients did not
   experience ST-segment depression. Following transfer to diltiazem CD, 79
   and 61\% of patients, respectively, remained angina- and ST-segment
   depression free. No significant changes in the number of angina attacks,
   nitroglycerin use, or any hemodynamic-related parameters were observed
   following transfer to diltiazem CD. Eleven percent of the patients
   receiving diltiazem CD experienced treatment-related adverse events,
   which were limited to headache and abdominal pain; these adverse events
   did not lead to discontinuation of treatment. These findings suggest
   that patients whose angina is controlled with twice-daily diltiazem SR
   can be safely and effectively switched to an equivalent daily dose of
   the once-daily diltiazem CD.}},

Abstract = {{Reproduction of two mass species of Black Sea copepods were studied. The
   data were obtained in three expeditions to the Black Sea on board of a
   research ship of Ukrainian Research Centre for Ecology of Sea in May,
   July and September 1992, correspondingly. In May, distribution of
   epiplankton Acartia clausi occurred with varying intensity over the
   entire sea, while migrant Calanus euxinus concentrated near the Crimean
   and Caucasian shores and in the eastern deep-sea part. In July and
   September, the numbers of copepod eggs and nauplii reduced in plankton,
   while that of Noctiluca increased. The depressed condition of pelagic
   area influenced the reproduction characteristics. For instance,
   fecundity of A. clausi decreased 3 - 10 times compared with May, the
   reproduction centre in coastal waters of the Crimea and Caucasus and in
   the middle of the western part of the sea. In C. euxinus the
   reproduction developed a suppressed character.}},

Abstract = {{The quantitation of catecholamines has yet to be reported in the human
   dental pulp. Various methods of chemical detection have shown the
   presence of catecholamines in pulpal tissue. Pulpal tissue was obtained
   from nonrestored, uninflamed teeth that needed to be extracted. The
   samples were collected, extracted, and analyzed by means of
   high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection for
   levels of catecholamines (dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine). As
   mediators of vasoconstriction, catecholamines play an important role in
   the control of intrapulpal pressure. This research describes a method
   for quantitation of catecholamines. Future studies investigating
   inflamed tissue can now be accomplished with the use of this analytic
   method. The results from this research indicate a baseline level of
   catecholamines in the uninflamed human dental pulp.}},

Abstract = {{Living benthic foraminifera and polychaetes have potential as robust
   elements of assemblage models that can be used to monitor the temporal
   and spatial impact of organic matter (OM) fluxes from various kinds of
   marine aquaculture operations on local benthic environments, Of 148
   samples analyzed for foraminifera in this survey of finfish and mollusk
   farms, 48 contained no living specimens, Thirty-three of the 48 barren
   samples were collected during summer/autumn when anthropogenic and
   natural OM fluxes are highest, and bottom-water oxygen concentrations
   can become severely depressed, At the four sites in Atlantic Canada, OM
   concentrations in the 0-2 cm layer of bottom sediment ranged from 4 to
   26\%, and there was a general inverse association, more pronounced
   during the summer months, between species per sample and mean OM, Some
   abundant calcareous species (e.g., Buccella frigida, Haynesina
   orbiculare and Elphidium excavatum) show seasonal variation in addition
   to their apparent response to OM contamination, Seasonal variation is
   also evident among prominent arenaceous taxa (e.g., Hemisphaerammina
   bradyi). These temporal variations are superimposed on distinctive
   spatial changes in assemblage character that occur in passing from
   control environments to heavily OM-contaminated areas located directly
   below fish cages and mussel lines, Species diversity usually increases
   at sites where average sediment OM levels are less than about 15\%.
   The five most abundant polychaetes in a 14-sample set show a wide range
   of sensitivity to both direct (food source) and indirect (low oxygen
   concentration) effects of OM loading. Nephtys neotena shows a weak
   direct relationship to OM that is consistent with its ubiquitous spatial
   and temporal distribution. As benthic conditions become less
   contaminated by OM at mussel line sites, N. neotena is replaced by forms
   such as Pholoe minuta during the reduced-stress winter/spring interval,
   Other taxa are restricted solely to proximal, OM-enriched aquaculture
   settings, a feature that they share with some of the opportunistic
   foraminiferal species, Nepthys neotena and Cossura longicirrata are part
   of this apparently OM-tolerant assemblage.}},

   rested on an early interpretation of optical rotation data. Applying a
   recent, less empirical, chiroptical model of saccharide rotation, we
   confirm the earlier analysis by concluding that the rotation observed in
   the gel can be satisfactorily accounted for in terms of wide-diameter
   agarose helices, capable of intertwining. In addition, we have found
   that the extended helices found in dried sols do not yield the observed
   gel rotations. (C) 1995 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF METAMORPHIC GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{1995}},

Abstract = {{The hydrothermal metamorphism of a sequence of Pliocene-aged seamount
   extrusive and volcanoclastic rocks on La Palma includes a relatively
   complete low-P-T facies series encompassing the zeolite,
   prehnite-pumpellyite, and greenschist facies. The observed mineral
   zonations imply metamorphic gradients of 200-300 degrees C km(-1).
   The transition from smectite to chlorite in the La Palma seamount series
   is characterized by discontinuous steps between discrete smectite,
   corrensite and chlorite, which occur ubiquitously as vesicles and, to a
   much lesser extent, vein in-fillings. Trioctahedral smectites {[}(Mg/(Fe
   + Mg) = 0.4-0.75] occur with palagonite and Na-Ca zeolites such as
   analcime and a thompsonite/natrolite solid solution. Corrensite
   {[}(Mg/(Fe + Mg) = 0.5-0.65] first appears at stratigraphic depths
   closely corresponding to the disappearance of analcime and first
   appearance of pumpellyite. Discrete chlorite {[}(Mg/(Fe + Mg) = 0.4-0.6]
   becomes the dominant layer silicate mineral coincident with the
   appearance of epidote and andraditic garnet.
   Within the stratigraphic section there is some overlap in the
   distribution of the three discrete layer silicate phases, although
   random interstratifications of these phases have not been observed.
   Although smectite occurs as both low- and high-charge forms, the La
   Palma corrensite is a compositionally restricted, 1:1 mixture of
   low-charge, trioctahedral smectite and chlorite. Electron microprobe
   analyses of coarse-grained corrensite yield structural formulae close to
   ideal values based on 50 negative charge recalculations. Calcium
   (average 0.20 cations/formula unit) is the dominant interlayer cation,
   with lesser Mg, K and Na.
   The absence of randomly interlayered chlorite/smectite in the La Palma
   seamount series may reflect high, time-integrated fluid fluxes through
   the seamount sequence. This is consistent with the ubiquity of
   high-variance metamorphic mineral assemblages and the general absence of
   relict igneous minerals in these samples.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a substrate-induced growth response (SIGR) method for

   in bioremediation processes in soil and bioreactors. The biomass of
   organisms that can mineralize a given chemical can be estimated based on
   the concentration of that chemical needed to induce the growth of the
   standing population. Estimates of population size are obtained by using
   nonlinear regression techniques to fit a simple model of microbial
   population dynamics to biodegradation curves. Using this approach we
   obtain estimates of values for parameters such as initial population
   size and growth rate of organisms carrying out biodegradative processes.
   Our approach was validated by comparing model parameter estimates with
   independent estimates of the same parameters from the same
   bioremediation systems. Examples studied include pentachlorophenol
   degraders introduced into soil and 2,4-dinitrophenol degrading organisms

Abstract = {{This 4-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled,
   parallel-group, multicenter study was designed to compare the efficacy
   and safety of etodolac and nabumetone in the treatment of patients with
   active osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. Ninety-one patients received
   etodolac 400 mg twice daily, 89 received nabumetone 1500 mg once daily,
   and 90 received placebo. Both active treatments significantly improved
   the patients' condition relative to baseline (P less than or equal to
   0.001) at all evaluations during treatment and relative to placebo (P
   less than or equal to 0.05) by visit 4. Improvement relative to placebo
   in investigator's global assessments was earlier in the etodolac group
   (ie, by visit 3) than in the nabumetone group. At visit 4, improvement
   in investigator's and patient's global assessment scores, and in the
   distribution of investigator's assessment scores, was significantly (P
   less than or equal to 0.05) greater in the etodolac group than in the
   nabumetone group. Other than hypokalemia, which occurred only in three
   patients in the nabumetone group (P = 0.035), there were no significant
   differences among the groups in the frequency of study events or
   premature discontinuation from the study as a result of study events.
   Study events considered at least possibly treatment related were
   reported for 26 patients in the etodolac group (28.6\%), 20 in the
   nabumetone group (22.5\%), and 23 in the placebo group (25.6\%). The
   most frequently reported symptoms for all groups were dyspepsia, nausea,
   and headache. Four patients treated with nabumetone (4.5\%) had
   elevations in aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase
   during treatment. The results of this study show that etodolac 400 mg
   twice daily is at least as effective as nabumetone 1500 mg once daily
   and is equally well tolerated in the treatment of patients with active
   OA of the knee; etodolac may have an earlier onset of action and/or a
   relatively greater efficacy in patient and investigator global
   assessments than nabumetone.}},

Abstract = {{Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem autosomal recessive disorder
   caused by mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator
   (CFTR), a protein that regulates cyclic-AMP-mediated chloride
   conductance at the apical membrane of secretory epithelia(1). Mutations
   in the CFTR gene are common in many populations. In North America, 4-5\%
   Of the general population are heterozygous for a CFTR mutation(2).
   Although there are over 400 known CFTR mutations, a single mutation, a
   deletion of the phenylalanine at position 508 (Delta F508) in exon 10,
   accounts for about 70\% of all CF chromosomes worldwide(3). The reasons
   for the high frequency of the Delta F508 CFTR allele - the selective
   advantage associated with CF heterozygosity - are unknown(1). Many
   physiological abnormalities have been observed in CF heterozygotes(4-6),
   although the clinical significance of these observations is unknown.
   Preliminary unpublished data and anecdotal information from CF families
   suggested that, remarkably, the Delta F508 allele might protect
   heterozygotes against bronchial asthma prompted us to further
   investigate this possibility. Here we present evidence that the Delta
   F508 CF allele protects against asthma in childhood and early adult
   life.}},

Abstract = {{The dose-proportionality of pharmacokinetics of an iodinated contrast
   medium, iopromide, encapsulated into liposomes was investigated.
   Methods. Following single intravenous administration of 150 mg iodine/kg
   (potential diagnostic dose) and a five-fold higher dose in rabbits the
   pattern of elimination was studied until 7 d and the blood
   concentrations were monitored up to 72 h after administration. The
   iodine concentration in the liver was calculated on the basis of the
   blood concentration and related to the concentration measured in the
   rabbit liver. Results. The dose-normalized blood concentration-time
   profiles of the encapsulated iodine were not superimposable. Contrary to
   the low dose a steady-state concentration of 2.8 mg iodine/ml was
   observed in blood for 60 min after the high dose administration
   indicating a saturation of the liposomal liver uptake. For both doses
   the elimination of iodine occurred predominantly via the kidneys and was
   complete 7 d after administration. The dose-normalized amounts of iodine
   excreted with the urine were similar for both dose groups. From the
   blood data it was calculated that doses up to about 300 mg iodine/kg
   should result in a dose-proportional increase of liposomal liver uptake
   before saturation occurs. This was confirmed by the measured iodine
   liver concentrations after increasing the doses stepwise from 150 to 750
   mg iodine/kg. Conclusions. In rabbits for the dose range 150 to 750 mg
   iodine/kg iopromide liposomes reveal dose-dependent pharmacokinetics due
   to a saturation in liver uptake which occurrs for doses of 300 mg
   iodine/kg corresponding to 300 mg lipid/kg onwards.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic obstruction of the guinea pig ileum leads to distension and
   muscular hypertrophy, but how this affects passive biomechanical and
   nerve-mediated contractions and clearance known as peristaltic reflex is
   unclear. Ileum of controls had a diameter of 3.0 +/- 1.1 mm and a
   circular muscle thickness of 37.2 +/- 11.2 mu m; 4 wk after placement of
   a nonconstricting Gore-Tex band, the ileum was distended to 10.0 +/-
   0.19 mm, and its muscle had hypertrophied to 195.0 +/- 61.2 mu m.
   Hypertrophied segments exceeded controls in capacity (e.g., 5.1 +/- 1.1
   vs. 1.1 +/- 0.2 ml at 6 cm); compliance, and hysteresis. Threshold
   volumes and pressures that triggered the reflex were 3.3 +/- 1.3 ml and
   3.1 0.01 mmHg in hypertrophied vs. 0.7 +/- 0.2 ml and 1.5 +/- 0.2 mmHg
   in controls. The diameter increase that triggered the reflex was 1.4 +/-
   0.1 mm in hypertrophied segments and 0.6 +/- 0.1 mm in controls.
   Hypertrophied segments generated fewer contractions of virtually double
   the amplitude and failed to generate a pressure differential between up-
   and downstream sites as controls did. Hypertrophied segments generated
   larger stroke volumes and cumulative clearance than controls. The ratio
   of antegrade to retrograde clearance was similar in hypertrophied and
   control segments. The length of the occluding segment in hypertrophied
   preparations exceeded that of controls. Control contractions indented
   the antimesenteric border and propagated antegrade from their site of
   origin; bizarre writhing movements of hypertrophied segments made their
   contractions difficult to monitor. Thus distension and muscular
   hypertrophy do not interfere with the ability of the chronically
   obstructed guinea pig ileum to generate a peristaltic reflex at least as
   readily and as powerful and as effective in clearing the lumen as
   controls.}},

Abstract = {{A 40-kb region of DNA from Sorangium cellulosum So ce26, which contains
   polyketide synthase (PKS) genes for synthesis of the antifungal
   macrolide antibiotic soraphen A, was cloned. These genes were detected
   by homology to Streptomyces violaceoruber genes encoding components of
   granaticin PKS, thus extending this powerful technique for the
   identification of bacterial PKS genes, which has so far been applied
   only to actinomycetes, to the gram-negative myxobacteria. Functional
   analysis by gene disruption has indicated that about 32 kb of contiguous
   DNA of the cloned region contains genes involved in soraphen A
   biosynthesis. The nucleotide sequence of a 6.4-kb DNA fragment, derived
   from the region with homology to granaticin PKS genes, was determined.
   Analysis of this sequence has revealed the presence of a single large
   open reading frame beginning and ending outside the 6.4-kb fragment. The
   deduced amino acid sequence indicates the presence of a domain with a
   high level of similarity to beta-ketoacyl synthases that are involved in
   polyketide synthesis. Other domains with high levels of similarity to
   regions of known polyketide biosynthetic functions were identified,
   including those for acyl transferase, acyl carrier protein,
   ketoreductase, and dehydratase. We present data which indicate that
   soraphen A biosynthesis is catalyzed by large, multifunctional enzymes
   analogous to other bacterial PKSs of type I.}},

Abstract = {{RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES. To compare technical aspects and neointima
   formation of a new Nitinol stent and a Wallstent.
   METHODS. A Nitinol stent and a Wallstent were placed into the iliac
   arteries of 14 sheep (total of 28 stents) and followed angiographically.
   Seven sheep were killed after 1 month and 7 after 4.5 months,
   Examination of histologic specimen by light microscopy was performed to
   determine neointimal and medial thickness inside the stents.
   Measurements were analyzed statistically.
   RESULTS. Neointima was thicker in Nitinol stents (N) than in Wallstents
   (W) (P < 0.004), both adjacent to (W = 0.265 mm, N = 0.596 mm) and
   between the stent wires (W = 0.177 mm, N = 0.361 mm). Because of poor
   radiopacity and the Croche releasing technique, delivery was more
   difficult with Nitinol stents, High-grade stenosis was found in two
   Nitinol stents at 1 and 4.5 months of follow-up, respectively. One
   Wallstent was insufficiently incorporated into the vessel wall.
   CONCLUSIONS. The observed difference in neointima formation that may be
   caused hy differences in design, mechanical properties or the metal
   alloy of the stents probably is too insignificant to be relevant to
   patency of large arteries. However, it may be relevant in small vessels
   such as coronary arteries.}},

Abstract = {{Neutrophil-derived hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is believed to play an
   important role in inflammatory lung injury. We investigated the
   influence of pharmacological agents that increase intracellular c-AMP
   levels on endothelial and epithelial leakage in response to
   intravascular H2O2 challenge in buffer-perfused rabbit lungs.
   Endothelial permeability was assessed by determination of the capillary
   filtration coefficient (Kfc) and lung weight gain. Measurement of the
   clearance rate of inhaled aerosolized technetium-99m-labeled
   diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid ({[}Tc-99m]DTPA) from the lungs into
   the perfusion fluid was used as an index of alveolar epithelial
   permeability. Experiments were performed in the presence of
   acetylsalicylic acid to suppress H2O2-induced lung prostanoid generation
   and concomitant vasoconstriction. Under these conditions, H2O2 admixture
   to the perfusate (250 mu M) caused a greater than eight-fold increase in
   Kfc values, resulting in >30 g lung weight gain within 30 min in the
   absence of any significant vasopressor response. Pretreatment with the
   adenylate cyclase activators prostaglandin E(1) (0.1 mu M) and forskolin
   (0.1 mu M), the dual phosphodiesterase type III/IV inhibitor zardaverine
   (10 mu M) as well as combinations of these drugs all caused a nearly
   complete suppression of this early Kfc increase; and severe edema
   formation (>30 g) was retarded to similar to 50-55 min. In addition to
   the microvascular leakage response, H2O2 caused a four- to five-fold
   increase in the {[}Tc-99m]DTPA clearance rate, starting within 15 min
   and culminating after similar to 35 min. Adenylate cyclase activation
   reduced this epithelial leakage response by similar to 30\%, whereas
   zardaverine exerted no significant effect. We conclude that both
   microvascular endothelial and alveolar epithelial barrier function are
   severely compromised by intravascular H2O2 challenge in intact lungs.
   Pharmacological approaches to increase c-AMP levels, including both
   adenylate cyclase activation and phosphodiesterase inhibition, partially
   block the endothelial response and, to a lesser extent, the epithelial
   response. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{In the developing cerebellum, young granule neurons in the external
   germinal layer respond preferentially to BDNF, while mature neurons
   within the inner portion of the cerebellum respond preferentially to
   NT3. Here we show that this anatomic distinction reflects a
   developmentally regulated switch at the level of neurotrophin receptor
   gene expression. The salient feature of the developmental switch is a
   change in the ratio of mRNA transcripts encoding functional BDNF and NT3
   receptor tyrosine kinases. The ratio of the BDNF receptor trkB to the
   NT3 receptor trkC reverses from 5:1 in neonatal cerebellum to 1:3 in
   adult cerebellum.
   TrkB and TrkC are closely related transmembrane tyrosine protein
   kinases. However, activation of BDNF and NT3 receptors in cerebellar
   granule neurons do not give equivalent biological responses. In
   aggregate cell culture and single cell assays, BDNF enhances axonal
   outgrowth of early granule cells by influencing neurite elongation. In
   contrast, NT3 alters the morphology of outgrowth. Collectively, these
   findings suggest that regulation of neurotrophin receptors during
   cerebellar development is important for the timing and morphology of
   axonal growth.}},

Abstract = {{An outbreak of acute febrile illness with haemorrhagic manifestations
   and pulmonary involvement occurred in Diglipur of North Andaman during
   October-November 1993. Investigations were carried out to see whether
   leptospires were responsible for this outbreak. Serum samples were
   collected from suspected cases and tested for presence of antibodies to
   leptospires by microscopic agglutination test (MAT) using a battery of
   19 antigens representing 16 serogroups. 66.7 per cent of the specimens
   showed significant titres of antibodies against leptospires, 18 of 23
   paired sera (78.3\%) showed sero-conversion or four-fold rise in
   antibody titres. The commonest serovar involved was Leptospira
   grippotyphosa followed by L. canicola and L. JEZ bratislava. In 7
   patients L. grippotyphosa was the sole serovar against which antibodies
   were detected. Clinical and epidemiological observations of this
   outbreak were similar with that of earlier seasonal outbreaks of acute
   febrile illness with haemorrhagic manifestations occurring in the same
   area, indicating that the past outbreaks may also have been due to
   leptospires. This is the first report of pulmonary leptospirosis from

Abstract = {{To better understand the accelerated decay of fatty acid synthase (FAS)
   message that occurs after glucose deprivation (J. Biol. Chem. 1993. 268:
   6961-6970), we characterized the 3' terminus of the human message and
   the kinetics of FAS mRNA decay in HepG2 cells. The FAS gene was
   localized to human chromosome 17q24-25 and to syntenic distal mouse
   chromosome 11. Expression of the FAS message in human tissues was
   ubiquitous with high levels in liver, lung, and intra-abdominal adipose
   tissue. The 806 nucleotide 3' untranslated region of the human mRNA
   contained two regions with the instability pentamer AUUUA. Unlike
   shortlived messages containing AUUUA motifs, FAS mRNA decay after
   glucose deprivation was not first order, and there were no detectable
   changes in the poly(A) tail. Glucose deprivation transiently caused FAS
   message to sediment more rapidly than control message in density
   gradients. In vivo treatment with different translational inhibitors
   showed that translation per se was not necessary for FAS mRNA decay;
   association of polysomes with FAS message protected it from decay. In
   cell-free decay experiments, FAS mRNA decay was more rapid using
   components from glucose-deprived than glucose-treated cells. These data
   suggest that glucose regulates cytoplasmic HepG2 FAS mRNA stability by
   partitioning the message between a translated pool not subject to
   degradation and a decay compartment, features reminiscent of regulated
   stability for other diet-responsive messages.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates how the movement zones of all the ants in a
   colony are organized inside the nest. The workers in nine colonies of
   the ant Leptothorax unifasciatus (Latr.) were marked individually and
   their positions in the nest were recorded over 33 periods of observation
   spread throughout the year. Results from randomization tests
   demonstrated that the individual workers in L. unifasciatus colonies had
   movement zones of limited area. These are termed spatial fidelity zones
   (SFZs). SFZs were specific to individuals. They occurred with partial
   overlap, in a sequence from the colony centre to the colony periphery.
   The size of SFZs increased from the centre of the colony towards the
   periphery. The median size of SFZ in a colony varied with the time of
   year; they expanded gradually after hibernation with a peak in May and
   then contracted gradually until the following hibernation. The frequency
   of a worker's brood care behaviour was related to the amount of overlap
   between her SFZ and the spatial distribution of the brood. Individuals
   on the periphery of the colony were most likely to leave the nest. No
   clear segregation on the basis of age was observed. The division of
   labour in L. unifasciatus was flexibly organized along the continuum of
   SFZs where each worker performed the tasks within her spatial fidelity
   zone. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour}},

Abstract = {{Efficient heuristic algorithms are developed for the buffer allocation
   in a production line so as to maximize the throughput. We focus on the
   unbalanced production line in which the mean processing time of each
   machine is not identical. The optimal buffer allocation problem is
   formulated as a multi-dimensional non-linear search problem with a
   linear resource constraint such that total capacity available is finite.
   The concept of standard and non-standard exchange vectors are introduced
   to develop two different versions of the algorithm. Since the objective
   function representing the throughput is not differentiable, we suggest
   the pseudo-gradient for obtaining improving directions. Numerical
   experiments show that the proposed algorithms work well even for the
   larger problems that could not have been handled as yet.}},

Title = {{THE OSMOTIC RESPONSE OF THE ISOLATED, UNFIXED MOUSE TECTORIAL MEMBRANE

Journal = {{HEARING RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{187-207}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Changes in the size, shape, and structure of the isolated tectorial
   membrane (TM) of the mouse were measured in response to isosmotic
   changes in the ionic composition of the bathing solution. Substitution
   of artificial perilymph (AP) for artificial endolymph (AE) caused a
   small(approximate to 1\%) shrinkage of the TM's thickness. This
   substitution alters not only the predominate cation (from K+ to Na+) but
   also the Ca2+ concentration(from 20 mu mol/l to 2 mmol/l). When the
   predominate cation was changed from K+ to Na+, while holding Ca2+
   concentration constant, results depended on Ca2+ concentration: there
   was a small(approximate to 1\%) swelling for 20 mu mol/l Ca2+, larger
   (approximate to 14\%) swelling for lower (< 7 mu mol/l) concentrations
   of Ca2+, and little response for 2 mmol/l Ca2+ or for solutions
   containing the Ca2+ chelator EGTA. Addition of Ca2+ while holding the
   predominate cation constant caused shrinkage of the TM; both removal of
   Ca2+ and addition of the Ca2+ chelator EGTA caused swelling. Swelling
   responses were largely reversible if the magnitude of the swelling was
   small. Responses greater than a few percent were only partially
   reversible and caused long-lasting changes.
   Changes in ionic composition of the bath affected not only the thickness
   of the TM but also its other dimensions. Solution changes that increase
   TM thickness tend to cause radial shearing motions of the surfaces of
   the TM, which are accompanied by small decreases in width. Little change
   in length was observed. Although the responses were non-isotropic,
   increases in thickness were highly correlated with increases in volume.
   Swelling of the TM was also accompanied by a reduction in prominence of
   its radially oriented fibrillar structure.
   These results for the isolated TM of the mouse are qualitatively similar
   to those obtained previously for the isolated chick TM (Freeman et al.,
   1994) but different from those obtained for the in vitro mouse TM
   (Kronester-Frei, 1979a).}},

   conduction mechanism is likely to dominate. At low temperatures the
   capacitance of the Au-CIAIPc-Au device is temperature-insensitive and

   forging tests conducted in a manufacturing environment to verify and

   mode II elastic-plastic fracture toughness of steels. J(II)-integral
   expression of the specimen was calibrated by finite element method. Both
   the microshear and four point bend specimen tests were conducted on
   structural steels with both L-T and T-L orientations.
   The results indicate that there is an excellent correlation between the
   microshear toughness and mode II fracture toughness. The basis of the
   correlation is because there exists the same stress triaxiality ahead of
   the crack tip and the same fracture mechanisms between the microshear
   and asymmetrical four point bend specimens. Therefore, the microshear
   test may be successfully used to predict the mode II elastic-plastic
   fracture toughness, and the microshear test is very simple and

   Couette flows. Shears of 0.1-10 s(-1) (corresponding to moderate to
   extremely strong marine and estuarine turbulence) enhanced clearance
   rates by the aloricate choanoflagellate, Monosiga sp., up to 2.7x the
   mean rate in still water. Shears of 1-10 s(-1) enhanced clearance rates
   by the helioflagellate, Ciliophrys marina, up to 7.0x the mean in still
   water. The data are consistent with a sigmoidal response to increasing
   shear rate. In contrast, clearance rates of the tintinnid,
   Helicostomella sp., were suppressed at 10 s(-1) to as low as 0.42x the
   still-water rate. Several other flagellates and ciliates (Paraphysomonas
   sp., two unidentified chrysomonads, Diaphanoeca grandis, Favella sp.,
   and an unidentified heterotrich) showed no significant effects. We
   hypothesize that the protozoa most susceptible to an influence of
   turbulence are nonmotile (e.g. Heliozoa, Foraminifera, Radiolaria) or
   are weak swimmers (e.g. some flagellates and ciliates). Current methods
   for measuring feeding rates in still-water incubations may underestimate
   grazing by these taxa under strong turbulence in the field. Through
   species-specific influences on feeding rates, spatial and temporal
   variations in turbulence may have very selective effects on microbial
   food-web dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of an artificial neural network derived from a biological
   system, and its two applications to engineering problems are examined.
   The model has a multi-layer structure simulating the primary and
   secondary components in the olfactory system. The basic element in each
   layer is an oscillator which simulates the interactions between
   excitatory and inhibitory local neuron populations. Chaotic dynamics
   emerges from interactions within and between the layers, which are
   connected to each other by feedforward and feedback lines with
   distributed delays. A set of electroencephalogram (EEG) obtained from
   mammalian olfactory system yields aperiodic oscillation with 1/f
   characteristics in its FFT power spectrum. The EEG also reveals abrupt
   state transitions between a basal and an activated state. The activated
   state with each inhalation consists of a burst of oscillation at a
   common time-varying instantaneous frequency that is spatially
   amplitude-modulated (AM). The spatial pattern of the activated state
   seems to represent the class of the input to the system, which simulates
   the input from sensory receptors. The KIII model of the olfactory system
   yields sustained aperiodic oscillation with `'1/f'' spec trum by
   adjustment of its parameters. Input in the form of a spatially
   distributed step function induces a state transition to an activated
   state. This property gives the model its utility in pattern
   classification. Four different methods (SD, RMS, PCA and FFT) were
   applied to extract AM patterns of the common output wave forms of the
   model. The pattern classification capability of the model was evaluated,
   and synchronization of the output wave form was shown to be crucial in
   PCA and FFT methods. This synchronization has also been suggested to
   have an important role in biological systems related to tile information
   extraction by spatiotemporal integration of the output of a transmitting
   area of cortex by a receiving area.}},

Abstract = {{Although the pathogenicity of Blastocystis hominis has been extensively
   debated in the medical literature, controlled studies of the association
   between B. hominis and diarrhea are lacking. We conducted a case-control
   study among expatriates and tourists in Kathmandu, Nepal, in which we
   compared the prevalence of the organism among patients with diarrhea to
   that among a control group without diarrhea. B. hominis was detected in
   56 (30\%) of 189 patients with diarrhea, compared with 40 (36\%) of 112
   asymptomatic controls. Patients with diarrhea were significantly more
   likely to have greater than or equal to 10 B. hominis organisms per
   high-power (400x) field than were controls. However, among the 25
   patients with this concentration of organisms, other enteric pathogens
   were detected in 17 (68\%). Only 8 (4\%) of 189 patients with diarrhea
   had greater than or equal to 10 B. hominis organisms per high-power
   field detected in the absence of other pathogens, compared with 5 (5\%)
   of 112 asymptomatic controls. Thus, B. hominis in higher concentrations
   was not associated with diarrhea. There were no specific symptoms
   associated with B. hominis infection, and the presence of higher
   concentrations of the organism in stool was not associated with
   more-severe symptoms. Despite the high prevalence of the organism among
   travelers and expatriates in Nepal, the results of this study suggest
   that B. hominis does not cause diarrhea in this population.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to investigate basic parameters regarding
   the postnatal effects of prenatal exposure to cocaine. Timed-pregnant
   Wistar rats were injected SC with 60 mg/kg body weight/day of cocaine
   from gestational day 8 to 22. Control females were nonmanipulated and
   given food ad lib; saline females received saline injections and
   pair-fed received saline and were nutritionally controlled to the
   cocaine-treated rats. Litters were restricted to 8 pups, weighed every
   other day until postnatal day (PND) 30 and every week from PND 30 to PND
   90. The rats were perfused at PND 14, 30, and 90. The adequacy of
   adjustment of the logistic and Gompertz models to the body weights of
   the offspring was tested for the whole experimental period. The results
   from the Gompertz curve showed a higher growth rate and less time to
   reach 37\% of expected mature body mass for the offspring of cocaine and
   pair-fed dams as compared with that of control and saline dams. No
   significant differences in the estimated adult weight were found among
   the experimental groups. The allometric relationship between forebrain
   and body weight is described by two postnatal growth phases with a first
   phase of rapid growth between PND 14 and 30 and a decelerating phase
   between PND 30 and 90. This relationship was not different among the
   experimental groups; however, the cocaine and pair-fed offspring showed
   a constant deficit in the forebrain weight as compared with the control
   and saline offspring. An analogous two- phase allometric relationship
   was found between cerebellum and body weight in the control and saline
   groups in contrast with a single phase for the cocaine and pair-fed
   groups. The low weight of the cerebellum until PND 30 in cocaine or
   pair-fed offspring is subsequently compensated by sustaining the high
   early relative growth between PND 30 and 90. These effects of prenatal
   cocaine exposure on growth patterns are not different from those
   detected in the offspring of pair-fed dams, suggesting effects on food
   intake rather than a direct drug effect. This longitudinal data analysis
   is of considerable value in the assessment of the effects of drug
   exposure on body and brain weights, suggesting a possible technique for
   further evaluation of the developmental processes of the central nervous
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Two samples of fly ash were treated for 2-48 h in 3.5 M NaOH at 100

   the treatment from the glassy part of fly ash, while quartz gradually
   dissolved and mullite remained stable. Approximately 50\% of fly ash
   could be converted to zeolites with the CEC of resulting products
   reaching 2.5-3 mequiv/g. Concentrations of extractable B, Mo, and Se in
   fly ash considerably decreased upon treatment. Adsorption isotherms of
   lead on treated fly ash suggested that at low initial lead
   concentrations and at pH lower than 6 precipitation of lead compounds is
   not likely. A desorption experiment indicated ii incomplete
   reversibility at higher concentrations, suggesting that part of the
   adsorption may not have been cation exchange related. Treated fly ash
   displayed high selectivity for Pb2+ > Sr2+ > CU2+ > Cd2+ > Zn2+ > Cs+ in
   competition with Na+, especially at low concentrations of these cations,
   and was effective in removing Pb and Zn from industrial wastewaters. It

Abstract = {{Study objective: it is often taught that acetaminophen-induced liver
   dysfunction occurs only after a latent period of 24 to 48 hours. This
   study was designed to evaluate the temporal profile of transaminase
   levels in patients with acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity.
   Design: Prospective data collection using standard poison control center
   data sheets.
   Participants: Hospitalized patients with acetaminophen exposure who were
   reported to the long Island Poison Control Center between January 1993
   and June 1994. Patients who presented within 24 hours of ingestion and
   in whom increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels developed
   during hospitalization were included in the data analysis. Patients who
   presented more than 24 hours after ingestion, who had ingested another
   potentially hepatotoxic agent, or who had ingested acetaminophen over a
   period of more than 2 hours were excluded.
   Results: Of 1,825 patients with reported acetaminophen exposure, 779 had
   potentially toxic ingestions and were examined in an emergency
   department. Of 291 patients with toxic acetaminophen levels who were
   admitted, 36 (12\%) had increased levels of AST at some point during
   hospitalization. All received oral N-acetylcysteine within 2.5 hours of
   presentation. In 11 of 19 patients who met all inclusion criteria
   (58\%), AST levels were noted to be increased in the 24 hours after
   ingestion. The median peak AST level was 422 IU/L (range, 74 to 8,538
   IU/L). AST levels peaked within 48 hours in 4 patients (21 \%) and
   within 72 hours in 18 patients (95\%). Six of eight patients with peak
   AST levels greater than 1,000 IU/L had increased transaminase levels
   during the 24 hours after acetaminophen ingestion.
   Conclusion: Acetaminophen poisoning may cause the serum transaminase
   level to increase during the 24 hours after ingestion.}},

Abstract = {{Six genotypes (PGG-1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8) of Guinea grass {[}Panicum
   maximum (Jacq.) L.] were compared regarding the impact of cutting
   frequency on the yield-quality relationship, in a humid subtropical
   environment, to determine the extent of the variation that occurs
   between genotypes and to identify morphological attributes closely
   associated with forage yield and quality. The genotypes fell into two
   groups on the basis of their dry matter (DM) production and
   digestibility. High-yielding lines (PGG-1, PGG-4, and PGG-8) were able
   to build up a higher leaf area index (>6) during a 30-day cutting
   interval than low yielders (PGG-5, PGG-6, and PGG-7) which were slower
   in replenishing their leaf canopies. Forage produced by the
   high-yielding lines had higher DM digestibilities. The morphological
   features that most closely correlated with DM yield and digestibility
   were leaf number and leaf area expressed on a per tiller or per plant
   basis, i.e., `leafiness.' Tiller number was negatively correlated with
   yield and quality. The results suggest that measures of `leafiness' are
   very useful indicators of the yield and nutritive value of the forage
   produced by P. maximum genotypes.}},

Abstract = {{We have reviewed 44 mucinous intestinal (MI) and 10 mucinous mullerian
   (MM) tumors of low malignant potential (LMP) seen at The George
   Washington University Medical Center. As previously reported by Rutgers
   and Scully, MMLMP tumors occurred in younger women, were generally
   smaller and more frequently bilateral, had a papillary rather than
   multicystic appearance, and lacked goblet cells. All patients with MMLMP
   tumors were recurrence-free at last follow-up, including three whose
   tumors were microinvasive. Patients with MILMP tumors also all did well
   regardless of tumor grade, with the exception of a single patient with
   bilateral grade 1 ovarian tumors, an appendiceal villous adenoma, and
   pseudomyxoma peritonei. Microinvasion was also seen in four of these
   tumors, none of which recurred. Review of the literature suggests that
   MILMP tumors without stromal invasion but with either prominent cell
   stratification or marked nuclear atypia may have a worse prognosis than
   those lacking these features, but probably largely because of a
   correlation with higher stage disease. We believe that tumors of this
   sort should not be diagnosed as `'noninvasive carcinomas,'' but should
   be sectioned more extensively for evidence of stromal invasion and
   subjected to careful staging. If the tumor is still noninvasive and in
   stage I after these procedures, the likelihood of treatment failure
   appears to be in the range of 1-3\%.}},

Abstract = {{In a prospective study, 102 hospital patients with liver disease were

   patients without liver disease served as controls. A total of 757
   individuals were tested for markers of hepatitis A, B, C and D and for
   immunological markers (autoantibodies, procollagen III,
   alpha-foetoprotein, CA50 antigen, alpha-1-antitrypsin and antibodies to
   human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2). One-third of the liver
   disease patients had focal lesions on ultrasound examination.
   Histologically, 20 cases of cirrhosis, 14 cases of chronic hepatitis, 15
   hepatocellular carcinomas and 17 cases of acute hepatitis were detected.
   All hepatic patients and virtually all controls had had a previous
   hepatitis A virus infection. Over 85\% of adult patients and controls
   had at least one marker of hepatitis B virus infection. Over 30\% of
   patients with liver disease had markers of possible hepatitis B virus
   replication, Antihepatitis C virus antibody was present in 18\% of
   hepatic patients and in 6\% of controls. Hepatitis C virus infection
   seems to play an important role in the development of chronic liver
   pathology; 40\% of cirrhotic patients had a combined hepatitis B and C
   virus infection. Serum autoantibodies were frequently found and were not
   correlated with the presence of autoimmune liver disease.}},

Abstract = {{Computerized axial manometry (CAM) of the lower esophagus measures
   squeeze pressure at multiple points in each segment of the lower
   esophageal sphincter (LES), calculates several unique parameters of LES
   function, and constructs a 3-D display of the LES. Whether parameters
   derived from CAM, such as the radial mean pressure (LESrmp), Asymmetry
   (Asym), and Vector Volume (VV), have relevance to function of the LES
   remains undefined. This study compares the results of CAM in patients
   with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and controls. There were 54
   patients with GERD and 21 volunteers; all underwent CAM as part of their
   evaluation; GERD was defined by clinical and endoscopic examinations,
   and all patients had abnormal 24-hour pH tests. Statistical evaluation
   was performed. The LESrmp and the Vector Volume were significantly
   correlated in both groups of patients and differed significantly in
   both. Asymmetry of the LES was a significant negative factor in LES
   strength as shown by VV and LESrmp. Asymmetry alone, however, did not
   show a strong correlation with reflux. Asymmetry is indirectly
   correlated with the major determinants of LES strength; in patients with
   low VV, asymmetry might be a critical factor. When a high VV is present,
   asymmetry has no particular relevance. CAM provides invaluable
   measurements of the LES.}},

   of renal sympathetic nerves. Pulsatile pressures and heart rates were
   measured before and after furosemide (2 mg/kg) administration to
   chronically instrumented lambs with either bilateral renal denervation
   (denervated, n = 8) or renal nerves intact (intact, n = 6). In intact
   lambs, mean arterial pressure remained constant after furosemide; in
   denervated lambs there was an increase in arterial pressure 20 min after
   furosemide (P < 0.001), and control levels were reached by 100 min.
   Basal heart rate was higher in denervated than in intact lambs (P =
   0.009). In both groups of lambs, heart rate increased 40 min after
   furosemide and remained elevated. These data provide new information

   are extended to outer planet applications in order to develop an
   algorithm that can be used in dynamical modeling of outer planetary
   flaws. Over the temperature range between 50 K and 250 K the delayed
   conversion of ortho- hydrogen to parahydrogen can have large effects on
   stratification. One-dimensional modeling of atmospheric layers cooled
   from the top, as by radiation to space, is reported. After ortho- and
   para-hydrogen are mixed by a convective event, the ortho/para ratio
   begins to relax toward thermodynamic equilibrium. The energy release
   during relaxation drives the atmosphere toward stability. On Jupiter,
   the influence of hydrogen conversion on convection is small. On Neptune
   the energy released by hydrogen conversion is large, and it shuts off
   convection. A time dependent structure ensues, with irregular occurrence
   of mixing events associated with temperature fluctuations of 1 K or
   more. The mean thermal structure at levels where the temperature is less
   than about 250 K is significantly stable, in contrast to the predictions
   of conventional outer planet radiative-convective calculations. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{The effect of particle packing on the theology and casting behavior and
   cast cake characteristics of aqueous alumina suspensions (50 vol\%) was
   investigated using the Andreasen approach, Varied packing was produced
   by blending two starting materials that differed in average size by a
   factor of 10, Formulations closest to ideal packing lowered viscosity,
   Specifically, the lowest viscosity suspension, 196 mPa . s, was produced
   with the distribution closest to the ideal packing distribution,
   Typically, a well-dispersed suspension (characterized by low viscosity)
   casts slower than one of poorer dispersion given the same solids
   content, However, the suspension that provided the lowest viscosity cast
   at a rate of 0.41 mm(2)/s, which was the fastest rate of the compared
   formulations, Therefore, suspensions consisting of extended size
   distributions do not necessitate slow filtration rates, The colloidal
   properties of the individual starting materials, low shear rate
   theology, and mercury porosimetry were used to explain the unexpected
   casting behavior, The dispersion and structure formation within the
   suspension were investigated using electrokinetic sonic amplitude
   measurements, Mercury porosimetry characterized the from channels that
   developed in the casts, Low shear rate theology confirmed the presence
   of flocculation that was first suggested by the porosimetry results.}},

   described. Results are obtained from as-fabricated devices, devices
   annealed at temperatures of 400 degrees C, and devices for which

   significant microstructural changes which are distinct from those
   observed in devices which are annealed. TEM images of the
   metal/semiconductor contact reveal `'metal spiking'' and facetted
   structures associated with alloy interpenetration. Characterization of

Abstract = {{The tegumental cytoskeleton of Opisthorchis viverrini was observed using
   both conventional transmission electron microscopy and Triton X-100
   extraction. The cytoskeletal elements of the newly excysted juveniles,
   first-week and adult stages are composed of 2 components: firstly, the
   network of knobbed fibres designated as microtrabeculae which form the
   principal scaffold of the cytoplasm; and secondly, the microtubules. The
   microtrabeculae are more densely packed in the newly excysted juveniles
   and become less densely packed later in the first-week and adult stages.
   Generally, their compactness in the tegument of each stage is higher in
   the apical and middle zones than in the basal zone. The results from
   extraction by Triton X-100 suggest that the microtrabeculae may be
   composed, at the primary level, of thin and straight fibres, partly
   coiled up to form knobbed fibres, which are highly cross-linked at the
   secondary level. At the tertiary level, these knobbed fibres may be
   coiled up further and form closely aggregated globules that appear as
   dense dots in cross-section. Most microtubules are confined within the
   tegumental cells' processes and splay out in the basal zone of the
   tegument. In addition, there are condensed laminae of cytoplasm with
   intermittent dense plaques underlining the outer membrane, with
   microtrabecular fibres inserting into them. This organization may help
   to stabilize the outer membrane and preserve the surface contour. Along
   the inner membrane of the tegument, there are hemidesmosomes distributed
   at regular intervals, with fine fibres radiating out from them to
   intertwine with the microtrabecular network, which may help to anchor
   the tegument to the basal lamina. Spines, which exist mainly in the
   newly excysted juveniles, appear as a crystalline lattice structure
   whose bases are firmly fused to the inner membrane.}},

   degeneracy of {[}110] centers is lifted by application of(001) stress.
   The energy separation between {[}110]((90)degrees) and {[}110](45

Abstract = {{A theoretically based analytical energy-range relationship has been
   developed and calibrated against well established experimental and Monte
   Carlo calculated energy-range data. Only published experimental data
   with a clear statement of accuracy and method of evaluation have been
   used. Besides published experimental range data for different uniform
   media, new accurate experimental data on the practical range of
   high-energy electron beams in water for the energy range 10-50 MeV from
   accurately calibrated racetrack microtrons have been used. Largely due
   to the simultaneous pooling of accurate experimental and Monte Carlo
   data for different materials, the fit has resulted in an increased
   accuracy of the resultant energy-range relationship, particularly at
   high energies. Up to date Monte Carlo data from the latest versions of
   the codes ITS3 and EGS4 for absorbers of atomic numbers between four and
   92 (Be, C, H2O, PMMA, Al, Cu, Ag, Pb and U) and incident electron
   energies between 1 and 100 MeV have been used as a complement where
   experimental data are sparse or missing. The standard deviation of the
   experimental data relative to the new relation is slightly larger than
   that of the Monte Carlo data. This is partly due to the fact that
   theoretically based stopping and scattering cross-sections are used both
   to account for the material dependence of the analytical energy-range
   formula and to calculate ranges with the Monte Carlo programs. For water
   the deviation from the traditional energy-range relation of ICRU Report
   35 is only 0.5\% at 20 MeV but as high as -2.2\% at 50 MeV. An improved
   method for divergence and ionization correction in high-energy electron
   beams has also been developed to enable use of a wider range of
   experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Cells of Escherichia coli which enter a phase of starvation for P-i
   induce the synthesis of the nucleotide guanosine 3',5'-bispyrophosphate
   (ppGpp). This induction is relA independent but depends on the spoT gene
   product. A mutant unable to produce ppGpp is impaired in the expression
   of two genes which belong to the pho regulon, a defect which is
   dependent on the product of spoT. We suggest that ppGpp is essential for
   the proper induction of the genes which belong to the pho regulon.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Pollen from grasses (Poaceae) are predominant aeroallergens
   throughout the world including tropical countries. Studies from USA,
   Europe, and Australia have shown extensive allergenic/antigenic cross
   reactivity among the grass pollen allergens prevalent there. No such
   information is available about airborne grass pollens of tropical
   countries.
   Objective: The present study was undertaken to explore common
   antigenic/allergenic components, if any, of five important grass pollens
   of India.
   Methods: Intradermal tests (ID) were performed with pollen extracts of
   Cenchrus, Cynodon, Imperata, Pennisetum, and Sorghum in patients with
   nasobronchial allergy. ELISAs were performed for estimating the
   allergen-specific IgE in sera of patients eliciting markedly positive ID
   response (2+ to 4+). To detect cross reactivity, ELISA inhibition
   experiments were carried out using pooled patient sera and five grasses,
   individually, as inhibitors with different solid phase antigens. To
   evaluate common antigenic components in Cenchrus, Imperata, and
   Pennisetum pollen extracts, rocket immunoelectrophoresis (RIE) and ELISA
   inhibition were conducted using rabbit antisera.
   Results: Among 133 patients, Cynodon extract elicited markedly positive
   skin reactivity in most patients followed by Pennisetum, Imperata,
   Cenchrus, and Sorghum. A large number of patients showed markedly
   positive skin reactions and enhanced specific IgE levels to more than
   one grass pollen extract. ELISA inhibition experiments showed different
   degrees of cross reactivity among the grass pollens studied. Rocket
   immunoelectrophoresis and ELISA inhibition using rabbit antisera with
   homologous and heterologous pollen revealed the presence of shared
   antigenic components in Cenchrus, Imperata, and Pennisetum extracts.
   Conclusion: The varied dose-response curves obtained with ELISA
   inhibition using different inhibitors suggest the presence of both
   common and specific antigens/allergens in the grass pollens studied.
   Based on the extensive immunologic cross reactivity, among the tropical
   grass species, it may be possible to use mixed allergen preparations for
   allergy diagnosis and immunotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{The problem considered here is the steady, incompressible plane Stokes
   flow in a rectangular cavity generated by uniform translation of the
   upper wall. An exact analytical solution of the governing biharmonic
   equation is derived which not only contains the leading term of the
   required singularities at the upper corners, but also approximately
   satisfies the boundary conditions at all four walls. A standard
   numerical algorithm is employed to correct the small deviations in the
   boundary conditions satisfied by the analytical solution. This technique
   enables accurate computation of the solution uniformly throughout the
   domain; in particular, near the singular corners and in those regions
   where the flow is extremely weak, for example, in the secondary vortex
   regions of the deep cavity. The method is illustrated for the square
   cavity and also for a deep cavity with a depth-to-width ratio of five,
   and the results are compared with previous analytical and numerical
   solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Modulated (690 and 730 nm), as well as direct chlorophyll (Chl) a
   fluorescence and changes in the concentration of the oxidized P700 were
   measured under steady state conditions in leaves of higher plants
   adapted to different light intensities. All the leaf samples exhibit an
   optimum curve of steady state fluorescence yield (F-s) versus the light
   intensity but its position with respect to light intensity varies
   considerably from one species to another or from one sample to other
   even in the same plant or within the same leaf sample. However, the
   optimum level of F-s was always at a moderate light intensity. By using
   the modulated fluorescence technique, the system with all closed
   (F-m(1)) or open reaction center (F-o(1)) were measured in steady state
   conditions. Each experimentally measured fluorescence yield was
   separated into a fluorescence emission of open (F-open=F-o(1) .(1-V-s))
   and closed (F-closed=(F-m(1) . V-s)) reaction center (RC) of photosystem
   II where V-s=(F-s-F-o(1))/(F-m(1)-F-o(1)) is the function of fraction of
   closed reaction centers. With increasing light intensity, the fraction
   of open RC decreased while the fraction of closed RC increased. Maximum
   quantum efficiency (Phi P-o) and actual quantum efficiency (Phi P)
   decreased by increasing light intensity. An optimum level of F, was
   observed, when the fraction of closed reaction centers V-s of each
   sample was about 0.2 showing a common quenching mechanism which
   determines the fluorescence properties under steady state condition.
   This explains the apparent phenomenological contradiction that the
   fluorescence yield under steady state conditions can increase or
   decrease upon an increase of actinic light.}},

Abstract = {{Contact area and pressure between 6-hole broad dynamic compression
   plates and 20 pairs of equine third metatarsal bones were measured using
   nonluted and luted plating techniques. Pressure-sensitive film (pressure
   ranges 10 to 50 MPa and 50 to 130 MPa) was used as the static pressure
   transducer. Nonluted and one of two luting techniques were tested on
   each pair of bones; each luting technique was tested on 20 bones.
   Quantitative determinations of contact area and pressure were made using
   computerized image processing techniques. Mean (+/-SD) total contact
   area for nonluted plates was 18.49\% +/- 3.5\% of the potential
   plate-bone contact area. Luting increased (P <.05) total contact area to
   25.56\% +/- 4.0\% and 31.29\% +/- 6.6\% for the respective luting
   techniques. The effects of luting on contact area were dependent on the
   contact pressure. At contact pressure ranges 10 to 20 and 21 to 35 MPa,
   luting increased contact area. In contact pressure ranges 36 to 45 and
   50 to 65 MPa, plate-bone contact was inherently greatest and plate
   luting had no significant effect on contact area. In contact pressure
   ranges 66 to 99 and 100 to 126 MPa, luting decreased contact area.
   Contact area was increased at lower contact pressures at the expense of
   higher pressure contact. Contact in the middle third of the plate was
   20\% to 40\% of the contact at either end of the plate. Plate luting
   increased contact area best where plate-bone contour was most similar.

   analyzed at the chromosomal and the molecular level in a model of rat
   leukemic cell lines, in which AraC and DAC resistance was induced, that
   was marked by dck deficiency. At the chromosomal level, karyotype
   analysis of metaphase spreads revealed the presence of an aberrant 2q +
   chromosome in the AraC-resistant cell line and a (Xq;11q) translocation
   in its subclone RA/7. The DAC-resistant lines were identical to the
   parental RCL/O. Fluorescence in situ hybridization on normal rat
   fibroblast metaphase spreads localized the rat dck gene to chromosome
   14q21-q22, a region that was not involved in any of the observed
   karyotypic aberrations. Analysis at the molecular level revealed an
   identical rearrangement of the dck gene in the AraC-resistant cell line
   RCL/A and its subclone RA/7 that resulted in the absence of dck
   expression, as assessed by RT-PCR. No genomic rearrangements were
   observed in a DAC-resistant cell line RCL/D or in its subclone RD/1.
   However, detection of a single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP)
   allowed the identification of a single C to G substitution (His to Gln)
   in the dck cDNA of the DAC-resistant RD/1 clone. The data demonstrate
   that exposure to AraC and DAC induces a resistant phenotype marked by
   functional dck deficiency that may be the consequence of mutations
   occurring in the dck gene.}},

   allografts. Moreover, allograft rejection in the IL-2 KO mouse is
   associated with intragraft expression of certain cytokine and CTL attack
   molecule genes (e.g. IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-7, IL-10, and granzyme B). In
   separate experiments, IL-2 KO mice generated CTLs in response to in vivo
   challenge with allogeneic tumor cells. Although IL-2 KO mice reject
   allografts in vivo, spleen cells from immunologically naive IL-2 KO mice
   exhibit a diminished proliferative response to mitogens in vitro that
   could be restored largely by exogenous IL-2, IL-4, or IL-7. The
   paradoxical ability to execute graft rejection in vivo despite near
   absent T cell proliferative responses in vitro may result from the
   expression of IL-7 in vivo, but not in vitro. Con A-stimulated bulk
   spleen cell cultures derived from IL-2 KO mice were essentially devoid
   not only of IL-2 but also IL-7 gene transcripts. These data indicate
   that 1) IL-2 is not the sole T cell growth factor capable of supporting
   allograft rejection and 2) expression of IL-4, but not IL-2, during the
   allograft response does not lead inevitably to tolerance.}},

Abstract = {{In a previous study we analyzed the molecular forms of monoclonal IgA
   class-switch variants (moIgA variants) and their transport into murine
   respiratory secretions. The aim of the present study is to characterize
   the transport of moIgA variants into bile and intestinal secretions so
   that their applicability in a passive immunization model of the gut can
   be evaluated. Different moIgA variants were directly isolated from IgG1
   and IgG2a producing hybridoma clones specific for the same surface
   determinants of bacterial enteric pathogens (Salmonella typhimurium and
   Campylobacter jejuni) as their respective parent IgG clones.
   Hepatobiliary transport experiments clearly revealed the selective
   transport of biologically active polymeric forms of the IgA variants
   into the murine and rat bile after intravenous injection. Biotinylation
   of polymeric IgA variants prior to intravenous injection resulted in the
   recovery of functional, labeled SIgA. Moreover biotin-labeled polymeric
   IgA variant was recovered in bile with an increased molecular weight,
   suggesting that the secretory component had been added during passage
   through the liver. When IgA variant and IgG parent clones were both used
   in a murine backpack tumor model for passive immunization, IgA variant
   was selectively transported into intestinal secretions in comparison to
   IgG. The experimental model described here is suitable for use in
   comparative studies on the role of IgA and IgG with identical
   specificity in invasive infections of the intestinal tract.}},

   of IgG3 responses was similar for the PI and INF groups. The frequency
   distributions for IgG1, IgG4 and IgE were significantly different

Abstract = {{In this paper a CMOS alternative amplitude detection system is
   presented, It is designed as an alternative for the, bipolar, amplitude
   detection in hard disk servo systems, The amplitude is detected by
   converting the input voltage to a current, rectifying the current, and
   integrating it on a capacitor, For this a new OTA topology and a
   rectifier cell are designed, This circuitry is expanded with a very
   linear current mirror and an automatic offset compensation system to
   cope with technology spread, The measured accuracy of the amplitude
   detector is 0.2\% (9 b), This makes the circuit suitable for
   implementation in state-of-the art hard disk systems with very high
   track densities and very short access times, Because the circuit is
   realized in standard CMOS its a further step toward CMOS only hard disk
   electronics, Because the circuit operates from a single 3 V power supply
   and has limited power consumption it can be used in battery powered
   systems.}},

   lifetime from ortho-positronium (o-Ps) pickoff annihilation. The o-Ps
   component disappears for samples, recrystallized at 700 degrees C and

   temperature until a value of 310 ps is reached for the layer annealed at

Abstract = {{Solving large systems of equations from CFD problems by the explicit
   pseudo-temporal scheme requires a very low amount of memory and is
   highly parallelizable, but the CPU time largely depends on the
   conditioning of the system. For advective systems it is shown that the
   rate of convergence depends on a condition number defined as the ratio
   of the maximum and the minimum group velocities of the continuum system.
   If the objective is to reach the steady state, the temporal term can be
   modified in order to reduce this condition number. Another possibility
   consists in the addition of a local preconditioning mass matrix. In this
   paper an optimal preconditioning for incompressible flow is presented,
   also applicable to compressible ones with locally incompressible zones,
   like stagnation points, in contrast with the artificial compressibility
   method. The preconditioned system has a rate of convergence independent
   from Mach number. Moreover, the discrete solution is highly improved,
   eliminating spurious oscillations frequently encountered in
   incompressible flows.}},

Abstract = {{Concerning the often discussed `chloride error' in AOX determination, a
   method is described wich allows the determination of the group parameter
   organic halogen compounds (OX) for chloride concentrations more than 1
   g/L. In opposite to the standard method DIN 38409 part 14, no chloride
   influence up to a concentration of 10 g/L in real water samples occurs.
   The basis of the method is the adsorption of the organic compounds from
   the water sample on XAD-4 resin, a nonpolar copolymer of styrene and
   divinylbenzene. The organic compounds are concentrated on the XAD-4
   resin conditioned with methanol. After the enrichment step, the
   adsorption columns are treated with sodium nitrate solution. Model
   experiments with p-chlorophenol and chloride concentrations of 50 g/L
   showed the effectiveness of this method. The loaded and washed
   adsorption columns are first eluated with acetone and then with ethyl
   acetate. Quantification of the OX compounds in the eluates is carried
   out by microcoulometric detection after combustion in a furnace equipped
   with a special injector for eluates. For optimal work, the instrument
   was modified and improved. The presented method was developed on model
   samples and tested on different real samples.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: Certain gut peptides exert gastroprotective effects.
   However, the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. This study
   examines the contribution of afferent neurons, calcitonin gene-related
   peptide, and nitric oxide to the protection conferred by gastrin 17 in
   the rat stomach. Methods: Gastroprotection by gastrin 17 against
   ethanol-induced gross and histological damage was studied after
   capsaicin-induced defunctionalization of afferent neurons, pretreatment
   with the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist human
   calcitonin gene-related peptide(8-37), anti-calcitonin gene-related
   peptide antibodies, and the NO synthase inhibitor N-G-nitro-L-arginine.
   Results: Gastrin 17 (1-25 pmol/kg) dose-dependently prevented mucosal
   damage caused by ethanol. Protection was inhibited by functional
   ablation of afferent neurons or pretreatment with human calcitonin
   gene-related peptide(8-37) (50\% inhibitory dose, 86 pmol . kg(-1).
   min(-1)), anticalcitonin gene-related peptide antibodies, or
   N-G-nitvo-L-arginine (50\% inhibitory dose, 1 mg/kg). L-Arginine but not
   D-arginine reversed the effect of N-G-nitro-L-arginine. Effects on gross
   damage were paralleled by histology. Protective doses of gastrin 17
   increased gastric mucosal blood flow and, in addition, elevated plasma
   gastrin concentrations to the same extent as intragastric peptone
   perfusion. Conclusions: Gastrin 17 has potent gastroprotective activity
   that involves afferent neurons, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and NO.}},

Abstract = {{A newly recognized type of familial glomerulopathy observed in patients
   of both sexes in six families is reported. Proteinuria, often within the
   nephrotic range, microscopic hematuria, hypertension and a slowly
   decreasing renal function over several years were common. No underlying
   systemic diseases were identified. Generally, light microscopy showed
   enlarged glomeruli with minimal hypercellularity and with extensive
   deposits in the mesangium and subendothelial space. By electron
   microscopy, granular deposits with some admixture of fibrils were most
   common. In one family, the deposits were predominantly fibrillary.
   Immunoglobulins and complement factors were inconstant or lacking. A
   main finding was a strong immune reactivity to fibronectin,
   corresponding to the distribution of the deposits. In one patient, the
   deposits recurred in a renal transplant. There was no indication of
   systemic deposition. Abnormalities in the metabolism of circulating
   fibronectin may play a pathogenetic role in this disease of probably
   autosomal dominant inheritance.}},

Abstract = {{The Bermuda tide gauge record extends back to the early 1930s. That sea
   level fluctuations there are highly coherent with dynamic height from
   hydrographic data has two interesting implications. First, it should
   contain information about the low-frequency circulation of the Atlantic.
   Furthermore, because dynamic height contains information on heat
   storage, it might, on the limited timescales accessible in the record,
   also contain clues about climate.
   A simple model of wind forcing of the Atlantic from the African coast to
   Bermuda uses the Levitus mean density data to estimate the long Rossby
   wave speed as a function of longitude. Sea Level and thermocline
   variability estimated this way are in remarkably good agreement with
   observations at periods of more than a few years duration. The
   peak-to-peak sea level signal is similar to 18 cm, which is nearly 25\%
   of the slope across the Gulf Stream at this latitude. The model results
   suggest that the variability is largest somewhat to the east of Bermuda;
   fluctuations of similar to 10 cm extend as far east as similar to 35
   degrees W.
   One surprising result is that at the longest periods in the GOADS data,
   the wind curl has a double-peak structure in longitude. That is, there
   is a significant amount of power on the eastern side of the ocean as
   well as near Bermuda. Therefore, it is essential to use the full
   horizontal resolution of the wind data; using the mean curl across the
   Atlantic turns out not to be a good way to estimate thermocline
   variability. One might wonder if the wind data are reliable at these
   long periods were it not for the good agreement between the results and
   observed sea level. The power in wind variability increases out to
   similar to 500 months, although with little statistical reliability. Sea
   level variability however, appears to peak at somewhat shorter periods.
   Although it is pushing the resolution of the data, this result is a
   limitation imposed by the basin width scale. The power in the model
   ocean's response to wind forcing is nearly an order of magnitude larger
   during the first half of the record (1952-69) than during the second
   (1970-86).
   It is likely that significant changes in buoyancy forcing by the
   atmosphere are coherent with changes in wind. Nevertheless,these results
   suggest that the variability in sea level-and so in deep temperature-can
   perhaps be accounted for without invoking changes in stored heat of the
   deep ocean.}},

   There was a higher diaphyseal blood flow, measured with a microsphere
   technique, in the legs filled with MMA-DMA-IBMA than in those filled
   with PMMA. The wax-filled bones presented higher blood perfusion than
   those with MMA-DMA-IBMA. We found a tendency towards higher

   and autoradiograms revealed a tendency towards larger subperiosteal
   apposition and more blackening, both at the subperiosteal apposition and
   the cortex, in the bones filled with new bone cement in the first
   series, but in wax-filled bone in the second series. it is concluded
   that the new bone cement, compared to standard acrylic bone cement,

   less, making earlier remodelling possible. However, the new bone cement

   years of age. Although stroke, brain tumors, and metabolic disorders are
   common causes of seizures, etiology may not be clinically obvious in up
   to one-third of elderly patients with new onset. Status epilepticus is
   common in the elderly and appears to carry high mortality. Significant
   changes in drug handling and disposition occur with aging, but
   information for individual anticonvulsants is limited. However,
   available evidence suggests that elderly patients may be effectively
   treated with 20 to 30\% lower doses than those commonly used in younger
   adults, which may be due to alterations in drug metabolism in the older
   patient. Many aspects of epilepsy in the elderly remain unexplored,

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the sensitivity and specificity of several
   urodynamic testing methods in the diagnosis of genuine stress urinary
   incontinence (GSI).
   Methods: One hundred eight consecutive patients were evaluated
   prospectively by history and physical examination, cough stress test,
   and single and multichannel urodynamics. Sensitivities and specificities
   in detecting genuine stress incontinence were calculated for: a positive
   cough stress test with a negative cystometrogram, equalization
   throughout a cough urethral pressure profile, a positive stress
   leak-point pressure determination, observed urine loss with cough during
   multichannel urodynamics, and a pressure transmission ratio of less than
   90\% for each third of the urethra.
   Results: Sixty-five patients (60\%) were found to have GSI. Observed
   urine loss with cough during multichannel studies was 91\% sensitive and
   100\% specific. A positive stress leak-point pressure determination had
   a 78\% sensitivity and was 100\% specific. A positive cough stress test
   with a negative cystometrogram was 77\% sensitive and 100\% specific.
   Pressure equalization throughout the length of the urethra during a
   cough urethral pressure profile was 49\% sensitive and 98\% specific. A
   pressure transmission ratio of less than 90\% in the distal, middle, and
   proximal urethra had sensitivities and specificities of 54 and 79\%, 51
   and 65\%, and 45 and 58\%, respectively. A pressure transmission ratio
   of less than 90\% along the entire length of the urethra was 22\%
   sensitive and 93\% specific.
   Conclusion: Observed urine loss with cough during multichannel
   urodynamics was the best examination for diagnosing GSI in our
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Transformation in follicular lymphoma represents an abrupt transition in
   tumor biology. The protein product of the bcl-2 oncogene is
   overexpressed in most follicular lymphomas and inhibits apoptosis. The
   protein product of the p53 oncogene prevents cell proliferation and
   induces apoptosis and is overexpressed in the dysfunctional (mutated)
   form. We studied 15 transformed lymphomas (large cell type), 7
   follicular lymphomas before transformation and 2 control groups of
   follicular center cell lymphomas with no evidence of transformation (9
   small cleaved cell and 10 de novo large cell lymphomas). High p53
   expression (greater than or equal to 45\% cells) was detected by
   immunostaining in 9/15 transformed lymphomas as compared with 0/10 de
   novo large cell lymphomas and 1/7 follicular lymphomas. Overexpression
   of bcl-2 (greater than or equal to 50\% cells) was similar in
   transformed (11/15) and de novo large cell lymphomas (6/10). The
   apoptotic index was high (greater than or equal to 2\%) in all
   transformed and large cell lymphomas and low in all follicular lymphomas
   and in the control group of small cleaved cell lymphomas. The apoptotic
   index in the transformed lymphomas appeared to be independent of bcl-2
   expression and was sometimes paradoxically high in the presence of both
   p53 and bcl-2 overexpression. The apoptotic index was weakly associated
   with bcl-2 expression in de novo large cell lymphomas. Expression of p53
   did not correlate with proliferation index. Our results indicate that
   p53 overexpression is a specific step associated with transformation and
   may occur shortly before if. This is not seen in de novo large cell
   lymphoma. Furthermore, the high apoptotic index in transformed lymphomas
   often occurs despite overexpression of bcl-2 and p53, implying that
   other factors may induce apoptosis in these tumors.}},

Abstract = {{Whether there is a sexual difference in phenotypic variance has been the
   subject of theoretical and empirical studies. The presence of such a
   difference is integral to some models on the evolution of sexual
   dimorphism. Several studies report that males are more variable than
   females for nonpelvic measures. This study tests for a sexual difference
   in variability of the pelvis. Phenotypic variance is a correlate of both
   the intensity and mode of selection. In both sexes, the pelvis is
   subject primarily to stabilizing selection. However, selection intensity
   is greater among females than among males because only among females
   does the pelvis function as a birth canal and, thereby, serve as a
   proximate cause of death. As selection intensity and phenotypic
   variability are inversely related under stabilizing selection, the
   implication is that females should be less variable than males in pelvic
   size and shape. However, the results of previous studies on this issue
   are equivocal or contradictory. This study compares the sexes for
   differences in pelvic variability by analyzing nine species (and ten
   samples) of nonhuman anthropoids. Data were collected on 16 measures of
   the pelvis; only adults were used. Levene's univariate and multivariate
   tests for relative variation were used in the analysis. The results show
   that the sexes do not differ significantly in pelvic variability either
   within or among the nine samples of noncaptive anthropoids. Only in the
   one sample of captive specimens (Saimiri sciureus) do the sexes differ
   significantly in pelvic variability, with males being more variable than
   females. Two interpretations are derived from these results. First, the
   sexual difference in variability in captive Saimiri may be due either to
   a bias in the selection of Saimiri specimens by the
   captors/experimentors or to a sexual difference in growth associated
   with the stress of captivity. Second, the sexes do not differ in pelvic
   variability among noncaptive anthropoids because the anlage of the
   pelvis is bipotential in development. The intrinsic (i.e., agonadal)
   pattern of growth and development is that characteristic of a female.
   Testicular androgens are requisite to redirect the pattern of growth and
   development to that characteristic of a male. However, the redirected
   pattern of growth in males simply shifts en masse the intrinsic (i.e.,
   female) distribution curve. The consequence among adults is sexual
   dimorphism in pelvic size, but sexual equivalency in relative pelvic
   variability. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of femoral marrow in 85
   untreated adult patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (N = 27),
   aplastic anemia (N = 9), and leukemia (N = 49). Images of femoral marrow
   were obtained using a T1-weighted spin-echo (SE) method and a short TI
   inversion recovery (STIR) technique. In patients with MDS, the change in
   MRI pattern from a fatty or nodular pattern to a uniform pattern
   correlated with disease progression. Evolution to acute leukemia in MDS
   patients was associated with a higher signal intensity on STIR images
   (lower signal intensity on T1-weighted SE images) and an extended area
   of involvement. The femoral marrow in patients with de novo acute
   myeloid leukemia (AML) showed increased signal and varied patterns
   (scattered to uniform) on STIR images. However, the faint pattern (grade
   4a) was characteristic of M2 AML. In patients with chronic myelogenous
   leukemia (CML) in the chronic phase, increased leukemic mass was
   represented by replacement of the femoral marrow with a region of
   abnormal signal intensity. The extent of involved areas in these CML
   patients correlated with the spleen size, This study indicates that MRI
   of femoral marrow is an important tool for the accurate diagnosis and
   management of patients with MDS and leukemia that may function as an
   adjunct to bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. (C) 1995 by The American

   antibody (HCVAb)-positive (the C-HCC group), who had undergone hepatic
   resection fi om 1989 to 1993, were compared. The mean age of the
   patients in the C-HCC group was higher than that in the B-HCC group
   (61.7 years vs. 57.0 years, P < .05). The C-HCC group demonstrated both
   a greater decrease in liver function and a larger enhancement of
   inflammatory changes in the liver under a pathological examination (the
   current rate of active hepatitis: 69\% vs. 27\%, P < .001). There was
   also a higher incidence of total postoperative complications in the
   C-HCC group (60\% vs. 37\%, P < .05); however, regarding each individual
   complication, the rate was similar between the two groups. Two of the
   six patients with postoperative hepatic failure in the C-HCC group died.
   The mortality rate in the C-HCC group was 2\%, but no operative death
   was encountered in the B-HCC group. The crude survival and the
   disease-free survival rates at 5 years were similar, 61.8\% and 46.2\%
   in the B-HCC group and 52.8\% and 23.2\% in the C-HCC group,
   respectively. The patterns of recurrence were also similar in both
   groups. The pathological features of HCC were similar between the two
   groups. In conclusion, the surgical results between the two groups were
   almost identical. However, because of the reduced liver function along
   with the enhancement of inflammatory changes in the liver, surgeons
   should therefore be more careful when determining operative indications
   and conducting the follow-up after surgery, especially for the C-HCC
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{Previously, we reported an effective chemotherapeutic combination
   regimen for non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC): cisplatinum,
   doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, CCNU, and vincristine (PACCO).
   Forty-one patients with a diagnosis of NSCLC Stages III-A and III-B were
   entered into the protocol of neoadjuvant PACCO chemotherapy. Following
   two courses of chemotherapy, the patients were evaluated for surgical
   therapy. The overall response rate to the chemotherapy was 60\%.
   Subsequently, 65\% of the patients underwent surgical resection. The
   overall estimated median survival was 18 months. The survival of
   patients in III-A was 36 months and that of III-B was 18 months (95\%
   confidence lower bounds for III-A: 8 months and for III-B: 13 months).
   There was one chemotherapy-related mortality but no surgical mortality.
   Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with PACCO regiment offers an alternative to
   chemoradiation therapy, without increasing the surgical mortality, and
   should be validated in a randomized clinical trial. For successful
   neoadjuvant chemotherapy of Stage III NSCLC, chemotherapy combination
   which would give a high response rate without significant side effects
   must be chosen. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{A new trigonal crystal form of photolyase from the cyanobacterium
   Anacystis nidulans has been obtained by the addition of
   ethylenediaminetetraacetate to the crystallization condition previously

   that is grown as assemblies of small single crystals, isolated large
   single crystals were obtained for the present trigonal form, thus
   providing a regular supply of crystals for X-ray diffraction work. The
   new form of crystal belongs to the space group P3(1)21 or P3(2)21 with
   unit cell dimensions of a = b = 146 Angstrom and c = 134 Angstrom.
   Assuming that the asymmetric unit contains two or three molecules, the
   V-m value is calculated as 3.9 or 2.6 Angstrom(3)/Da, respectively. The
   present crystals diffract X-ray beyond 3.0 Angstrom resolution with
   synchrotron radiation and were stable toward X-ray exposure. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{Aminotriazole (AT), a catalase inhibitor, was administered to UChA (low

   and solid food intake were measured during basic, treatment, and
   posttreatment periods. The effects of AT on brain catalase activity and
   acetaldehyde recovered during incubation of brain homogenates with
   ethanol were also studied in rats of both strains. Results showed that
   AT decreased voluntary ethanol intake in UChB rats, and also diminished
   the consumption of food by rats of both strains. No strain difference in
   brain catalase activity and acetaldehyde recovered during ethanol
   incubation was observed. The results suggest that AT effect on ethanol
   consumption is secondary to a reduction in the appetite for calories and
   not related to its catalase blocking effect.}},

Abstract = {{The water relations of shoots of young jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.)
   seedlings were examined 6 and 15 weeks after the initiation of four
   different dynamic nitrogen (N) treatments using a pressure-volume
   analysis, The N treatments produced a wide range of needle N
   concentrations from 12 to 32 mg g(-1) dry mass and a 10-fold difference
   in total dry mass at 15 weeks, Osmotic potential at full turgor did not
   change over the range of needle N concentrations observed. Osmotic
   potential at turgor-loss point, however, declined as N concentrations
   decreased, indicating an increased ability of N-deficient jack pine
   plants to maintain turgor, The increase could be attributed largely to
   an increase in cell wall elasticity, suggesting that elasticity changes
   may be a common, significant adaptation of plants to environmental
   stresses, Dry mass per unit saturated water almost doubled as needle N
   level dropped from 32 to 12 mg gl, and was inversely correlated to the
   bulk modulus of elasticity. This suggests that cell wall elasticity is
   determined more by the nature of its cross-linking matrix than by the
   total amount of cell wall material present, Developmental change was
   evident in the response of some water relation variables to N
   limitation.}},

   challenging computational problems. Typically forward simulation is well

   synthesizing motions consistent both with physical law and with the
   animator's requirements-is generally tedious and sometimes intractable.
   We show how N-body inverse problems can be formulated as optimization
   tasks, We present a simply stated, but combinatorially formidable
   example that exhibits all of the essential sources of complexity common
   to N-body motion synthesis, and show how it can be solved approximately
   using heuristic methods based on evolutionary computation.}},

   euclidean space. We generalize this notation to r-rigidity of
   higher-dimensional simplicial complexes, again realized in d-dimensional
   space. Roughly speaking, r-rigidity means lack of non-trivial r-motion,
   and an r-motion amounts to assigning a velocity vector to each (r -
   2)-dimensional simplex in such a way that all (r - 1)-dimensional
   volumes of (r - 1)-simplices are instantaneously preserved. We give
   three different, but equivalent, elementary formulations of r-motions
   and the related idea of r-stresses in this part of the paper, and two
   additional ones in Part II. We also give a homological interpretation of
   these concepts, in a special case. This homological interpretation can
   be extended to the general case, which will be done in a later paper.
   The motivation for this paper is the desire to understand the
   combinatorics of the g-theorem, which is the characterization of all the
   possible f-vectors of simplicial polytopes. The crucial part of the
   g-theorem is the inequality g(r) greater than or equal to 0, also known
   as the generalized lower bound theorem, for r less than or equal to
   right perpendicular (d + 1)/2 left perpendicular, where g(r) is the rth
   entry in the g-vector of the boundary complex Delta of a simplicial
   d-polytope. We show that this inequality and, indeed, the full
   g-theorem, is implied by the r-rigidity of all polytopal Delta for r
   less than or equal to right perpendicular (d + 1)/2 left perpendicular.
   This polytopal r-rigidity is conjectured, but not proven. The details of
   this connection with the g-theorem are contained in the second part of
   the paper. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited}},

Abstract = {{A peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) technique was developed for the
   identification of Haemophilus somnus bacteria in lung tissues of calves.
   Antisera raised against somatic and wall antigens of a Danish and
   American strain of H. somnus were produced. Experimentally infected
   murine tissues were used for the determination of the sensitivity and
   specificity of antiserum that had been heterologously absorbed with
   antigens of cross-reacting bacteria, i.e. Pasteurella haemolytica and
   Pasteurella multocida. None of the antisera reacted with Actinomyces
   pyogenes. An antiserum raised against somatic antigens of the Danish
   strain of H. somnus revealed the highest sensitivity in the PAP
   technique and became specific following absorption. Heterologous
   absorption also rendered this antiserum specific in crossed
   immunoelectrophoresis. Subsequently, the PAP technique was applied on
   formalin-fixed pneumonic lung tissues of 86 calves. An immunodiagnosis
   of H. somnus pneumonia was obtained in 15 of 17 lungs from which the
   bacterium had been isolated. Moreover, immunostained bacteria were also
   demonstrated in 20 lungs from which H. somnus had not been isolated.
   Thus, application of immunohistochemistry significantly enhanced the
   diagnostic sensitivity of H. somnus pneumonia of calves and should be
   used as a potent supplementary tool for the routine screening of
   suspected lung tissues of calves from which bacterial isolation is
   negative.}},

   was measured using a vessel myograph. After inhibition of sarcoplasmic

   The second phase of the contractile response was abolished in the

   indicating that the second phase of the contraction may be mediated by
   the transplasmamembrane calcium influx. The initial phase of the
   contractile response was abolished after addition of the intracellular
   calcium antagonist 8-(diethylamino)-octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate

Abstract = {{A necessary goal in the calibration of any instrument is an indication

   of the success of that algorithm. This paper presents an experimental
   performance analysis of a traditional calibration algorithm as applied
   to the problem of three-dimensional vision. The study begins with an
   analysis of the algorithm in a single camera or monocular system.
   Monocular analysis concludes with a derivation of error boundaries under

   propagates from the component monocular systems into a three-dimensional

Abstract = {{Failure criteria based on tenser polynomials present an advantage over
   the old classical criteria in that the coefficients of their terms are
   no longer scalar quantities defined by either some simple assumption,
   defining the shape of their loci, or evaluated by a curve-fitting
   process, but they belong to the terms of a fourth-order tenser
   expressing the mode of failure of the respective material. While the
   first generation of these criteria defined the coefficients of the terms
   of the respective tenser polynomial experimentally, by testing the
   material in different modes of loading, associated by a curve-fitting
   process, recent forms of this type of criteria have rejected the
   arbitrariness of definition of the coefficients of the tenser terms and
   accepted in advance the validity of some phenomenological conjecture,
   associated with and derived from the validity of some physical law.
   In this paper, failure criteria, expressed in the form of tenser
   polynomials, are formulated appropriately according to justified
   postulates. Two different variations of the failure tenser polynomial
   criterion will be presented in this paper, the one being based on the
   assumption that the material does not fail by a predominant type of
   hydrostatic stress, whereas the other being established by conjecturing
   that a safe loading for the material is expressed by a stress tenser,
   whose associated strain tenser in the context of Hookean elasticity is a
   spherical one.
   The variances between these two extreme cases of definition of failure
   criteria are studied in the paper and suggestions for the superiority of
   a safe criterion are proposed, although the final decision depends
   exclusively on a comparison of experimental results derived from
   compound tests appropriately selected, which, up to now, are almost
   totally missing in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{The ice-clad and fumarolic Nevado del Tolima volcano (4 degrees 39'N, 75
   degrees 20'W) south of Nevado del Ruiz, is offset toward the southeast
   from the axis of the volcanic Ruiz-Tolima massif with respect to the
   major NE-trending strike-slip Palestina fault. It is composed of four
   units: (1) a pre-Tolima plateau-like basement of basaltic andesite lava
   flows of early Quaternary age; (2) a dissected, ancestral Tolima
   stratovolcano, cut by a presumed collapse caldera of middle Pleistocene
   age; (3) an older Tolima stratovolcano of late Pleistocene age, partly
   destroyed by a summit caldera; and (4) composite domes of the
   cone-shaped young and present Tolima.
   Young Tolima volcano is an andesitic and dacitic composite cone formed
   over the past 40,000 years within a 3-km-wide caldera that opened around
   0.14 Ma. Deposits of welded and nonwelded pumice- and scoria-flows were
   emplaced toward the southeast (Rio Combeima) and northeast (Rio Totare).
   Repeated growth of lava domes over the past 16,000 years is witnessed by
   thick block-lava flows on the southern and eastern flanks and by
   block-and-ash or scoria-rich pyroclastic-flow deposits. This activity
   occurred during at least six eruptives stages as follows: El Placer, ca.
   16,200-14,000 yr B.P.; Romerales, ca. 13,000-12,300 yr B.P.; Canalones,
   ca. 11,500-9750 yr B.P.; Mesetas, ca. 7200-4600 yr. B.P.; Encanto, ca.
   3600-1700 yr B.P., and Nieves, historical. Interactions with the ice cap
   probably triggered debris flows that partly filled the Combeima and
   Totare valleys and formed the Holocene terraces on the upper Pleistocene
   volcaniclastic fans of Ibague and Venadillo as much as 60 km from the
   source. The latest major activity was a plinian eruption, which
   deposited a pumice-fall layer ca. 3600 yr B.P. (0.5 km(3) actual volume)
   mainly toward the west and northwest. Minor tephra-falls and debris
   flows occurred during the historical period before the reported 1918 and
   1943 small (phreatic ?) events.
   A general hazard-zone map shows areas potentially affected by future
   eruptions both at Nevado del Tolima and at active Cerro Machin 12 km
   southward. The extent of areas likely to be affected by tephra-falls,
   debris flows, pyroclastic flows or surges, debris avalanches and lava
   flows is shown. Subplinian and plinian eruptions of Nevado del Tolima
   were used to represent the moderate and large events to be expected.
   300,000 people live within a 35-km distance from those volcanoes, which
   have exhibited a behaviour more explosive than Nevado del Ruiz. Despite
   the small-sized ice cap, debris flows are the most probable hazard for
   even a minor eruption, because of the very steep slope gradient, and
   because of probable interactions of hot eruptive products with ice and
   snow. Additionally, scoria flows and debris avalanches can be directed
   toward the southeast and could be transformed into debris flows that
   would devastate the Combeima valley and suburbs of Ibague city, where
   about 50,000 people live.}},

   work reconstructs women's track on their trip le condition of
   student-teacher-administrator within the universities The feminine
   tendency to give up teaching careers in favour of other options
   associated with the practice of liberal professions, comes from the
   matricular analysis. Nevertheless, women are still under-represented in
   those careers in which the occupational future has to do with the

   place within the teaching field, which involves the lowest hierarchies
   and maintains exclusion regarding full professors. Finally, women are

Abstract = {{Equine C9, in contrast to human C9, has extremely low hemolytic activity
   against must mammalian erythrocytes, although the amino acid sequences
   of both proteins show 77\% identity, In an attempt to define the region
   of human C9 responsible for conferring its lytic activity, or
   conversely, the region oi equine C9 responsible for its restriction,
   recombinant human and equine C9 and four chimeric human/equine C9
   proteins were constructed and expressed in COS-7 cells. Recombinant
   human and equine C9 displayed hemolytic profiles similar to those of the
   purified native proteins. Exchange of a fragment extending from residues
   145 to 240 in horse C9 with the corresponding one from human C9 created
   a fully hemolytic protein, This region contains the putative hinge
   region but not the membrane-interacting domain. Nonlytic chimeric C9
   proteins inhibited hemolysis and binding of human C9 to EAC1-8 cells,
   indicating that they bind to their receptor, but subsequent unfolding or
   insertion into the membrane is impaired. These results suggest that
   restriction factors, such as glycophorin, CD59, or homologous
   restriction factor, on erythrocytes may limit the activity of horse C9
   by interacting with its hinge region, In support of this conclusion
   direct binding of CD59 to immobilized horse C9 was detected by ligand
   blotting, and it was observed that a polyclonal anti-CD59 Ab enhanced
   human and horse C9-mediated hemolysis of human EAC1-7, but the increase
   in hemolytic activity of horse C9 by inhibition of CD59 was less than
   what could be achieved by insertion of the human C9 hinge region into
   horse C9.}},

   calcium by 34\%. In PKC-downregulated cells, the effect of Ptx treatment
   on the ATP-evoked increase in {[}Ca2+](i) was 73\% and 44\%,
   respectively. Phorbol myristic acetate (PMA) decreased the ATP-evoked
   calcium entry to the same extent as Ptx. In Ptx-treated cells, the
   ATP-evoked influx of Ca-45(2+) was attenuated. Stimulation of the cells
   with P-2p-purinergic agonist GTP evoked no entry of calcium, although
   GTP released the same amount of sequestered calcium as did ATP. PKC
   downregulation or pretreatment with Ptx had no effects on the GTP-evoked
   responses, whereas PMA decreased the GTP-evoked release of calcium. We
   conclude that the ATP-activated rapid calcium entry pathway is a second
   messenger-operated calcium channel. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of several plant lectins on the production of a pea
   phytoalexin, pisatin, were examined. Con A, PHA, PNA and PSA each
   induced the production of pisatin in pea epicotyl tissues, demonstrating
   that plant lectins can act as elicitors. The production of pisatin in
   response to PHA, PNA or PSA was not affected by the simultaneous
   presence of the respective hapten sugars, whereas haptens specific for
   Con A, such as alpha-D-mannose and methyl-alpha-D-mannoside, abolished
   the induction of pisatin by Con A. These results indicate that the
   elicitor effect of Con A is attributable to its ability to bind to
   specific carbohydrates in pea cells. Induction of the production of
   pisatin by Con A was markedly inhibited by the suppressor derived from a
   pea pathogen. Mycosphaerella pinodes, and by several inhibitors related
   to signal-transduction pathways. It is suggested, therefore, that the
   Con A-induced production of pisatin in pea tissues might be associated
   with activation of a signal-transduction pathway. An additive effect on
   the accumulation of pisatin was observed when Con A was present with a
   polysaccharide elicitor from M. pinodes, suggesting that exogenous Con A
   does not compete with the recognition site(s) for the fungal elicitor in
   pea cells. The present data also indicate that Con A may be useful for
   characterization of the signal-transduction system that leads to the
   synthesis of phytoalexin in pea epicotyl tissues.}},

Abstract = {{An improvement in culture productivity, changes in biomass composition,
   and an increase in the yield of biomass components could be attained by
   directed formation of a definite age structure in Chlorella IPPAS C-1
   population cultured intensely at a turbidostatic regime. The
   calculations were made for four different cell age distributions, using
   some cell characteristics previously measured in the course of the cell
   cycle. An increase in biomass production by a factor of 1.44 and changes
   in the photosynthetic coefficient within the wide limits were predicted.
   The control of the culture age structure also resulted in the alteration
   of age distribution within the harvested cells and, as a consequence, in
   changes of the chemical composition of the harvested biomass. The
   protein content in the biomass produced could be changed within the
   range from 0.69 to 1.27 (when the index for the regime without age
   structure control was taken to be unity); the carbohydrate content could
   be changed from 0.68 to 1.24; and the lipid content from 0.86 to 1.07.
   The total yield of these compounds (their content multiplied by culture
   production) could vary from 0.93 to 1.22 for proteins, from 0.65 to 1.76
   for carbohydrates, and from 0.95 to 1.44 for lipids. The technological
   methods for controlling the age pattern of populations are described
   based on complete or partial removing of the `'old,'' heavier cells from

Abstract = {{In neutrophils, activation of receptors for the chemotactic peptide
   N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) leads to changes in
   intracellular events such as phosphoinositide turnover and Ca2+
   mobilization. Studies have shown that activation of the cloned fMLP
   receptor can also lead to inhibition of cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation
   {[}Lang, Boulay, Li and Wollheim (1993) EMBO J. 12, 2671-2679; Uhing,
   Gettys, Tomhave, Snyderman and Didsbury (1992) Biochem. Biophys. Res.
   Commun. 183, 1033-1039]. These responses are apparently mediated through
   pertussis toxin-sensitive G(i) proteins. Since other chemotactic factor
   receptors can couple to multiple G proteins, we examined the ability of
   the fMLP receptor to utilize a pertussis toxinin-sensitive G protein,
   G(z), in its signal transduction pathways. The human fMLP receptor was
   transiently expressed in 293 and Ltk(-) cells, and subsequently assayed
   for receptor-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation and stimulation of
   phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C. In transfected 293 cells,
   fMLP inhibited choriogonadotropin-stimulated cAMP accumulation by 50\%
   and the response could be abolished by pertussis toxin. Co-expression of
   the fMLP receptor with the alpha subunit of G(z) rendered the fMLP
   response pertussis toxinin-sensitive, indicating that the endogenous Gi
   proteins can be substituted efficiently by G(z). In contrast, Ltk(-)
   cells expressing the fMLP receptor were able to respond to fMLP with an
   increase in the production of inositol phosphates, but this response was
   completely abolished by pertussis toxin even in cells co-expressing the
   alpha subunit of G(z). Thus, although both signalling pathways appeared
   to utilize G(i)-like proteins, G(z) can only replace G(i) in mediating
   inhibition of cAMP accumulation, and not in the stimulation of
   phospholipase C. Differential interaction with G(z) might represent a
   novel mechanism by which fMLP receptors regulate intracellular events.}},

   4,4'-diphenylmethanediisocyanate, poly(tetramethylene oxide), and
   1,4-butanediol, showed an inhibitory action on the gap-junctional
   intercellular communication in a V79 metabolic cooperation (MC) test
   system. However, the inhibitory potentials of methanol extracts did not
   correlate with the tumorigenic potential of the polyurethanes in 1-year
   rat implantation studies. When the MC test was carried out using glass
   dishes partly coated with low molecular weight PEU, the inhibitory
   activity was clearly detected on the surface of the polyurethane coating
   but not on that of the noncoated glass area. The inhibitory activity of
   the three PEUs investigated using polyurethane-coated dishes correlated
   with the values of the polyurethane's tumorigenic potential in the rat
   implantation study. Various polyurethanes containing polybutadiene
   (PBD), hydrogenated polybutadiene (HPBD), or a fluoropolyether glycol
   (FPEG) as the soft segment were also tested using coated dishes in the
   MC assay. The threshold inhibitory response of FPEG-PU was 10-fold less

   in the MC test system. Both the FPEG and aliphatic soft segment
   containing polyurethanes decreased, and had minimal influence on the gap
   junctional intercellular communication. Thus, the tumor-promoting
   potential of PBD-PU, HPBD-PU, and SPEG-PU was considered to be lower
   than those of the PEUs based on these in vitro test results. (C) 1995

   disasters. In this paper we present a conceptual framework for an
   effective, integrated, and modular decision support system (DSS) for
   hurricane emergency management. As an important component of this
   decision support system, we have been developing a PC-based emergency
   hurricane evacuation planning module, Regional Evacuation Modeling
   System (REMS), at the University of Florida since 1990. The software
   uses simulation as well as several network optimization models in
   estimating the evacuation time and the traffic flow on a given
   transportation road network. The system is very robust and user
   friendly. One of the important features of REMS is its ability to be
   used in real time.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of long-term cilazapril treatment on glucose and lipid
   metabolism were assessed in 25 hypertensive patients with
   non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Patients were treated
   with 0.5 to 1 mg of cilazapril once daily or a combination of cilazapril
   and other antihypertensive drugs once daily for 48 weeks. Both systolic
   and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced (P < 0.001)
   throughout the study with no significant changes in heart rate and no
   adverse effects such as cough. There were no significant changes in body
   mass index or serum levels of glycated hemoglobin A(1c), fructosamine,
   total cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoproteins (high-density lipoprotein
   cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and very-low-density
   lipoprotein cholesterol), or apolipoproteins (ape A-I, apo C-II, apo
   C-III, apo B, and apo E). Cilazapril caused a significant increase (P <
   0.05) in levels of apo A-II and a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in the
   apo B:apo A-I ratio, an index of arteriosclerosis. These results suggest
   that cilazapril has favorable effects on glucose and lipid metabolism
   and that it may be useful as the first or second choice of
   antihypertensive drugs in hypertensive patients with NIDDM.}},

   anion-exchange chromatography. The molecular mass of PLD in both peaks
   was 82 kDa on SDS-PAGE and 78 kDa in gel filtration. Antibodies raised
   against the protein in one of the peaks precipitated the enzyme
   activities in both peaks. Enzymatic characteristics of PLD in the two
   peaks were identical except for a difference of 0.1 in the isoelectric
   points. Sequence analysis covering more than 10\% of the amino acids of
   the proteins and peptide mapping did not detect any difference in the
   primary structure of the proteins. A cDNA for PLD was isolated from rice
   and it encoded a protein of 812 residues. The N-terminal sequences of
   purified PLDs matched the deduced amino acid sequence starting from
   residue 47. A Northern blot showed this gene was expressed in leaves,
   roots, developing seeds and cultured cells, and a Southern blot detected
   a single band of rice genomic DNA hybridizing to the cDNA. A cDNA for

Abstract = {{The cysteine proteases cathepsin B and cathepsin L are very likely
   involved in invasive processes of normal and malignant cells, they
   become relevant for a number of diseases and are possibly prognostic
   markers for the outcome of human lung cancer. Therefore, we have
   determined activities of these related enzymes in cells and in cell
   extracts of human lung carcinoma cell lines of different cathepsin
   composition by flow cytometry and by spectrophotometry, respectively. To
   this end we applied the synthethic dipeptidyl substrates
   benzoxycarbonyl-arginyl-arginine- and benzoxycarbonyl-phenyl-arginine-
   coupled to 4-methoxy-beta-naphthylamide, aminomethyl-coumarine or
   rhodamine R110, The apparent enzymatic activities were differentially
   defined by protease inhibitors, particularly E-64 and CA-074.
   Independent of the dipeptidyl-composition more than 99 per cent of the
   apparent activity was due to cathepsin B when
   4-methoxy-beta-naphthylamide or aminomethylcoumarine were the leaving
   groups, The 4-methoxy-beta-naphthylamide precipitate used for detection
   of cell associated activities revealed a wide spectrum of excitation to
   fluorescence thwarting the application of other possible fluorescent
   tags. Therefore, its application is restricted to uniparametric
   fluorescence investigations. Both dipeptidylgroups coupled to rhodamine
   R110 were promiscuous: only 25 to 30\% of the apparent activity were due
   to cathepsin B; the predominant activity came from cathepsin L,
   irrespective whether intracellular or activities of cellular extracts
   were analyzed, However, rhodamine R110-coupled substrates open the way
   for multiparametric fluorescent analysis of cathepsins B and L
   containing cells if appropriate inhibitors for specification of the
   enzymatic activities are additionally applied, In very contrast to
   4-methoxy-beta-naphthylamide, which causes irreparable damage to the
   cells, the rhodamine substrates permit studies with living cells and
   live cell sorting.}},

Abstract = {{We have studied the effect of the cell synchronization agents compactin,
   ciclopirox olamine, mimosine, aphidicolin, ALLN, and colcemid on several
   parameters of cell cycle progression in mitotically synchronized HeLa S3
   cells. Using cell size and cyclin A and B levels as markers of
   cytoplasmic progression and DNA content as a measure of nuclear cell
   cycle position, we have examined coordination of cytoplasmic and nuclear
   events during induction synchrony. Each synchronizing agent was unique
   in its effect on the coordination of the cytoplasmic and nuclear cycle.
   Mimosine, aphidicolin, ALLN, and colcemid disrupted cell cycle
   integration while compactin and ciclopirox olamine did not, Continued
   net cell growth during cell cycle arrest was the most dramatic in
   aphidicolin-treated cells, which averaged a 60\% increase in size.
   Mimosine, ALLN, and colcemid produced an increase in cell size of
   approximately 25\%, and ciclopyrox olamine and compactin exerted a
   negligible effect. Cyclin A and B were found at mitotic (high) or G1
   (low) levels, or in combination of high and low concentrations not
   correlated with DNA content in drug-treated cells. For example,
   treatment with mimosine, which arrests cells in G1 with 2C DNA, resulted
   in cyclin A accumulating to mitotic levels, whereas cyclin B remained at
   a low concentration, the first time this phenomenon has been observed.
   These results demonstrate that populations of synchronized cells
   obtained by different drug treatments are blocked at biochemically
   distinct cell cycle points not apparent by cytometric measurement of DNA
   content. Our results provide conclusive evidence that induced synchrony
   methods differ with respect to their impact on cell cycle organization
   and from the pattern seen with nonperturbing cell selection methods. (C)

Abstract = {{A procedure has been developed for measuring the steady state rate of
   permeation of commercial solvents through living human skin. To get the
   most consistent results, it was necessary with some solvents to
   normalize the solvent permeation rare of a given skin sample with its
   {[}H-3]water permeation rate. For other solvents this was not necessary,
   so the un-normalized data were used. Nigh {[}H-3]water permeation rate
   also was used as a criterion for `'defective'' skin samples that gave
   erroneous permeability rates, especially for solvents having slow
   permeability. The linearity of the steady state data was characterized
   by calculation of the `'percent error of the slope.'' The following
   permeability rates (g/m(2)h) of single solvents were measured: dimethyl
   sulfoxide (DMSO), 176; N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, 171; dimethyl acetamide,
   107; methyl ethyl ketone, 53; methylene chloride, 24; {[}H-3]water,
   14.8; ethanol, 11.3; butyl acetate, 1.6; gamma-butyrolactone, 1.1;
   toluene, 0.8; propylene carbonate 0.7; and sulfolane, 0.2. The effect of
   {[}H-3]water saturation on the shape of the presteady state portion of
   the permeation curve was determined and found to be very dependent on
   the solvent. The permeability of mixtures of DMSO and octyl acetate were
   measured No octyl acetate was detected and the permeability of DMSO was
   proportional to its mole fraction in the mixture. The effect of two
   hours of solvent exposure on the viability of skin (based on DNA
   synthesis) was measured and found to be very dependent on the solvent.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Measurement of splanchnic blood flow is necessary to
   evaluate the effect of therapeutic interventions on splanchnic tissue
   perfusion. Systemic indocyanine green (ICG) clearance has been used to
   estimate splanchnic blood flow, but the results may be compromised by
   altered hepatic dye extraction. We evaluated the applicability of
   simultaneous estimation of splanchnic and femoral blood flow by dye
   dilution and regional blood sampling in intensive care patients.
   Methods: 240 simultaneous determinations of regional blood flow were
   conducted in different patient groups (cardiac surgery, ARDS,
   pancreatitis, septic shock, preoperative controls). The measurement
   protocol consists of catheterizations of hepatic vein, femoral artery
   and vein and primed constant infusion of two different ICG preparations.
   Results: The method was used successfully in a wide variety of patients.
   Steady-state dye concentration and sufficient dye extraction was
   achieved in each group of patients. The coefficient of variation of
   splanchnic blood flow estimation was 7 +/- 1\% and of femoral blood flow
   estimation 6 +/- 0\%. There was a great intra- and interindividual
   variation of ICG extraction Use of dobutamine modified the extraction in
   most patients but did not lessen the performance of the method. ICG
   extraction was markedly lower and the coefficient of variation of both
   femoral and splanchnic blood flow markedly higher with propylene
   glycol-dissolved ICG preparation as compared with the freeze-dried.
   Conclusions: The prerequisites for the method of primed, constant
   infusion of indocyanine green with hepatic vein catheterization are
   achieved in intensive care patients. The results of splanchnic blood
   flow estimations based on techniques with peripheral blood sampling
   should be interpreted with caution, and the use of ICG clearance as a
   flow-related indicator without the measurement of ICG extraction cannot
   be justified because of the great variability of dye extraction. Certain
   indocyanine green preparations may greatly modify the results of the
   regional blood now determinations.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Dental personnel are prone to frequent bouts of hand
   dermatitis. This has been attributed to hand washing, occupational
   exposure to a multitude of possible sensitizers, and frequent latex
   glove use. There has been some conflict in the literature as to the true
   frequency of allergic contact dermatitis in dental personnel. Objective:
   The purpose of this investigation was to quantify the frequency of
   allergic contact dermatitis and contact urticaria in a large group of
   Air Force dental personnel. Methods: Four hundred forty-nine dental
   personnel were surveyed for hand dermatitis. Positive responders were
   interviewed and examined. Patients with histories most consistent with
   allergic contact dermatitis were patch tested to a standard and a dental
   tray. Results: Of the 449 personnel completing our survey, 169 had a
   positive history of hand dermatitis. One hundred twenty of these were
   interviewed and examined, of which 27 patients gave a history most
   consistent with allergic contact dermatitis and were subjected to patch
   testing. Only 3 patients had relevant positive reactions to the
   allergens on the standard or dental trays. All others (93) were
   diagnosed with irritant contact dermatitis. None had contact urticaria
   to latex. Conclusion: The frequency of hand dermatitis in our dental
   personnel is consistent with that in other published studies (37.6\%).
   The majority of hand dermatitis occurring in this group is due to
   irritant contact dermatitis; the frequency of allergic contact
   dermatitis is very low (0.67\%). None had contact urticaria.}},

Abstract = {{Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is an autosomal dominant disorder
   characterised by pigmentary abnormalities and sensorineural deafness. It
   is subcategorised into type 1 (WS1) and type 2 (WS2) on the basis of the
   presence (WS1) or absence (WS2) of dystopia canthorum. WS1 is always
   caused by mutations in the PAX3 gene, whereas WS2 is caused by mutations
   in the microphthalmia (MITF) gene in some but not all families. An
   association of WS symptoms with Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) has been
   reported in many families. We report here a patient with characteristics
   of WS2 and a de novo interstitial deletion of chromosome 13q. We also
   describe a family with two sibs who have both WS2 and HSCR. In this
   family, all possible genes for WS and HSCR, but not chromosome 13q,
   could be excluded. As an association between chromosome 13q and HSCR/WS
   has been reported previously, these data suggest that there is a gene on
   chromosome 13q that is responsible for WS or HSCR or both.}},

Abstract = {{Metabolism of {[}C-14]gibberellin(GA)(12)-aldehyde and {[}C-14]GA(12) in
   vegetative tissue of potato (Solanum tuberosum ssp. andigena) was
   studied by supplying solutions of these compounds to the base of
   isolated shoot tips and analyzing the metabolic products by
   radiodetection after HPLC. Endogenous gibberellins that co-eluted with
   the C-14-metabolites on HPLC were identified by GC-MS as
   GA(53)-aldehyde, GA(53), GA(44), GA(19), GA(20), GA(29), GA(1), and
   GA(8). Thus the early-13-hydroxylation pathway seems to be a major
   pathway in vegetative potato shoots. This was confirmed by time-course
   feeding studies; according to HPLC elution profiles, the members of the
   pathway were produced from {[}C-14]GA(12)-aldehyde and {[}C-14]GA(12) in
   the expected time sequence. The formation of GA(53) appeared to be
   predominantly via GA(12) rather than GA(53)-aldehyde. The detection of
   endogenous GA(51) suggests that the non-hydroxylation pathway was also
   active. Comparisons of HPLC retention times of radioactive metabolites
   before base hydrolysis with retention times after base hydrolysis showed
   that potato shoots can conjugate several GAs. HPLC retention times of
   other radioactive metabolites corresponded with previously published
   retention times of GA(29)-catabolite, GA(51)-catabolite,
   GA(12)-aldehyde-conjugate, and GA(53)-aldehyde-conjugate.}},

Abstract = {{To increase the effect of cisplatin on locoregional osteosarcoma, the
   short-term effect of hyperthermic isolated regional perfusion (HIRP)
   with cisplatin (30 mg/L extremity volume) was studied in 28 dogs with
   spontaneous osteogenic sarcoma, using clinical, radiological, and
   histological parameters. Thirty days postoperatively, mortality was
   14.3\%. Total platinum levels at the start of perfusion were 28.2 +/-
   14.3 mg/L. A significant improvement (P < 0.001) in clinical score was
   observed in the overall group at 6 and 12 weeks after perfusion. The
   radiological parameter showed a stationary X-ray 2 weeks after perfusion
   and an improved X-ray 6 weeks after perfusion. Overall histological
   scores showed a moderate effect according to the Huvos classification.
   No additional therapeutic effect, according to the three parameters,
   could be demonstrated by increasing the perfusate temperature by 1
   degrees C. HIRP with cisplatin is feasible in the local treatment of
   spontaneous osteosarcoma in dogs with acceptable locoregional toxicity.
   However, the histological results were modest, with none of the dogs
   showing a complete response 6 weeks after perfusion. Therefore, the
   search for the ideal perfusion agent with substantial contribution to
   the limb-sparing treatment in human osteosarcoma continues. (C) 1995

   transition, misfit dislocations, perfect glissile dislocation loops and
   a vacancy supersaturation. All these features effect hardness in their

Abstract = {{Immunocytochemical analysis revealed the presence of acetylated
   endorphins in both melanotropes and corticotropes of the pituitary gland
   of Xenopus laevis. Chemical acetylation studies to determine the
   steady-state level of acetylated versus non-acetylated endorphins showed
   that virtually all endorphins are acetylated in both melanotropes and
   corticotropes. Apparently Xenopus is unique among vertebrates as
   non-acetylated endorphins are major endproducts in the distal lobe of
   all other vertebrate species studied thus far. The dynamics of endorphin
   biosynthesis in melanotrope cells using pulse-chase analysis coupled to
   immunoaffinity chromatography revealed that processing of
   pro-opiomelanocortin to produce N-terminal-acetylated endorphins is very
   rapid. To determine the effect of long-term background adaptation on
   acetylation status of endorphins and alpha-MSH-related peptides, Xenopus
   laevis were adapted for 3 or 6 weeks to either a black or a white
   background. In both physiological states the major intracellular form of
   alpha-MSH-related peptides in melanotropes was desacetyl alpha-MSH while
   the major endorphin-related peptide was
   alpha,N-acetyl-beta-endorphin{[}1-8]. In the medium of superfused
   neurointermediate lobes of black background-adapted animals the major
   form of secreted melanotropins and endorphins was alpha-MSH and
   alpha,N-acetyl-beta-endorphin{[}1-8] respectively. We conclude that
   there is a marked spatio-temporal difference in acetylation of
   melanotropin and endorphins, with rapid intracellular acetylation of
   endorphins while melanotropin is acetylated at the time of its
   exocytosis. In the medium of superfused neurointermediate lobes of white
   background-adapted animals the amount of desacetyl alpha-MSH was much
   higher than in the medium of lobes of black-adapted animals. Therefore,
   the secretory signals from melanotrope cells of black- and white-adapted
   Xenopus appear to differ with respect to the degree of acetylation of
   the melanotropins. This difference may underlie the strategy of Xenopus
   to regulate dermal melanophore activity during physiological background
   adaptations.}},

Abstract = {{An assessment of the immune status of both HIV-positive and HIV-negative

   HIV itself, may be caused by other viral infections such as all types of

   new technologies for preparing factor VIII concentrates led to the
   question of whether higher purity is associated with a protective effect
   on the immune system, which might improve the clinical course of
   HIV-positive patients. Factor VIII from two manufacturing processes was
   investigated, one prepared using an ion-exchange S/D step, and the other
   utilizing a monoclonal antibody step. It is concluded that changing the

Abstract = {{Thrombin is a multifunctional serine protease that is rapidly produced
   from prothrombin at sites of tissue injury and catalyzes the final steps
   in blood coagulation, Thrombin also regulates gene expression and
   process outgrowth in neurons and astrocytes and stimulates proliferation
   of astrocytes, Since thrombin is produced immediately upon breakdown of
   the blood-brain barrier we examined its effects on astrocytes and
   neurons cultured under conditions which resemble those found in vivo
   following cerebrovascular injury, These studies showed that thrombin
   markedly protected rat primary astrocytes from cell death induced by
   hypoglycemia or oxidative stress, Thrombin also protected rat primary
   hippocampal neurons from cell death produced by hypoglycemia or growth
   supplement deprivation, Synthetic peptides which directly activate the
   thrombin receptor also protected astrocytes and neurons from these
   environmental insults, demonstrating that the thrombin effects were
   mediated through the thrombin receptor, In contrast to these results
   with stressed cells, high concentrations of thrombin killed both
   astrocytes and neurons cultured under normal conditions, All of the
   effects of thrombin on astrocytes and neurons were blocked by the brain
   thrombin inhibitor, protease nexin-1 (PN-1), This shows that the effects
   required the proteolytic activity of thrombin and is consistent with the
   known proteolytic mechanism by which thrombin activates its receptor,
   These results indicate that thrombin and PN-1 may regulate the viability
   of both astrocytes and neurons in early moments following trauma to the
   CNS or other conditions that alter the blood-brain barrier.}},

   Selective fruit abortion was examined in selfing and outcrossing

   Inflorescences were pollinated with cross pollen, self pollen, or a
   combination of the two pollination types on different flowers. Fruit
   initiation and maturation were similar on self- and cross-pollinated
   inflorescences. Self-incompatibility indices indicated that all plants
   were fully self-compatible. When self and cross fruits competed for
   limited maternal resources on the same inflorescences, numbers of self
   and cross fruits did not deviate from a 50 : 50 ratio. This indicates
   that differences in the vigor of self and cross progeny were minimal,
   which may be a consequence of populations having a history of
   inbreeding. Most fruits aborted early in development, before substantial
   investment of resources. Results in the selfing and outcrossing
   populations were similar, indicating that neither selective abortion nor

   the excited state in alkanenitriles as well as in the ground state in
   both alkanenitriles and n-alcohols, using ps transient grating
   spectroscopy and flash photolysis is reported. The intrinsic activation
   energy for isomerisation has been determined from isoviscosity plots. In
   the ground state, the activation energy amounts to 12.9 kcal/mol in both
   nitriles and alcohols, while it is equal to 3.0 kcal/mol in the excited
   state. The reduced isomerisation rate constant shows a fractional
   dependence on the solvent viscosity, with a fractional exponent ct of
   0.20 and 0.38 for the ground state isomerisation in alcohols and
   nitriles and of 0.65 for the excited state isomerisation. The data have
   been analysed within the framework of the Kramers theory using different
   models for friction. The best agreement was obtained with the
   Grote-Hynes model, which takes into account the frequency dependence of
   the friction. The solvent dependence of a for the ground state
   isomerisation is accounted for by a different average value of the
   infinite frequency shear modulus in alcohols and nitriles. The barrier
   height dependence of ct is explained by a decrease of the barrier's top
   frequency by going from the ground to the excited state.}},

   MoAbs against these proteins were made by immunization of BALB/c mice

   Five stable hybridoma cell lines' were obtained, of which four secreted
   anti-Ro/SS-A antibodies (clones 1D8, 1D11, 2G10 and 6G8) and one
   produced anti-La/SS-B antibodies (clone 7F6). The MoAbs were further
   characterized using four different immunoassays: immunofluorescence,
   immunoblotting, RNA precipitation combined with Northern blotting, and
   recombinant protein precipitation. All four MoAbs against Ro/SS-A
   recognized the native protein and one of them (2G10) recognized also
   intact scRNP particles. Interestingly, hY3-RNA was reproducibly not
   efficiently precipitated by MoAb 2G10. Epitope mapping using deletion
   mutants of the 60-kD Ro/SS-A antigen showed that MoAb 1D8 recognized the
   C-terminal part of this protein, while 1D11 and 2G10 recognized distinct
   epitopes in the region between the RNP motif and the putative zinc
   finger domain. The epitopes recognized by these MoAbs are highly
   conserved among species, and the epitope recognized by MoAb 2G10 may be
   identical to an autoepitope recognized by sera of patients. This is the
   first report describing the isolation and characterization of MoAbs of
   the IgG class against the 60-kD Ro/SS-A and La/SS-B autoantigens
   obtained by immunization with purified human-recombinant proteins. These
   MoAbs can be of great use in studying the cellular processes in which
   scRNPs are involved, and may help to determine why these scRNPs become
   autoantigenic in autoimmune diseases.}},

Abstract = {{The Salpeterkop complex is an eroded central volcano of Late Cretaceous
   (66 Ma) age with a sediment-filled crater remnant 1 km in diameter
   associated with radial and concentric carbonatite/K-trachyte dykes as
   well as K-trachyte, breccia and olivine melilitite plugs. The
   sedimentary country rocks have been domed. Geochemical anomalies for Ti,
   Y,Zr, Nb, Th, V, Zn and Mo, based on a core-drilling programme, were
   found to outline a mineralized zone coinciding with the crater rim,
   especially on the western and southern sides. The rim rocks are volcanic
   breccias intimately mixed and veined by decomposed, silicified and
   ferruginized carbonatite and carbonatitic tuff. A large variety of very
   fine-grained minerals have been identified in a groundmass consisting
   mainly of goethite and chalcedony. The principal Nb ore mineral is
   niobian brookite occurring as microscopic disseminated grains of several
   morphological types. High-Nb (12\% Nb2O5) and low-Nb (8\% Nb2O5)
   brookites have been distinguished. Some of them contain inclusions of
   ilmenorutile. Delicate brookite crystal aggregates crystallized in situ.
   No discrete V and Zn minerals could be identified but Th occurs as
   thorianite and thorite, Zr occurs in eudialyte and an unidentified KNb
   silicate and Y occurs as xenotime. Nepheline and eudialyte are probably
   xenocrysts from an unexposed body of nepheline syenite. It is concluded
   that mineralization took place in three overlapping stages:
   i) primary magmatic, with concentration of Nb, Zr, Th, V in both
   carbonatite and associated silicate rocks;
   ii) mesothermal, with oxidation and introduction of Fe, Ti, REE, Mo and
   F;
   iii) epithermal, with hydration and dissolution of carbonates, removal
   of Ca and Mg, redistribution of Y, Ti, Nb, Zn and deposition of Si, Ba,
   Mn and other mobile elements.
   The suggestion is made that the preservation and extent of the third
   stage, which may be linked to fumarolic activity, distinguishes the
   multi-element mineralization at Salpeterkop from other carbonatite
   complexes. Secondary alteration in the weathered zone merged with the
   third stage, but is less important.}},

Abstract = {{The seasonal growth of Codium bursa J. Agardh was examined in relation
   to ambient and internal nutrient concentrations to elucidate whether the
   low tissue nutrient concentrations observed are an intrinsic feature of
   this species or reflect nutrient-limited growth. Growth rates were
   rather low (mean +/- SE: 2.2 +/- 0.4 x 10(-3) d(-1); doubling time =
   1.24 +/- 0.1 yr), and were significantly correlated to seasonal changes
   in ambient and internal nutrient concentrations, suggesting nutrient,
   probably P, limitation. This suggestion is supported by the rather high
   atomic tissue C/P ratios (1712), compared to C/N ratios (31.8) observed
   in summer. This was confirmed by experimentally injecting nutrients into
   the internal lumen of the plants in situ, which resulted in a doubling
   of growth rate, photosynthetic efficiency, and a reduction in light
   compensation irradiance (39.6 and 29.9 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) in
   control and fertilised specimens, respectively). These results provide,
   along with the strong correlation between growth rate and ambient and
   internal phosphorus concentrations, clear evidence of a tight nutrient
   (likely phosphorus), rather than Light or temperature, control of C.
   bursa growth rates. Hence, even inherently slow-growing organisms in the
   oligotrophic Mediterranean may be resource limited.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of alkaline hydrolysis of the dicarboximide fungicides
   procymidone, iprodione, vinclozolin, and chlozolinate (1-4,
   respectively) were investigated in micellar solutions containing various
   amounts of either sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), cetyltrimethylammonium
   bromide (CTAB), or three nonionic surfactants (two C-13 alcohols and a
   copra amine combined with ethoxyl chains) and compared with the kinetics
   in aqueous media. For all compounds, the rate constants observed are
   slightly reduced by the SDS micellar media, showing that reactions
   essentially take place in the aqueous pseudophase. The CTAB micellar
   media speed up the hydrolysis rates with small quantities of Br- ions in
   the medium. As the number of Br- ions increases, the rate of reactions
   falls. This is characteristic of an ion exchange (OH- and Br-) at the
   surface of the CTAB micelles. Finally, the presence of nonionic micelles
   has little influence on the hydrolysis of the fungicides: the reduction
   in the rate of dicarboximide ring opening is attributed to
   micelle-substrate association. These results can be explained by means
   of the pseudophase kinetic model coupled with the mechanisms of
   hydrolysis of these fungicides in water solution.}},

Abstract = {{A fraction rich in water-unextractable arabinoxylans was isolated from

   investigated by methylation analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy. Three groups of water-unextractabIe arabinoxylans could be
   recognized, differing in extractability, solubility, and structure. The
   first group had an intermediate arabinose-to-xylose ratio (A/X) of
   0.55-0.79 and was extractable either with saturated Ba(OH)(2) containing
   1\% NaBH4 or with water after saturated Ba(OH)(2) extraction. The
   polymers were soluble in water after neutralization of the alkaline
   extract, but they precipitated in saturated ammonium sulfate solution.
   They contained terminal arabinose residues and unsubstituted, 3-mono-,
   2-mono-, and disubstituted xylose residues. A second group had an A/X of
   similar to 1.1 and was partly extracted with alkali; more could be
   extracted after delignification. This group was soluble in water and in
   saturated ammonium sulfate solution. Typical structural features in this
   arabinoxylan were: substituted arabinose residues (40\% of arabinoses),
   terminal xylose residues (26\% of xyloses), and terminal galactose
   residues. A third group of arabinoxylans was extractable with 1M KOH,
   had low water solubility after neutralization of the alkaline extract,
   and had an A/X of similar to 0.2. Besides arabinoxylan, beta-glucan was
   present in large proportions in rye cell-wall material. Glucomannan and

Abstract = {{Occupational exposure to styrene was studied in nine workers of a hand
   lamination plant in Bohemia, Personal dosimeters were used to monitor
   the styrene workplace exposure, and the levels of styrene in blood and
   mandelic acid in urine were measured, Blood samples were taken at four
   occasions during a 7 month period to determine styrene-specific
   O-6-guanine DNA adducts in lymphocytes and granulocytes, DNA strand
   breaks and hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) mutant
   frequency in T-lymphocytes, Seven administrative employees in the same
   factory (factory controls) and eight persons in a research laboratory
   (laboratory controls) were used as referents, DNA adduct levels
   determined by the P-32-postlabelling method in lymphocytes of laminators
   were remarkably constant and significantly higher (P < 0.0001) than in
   factory controls at all four sampling times, HPRT mutant frequencies
   (MF) measured by the T-cell cloning assay were higher in the laminators
   (17.5x10(-6), group mean) than in the factory controls (15.7x10(-6),
   group mean) at three of the four sampling times, but the differences
   were not statistically significant. However, a statistically significant
   (P = 0.021) difference between MF in the laminators (18.0X10(-6), group
   mean) and laboratory controls (11.8X10(-6), group mean) was observed at
   sampling time 4 (the only sampling time when this latter group was
   studied), This result indicates that styrene exposure may induce gene
   mutation in T-cells in vivo. DNA strand breaks were studied by the
   `Comet assay' at the fourth sampling time, The laminators were found to
   have significantly higher levels of DNA strand breaks than the factory
   controls (P = 0.032 for tail length, TL; P = 0.007 for percentage of DNA
   in tail, T\%; and P = 0.020 for tail moment, TM), A statistically
   significant correlation was also found between the levels of lymphocyte
   DNA adducts and all three DNA strand break parameters (TL P = 0.046; T\%
   P = 0.026 and TM P = 0.034). On the contrary, no significant
   correlations were found between DNA adduct levels and the HPRT mutant
   frequencies or between the mutant frequencies and DNA strand breaks,
   Taken together, these results add further support to the genotoxic and
   possibly mutagenic effects of styrene exposure in vivo. However, no
   simple quantitative relationship seems to exist between the levels of
   styrene-induced DNA damage and frequency of HPRT mutation in

Abstract = {{Four different methods for calcium precipitation are compared in the
   optic tectum and the inner ear of the cichlid fish, Oreochromis
   mossambicus. Several parameters are investigated concerning their
   influences on the reaction product. Three procedures (bichromate,
   fluoride, and oxalate-pyroantimonate) produce fine-grained deposits,
   often flocculent in the latter method. The fourth method
   (potassium-pyroantimonate) generates predominantly coarse-grained
   reaction product. The calcium content of the deposits is always proven
   with energy-filtering transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM). In both
   tissues fine-grained reaction product is found in endoplasmic reticulum
   and synaptic vesicles, and in addition in some mitochondria and at the
   cytoskeleton. The coarse-grained deposits of the
   potassium-pyroantimonate method have a more unspecific distribution.
   This is the only method which produces extracellular deposits in the
   inner ear, whereas in the optic tectum extracellular precipitates are
   always present except with the oxalate-pyroantimonate procedure. Two
   factors have an influence on the reaction product: the duration of
   fixation and the type of resin. The prolongation of the fixation time up
   to 24 hours leads to an increase of the reaction product, which also
   becomes coarse-grained. These observations are corroborated by
   quantification with image analysis. Furthermore the use of an epoxy
   resin compared to acrylic resins decreases the amount of reaction
   product produced. We show that the application of several methods is
   meaningful in order to understand the calcium properties of the
   investigated tissue, but it is necessary to optimize a certain method
   for a given tissue. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to compare thoracic aortic pathologies of
   30 patients with Marfan's syndrome and a group of 78 patients with
   arterial hypertension. With a mean age of 35 +/- 12 years, patients with
   Marfan's syndrome were younger than hypertensives (59 +/- 11) (p < 0.01)
   and Marfan's syndrome, women (52\%) were more frequently affected than
   in hypertensive patients (21\%; p < 0.05). While aortic dissection and
   intramural hemorrhage in patients with Marfan's syndrome were usually
   confined to the ascending thoracic aorta (62\%), in the hypertensive
   patients aortic disease frequently extended to distal segments of the
   thoracic or abdominal aorta (p < 0.05). Aortic pathology was complicated
   by aortic regurgitation in 95\% of the patients with Marfan's syndrome
   and in 56\% of the hypertensive patients (p < 0.01). Signs of renal,
   mesenteric or coronary malperfusion, cardiac effusion and severe
   hypotension (p < 0.05) were more frequently seen in the hypertensive
   group. While there was no early death in the Marfan group, only 67\% of
   the patients having aortic dissection or intramural hematoma survived
   the first 30 days in the hypertensive group (p < 0.01).
   Aortic dissection, intramural hematoma and aortic aneurysms were as
   often found in the Marfan's syndrome patients with 60\%, 10\%, and 30\%,
   as in patients with arterial hypertension with 55\%, 6\%, and 38\%
   (n.s.). One-year survival rates were high in patients with Marfan's
   syndrome (93\%) as well as in patients with arterial hypertension (73\%)
   (n.s.).
   The diagnosis of aortic dissection, intramural hematoma, and aneurysms
   could in all eases be established by the use of noninvasive imaging
   techniques, such as TEE, XCT, and MRI, Moreover, noninvasive imaging
   modalities were both highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of
   aortic regurgitation, pericardial effusion, or mediastinal hematoma
   complicating acute aortic disease.}},

Abstract = {{Intraoperative irradiation (IORT) is used to enhance local tumour
   control by using large, single doses while removing critical structures
   from the treatment field. Peripheral nerve remains a dose-limiting
   normal tissue that often cannot be removed from the field. To assess
   ultrastructural changes in canine sciatic nerve after IORT, computerized
   morphometric analysis of plastic sections and electron micrographs of
   nerve cross-sections was used. Surgically exposed sciatic nerves were
   irradiated with 6 MeV electrons to 12, 20 or 28 Gy. Twelve months after
   treatment dogs were killed humanely and the nerves from three dogs per
   dose group, including non-irradiated controls, were analyzed. Twelve
   months after 28-Gy IORT a significant decrease in nerve fiber density
   occurred. Nerve fiber loss was particularly prominent in the central
   portion of the nerve predominantly among large nerve fibers. Other nerve
   fiber parameters including fiber and axon area, diameter and perimeter,
   myelin thickness, form factor (measure of roundness), and G ratio (axon
   diameter/fiber diameter) did not show significant, dose-related changes.
   An increase in microtubule and neurofilament density in irradiated nerve
   axons was found. These changes are suggestive of radiation-induced
   hypoxia (damage to microvasculature) resulting in axon damage and
   subsequent nerve fiber loss as a possible mechanism of late radiation
   injury to peripheral nerve.}},

Abstract = {{Background. It was hypothesised that schizophrenic patients with tardive
   dyskinesia show an excess of neurodevelopmental disturbance,
   particularly minor physical anomalies, in association with cognitive
   dysfunction and abnormalities of cerebral structure.
   Method. Forty-seven out-patients with a DSM-III diagnosis of
   schizophrenia were examined for tardive dyskinesia using the Abnormal
   Involuntary Movement Scale; they were examined also for minor physical
   anomalies and neuropsychological test performance. Cortical atrophy,
   signal hyperintensities and lateral ventricular volume were determined
   on magnetic resonance Imaging.
   Results. Patients with and without tardive dyskinesia could not be
   distinguished by age, gender distribution or a number of clinical
   measures; however, patients with tardive dyskinesia sorted fewer
   categories on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (P=0.04). Cerebral
   structure in patients with and without tardive dyskinesia could not be
   distinguished on magnetic resonance imaging but those with dyskinesia,
   all of whom showed involvement of the orofacial region, showed more
   evident minor physical anomalies of the head relative to those of the
   periphery (P=0.02).
   Conclusions. Tardive orofacial dyskinesia in schizophrenia appears to be
   associated particularly with poorer frontal lobe function, while
   predominance of craniofacial dysmorphogenesis may constitute a
   vulnerability factor that is related to the early origins of the disease
   process.}},

Abstract = {{Cross-sectional data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation
   were used to estimate the impact of coresidence on the economic
   well-being of elderly widows and of coresident family members.
   Coresidence improves well-being for both the widow and the other
   participants in 51 percent of cases; improves it for the widow and
   diminishes it for the others in 28 percent of cases; and improves it for
   the others while diminishing it for the widow in 21 percent of cases.
   Among non-Whites, coresidence benefits the widow less, and other members
   more, than among Whites. A regression model of the economic benefit to
   elderly widows from coresidence was used to explain why non-White widows
   receive less benefit from coresidence than Whites. Much of the racial
   difference con be explained by differences in household composition and
   the lower earnings of adult males in the households of non-White elders.
   While coresidence is often thought of as a response to an elderly
   widow's needs, her presence typically contributes to rather than
   diminishes the economic well-being of the household, and this is
   especially true among non-Whites.}},

   M CdCl2, ZnCl2, MnCl2, FeCl2, CoCl2 and NiCl2. For each additive the
   protective cation was incorporated into the oxide film that formed on
   the metal surface during exposure to the solution tested. The cations
   added (Cd2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+ and Ni2+) caused a surface film to
   be developed that modified the susceptibility to corrosion by reducing
   the kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction at cathodic sites on the
   tin surface. It was found that a concentration of 10(-2) M of these ions
   inhibits the anodic Sn dissolution reaction by a factor of 2-3. The
   presence of the metal ions, more electronegative than the cathodic
   potential for the hydrogen evolution reaction on tin in the solution
   tested, inhibits the hydrogen evolution reaction and corrosion of Sn.
   This effect was explained by the underpotential deposition of adatoms of
   the metal complexing ions on the Sn electrode.}},

Abstract = {{We purified an iron-containing protein from Campylobacter jejuni using
   ultracentrifugation and ion-exchange chromatography. Electron microscopy
   of this protein revealed circular particles with a diameter of 11.5 nm
   and a central core with a diameter of 5.5 nm. The protein was composed
   of a single peptide of 21 kDa and did not serologically cross-react with
   horse spleen ferritin. The UV-visible spectrum of the protein showed no
   absorption peaks in the visible region, indicating that little or no
   heme is bound. The ratio of Fe:phosphate of C. jejuni ferritin was
   1.5:1. From these morphological and chemical examinations, we concluded
   that the C. jejuni purified protein is a ferritin of the same class as
   that of Helicobacter pylori and Bacteroides fragilis and differs from
   the heme-containing bacterioferritin of Escherichia coli. The 30
   N-terminal amino acids were sequenced and were found to resemble the
   sequences of other ferritins strongly (H. pylori ferritin, 73\%
   identity; B. fragilis ferritin, 50\% identity; E. coli gene-165 product,
   50\% identity), and to a lesser degree, bacterioferritins (E. coli
   bacterioferritin, 26\% identity; Azotobacter vinelandii, 26\% identity;
   horse spleen ferritin 30\% identity). Proteins that cross-reacted with
   antiserum against the ferritin of C. jejuni were found in other
   Campylobacter species and in H. pylori, but not in Vibrio, E. coli, or

   In either unloading protocol, both Hemopumps were used. It was shown
   that recovery from asynchrony was significantly faster in Groups 2 and 3
   if unloading was performed with the 21-F HP compared with control Group
   1 and the groups using the 14-F HP (p > 0.05). Thus, mechanical
   unloading with the 21-F Hemopump enhances recovery from stunning whereas
   unloading with the 14-F HP has only minor effects on hemodynamics and no
   effects on recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Observations during the past few decades indicate that the distribution
   of atmospheric ozone has been changing, notably decreases in the lower
   stratosphere around the globe and increases in the upper troposphere in
   the mid-to-high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. These changes can
   perturb the radiative forcing of the Earth-atmosphere climate system and
   thus raise the issue of atmospheric ozone as a climate gas. Here, we
   demonstrate the importance of ozone to climate by comparing general
   circulation model (GCM) simulated present climates between two
   atmospheric ozone climatologies: a version currently used in the NCAR
   GCM's (CCM1 and GENESIS) and an updated version. The new ozone
   climatology includes two improvements: the use of recent years'
   measurements from satellite (TOMS and SAGE) and ground-based ozonesondes
   and the consideration of longitudinal variations. Although the effect on
   the simulated global, annual mean surface air temperature is calculated
   to be small, the regional influences are quite substantial, especially
   at the middle and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere during
   winter. This suggests that atmospheric ozone is important in simulating
   the regional climate and observed ozone changes in the last few decades
   may have played an important role in affecting the climate. Note that to
   assess the climatic effect of ozone changes requires the GCM's to
   include interactive radiation-chemistry-dynamics interaction so that the
   ozone distribution can be consistently calculated.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyses the spatial distribution of rural services in
   selected regions of three states in India (Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra,
   and Tamil Nadu), based on data collected over three decades. In spite of
   economic disparities between regions, Christaller's Central Place Theory
   provides a framework in which to examine demographic, functional and
   spatial characteristics of settlements in these regions. In all regions,
   there has been a tremendous improvement in rural service provision,
   since the late 1960s, especially in smaller sized settlements. Over
   time, more complex services in particular, have become more widely
   available. In Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, the introduction of new
   agricultural technologies was largely responsible for stimulating such
   improvements, whereas in Maharashtra they were a consequence of urban
   industrial development in a metropolitan city. The government played a
   critical role in this process during the earlier stages of development
   of the regions, which facilitated greater involvement of the private
   sector at later stages. The changes in rural service provision are
   further examined in the context of decentralized service centre planning
   in India. The analysis suggests how the concepts and methodologies
   employed in this study might provide the basis for a more integrated
   regional approach to planning and policy formulation for rural service
   provision at the district level in India.}},

Abstract = {{We have reanalyzed 40 spectra of 25 Seyfert and narrow emission line
   galaxies (NELGs) and one QSO, all of which were obtained during the
   pointed observations phase (1978 May-1979 January) of the HEAO I A-2
   experiment. This investigation was prompted by Ginga results which
   indicate that Fe Ka lines are common X-ray spectral features of active
   galactic nuclei (AGNs) and that a high-energy `'bump'' associated with
   reprocessing of nuclear radiation may be common as well. The HEAO I
   data, which cover the 2-40 keV energy band, provide a large sample of
   AGNs with which to test the Ginga results. New analysis techniques are
   employed which consist of simultaneous fitting of data from both the
   medium-energy (2-20 keV) and high-energy (3-40 keV) detectors, as well
   as the subtracting of summed background spectra (up to 230,000 s of
   data) in order to improve the ratio of signal to noise. These improved
   techniques have resulted in the detection of Fe K features and/or
   spectral flattening above similar to 5-10 keV in similar to 75\% of the
   HEAO I sample. This confirms the Ginga result that spectral complexity
   is common in the X-ray spectra of Seyfert galaxies.
   We find that strong Fe K lines tend not to be associated with the
   presence of high-energy flattening, implying that Fe Ka emission is not
   entirely the result of fluorescence from accretion disks. Our spectral
   results typically agree with Ginga for overlapping sources for which we
   have adequate signal-to-noise ratios, although we find a significantly
   larger reflection component in IC 4329A, NGC 5506, and Mrk 509. For IC
   4329A and NGC 5506, a time lag in the response of the reflection
   component to variability in the intrinsic source flux can explain the
   presence of more reflection, since the sources were fainter during the
   HEAO 1 epoch. A similar effect can explain the larger reflection
   component in Mrk 509, provided the continuum underwent a flux outburst
   before or during HEAO 1 epoch.}},

Abstract = {{Aims/Background-Ischaemic retinopathy is a well characterised
   complication of bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Although the
   aetiology is unclear, it is most probably multifactorial, and may be
   related to treatment such as radiation and cyclosporin A. The clinical
   findings are reported of two patients who developed such a retinopathy
   and the ocular histology from one of these cases is presented.
   Methods-Two patients underwent BMT for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia,
   receiving campath-1G for prophylaxis against graft versus host disease,
   and showed fundal changes compatible with BMT retinopathy. The eyes from
   one patient were retrieved at post mortem and examined by both light and
   electron microscopy.
   Results-The visual symptoms and fundal signs resolved spontaneously with
   no specific treatment in one patient. Light and electron microscopic
   examination of the eyes of the other patient was compatible with an
   ischaemic aetiology and showed evidence of retinal capillary endothelial
   loss.
   Conclusions-(i) Histopathology in one case of BMT retinopathy
   demonstrates a retinal endotheliopathy similar to that described in
   radiation retinopathy. (ii) BMT retinopathy may occur in the absence of
   cyclosporin A treatment. (iii) The retinopathy can recover spontaneously
   with no specific treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Bilateral long-term surface cortical cerebral blood flow (CBF) and
   electrocorticographic (ECoG) monitoring were performed in eight patients
   with complex partial seizures. In each patient, the epileptic temporal
   lobe was localized using ictal ECoG. Mean seizure interval
   (frequency(-1)) off anticonvulsant medication, a clinical measure of
   epileptogenicity, was 1.0 +/- 0.3 h (range: 0.4 to 2.5 h). During 13
   interictal hyperventilation periods, 3.6 +/- 0.6 min in duration, the
   mean decrease in epileptic and nonepileptic temporal cortical CBF was
   13.7 +/- 2.3 versus 6.4 +/- 1.9 ml/(100g min) (t = 2.230, d.f. = 16, P <
   0.05), representing 20.9\% and 10.8\% reduction from baseline CBF during
   hyperventilation, respectively. Seizure interval decreased (i.e.
   frequency increased) with increasing magnitude of seizure focus CBF
   reduction during hyperventilation. Seizure interval was significantly
   correlated with epileptic temporal lobe CBF decrease during
   hyperventilation (R = 0.763, d.f. = 5, P < 0.05). The data suggest that,
   compared to nonepileptic brain, epileptic temporal lobe is particularly
   prone to hypoperfusion during hyperventilation. Epileptogenicity is a
   function of this seizure focus susceptibility to ischemia. The finding
   of abnormal seizure focus autoregulation during hyperventilation has
   implication for epileptic focus localization with cerebral blood flow
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of stone pavements, a ubiquitous gravel armor mantling
   landforms in arid regions of the world, has been previously attributed
   to erosion by wind and water or alternating shrinking and swelling of
   soil horizons, implying that gravel is concentrated at the land surface
   in a time-transgressive manner. A newly proposed model for pavement
   evolution differs from these models in that pavement clasts are
   continuously maintained at the land surface in response to deposition
   and pedogenic modification of windblown dust. In-situ cosmogenic He-3
   surface-exposure ages on volcanic and alluvial landforms in the Mojave
   Desert of California are used to understand pavement evolution over
   geologic time scales and to test this new model. These exposure ages are
   stratigraphically consistent, show internal consistency at each site,
   and, for stone pavements adjacent to pristine, continuously exposed
   volcanic bedrock, are indistinguishable at the 1 sigma level. We
   conclude that stone pavements are born at the surface and that pavements
   may provide one of the longest-term records of geologic, hydrologic, and
   climatic processes operating on desert surfaces.}},

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with known or suspected BPFs

   air leaks. Fourteen patients also underwent thin-section CT.
   RESULTS: The BPF or its probable cause was visualized in all patients
   with air and fluid collections and in two of the patients with air
   leaks. BPFs due to bronchiectasis, necrotizing pneumonia, or alveolar
   cell carcinoma were identified in 10 patients. In four others,
   bronchiectasis was seen but the actual communication was not. In seven
   patients with postoperative air leaks, standard or thin-section CT
   demonstrated the air-leak source in only one. Thin-section CT was
   superior to standard CT in six of eight patients in whom the BPF or its
   probable cause was visible.
   CONCLUSION: Standard and thin-section CT are useful in the diagnosis and
   management of peripheral BPFs.}},

   during insertion. Scanning electron microscopy was used to view the
   pin-bone interface to assess the microdamage during placement. The
   design of the tip of the pin influenced insertion torque and heat
   generation. Higher heat generation was measured when a thermocouple was
   placed within the pin itself and less was measured when thermocouple
   probes were placed within bone samples 0.5 mm from the impending pin
   track. Furthermore, insertion torque and thermal responses were related,
   but there were no significant differences in microdamage to bone when
   different pins and drilling/tapping techniques were used. Due to the
   significant heat generation at the pin-bone interface, proper cooling
   with saline irrigation should be applied during pin insertion regardless
   of the design of the pin. The microdamage observed at the surface of the
   pin track may have significant implications with regard to loosening of
   pins, but such effects must be studied with in vivo models.}},

   `'typical'' hepatic arterial anatomy occurs in only 55\% of the
   population, and numerous variants exist; the standard classification
   system for hepatic arterial anatomy includes 10 variations. After
   helical scanning, postprocessing with reconstruction algorithms such as
   shaded surface display and maximum-intensity projection provides highly
   graphic, easily understandable views of vascular anatomy. The 3D CT
   angiograms, with their global view of the anatomy and inherent advantage
   of volumetric rotation of the vascular system, are useful to surgeons

Abstract = {{One hundred sixty-hive otosclerotic patients who underwent a stapedotomy

   postoperative days; in these cases, special treatment was not necessary.
   However, in twelve patients in whom vertigo persisted even after their
   stay in the hospital, the problem seriously affected their quality of
   life and their return to work. In these cases, an individualized
   diagnostic and therapeutic procedure was indicated. Case reports
   demonstrate the usefulness of several diagnostic methods (analysis of
   the case history, audiogram, investigation of the vestibular system, and
   elimination of non-vestibular causes of vertigo. But only
   high-resolution computed tomography scans of the temporal bone showed
   definite results. Air bubbles at the end of the prothesis as indirect
   sign of perilymphatic fistula, bad position of the piston, new centers
   of otosclerosis, cicatrices, and in one case fracture of the prothesis.
   Ten of the twelve patients required revision surgery. In most patients
   with persisting vertigo following stapedotomy, revision surgery was
   justified. However, high-resolution computed tomography is recommended.}},

Number = {{1, 1}},

Abstract = {{Wolf-Chase, Walker, \& Lada (1995, hereafter WWL) found that most of the
   CS J = 2-->1 emission in the Mon OB1 dark cloud is concentrated in two
   regions they refer to as the South Cloud (SCL) and North Cloud (NCL).
   These regions encompass five of the 10 outflows previously identified in
   CO by Margulis, Lada, and Snell (1988). The spatial morphologies of the
   CS J = 5-->4 and CS J = 7-->6 emission regions in the SCL (WWL) are
   significantly different from those of the CS J = 2-->1 emission.
   Velocity centroid plots of the CS J = 2-->1 and CS J = 5-->4 emission in
   the line cores indicate that the upper transition primarily traces dense
   core material, but the lower transition primarily traces dense outflow
   material.
   We have found that the CS J = 2-->1 transition traces a large portion of
   the dense, low-velocity component of outflows in the Mon OB1 dark cloud.
   The outflows are identifiable through non-Gaussian, asymmetric wings in
   the CS J = 2-->1 lines. This outflow component is not identifiable in CO
   because the gas in the asymmetric CS line wings is moving at velocities
   which lie within the core of the much broader CO lines. Two of the
   outflows which were previously classified as monopolar in CO (Margulis
   et al. 1988) appear bipolar in CS. We find the mass of this component to
   be about an order of magnitude greater than previous estimates of the
   low-velocity outflow component.
   Comparison of the masses derived for the CS outflows to the masses
   derived by WWL for the total CS emission in the SCL and NCL indicate
   that at least 20\% of the material in the SCL has been entrained in
   outflows, and approximately 25\%-50\% of the material in the NCL is
   associated with a rotating cloud swept up by an outflow. The addition of
   the low-velocity CS outflow component to previous estimates of outflow
   energetics implies that multiple generations of outflows need not be
   required to support this cloud against collapse. Our results neither
   support nor rule out the existence of fossil outflows in this cloud. A
   fully sampled, unbiased survey of the cloud is required to search for
   such outflows.}},

   proximal and distal small intestine are not clearly understood. We
   determined the dose-dependent effects of duodenal and distal ileal
   infusions of glucose and oleic acid on meal patterns in ad libitum
   feeding rats. Rats with cannulas in both the duodenum and ileum received
   a 2-h infusion of glucose (0, 800, 1,600, 3,200, 6,400, or 12,800 mu
   mol/h) or oleic acid (0, 48, 240, 640, or 1,280 mu mol/h) into the
   duodenum or ileum at the start of the dark period, and meal patterns
   were monitored for 4 h. Cumulative food intake was inhibited dose
   dependently by ileal as well as duodenal infusion of both glucose and
   oleic acid. Ileal glucose was more inhibitory than duodenal glucose,
   whereas duodenal oleic acid was more inhibitory than ileal oleic acid.
   Duodenal glucose and oleic acid inhibited feeding by decreasing meal
   frequency; ileal oleic acid decreased only meal size, whereas ileal
   glucose reduced both meal size and frequency. We interpret these results
   to suggest that ileal oleic acid and glucose suppress feeding by
   different mechanisms and that these mechanisms differ from those
   mediating the anorexic responses to oleic acid and glucose in the
   duodenum.}},

Abstract = {{During the principate of Caligula, women of the imperial family achieved
   unprecedented public honors.  The vilification of this hated emperor in
   later tradition, however, tends to follow a predictable format that
   includes charges of disregard for the most sacred taboos, in particular
   the prohibition against incest.  The reputations of Caligula's sisters
   have consequently suffered `'collateral damage'' that distorts their
   true historical significance.  This paper supplements a critical reading
   of the ancient historianswith the iconographical evidence of coins and
   of sculpture, in which Caligulan portrait types for Agrippina II and
   Drusilla can be at least tentatively distinguished.
   I contend that Caligula's sisters owed their public honors to their
   potential to bear Julian children.  Drusilla, the heir to Caligula's
   imperium in his will of A.D. 37, was probably intended to produce male
   heirs while her husband wielded actual power.  Her deification after her
   untimely death was an attempt to make the best of dynastic disaster by
   keeping her in public imagery as a symbolic genetrix of the Julians. 
   Provincial coinages suggest that the consecration was well received,
   while the public presentation of all three sisters in statuary groups
   seems to grow logically from existing practices among aristocratic
   private families.  Caligula's glorification of his sisters, like his
   demand for divine honors, appears to have been a rational decision later
   distorted by hostile writers as evidence of psychotic arrogance.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the prevalence, characteristics, and correlates of
   mania among referred children aged 12 or younger. Many case reports
   challenge the widely accepted belief that childhood-onset mania is rare.
   Sources of diagnostic confusion include the variable developmental
   expression of mania and its symptomatic overlap with attention-deficit
   hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Method: The authors compared 43 children
   aged 12 years or younger who satisfied criteria for mania, 164 ADHD
   children without mania, and 84 non-ADHD control children. Results: The
   clinical picture was fully compatible with the DSM-III-R diagnosis of
   mania in 16\% (n = 43) of referred children. All but one of the children
   meeting criteria for mania also met criteria for ADHD. Compared with
   ADHD children without mania, manic children had significantly higher
   rates of major depression, psychosis, multiple anxiety disorders,
   conduct disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder as well as evidence
   of significantly more impaired psychosocial functioning. In addition,
   21\% (n = 9) of manic children had had at least one previous psychiatric
   hospitalization. Conclusions: Mania may be relatively common among
   psychiatrically referred children. The clinical picture of
   childhood-onset mania is very severe and frequently comorbid with ADHD
   and other psychiatric disorders. Because of the high comorbidity with
   ADHD, more work is needed to clarify whether these children have ADHD,
   bipolar disorder, or both.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To investigate the relationship of infant feeding to
   recurrent wheezing at age 6 years and to assess whether this
   relationship is altered by a history of wheezing lower respiratory tract
   illnesses.
   Design: Prospective, longitudinal study of healthy infants followed up
   from birth to 6 years of age.
   Setting: Nonselected health maintenance organization population in
   Tucson, Arizona.
   Participants: There were 1246 healthy infants enrolled at birth, 988 of
   whom whom had data on both infant feeding and wheezing at age 6 years.
   Interventions: None.
   Main Outcome Measures: Recurrent wheeze (four or more episodes in the
   past year) was assessed by a questionnaire that was completed by parents
   when the children were 6 years old. Children were classified by atopic
   status on the basis of skin prick tests.
   Results: Breast-feeding information was collected prospectively, and
   lower respiratory tract illnesses in the first 3 years of life were
   diagnosed by the pediatrician. Being breast-fed was associated with
   lower rates of recurrent wheeze at age 6 years (3.1\% vs 9.7\%, P<.01)
   for nonatopic children; this relationship was not significant for atopic
   children. The relationship of breast-feeding with recurrent wheeze was
   apparent among nonatopic children both with and without a wheezing lower
   respiratory tract illness in the first 6 months of life. When potential
   confounders, including early wheezing lower respiratory tract illness,
   were included in a multivariate model, nonatopic children who had not
   been breast-fed had three times the odds of wheezing recurrently (odds
   ratio, 3.03; confidence interval, 1.06 to 8.69). Eleven percent of
   recurrent wheeze among nonatopic children could be attributed to not
   breast-feeding.
   Conclusions: Recurrent wheeze at age 6 years is less common among
   nonatopic children who were breast-fed as infants. This effect is
   independent of whether the child wheezed with a lower respiratory tract
   illness in the first 6 months of life.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to find out if reinfection or recrudescence
   accounted for the recurrence of Helicobacter pylori infections after
   apparent eradication of the bacterium. Three hundred and twenty patients
   were treated with colloidal bismuth subcitrate (120 mg four times daily
   for four weeks), metronidazole and tetracycline (400 mg and 500 mg,
   respectively, thrice daily for the first week). H pylori was eradicated
   four weeks after the end of treatment as assessed by the rapid urease
   test, histological examination, Gram staining, and culture. However, the
   infection recurred in 29 (9.1\%) of the patients one year after apparent
   eradication. Pre and posteradication isolates from five patients were
   available. DNA was extracted and used for restriction endonuclease
   analysis with Hind III and Hae III, and for polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR) based randomly amplified polymorphic DNA fingerprinting with a
   combination of two 10 nucleotide primers. Sodium dodecyl sulphate
   polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis was performed also. Randomly
   amplified polymorphic DNA fingerprinting was unique in that it yielded
   highly discriminatory fingerprints, which showed that the pretreatment
   and recurrent isolates obtained from each of the five patients were
   indistinguishable from one another. This shows that recurrence of H
   pylori infection is probably caused by recrudescence and that the
   discriminatory power of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA
   fingerprinting is a practicable and discriminatory typing scheme for H
   pylori.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between blood flow in the working leg and cardiac
   output (Q) response was determined for patients with chronic heart
   failure. The ratio of leg blood flow (LBF) to Q (LBF/Q) at the same
   workload during submaximal exercise was significantly different in three
   groups of patients classified by peak cardiac index: it was 0.22 +/-
   0.08 in the `satisfactory' Q group vs 0.33 +/- 0.09 in the moderate Q
   group, and 0.38 +/- 0.08 in the poor Q group (P<0.01) in the first stage
   of exercise. Delta LBF/Delta Q the slope of change in leg blood flow to
   Q from rest to peak exercise, was significantly larger in the poor Q
   group than in the satisfactory Q group (P<0.01). The intergroup
   arteriovenous oxygen difference (AVO(2)D) in organs other than the leg
   was large, while that in the working leg was small. Leg vascular
   resistance at submaximal workload was similar in the three groups, but
   vascular resistance in other organs was significantly higher in the poor
   Q group than in the satisfactory Q group (P<0.001). These findings
   suggested that metabolic vasodilating stimuli in the working leg
   attenuated excessive vasoconstriction and caused a shift in blood flow
   from other organs to the working leg under conditions of severely
   reduced Q response.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on controlled release dosage forms were conducted by using waxy
   materials for a newly developed anti-allergy drug,
   6-methyl-N-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-2-pyridinecarboxamide (TA-5707F), which is
   not maintained at an effective level in blood for a long duration. Four
   kinds of tablets were prepared by changing the amount of hydrogenated
   oil (K3 wax) and polyethyleneglycol-6000 in the tablets. Then, they were
   administered orally to beagle dogs, and the TA-5707F concentration in
   the plasma was determined by a HPLC method. The pharmacokinetic
   parameters were estimated and compared with the results of the in vitro
   dissolution test determined by the JP paddle method and by the
   disintegration method. The linearity between the in vivo mean
   dissolution time (MDT) and in vitro MDT was good in both in vitro
   dissolution methods. However, the MDTs obtained by the disintegration
   method mere one-third of the in pipe MDT, while those obtained by the
   paddle methods were 3 times higher. This suggests that both the
   diffusion of TA-5707F through the waxy matrix and the erosion of the max
   matrix caused by the gastrointestinal (GI) tract mobility contributed to
   the in vivo dissolution mechanism.
   The blood levels were very low when the tablet was administered after
   giving food. The prolongation of resident time in the stomach and the
   low solubility of TA-5707F in an acidic medium seemed to be related to
   the phenomena. By the depression of GI motility using propantheline
   bromide, the blood levels could be markedly prolonged and the area under
   the plasma concentration-time curve (AUG) increased 1.3 times.}},

Abstract = {{To understand the importance of oxygen transport to the inner ear
   tissue, we studied, in guinea pigs, the relationship between cochlear
   blood flow and endocochlear direct-current potential (EP) under
   different respiratory conditions. EP, a functional parameter of the
   stria vascularis, was recorded by a microelectrode inserted into the
   lateral wall of the chochlea. To measure the cochlear blood flow (CoBF),
   we employed laser Doppler flowmetry and recorded the flow with a probe
   placed on the same spot on the lateral wall. During 3 min of asphyxia,
   CoBF and systemic blood pressure showed irregular biphasic increases,
   while the EP decreased to reach a negative value. In the hypoxemia
   experiment, which was induced by stepwise reduction of the respiratory
   rate to 60\%, increases in CoBF and blood pressure were evident during
   hypoventilation with an intermediate position of EP in the positive
   range. The mechanisms of these increases in two parameters are discussed
   from the viewpoints of sympathicotonic activity in the autonomic nervous
   system and the vasodilating action of CO2 during hypercapnia. In the
   hyperoxemia experiment, which was induced by stepwise increase in the
   respiratory rate to 140\%, CoBF and blood pressure were found to
   decrease during hyper-ventilation with no significant change of EP. The
   decrease in blood pressure was considered to be due to the increase in
   intrathoracic pressure caused by the increased rate of artificial
   respiration. As for the concomitant decrease in CoBF, chemical
   regulation of PCO2 in the vascular bed of the lateral wall of the
   cochlea was thought to be a contributory factor.}},

Abstract = {{Sensory tests and analysis on extractive components were carried out to
   clarify the off-flavor components in raw and boiled muscles of American
   jumbo squid.
   The results of the sensory tests indicated that strong salty, sour,
   bitter, and fishy tastes were characteristic to the off-flavor of
   American jumbo squid, and such tastes were the main factor of
   unacceptability of the raw mucle as food. Boiling of the muscle hardly
   improved the acceptability.
   Although VBN contents were very high, TMA and polyamines contents were
   still low, suggesting that the American jumbo squid used in the present
   experiment was not at the stage of decomposition. The high level of VBN
   was primarily due to ammonia. The pH values (less than 6.7) and the
   amount of chloride ion suggest the existence of ammonium chloride in the
   squid muscle. Therefore, the off-flavor of American jumbo squid seems to
   be due to the saltiness and bitterness of ammonium chloride.
   In addition, the significantly low level of free amino acids was not
   enough to mask the off-favor of American jumbo squid.}},

   patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The two genes involved in
   the t(8;21) have been recently isolated and the cDNA of the AML1/ETO
   fusion gene identified. We have investigated a series of AML and MDS
   patients by a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
   and analyzed the clinical and laboratory features of leukemia with
   t(8;21). The t(8;21) was only found in a subset of M2, which had the
   clinical and hematological features distinct from those M2 without
   t(8;21). M2 with t(8;21) was associated with a significantly higher
   myeloid differentiation and with a good response to chemotherapy.
   Moreover, among the patients with refractory anemia with excess of
   blasts in transformation (RAEB-T) the t(8;21) was also significantly
   associated with a higher myeloid differentiation and a good response to
   chemotherapy. M2 patients with t(8;21) could be distinguished on a
   number of hematological parameters, eg white blood cell count and
   percentage of bone marrow myeloblasts and promyelocytes, from RAEB-T
   carrying the t(8;21). Based on these findings we suggest that leukemia
   patients carrying t(8;21) can be grouped into two types: overt acute
   myeloid leukemia (M2) and smoldering or slowly evolving myeloid

Abstract = {{Tri-tert-butyltrihydroxy{[}3.3.3]metacyclophane 13 was prepared in 6
   steps from p-tert-butylanisole in 25\% overall yield by using the TosMIC
   method, followed by Wolff-Kishner reduction and demethylation with boron
   tribromide. AlCl3/MeNO(2)-catalyzed trans-tert-butylation of 13 in
   benzene gave the desired metacyclophane 14 in 85\% yield, along with
   tert-butylbenzene (15). Weak intramolecular hydrogen bonding was
   observed in the triols 13 and 14. -
   6,15,24-Tritert-butyl-9,18,27-trihydroxy{[}3.3.3]MCP 13 was
   tri-O-alkylated with alkyl halides (RX: R = Et, Pr, and Bu) in the
   presence of Cs2CO3 to yield partial-cone confomer 12b-d in quantitative
   yield. Ring inversion by oxygen-through-the-annulus rotation is allowed
   for triethoxy derivative 12b (coalescence temperature ca. 90 degrees C)
   but inhibited for the tripropoxy-12c and the tributoxy derivative 12d.
   The reaction of the triol 13 with ethyl bromoacetate in the presence of
   Cs2CO3 yielded cone and partial-cone 12e, respectively. In contrast, a
   significant amount of cone conformer 12f resulted when NaH was used as
   base. Only when the template metal can hold the ester or amide group(s)
   and the oxide group(s) on the same side of the {[}3.3.3]MCP is the
   conformation immobilized to the cone. - Titration of cone amide cone-12f
   with KSCN monitored by H-1 NMR clearly demonstrates that a 1:1 complex
   is formed which is stable on the NMR time scale, and the original C-3
   symmetry is retained after the complete metal cation complexation. - The
   stability of multimembered carbon skeletons permits the interconversion
   of functional groups without special regard to ring-opening side
   reactions as was observed for homotrioxacalix{[}3]arenes with ethereal
   Linkages. For example, the introduction of nitro groups was accomplished
   on the upper rim by direct three-fold ipso-nitration of
   tert-butyltrimethoxy derivative 12a.}},

Abstract = {{Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) catalyzes the carboxylation of
   acetyl-CoA, forming malonyl-CoA a key intermediate in the biosynthesis
   of fatty acids and a variety of secondary metabolites. Based upon amino
   acid sequences conserved among rat, chicken, and E. coli ACCases,
   PCR-primers were used to amplify a genomic fragment which codes for an
   ACCase of Arabidopsis. The resulting fragment was used for isolation of
   genomic and cDNA clones. We have determined the complete cDNA sequence
   coding for an Arabidopsis ACCase consists of 2,254 amino acids with the
   molecular mass of 251 kDa. This enzyme contains no recognizable plastid
   transit-peptide sequence. Therefore, this ACCase is presumably the
   cytosolic isozyme. Southern analysis indicates that there are two ACCase
   genes in the Arabidopsis genome. Surprisingly, the results of RFLP
   analysis and physical mapping of the isolated genomic clones demonstrate
   that these two genes, acc1 and acc2, are contiguously located within a
   25-kbp genomic region near the middle of chromosome 1. Both genes are
   transcriptionally active, as transcripts from each gene were detected by
   reverse transcription-PCR analysis using gene-specific primers. The acc1
   and acc2 transcripts accumulate in leaves and seedlings but only the
   acc1 transcript accumulates in developing siliques, unexpectedly. The
   differences in the expression patterns may be indicative of the
   differential role of the two genes.}},

Abstract = {{In an attempt to retard the rapid clearance rate of pro-urokinase
   (pro-UK), we prepared pro-UK mutants (m-pro-UK) with a mutation in the
   epidermal growth factor-like domain. These comprised of three deletion
   mutants (del pro-UK) and 14 amino acid-substituted mutants (sub pro-UK),
   This paper describes the thrombolytic properties of m-pro-UKs in
   comparison with those of pro-UK.
   In human plasma clot lysis assay, del pro-UKs had shown much less plasma
   clot lysis activity than pro-UK, while 7 out of 14 sub-pro-UKs showed
   activity comparable to that of pro-UK. In the present experiment, all
   m-pro-UKs were i.v. injected as a bolus to rats with pulmonary embolism,
   Eight of the sub pro-UKs showed significantly higher thrombolysis than
   pro-UK, whereas del pro-UKs caused slightly less thrombolysis, The two
   sub pro-UKs G38K and N32P, in which glycine at 38th position and
   asparagine at 32nd position were replaced by lysine and proline
   respectively, showed the most marked thrombolytic effect in the rat
   model, Their efficacy was then tested in a rabbit model of
   arterio-venous shunt thrombosis through injection as a bolus, Both were
   also found to have significantly higher thrombolytic activities than
   pro-UK in the rabbit model.
   Sub pro-UK's having higher thrombolytic activity than pro-UK were
   divisible into two groups: those with prolonged half-lives and those
   with undiminished or enhanced fibrin/celite affinity,}},

Abstract = {{The roles of phytochrome A (phyA), phytochrome B (phyB) and a putative
   blue-light (BL) photoreceptor (HY4) in the control of hypocotyl growth
   by natural radiation were investigated using phyA, phyB and hy4 mutants
   of Arabidopsis thaliana. Full sunlight inhibited hypocotyl growth to a
   larger extent in wild-type (WT) than in phyA, phyB and, particularly,
   hy4 seedlings, In WT seedlings, hypocotyl growth was promoted by
   selectively lowering BL irradiance, lowering red-light (R) plus
   far-red-light (FR) irradiance or lowering the R/FR ratio (which was
   achieved either by increasing FR or by reducing R). The effects of
   lowering BL were reduced in hy4 and exaggerated in phyA seedlings, The
   effects of lowering R+FR were reduced in phyA and exaggerated in hy4
   seedlings, Neither phyB nor hy4 mutants responded to low R/FR ratios,
   Neighbouring plants reflecting FR without shading caused subtle
   reductions of the R/FR ratio, This signal promoted hypocotyl growth in
   WT but not in phyA, phyB or hy4 seedlings, Intermediate canopy shade
   produced similar effects in all genotypes, Under deep shade,
   de-etiolation was severely impaired in phyA seedlings, which died
   prematurely, Thus, the FR `high-irradiance reaction' mediated by phyA
   could be important for seedling survival under dense canopies.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in
   human serum is frequently used to detect tumor recurrence in patients
   with resected primary colorectal cancers. These levels are highly
   variable from patient to patient, and the mechanism that determines
   these levels is still poorly understood.
   Methods: Using a 6-h in vitro CEA-release assay, we determined that a
   factor in human and fetal bovine sera signifrcantly augments the release
   of CEA from the tumor cell surface into cell culture supernatants.
   Results: As little as 1\% serum admired with tumor cells results in CEA
   release up to 200\% greater than that of serum-free controls. It is not
   inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline or heat inactivation (of serum) but is
   calcium dependent. The electrophoretic mobility and membrane linkage of
   CEA released by serum appear to be identical to those of CEA released by
   bacterial phospholipase C. Because bacterial phospholipase C is known
   specifically to cleave the phosphoinositol (PI) glycan moiety that
   anchors CEA to the tumor cell surface, a mechanism of action for serum
   cleaving this anchor is suggested.
   Conclusions: The large range of CEA levels observed in patients with
   colorectal cancers may be related to differential sensitivity of the CEA
   membrane anchor to the CEA-releasing factor in serum.}},

Abstract = {{The reformulation of the mode-coupling theory (MCT) of the liquid-glass

   the hard-sphere system. It is shown that the glass transition in this
   system is not a sharp one at the special value of the density or the
   packing fraction, which is in contrast to the prediction by the
   conventional MCT. Instead we find that the slowing down of the dynamics
   occurs over a range of values of the packing fraction. Consequently, the
   exponents governing the sequence of time relaxations in the intermediate
   time regime are given as functions of the packing fraction, with one
   additional parameter that describes the overall scale of the metastable
   potential energy for defects in the hard-sphere system. Implications of
   the present model on the recent experiments on colloidal systems are
   also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The fliD genes of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli encode the
   filament-cap protein of the flagellar apparatus, which facilitates the
   polymerization of endogenous flagellin at the tips of the growing
   filaments. Previous sequence analysis of this operon in both organisms
   has revealed that the fliD gene constitutes an operon together with two
   additional genes, fliS and fliT. Based on the gene-disruption experiment
   in E. coli, both the fliS and fliT genes have been postulated to be
   necessary for flagellation, In the present study, we constructed S.
   typhimurium mutants in which either fliS or fliT on the chromosome was
   specifically disrupted. Both mutants were found to produce functional
   flagella, indicating that these genes are dispensable for motility
   development in S. typhimurium. However, flagellar filaments produced by
   the fliS mutant were much shorter than those produced by the wild-type
   strain. This indicates that the fliS mutation affects the elongation
   step of filament assembly. The excretion efficiency of flagellin was
   examined in the fliD-mutant background, where the exported flagellin
   molecules cannot assemble onto the hooks, resulting in their excretion
   into the culture media. We found that the amount of flagellin excreted
   was much reduced by the fliS mutation. Based on these results, we
   conclude that FliS facilitates the export of flagellin through the
   flagellum-specific export pathway.}},

Abstract = {{The inoculum potential of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi,
   spore abundance, and the VAM fungi colonization levels of young feeder
   roots in sugar maple (Acer saccharum, Marsh.) were investigated in four
   Vermont sugar maple forest stands for which different levels of crown
   dieback status previously were estimated. Physical and chemical
   properties of soils were determined and the relationships between these
   properties and maple root colonization and spore abundance were
   investigated, Propagule densities, estimated by a greenhouse assay,
   ranged from 0.03 to 5.23 propagules g(-1) dry soil among four study
   sites and were strongly correlated (r(2) = 0.704, P < 0.01) with VAM
   fungi colonization levels in maple roots. Colonization levels ranged
   from 9 to 30\% of root length. The VAM fungi structures most frequently
   observed were intracellular coiled hyphae and arbuscules; vesicles were
   rarely seen. Counts of VAM fungi spores in the four forest soils ranged
   from 118 to 217 spores g(-1) dry soil. The most frequently occurring
   species at all four sites were Glomus rubiforme and Glomus fasciculatum.
   The site with the greatest crown dieback had the lowest viable propagule
   density and the lowest VAM fungi colonization levels in maple feeder
   roots, However, the two sites with relatively little dieback differed
   markedly in their VAM status. Therefore, no clear relationship between
   sugar maple VAM and forest dieback was indicated.
   Correlation and multiple regression analyses suggested that
   concentration of soil potassium was the key predictor for variations
   observed in colonization levels and for the occurrence of arbuscules in
   root cortex cells. Spore abundance was correlated with concentrations of
   soil available and reserve phosphorus and soil pH. The difference in
   concentrations of soil potassium between the two sites with little
   dieback might explain the considerable difference in mycorrhizal
   formation on those sites.}},

Abstract = {{GT1-7 cells, a clonal line derived from specific tumours of
   gonadotropin-releasing hormone-secreting neurons from mouse
   hypothalamus, were used as a model system to investigate the cellular
   mechanisms underlying the histamine H-1 receptor-mediated
   desensitisation. GT1-7 cells contain H-1 receptors, acute stimulation of
   which leads to the desensitisation of histamine-mediated calcium
   mobilisation and is manifest as a concurrent reduction in both the
   magnitude of the calcium transient and of the sustained phase. Acute
   pretreatment of the cells with the phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate
   13-acetate, can also ablate the histamine-stimulated calcium
   mobilisation. In addition, acute H-1-receptor stimulation and acute
   phorbol ester treatment result in the attenuation of histamine-mediated
   inositol phosphate production. Receptor desensitisation resulting from
   acute stimulation with histamine is not affected by inhibiting protein
   kinase C (PKC) activity with Ro 31-7549 or staurosporine. In contrast,
   the desensitisation of H-1-receptor responses induced by direct
   activation of protein kinase C is preventable by PKC inhibitors. Thus,
   these results imply that a PKC-dependent mechanism and PKC-independent
   mechanism are involved in the H-1-receptor desensitisation cascade in
   GT1-7 cells and do not support the involvement of PKC in the
   receptor-mediated desensitisation of H-1 receptor-stimulated calcium and
   inositol phosphate responses.}},

Abstract = {{High-altitude residence during pregnancy is associated with an increased
   incidence of preeclampsia. To determine whether uteroplacental blood
   flow was reduced and pelvic blood flow distribution altered before the
   onset of hypertension, we measured common iliac (CI), uterine (UA), and
   external iliac (EI) artery flow velocities (FV), indexes of flow
   distribution, and blood volume (BV) at week 12, 24, and 36 of pregnancy
   and 6 mo postpartum in 23 normotensive, 7 preeclamptic, 5 transiently
   hypertensive, and 3 chronically hypertensive residents of 3,100 m.
   Normotensive women had a progressive increase in CIFV and UAFV, decrease
   in EIFV, redistribution of CIFV from the EI to the UA, and increase in
   BV with advancing pregnancy. Preeclamptic women attained maximal UAFV
   and redistribution of CIFV from the EI to the UA well before the onset
   of hypertension and, unlike normotensive women, showed no further
   increases near term. Plasma volume increment with pregnancy related to
   the fall in the EIFV/CIFV ratio. Transiently hypertensive women
   resembled normotensive subjects in the parameters measured, whereas
   chronically hypertensive subjects resembled preeclamptic subjects. We
   concluded that preeclamptic vs. normotensive pregnant residents of high
   altitude had less redistribution of CI flow to the UA and no increase in
   UA blood flow near term. That these differences were present before the
   onset of hypertension supports the concept that preeclampsia is
   characterized by an incomplete vascular adjustment to pregnancy.}},

Abstract = {{We have previously reported on the successful engraftment and long-term
   multilineage expression (erythroid, myeloid, lymphoid) of human adult
   marrow CD34(+)HLA-DR(-) cells in sheep after transplantation in utero.
   The persistence in these animals of CD34(+)HLA-DR(-) cells, the
   phenotype of the original graft, and the presence of assayable high
   proliferative potential colony-forming cells (HPP-CFCs), a primitive
   progenitor cell that has self-renewal capacity and multilineage
   differentiative capacity, suggested that these chimeric animals
   continued to contain human pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).
   To test this hypothesis, CD45(+) cells from the bone marrow of such an
   animal were isolated by panning at 19 and 24 months after birth, were
   pooled, and were transplanted into 4 preimmune sheep fetuses (0.6 x
   10(6) viable cells per fetus). Three of the sheep were born alive, Bone
   marrow from one of these secondary recipients (lamb 58) exhibited
   significant donor (human) cell presence at 3, 9, 12, and 15 months (last
   evaluation period) after transplant, The engraftment was sustained along
   with multilineage expression involving lymphoid, erythroid, and myeloid
   cells of human origin. These results indicated that human
   CD34(+)HLA-DR(-) cells are capable of long-term marrow repopulation and
   that this cell population is enriched for human long-term repopulating

Abstract = {{The patch-clamp technique was used to record whole-cell currents induced
   by alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-isoxazol-4-propionic acid (AMPA) or
   kainate in solitary rat retinal ganglion cells (n = 125) in vitro. Two
   groups of retinal ganglion cells could be distinguished according to
   their responses to kainate or AMPA in extracellular solutions with Ca2+
   as the only permeant cation. The ratio of the steady-state currents
   evoked by a given concentration of AMPA compared to kainate was low
   (0.08) in the first group and high (0.61) in the second group of retinal
   ganglion cells. The Ca2+ permeability through AMPA/kainate
   receptor-operated channels was low (P-Ca2+/P-Cs+ < 0.1) in the first
   group (n = 74, 59\%) and moderate (P-Ca2+/P-Cs+ = 0.53) in the second
   group (n = 51, 41\%) of retinal ganglion cells. The fraction of the
   total current induced by stimulation of non-N-methyl-D-aspartate
   receptors that is flowing through Ca2+ permeable AMPA/kainate channels
   in single cells with high Ca2+ permeability was estimated by comparing
   the current-voltage relationship in extracellular solutions with either
   Ca2+ or Na+ as the sole charge carrier. The contribution of
   Ca2+-permeable channels to the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor induced
   whole-cell current in single Ca2+ permeable cells (n = 12) ranged from
   40 to 70\%, correlating with the intermediate level of Ca2+ permeability
   (P-Ca2+/P-Cs+ = 0.22-0.80) measured by an independent method in these
   cells. Thus, single Ca2+-permeable cells appear to express at least two
   types of AMPA/kainate receptor-operated channels with high or low Ca2+
   permeability. Using the polymerase chain reaction, transcripts for the
   glutamate receptor subunits 1-4, including their `'flip'' and `'flop''
   versions, were identified in retinal ganglion cells. Together, these
   findings suggest that among rat retinal ganglion cells there are
   differences in the pattern of expression of AMPA/kainate
   receptor-operated channels. Moreover, individual cells co-express
   multiple heterologous non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors with distinct
   functional properties. The functional diversity of these receptors may
   play an important role in controlling Ca2+ entry into neurons. We
   speculate that the low Ca2+ permeability and the preference for kainate
   in one group of retinal ganglion cells may be due to the predominant
   expression of non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors containing the edited
   form of the glutamate receptor subunit 2 flop splice variant.}},

Abstract = {{AIM: To study the interactive influence of somatostatin (Som) and GABA
   in the brain and its relation to the pain modulation. METHOD: Using
   radioimmunoassay, amino acid analyzer and measurement of pain threshold.
   RESULTS: Som 10 mu g icv increased the pain threshold (from 4.2 +/- 0.2
   to 7.0 +/- 1.1 s) of the rat, but reduced the content of GABA from 2.3
   +/- 0.3 to 1.6 +/- 0.4 mu mol g(-1) in hippocampus and from 2.4 +/- 0.4
   to 1.5 +/- 0.2 mmol kg(-1) in brain stem. After depletion of the Som in
   brain by icv cysteamine (Cys, 600 mu g), the content of GABA in
   hippocampus and brain stem was also reduced without modification of the
   pain threshold. GABA 1500 mu g icv had no effect on the pain threshold,
   however, caused a decrease of Som content from 55 +/- to 37 +/- 5 ng
   g(-1) in hippocampus and from 84 +/- 4 to 66 +/- 6 ng g-1 in brain stem,
   which was blocked by bicuculline (190 mu g). After reduced of the GABA
   content in brain by subcutaneous injection of isoniazid (300 mg kg(-1)),
   Som content of the hippocampus and brain stem was markedly elevated.
   CONCLUSION: Som and GABA inhibited each other, unrelated to their pain
   modulation.}},

Abstract = {{Optimality criteria (OC) methods and the closely related dual method
   have become one of the most important class of optimization algorithms
   used in the practice of structural optimization. Since this class of
   algorithms search the optimum in the dual space of the Lagrange
   multipliers corresponding to the active constraints, the computational
   cost of the optimization is determined mostly by the number of active
   constraints. The efficiency of OC methods has been greatly improved
   recently by an OC method termed DCOC, which searches for the optimum in
   a usually much smaller dual subspace corresponding to only displacement
   multipliers. However, the relation of the DCOC with traditional OC
   methods is not clear, and therefore it is still difficult, even for
   people familiar with OC methods, to understand DCOC algorithm. This
   paper shows that the DCOC algorithm can be directly obtained from
   traditional OC methods, which provides insights into the method.
   Additionally, a derivative-based version of DCOC is developed which also
   helps in the understanding of the method.}},

Abstract = {{Osmotin-like proteins are encoded by at least six members of a multigene
   family in Solanum commersonii. A genomic clone (lambda pCEM2a-7) that
   contains two osmotin-like protein genes (OSML13 and OSML81) arranged in
   the same transcriptional orientation has been isolated. Restriction
   mapping and sequence analysis indicated that the two intronless genes
   correspond to the previously characterized pA13 and pA81 cDNAs. To study
   the transcriptional activation of OSML13 and OSML81 promoters, the 5'
   flanking DNA sequence (-1078 to +35 of OSML13 and -1054 to +41 of
   OSML81) was fused to the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) coding region, and the
   chimeric gene fusions were introduced into wild potato (S. commersonii)
   plants via Agrobacteriom-mediated transformation. Analysis of the
   chimeric gene expression in transgenic potato plants showed that both 5'
   flanking DNA sequences are sufficient to impart GUS inducibility by
   abscisic acid, NaCl, salicylic acid, wounding, and fungal infection. Low
   temperature activated both chimeric genes only slightly. Infection with
   Phytophthora infesfans resulted in strong GUS expression from both
   chimeric genes primarily in the sites of pathogen invasion, suggesting a
   limited diffusion of fungal infection-mediated signals. The expression
   patterns of both osmotin-like protein genes implicate their dual
   functions in osmotic stress and plant pathogen defense.}},

Abstract = {{The new subfamily Struthiopterinae is proposed for the aporrhaid
   gastropods occurring in the Late Cretaceous-early Tertiary Weddellian
   Province along the southern margin of the Pacific. The following genera
   are placed within the Struthiopterinae: Struthioptera Finlay and
   Marwick, 1937; Austroaporrhais n. gen.; and Struthiochenopus n. gen. The
   temporal and biogeographic distribution of members of Struthiopterinae
   show a similar pattern to other Southern Hemisphere groups of Late
   Cretaceous and early Cenozoic molluscs with initial disappearance from
   the western Australasia of the Weddellian Province by the Paleocene
   white surviving in Antarctica until the late Eocene and eventually
   disappearing in southern South America during the early Miocene.
   Also included in this paper is a reappraisal of the species assignable
   to these genera from Late Cretaceous and early Tertiary of New Zealand,
   Antarctica, and southern South America together with the description of
   bye new species. The following new species of the Struthiopterinae are
   described: Austroaporrhais larseni n. sp., A. stilwelli n. sp., A.
   dorotensis n. sp., Struthiochenopus antarcticus n. sp., and S. philippii
   n. sp.}},

Abstract = {{Diurnal courses of CO2 and water-vapour exchange of canopy leaves of
   mature trees of Ficus insipida WILLD. (Moraceae) were studied under
   natural conditions in the tropical dry forest of Parque Metropolitano
   near Panama City, Republic of Panama. Measurements were conducted from
   early January 1993 (dry season) until July 1993 (wet season). Rates of
   net CO2 uptake were high throughout the study period, with up to 33.1 mu
   mol m(-2) s(-1) in the early dry season. During the dry season, gas
   exchange was characterized by strong reductions (''midday-depressions'')
   of net CO2 uptake and stomatal conductance at noon. However, daily
   carbon gain and diurnal water-use efficiency of CO2 uptake did not
   differ between seasons. East-exposed leaves that received direct
   sunlight during early morning hours showed higher CO2 uptake rates and
   lost less water per CO2 fixed than west-exposed leaves. As previously
   demonstrated for several canopy species from a tropical moist forest,
   the maximum rate of net CO2 uptake was a good predictor of daily carbon
   gain.}},

Abstract = {{Some recent results relating to system identification are described and
   illustrated in this contribution. The system considered is nonlinear and
   time-invariant, being represented by a Volterra series up to second
   order. Closed-form expressions for the generalised transfer functions of
   first and second order are derived for a class of non-Gaussian
   stationary input processes. It is shown that the obtained parameters are
   optimum in the mean square sense. Once the system is identified, we
   derive a closed-form expression for the quadratic coherence that is a
   measure of the goodness of fit of the quadratic model. It is shown that
   this expression simplifies to well known results when the system is
   linear or its input is Gaussian. Furthermore, we develop estimates of
   the generalised transfer functions and the quadratic coherence from
   spectral and bispectral estimates, based on averaged periodograms and
   bi-periodograms of data stretches of the observed input and output of
   the system. This method is tested and validated by using simulated
   input-output data of a known quadratically nonlinear system, with known
   input signal statistic.}},

Abstract = {{The biennial review of atomic weight, A(r)(E), determinations and other
   cognate data has resulted in changes for the standard atomic weight of
   titanium from 47.88+/-0.03 to 47.867+/-0.001, of iron from
   55.847+/-0.003 to 55.845+/-0.002, of antimony from 121.757+/-0.003 to
   121.760+/-0.001, and of iridium from 192.22+/-0.03 to 192.217+/-0.003.
   Recent investigations on chlorine and bromine confirmed the presently
   accepted values of A(r)(Cl) and A(r)(Br). To emphasize the fact that the
   atomic weight of lithium commonly available in laboratory reagents can
   vary significantly, the value of lithium, A(r)(Li), was enclosed in
   brackets and a footnote was added. As a result of several changes, the
   Table of Standard Atomic Weights Abridged to Five Significant Figures
   has been updated. Because relative isotope-ratio data for stable
   hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen are commonly being expressed on
   non-corresponding scales, the Commission recommends that such isotopic
   data be expressed only relative to the references VSMOW and VPDB.
   Because many elements have a different isotopic composition in some
   non-terrestrial materials, recent data on non-terrestrial materials are
   included in this report for the information of the interested scientific
   community. (C) 1995 American Institute of Physics and American Chemical

Abstract = {{To understand a possible insulin mediated translocation mechanism of the
   insulin dependent glucose transpoter (GLUT4) from the intracellular
   vesicles to the plasma membrane, we investigated the phosphorylation of
   membrane proteins in GLUT4-containing vesicles by the kinases which are
   related to the Pas signalling system. When 3T3-L1 adipocytes were
   treated with insulin, the increase of GLUT4 translocation from the
   intracellular vesicle to the plasma membrane was observed by
   immunofluorescence microscopy. In the anti-Ras immunoprecipitates from
   the 3T3-L1 adipocytes, there was no change in the amount of GAP and ERK
   by insulin treatement. However, the tyrosine phosphorylation of the GAP
   and ERK was increased in the anti-Ras immunoprecipitates from the
   insulin treated cells. In case of MEK, the amount was increased by the
   insulin treatement. Several components of the immunopurified LDM
   proteins (62, 46, 42, and 33.5 kDa) were phosphorylated when LDM was
   incubated with the anti-Ras immunoprecipitates. In addition, the amount
   of P-32-incorporation into each component was increased when LDM was
   phosphorylated with the insulin-treated anti-Ras imunoprecipitates.
   These results suggest that the phosphorylation of LDM components by
   activated Ras-associated kinases may have roles on the insulin-regulated
   translocation of GLUT4 molecules from the intracellular vesicle to the
   plasma membrane.}},

   sites at the A- and B-branch of the photosynthetic reaction centre from
   Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Optical absorption and absorption-detected
   magnetic resonance experiments were performed on these samples at 8 K.
   The site-specific interaction of only pigment B-B (at the electron
   transfer-inactive branch) with the triplet state on the neighbouring
   carotenoid, spheroidene, clearly demonstrates the selective pigment
   exchange. The absorption spectra allow a distinction of the two monomer
   bacteriochlorophyll pigments (native as well as modified
   bacteriochlorophylls) by their absorption band maximum positions in
   native reaction centres: B-A absorbs at 803 nm, B-B at 812 nm. The upper
   exciton component of the primary donor was observed around 807 nm. The
   microwave induced absorption spectra of the primary donor triplet in the
   modified preparations are quite distinct from those of native reaction
   centres revealing specific pigment-pigment interactions between the
   monomers and the primary donor triplet state. These interactions appear
   as band shifts of the Q(y)-transitions of the accessory monomers, and
   are in agreement with a primary donor triplet that is delocalized over
   both dimer parts.}},

   (for helicase of 117.4 kDa). Besides the helicase consensus motifs,
   HEL117 contains an arginine-serine (RS)-rich domain, which occurs in
   some proteins involved in RNA splicing. Moreover, the COOH-terminal
   region of 78 residues of HEL117 is 38.5\% identical and 59\% similar to
   the COOH-terminal region of a yeast PRP5 protein that is involved in RNA
   splicing. Rabbit antibodies generated against a synthetic peptide of
   HEL117 identified a single polypeptide not only in rat cells but also in
   cells of other mammals as well as chicken. The antibodies revealed a
   finely punctate and speckled intranuclear staining in immunofluorescence

Abstract = {{For the parallel integration of nonstiff initial value problems (IVPs),
   three main approaches can be distinguished: approaches based on
   `'parallelism across the problem'', on `'parallelism across the method''
   and on `'parallelism across the steps''. The first type of parallelism
   does not require special integration methods and can be exploited within
   any available IVP solver. The method-parallelism approach received much
   attention, particularly within the class of explicit Runge-Kutta methods
   originating from fixed point iteration of implicit Runge-Kutta methods
   of Gaussian type. The construction and implementation on a parallel
   machine of such methods is extremely simple. Since the computational
   work per processor is modest with respect to the number of data to be
   exchanged between the various processors, this type of parallelism is
   most suitable for shared memory systems. The required number of
   processors is roughly half the order of the generating Runge-Kutta
   method and the speed-up with respect to a good sequential IVP solver is
   about a factor 2. The third type of parallelism (step-parallelism) can
   be achieved in any IVP solver based on predictor-corrector iteration and
   requires the processors to communicate after each full iteration. If the
   iterations have sufficient computational volume, then the step-parallel
   approach may be suitable for implementation on distributed memory
   systems. Most step-parallel methods proposed so far employ a large
   number of processors, but lack the property of robustness, due to a poor
   convergence behaviour in the iteration process. Hence, the effective
   speed-up is rather poor. The dynamic step-parallel iteration process
   proposed in the present paper is less massively parallel, but turns out
   to be sufficiently robust to achieve speed-up factors up to 15.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms that govern core promoter recognition and basal
   transcription efficiency remain poorly understood. Here, we have
   assessed the potential role of TAFs and the TFIID complex in directing
   basal promoter function. Reconstituted transcription reactions revealed
   the ability of TFIID versus TBP to discriminate between distinct core
   promoters. A comparison of different partial TBP-TAF assemblages
   established that a trimeric TBP-TAF(II)250-TAF(II)150 complex is
   minimally required for efficient utilization of the initiator and
   downstream promoter elements. Depending on the promoter structure, TAFs
   can increase or decrease the stability of TFIID-promoter interactions.
   These findings suggest that TAFs play a critical role in promoter
   selectivity and transcription regulation through direct contacts with

Abstract = {{The research deals with the possible role of the essentially
   monosynaptic bidirectional corticocortical connections between
   occipito-temporo-parietal association cortical areas and frontal areas
   in the genesis of some contingent negative variation (CNV) components,
   especially on the supramodal dorsolateral prefrontal regions. With
   standard averaging and topographic mapping methods of analysis, the
   multicomponent CNV complex formation was examined in 7 patients with
   extensive frontal cortex ablations exactly identified through CT/MRT,
   examinations, and in 10 normal subjects. On the scalp over the ablated
   frontocortical areas, no consistent post-warning auditory N100 a-b-c,
   P200, P300, early and late CNV components were recordable. The
   hypothesis is proposed that the bidirectional ipsilateral long-distance
   pathways which interconnect uni-polymodal occipito-temporo-parietal
   cortical areas to prefrontal ones, in particular the arcuate-superior
   longitudinal and superior/inferior occipito-frontal fasciculi, play an
   important rob in the genesis of several CNV complex components,
   especially the multicomponent post-Si auditory N100. The posteroanterior
   sequential latency differences of these neurocognitive components,
   roughly measured along the scalp or on MRT imagings, is probably
   accounted for by the transcortical ipsilateral conduction time of about
   1 cm/ms (10 m/s).}},

Abstract = {{Clusters of SeF6 were observed in molecular dynamics simulations to
   undergo a solid-state transition when sufficiently undercooled. Analyses
   were performed on clusters ranging in size from 100 to 500 molecules to
   examine how faithfully properties of cores of clusters reproduce
   properties of bulk matter, It was found that configurational energies
   and coefficients of rotational diffusion of molecules in cores closely
   approximated those of the bulk. If this had not been true, there would
   have been no basis for calculating the degree of undercooling at which
   nucleation was observed. Excess surface energies obtained in the process
   were roughly half the heat of sublimation per unit area of a molecular
   layer and perhaps twice the surface free energy. Nucleation from the bcc
   phase to monoclinic was seen to occur in each of 17 cooling runs made on
   150 molecule clusters. Nucleation always began in the interior of the
   clusters and was mononuclear, always leading to single crystals of the
   monoclinic phase. From the times of nucleation could be derived
   nucleation rates at temperatures of 88 and 78 K. Lifetimes of bcc
   molecules in a given orientation inferred from the runs agreed in order
   of magnitude with those derived from Raman and NMR spectra and yielded
   the same activation energy. Frequencies of rotational jumps from the old
   phase to the new were estimated from the coefficients of diffusion. By
   applying the classical theory of homogeneous nucleation, it was possible
   to derive the kinetic parameter sigma(ss) for the bcc-monoclinic
   interface. In nucleation theory it represents the interfacial free
   energy. This quantity was approximately 0.19 of the heat of transition
   per unit area from bcc to monoclinic, or about two/thirds that of the
   corresponding ratio proposed for freezing transitions. We conclude that
   clusters serve as convenient and realistic models for studying both
   surface properties and the dynamics of bulk systems.}},

   agonists, significantly enhanced the phosphoinositide turnover by acting
   through higher affinity H-2 receptors. On the other hand, histamine at

   cAMP levels in a response specifically blocked by mepyramine. These H-1

Abstract = {{The recent reduction in stratospheric ozone has led to speculation that
   marine organisms may be harmed by increased exposure to midultraviolet
   radiation (UVB). Elysia tuca Marcus, Bursatella leachii Rang and
   Haminaea antillarum d'Orbigny are opisthobranch slugs which dwell in
   shallow marine waters and are exposed to different amounts Of
   biologically damaging solar UVB. As adults, E. tuca are exposed to the
   highest levels of solar UVB, B. leachii are exposed to moderate levels
   of solar UVB, and H. antillarum are exposed to low levels of solar UVB.
   As larvae, the planktotrophic B. leachii are probably exposed to the
   most solar UVB, followed by the lecithotrophic larvae of E. tuca and
   then the direct developing larvae of H. antillarum, which have no
   planktonic stage of development. In this study, the capacity of
   photolyase-mediated DNA repair for each species was determined to
   examine interspecific variation in the ability of these marine slugs to
   repair UV-induced DNA damage. A DNA repair assay involving incubation of
   a UV-damaged plasmid with slug extracts containing photoreactivating
   enzyme was used. Partially purified E. tuca photolyase extracts repaired
   19.82 +/- 7.15\% (mean +/- so) of the damaged plasmid DNA; B. leachii
   photolyase extracts repaired 4.59 +/- 1.92\% of the damaged plasmid DNA;
   H. antillarum photolyase extracts repaired 20.32 +/- 9.22\% of the
   damaged plasmid DNA. The results of nonorthogonal planned comparisons
   tests between species showed a statistically significant difference (p <
   0.05) in the comparison between the photorepair capacities of B. leachii
   and E. tuca photolyase extracts, and in the comparison between the
   photorepair capacities of B. leachii and H. antillarum photolyase
   extracts, but no significance in the comparison between the photorepair
   capacities of E. tuca and H. antillarum photolyase extracts.}},

Abstract = {{Augmentation of tumor immunogenicity has been increasingly studied as a
   strategy to develop host immunity against established malignancies.
   Genetic modification of tumors to secrete immunoregulatory peptides such
   as IL-4 has been demonstrated to augment tumor immunogenicity and
   enhance the induction of tumor reactive lymphoid cells in animal models.
   To explore the ability of IL-4 to augment the immunogenicity of melanoma
   cells, we constructed a recombinant retrovirus vector encoding for human
   IL-4 and used it to transduce human melanomas. After optimizing
   retrovirus transduction conditions using a reporter virus, an IL-4
   encoding retrovirus vector was used to transduce early and late passage
   melanoma cells. IL-4 production rates of up to 2000 pg/ml per 24 h per
   10(6) cells were achieved, and provirus could be detected by Southern
   blot of the transduced cells at 0.1 copies per cell. The IL-4 produced
   by the melanoma cells was biologically active. Irradiated transduced
   melanoma cells continued to produce IL-4 for at least two weeks of
   observation. Thus melanoma cells can be efficiently modified to secrete
   biologically active IL-4, and may be suitable substrates for autologous
   tumor cell vaccines.}},

Abstract = {{Some reactions of fundamental importance in mercury photosensitization
   have been studied by high level quantum chemical calculations. The
   reactions of Hg{*} (P-3(1)) With H-2, CH4, C3H8, and SiH4 go by initial
   formation of exciplexes, followed by insertion of Hg{*} into the
   reactive X-H bond ultimately giving X radicals and H atoms.
   Intermediates and transition states have been located, notably the bent
   triplet (3){[}H-Hg-H] species. The hydrogen and silane reactions are
   found to proceed without barriers, whereas the methane and propane
   reactions require activation energies. In the case of methane the
   barrier is so high, 12.8 kcal/mol, that the reaction is very inefficient
   while for propane the barrier is small, 4.9 kcal/mol, leading to the
   breaking of one of the central C-H bonds. Triplet sensitization of
   alkenes and the bonding of Hg{*} with lone-pair ligands are also
   studied. Very good agreement with the general picture obtained from
   experiments is obtained. The consideration of both spin-orbit and
   zero-point vibrational effects are very important for a qualitative
   understanding of the reactions. Similarities and differences to the
   corresponding transition metal reactions are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The amyloid precursor protein (APP) undergoes abnormal metabolism in
   Alzheimer's disease, resulting in the accumulation of beta P4 amyloid in
   the brain. Normal APP metabolism includes the release of a truncated
   form (sAPP) which has been cleaved at the alpha-secretase site within
   the beta P4 amyloidogenic domain. However, intact forms of beta P4
   protein may also be generated by the beta- and gamma-secretases. Soluble
   forms of beta P4 have been detected in various cell lines and in
   cerebrospinal fluid, Previous studies of protein kinase C activation
   have suggested a reciprocal relationship between sAPP secretion and beta
   P4 production and release. We find that phorbol ester activation of
   protein kinase C in untransfected SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells increases
   the release of sAPP without affecting beta P4 secretion. We provide
   further evidence for intracellular beta P4 production. Treatment of SY5Y
   cells with the protease inhibitor phosphoramidon results in a 2-fold
   increase in beta P4 secretion and an increase in the amount of beta P4
   recovered from cell lysates, yet it does not affect sAPP secretion. The
   protease inhibitors thiorphan and
   N-{[}(RS)-2-carboxy-3-phenylpropanoyl]-L-leucine had no effect on beta
   P4 or sAPP secretion. The lysosomotropic agents chloroquine and NH4Cl
   decreased beta P4 secretion, providing additional evidence for the
   involvement of intracellular acidic compartments in the production of
   beta A4. Our results therefore demonstrate a double dissociation between
   the secretion of sAPP and beta P4 in the SH-SY5Y cell line. The effect
   of phosphoramidon supports previous studies which show that
   metalloproteases are involved in the biogenesis of beta A4.}},

Abstract = {{Surface modifications of polyimide (PI) films by Ar-plasma, O-2-plasma,
   and O-3 pretreatment and by near-UV light-induced graft copolymerization
   with water-soluable monomers, such as acrylamide (AAm), acrylic acid
   (AAc), and sodium salt of 4-styrenesulfonic acid (NaSS), have been
   carried out. The angle-resolved x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
   results show that surface pretreatment results in the formation of
   peroxide species on the polymer film surfaces and leads to a substantial
   enhancement of the density of surface graft. The XPS results further
   suggest that in the case where substantial grafting has taken place, the
   grafted polymer either forms a surface layer uniformly intermixed with
   the substrate chains, or a graft-rich surface layer in the case of
   sterically hindered migration of the graft. The resulting surface
   structures are further supported by dynamic water contact angle
   measurements. These surface structures are probably associated with the
   thermoset character of PI, as they differ from the stratified
   microstructures observed on most thermoplastic films after surface
   modification by graft copolymerization with hydrophilic monomers. (C)

Abstract = {{Anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques have been used to study
   the uncrossed retinal projection in neonatal pigmented and albino Syrian
   hamsters. The total number of retinal ganglion cells projecting
   ipsilaterally peaks at postnatal days 2-4 (P2-P4) and declines to adult
   values by P12. The change in cell numbers has a similar time course in
   albino and pigmented animals. Although the population of uncrossed cells
   in the temporal retina of albino hamsters is always less than that in
   pigmented hamsters, no difference between the colour phases was found
   for the population of uncrossed cells in nasal retina. Differential cell
   death also contributes to the adult albino decussation pattern in
   hamsters: The relative loss of cells from temporal retina in albinos
   (72\%) is greater than that in pigmented animals (56\%). The additional
   loss in albinos does not appear to depend on binocular interactions: The
   same proportion (30\%) of uncrossed cells is `'rescued'' from death by
   neonatal monocular enucleation in both colour phases.
   Flat-mount preparations showing the distribution of uncrossed fibres
   reveal that a distinct focus of terminals emerges in rostral superior
   colliculus, which is topographically appropriate for a binocular
   mapping, at the peak of uncrossed ganglion cell numbers (P4). Comparison
   of uncrossed terminal distributions and ganglion cell death reveals
   considerable refinement of the terminals prior to the main phase of cell
   death. Monocular enucleations performed some time after birth have a
   greater effect on uncrossed terminal distributions than on cell death.
   These observations suggest that independent mechanisms may be involved
   in the regulation of terminal distributions and of cell numbers in the
   developing uncrossed retinal pathways. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The p-glycoprotein is a transmembrane efflux transporter found on the
   luminal side of the capillary endothelial cells that comprise the
   blood-brain barrier. This study examined the effect of a p-glycoprotein
   inhibitor, cyclosporin A, on the distribution to the brain of a
   p-glycoprotein substrate, rhodamine-123, in freely moving rats using
   intracerebral microdialysis coupled with on-line HPLC analysis. Results
   from crossover experiments show that the coadministration of cyclosporin
   A significantly increased the distribution of rhodamine-123 to the
   brain. The plasma disposition of rhodamine-123 was unchanged by
   cyclosporin A, indicating that the change in brain exposure was mediated
   by a process at the level of the blood-brain barrier, possibly by
   inhibition of the p-glycoprotein efflux transporter. This finding
   suggests a functional activity of the p-glycoprotein in the blood-brain
   barrier and validates an in vivo model to examine the role of this
   transporter in the brain distribution of drugs. (C) 1995 Academic Press,

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{293}},
Pages = {{237-268}},
Month = {{JUN 25}},
Abstract = {{Faraday waves arise on the surface of a liquid in a container that is
   undergoing vertical periodic oscillations. Hysteresis occurs when both
   finite-amplitude solutions and the flat-surface solution are available.
   We derive a nonlinear model of Faraday resonance, extending the
   Lagrangian method of Miles (1976). The model is used to investigate
   hysteresis. The theoretical results are compared to previous
   experimental studies and to some new observations. It is found necessary
   to retain damping and forcing terms up to third-order in wave amplitude,
   and also the fifth-order conservative frequency shift, in order to
   achieve agreement with experiments. The latter fifth-order term was
   omitted from all previous studies of Faraday waves. The lower hysteresis
   boundary in forcing-frequency space is found in most cases to be defined
   by the lower boundary above which non-trivial stationary points exist.
   However, the stability of stationary points and the existence of limit
   cycles are also found to be factors in determining the lower hysteresis
   boundary. Our results also suggest an indirect method for estimating the
   coeffrcient of cubic damping, which is difficult to obtain either
   experimentally or theoretically.}},

Abstract = {{The origin of transfer (oriT) of the IncFV plasmid pED208 contains a
   region with three binding sites for both the plasmid-encoded TraM
   protein and the integration host factor (IHF) of Escherichia coli, a
   sequence-specific DNA-binding protein. One region, containing
   overlapping TraM and IHF binding sites, could be interpreted as
   containing two binding sites for each protein. Using gel retardation
   assays, an affinity constant for IHF binding to the three main sites was
   estimated in the presence and absence of 0.1 M potassium glutamate,
   which increased the avidity of IHF binding to the weaker sites by two
   orders of magnitude. DNase I protection analyses and electron microscopy
   were used to determine the affinity of IHF for oriT-containing DNA in
   the presence and absence of TraM. The binding of IHF and TraM was found
   to be non-cooperative by the two techniques employed. Electron
   microscopy also demonstrated that IHF bent the oriT region in a manner
   consistent with its previously determined mode of action, while TraM had
   no discernible effect on the appearance of the DNA. This suggested that
   IHF and TraM interact with a 295 bp sequence in the oriT region and
   organize it into a higher order structure that may have a role in the
   initiation of DNA transfer and control of traM expression.}},

Abstract = {{Excision of a DNA segment can occur in Arabidopsis thaliana by
   reciprocal recombination between two specific recombination sites (RSs)
   when the recombinase gene (R) from Zygosaccharomyces rouxii is expressed
   in the plant. To monitor recombination events, we generated several
   lines of transgenic Arabidopsis plants that carried a cryptic
   beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene which was designed in such a way
   that expression of the reporter gene could be induced by R gene-mediated
   recombination. We also made several transgenic lines with an R gene
   linked to the 35S promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus. Each transgenic
   line carrying the cryptic reporter gene was crossed with each line
   carrying the R gene. Activity of GUS in F-1 and F-2 progeny was examined
   histochemically and recombination between two RSs was analyzed by
   Southern blotting and the polymerase chain reaction. In seedlings and
   plantlets of F-1 progeny and most of the F-2 progeny, a variety of
   patterns of activity of GUS, including sectorial chimerism in leaves,
   was observed. A small percentage of F-2 individuals exhibited GUS
   activity in the entire plant. This pattern of expression was ascribed to
   germinal recombination in the F-1 generation on the basis of an analysis
   of DNA structure by Southern blotting. These results indicate that R
   gene-mediated recombination can be induced in both somatic and germ
   cells of A. thaliana by cross-pollination of parental transgenic lines.}},

Abstract = {{The casein kinase I (CKI) gene family is a rapidly enlarging group whose
   members have been implicated in the control of cytoplasmic and nuclear
   processes, including DNA replication and repair. We report here the
   cloning and characterization of a novel isoform of CKI from a human
   placental cDNA library. The cDNA for this isoform, hCKI epsilon,
   predicts a basic polypeptide of 416 amino acids and a molecular mass of
   47.3 kDa. It encodes a core kinase domain of 285 amino acids and a
   carboxyl-terminal tail of 123 amino acids. The kinase domain is 53-98\%
   identical to the kinase domains of other CKI family members and is most
   closely related to the delta isoform. Localization of the hCKI epsilon
   gene to chromosome 22q12-13 and the hCKI delta gene to chromosome 17q25
   confirms that these are distinct genes in the CKI family. Northern blot
   analysis shows that hCKI epsilon is expressed in multiple human cell
   lines. Recombinant hCKI epsilon is an active enzyme that phosphorylates
   known CKI substrates including a CKI-specific peptide substrate and is
   inhibited by CKI-7, a CKI-specific inhibitor. A budding yeast isoform of
   CKI, HRR25, has been implicated in DNA repair responses. Expression of
   hCKI epsilon but not hCKI alpha rescued the slow-growth phenotype of a
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain with a deletion of HRR25. Human CKI
   epsilon is a novel CKI isoform with properties that overlap those of
   previously described CKI isoforms.}},

Abstract = {{The microstructures of fused iron catalysts in the unreduced and
   partially reduced state have been investigated using analytical electron
   microscopy techniques. In the unreduced state, B `''-potassium ferrites
   of 0.1 to 0.3 mu m in size were found to precipitate uniformly and
   semi-coherently at the centers of the magnetite dendrites. These
   precipitates were identified as K2O . 4FeO . 15Fe(2)O(3) potassium
   ferrites, having lattice fringes of ca. 1.72 nm, which corresponded to
   the distance between the {[}KO](-) planes. During hydrogen reduction, a
   well delineated porous structure develops which can be described by the
   (0001)K2O . 4FeO . 15Fe(2)O(3) parallel to ((\$) over bar 111)Fe3O4
   ((\$) over bar 110)Fe parallel to Pore Channel and the (2 (\$) over bar

   22)Fe3O4 parallel to (002)Fe perpendicular to Pore Channel,
   crystallographic orientation relationship. This indicates that the
   potassium ferrite precipitates, which are still present in the partially
   reduced structure, have their potassium conduction bands parallel to the
   pore channels. It was concluded that the presence of these uniformly
   distributed B `''-potassium ferrites and their orientation relationship
   with the pore channels are responsible for the high atomic surface
   coverage of potassium obtained in the catalyst.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the vectorial formulation of variationally
   consistent sets of differential equations that, with either transverse
   shear or transverse normal deformation effects taken into consideration,
   govern the static and/or dynamic behaviour of homogeneous or
   inhomogeneous elastic plates.  The present formulation is based on a
   general form of the displacement representation and yields the kinematic
   relations, constitutive equations and equations of motion of a
   variationally consistent, shear and normal deformable, general plate
   theory, the number of degrees of freedom, as well as the performance, of
   which can be controlled a posteriori.  It is shown to be equivalent with
   a variational approach and can further be considered as a generalization
   of several variationally consistent transverse shear and normal
   deformable plate theories, in the sense that, in particular cases, it
   quotes their governing equations derived elsewhere variationally. 
   Moreover, just as happens with the application of a variational
   approach, an a priori knowledge of the elastic law governing the
   material behaviour of the plate considered is not required.  Under the
   general assumption that there exists a strain energy density function,
   the present vectorial approach can be applied successfully.}},

Abstract = {{Large scale non-uniformities in the approach flow to a propeller result
   in periodic unsteady blade forces that radiate tonal noise at the blade
   passing frequency and its higher harmonics.  The current research
   experimentally investigates the free-field directivity of a four-bladed
   propeller interacting with matched and mismatched cyclic distortions. 
   The study employs non-uniform flow generators that provide a three-cycle
   and four-cycle azimuthal distortion of the flow field.  As the inflow
   distortions contain just one dominant Fourier mode, a well-defined
   axisymmetric free-field directivity exists only for the fundamental
   tone.  Higher harmonics, originating from small scale flow gradients,
   have a random directivity.  An extensive comparison of the measured
   tonal noise levels with the theoretical predictions shows an excellent
   agreement, both in magnitude and directivity.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of chemical shift can be removed to high order by quantizing
   nuclear spins along a strong radio-frequency (RF) field and applying a
   second audio-frequency magnetic field, orthogonal to the direction of
   the effective RF spin lock field. By adjusting the audio-modulation
   frequency of this second magnetic field to the rate at which spins
   nutate about the RF field, a resonance condition in the spin-locked
   frame is established which, to second order, is independent of the
   resonance offset of the homonuclear spins. The phase and amplitude of
   the audio-frequency field are under operator control and make it
   possible to conduct complex pulse sequences in the nutating frame. The
   approach is demonstrated for transferring in a single step magnetization
   from phenylalanine C-13(beta) to all aromatic ring carbons in a sample
   of uniformly C-13-enriched calmodulin. A three-dimensional version of
   the experiment yields complete resonance assignments for the

   described for 1, using HSMes{*} instead of HSTriph. Although
   crystallographic data for 2 are not available, the spectroscopic
   characterization indicates a dimeric species with a distorted trigonal

   Mg(n-Bu/s-Bu)(2) or alternatively {[}Mg\{N(SiMe(3))(2)\}(2)](2) with 2
   equiv of the sterically demanding HSMes{*} in a hexane/diethyl ether

   Mg(SeMes{*})(2)(THF)(2) is prepared by a reaction sequence similar to
   that described for 3, by the addition of 2 equiv of freshly prepared
   HSeMes{*} in a mixture of hexane and tetrahydrofuran. The reaction of
   MgBr2 with 2 equiv of lithium selenolate in THF affords 4 in good yield.

   kJ mol(-1) in aqueous medium and 15.3 kJ mol(-1) in an isopropanol-water
   (1:1) mixture. On photoexcitation, the trans isomer changes to the cia
   isomer which absorbs in the region 420-430 nm. The back conversion of
   the cis to trans isomer occurs via an intermediate hydrate tautomeric
   monoanion. The rate-determining step of the conversion process depends
   on the amount of base present or the alkalinity of the system. The
   conversion of the cis isomer to the hydrate monoanion and the
   equilibrium relaxation of the hydrate monoanion to the trans isomer are
   competing reactions. In the absence of base, the cis to hydrate
   conversion is slower than the equilibrium relaxation of the hydrate to
   the trans form, while in the presence of base, it is faster.}},

Abstract = {{Neovascularization that generates collateral blood flow can limit the
   extent of tissue damage after acute ischemia caused by occlusion of the
   primary blood supply, The neovascular response stimulated by the BE
   homodimeric form of recombinant platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB)
   was evaluated for its capacity to protect tissue from necrosis in a rat
   skin flap model of acutely induced ischemia. Complete survival of the
   tissue ensued, when the original nutritive blood supply was occluded, as
   early as 5 days after local PDGF-BB application, and the presence of a
   patent vasculature was evident compared to control flaps. To further
   evaluate the vascular regenerative response, PDGF-BB was injected into
   the muscle/connective tissue bed between the separated ends of a divided
   femoral artery in rats. A patent new vessel that functionally
   reconnected the ends of the divided artery within the original 3- to
   4-mm gap was regenerated 3 weeks later in all PDGF-BB-treated limbs. In
   contrast, none of the paired control limbs, which received vehicle with
   an inactive variant of PDGF-BB, had vessel regrowth (P < 0.001). The
   absence of a sustained inflammatory response and granulation tissue
   suggests locally delivered PDGF-BB may directly stimulate the angiogenic
   phenotype in endothelial cells. These findings indicate that PDGF-BE can
   generate functional new blood vessels and nonsurgically anastomose
   severed vessels in vivo. This study supports the possibility of a
   therapeutic modality for the salvage of ischemic tissue through
   exogenous cytokine-induced vascular reconnection.}},

Abstract = {{Human hookworm infection is a major cause of gastrointestinal blood loss
   and iron deficiency anemia, affecting up to one billion people in the

   during attachment to the intestinal mucosa by lacerating capillaries and
   ingesting extravasated blood. We have isolated the major anticoagulant
   used by adult worms to facilitate feeding and exacerbate intestinal
   blood loss. This 8.7-kDa peptide, named the Ancylostoma caninum
   anticoagulant peptide (AcAP), was purified by using a combination of
   ion-exchange chromatography, gel-filtration chromatography, and
   reverse-phase HPLC. N-terminal sequencing of AcAP reveals no homology to
   any previously identified anticoagulant or protease inhibitor,
   Single-stage chromogenic assays reveal that AcAP is a highly potent and
   specific inhibitor of human coagulation, with an intrinsic K-i{*} for
   the inhibition of free factor Xa of 323.5 pM, In plasma-based clotting
   time assays, AcAP was more effective at prolonging the prothrombin time
   than both recombinant hirudin and tick anticoagulant peptide. These data
   suggest that AcAP, a specific inhibitor of factor Xa, is one of the most
   potent naturally occurring anticoagulants described to date.}},

Abstract = {{The peptide guanylin, which has recently been isolated from the
   intestine, is involved in the regulation of fluid secretion in the
   intestinal epithelium by activation of guanylate cyclase C, the putative
   guanylin receptor. Since the latter protein is also expressed in airway
   epithelia, we investigated the lung of three mammalian species for the
   presence and cellular localization of guanylin by immunoblot (Western
   blot) analyses and light and electron microscopical immunocytochemistry.
   In Western blots of bovine, guinea pig, and rat lung extracts, three
   different guanylin antisera directed against the midportion and against
   the C terminus of the precursor molecule identified a peptide band
   corresponding to the apparent molecular mass of guanylin. Localization
   studies in the lung revealed that guanylin is exclusively confined to
   nonciliated secretory (Clara) cells in the lining of distal conducting
   airways. The presence of guanylin in the lung and particularly its
   specific localization to Clara cells indicate that these cells may play
   a pivotal role in the local (paracrine) regulation of electrolyte/water
   transport in airway epithelia.}},

   expression:-d{[}C2H4]/dt = k'K'{[}PdCl3(Py)(-)]{[}C2H4]/{[}H+]{[}Cl-](2)
   where K' is the equilibrium constant for pi-complex formation between
   ethene and PdCl3(Py)(-) (Py = pyridine). This rate expression is of the
   same form as that previously found for the oxidation of ethene by
   PdCl42- in aqueous solution (Wacker reaction). The value of K' for
   PdCl3(Py)(-) was found to be 20.3 which is close to the value of 17.4
   previously measured for pi-complex formation between ethene and PdCl42-.
   However, the value of k for PdCl42- was 750 times the value of k' for
   PdC1(3)(Py)(-). This result suggests that the hydroxypalladation adduct
   from PdCl3(Py)(-) is much more stable towards decomposition to ethanal
   than the corresponding one from PdCl42-. A direct result of this higher
   stability is the expectation that the adduct from PdCl3(Py)(-) should be
   more readily intercepted by CuCl2 to produce 2-chloroethanol. At
   chloride concentrations as low as 0.2 M and {[}CuCl2] = 4 M, the product
   was almost 50\% 2-chloroethanol. At {[}CuCl2] = 8 M, the product was
   98\% 2-chloroethanol. With PdCl42-, a chloride concentration of 3 M is
   required before an appreciable amounts of 2-chloroethanol are produced
   at any cupric chloride concentration. For the reaction of ethene with
   PdCl42-, these results are consistent with a mechanism involving cis
   addition at low {[}Cl-] and trans addition at high {[}Cl-]. The pathway
   for ethanal formation may be different with PdCl3(Py)(-) than it is with
   PdCl42-.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrothermal systems located in the Okinawa Trough Back Are Basin are
   considered to be related to rifting activities in the continental
   margin, Hydrothermal fluids sampled from two sites (JADE and CLAM) are
   significantly enriched in gas species compared to those from mid-oceanic
   ridges, A high-temperature fluid (320 degrees C) from the JADE site
   shows a CO2 concentration of 200 mmol kg(-1), which is more than one
   order of magnitude higher than that of sediment-starved ridge crest
   hydrothermal systems, Both helium (R/R(A) = 6.1-6.5) and carbon
   (delta(CO2)(13) = - 5.0 to - 4.7 parts per thousand PDB) isotopic
   compositions are typical of island are magmatic gases. Also the
   abundance ratio of CO2/He-3 ( = 3 . 10(10)) is within the range of
   values found in island area. Chemical and isotopic compositions of the
   JADE fluid are considered to indicate that both CO2 and helium are
   derived from a magmatic source beneath the hydrothermal system without
   significant contamination. Contrary to these species, CH4 is attributed
   to a thermogenic origin based on its isotopic composition
   (delta(13)C(CH4) = - 41 to - 36 parts per thousand PDB) and high
   concentration (= 7.1 mmol kg(-1)), which values are similar to those
   observed in sediment-hosted hydrothermal systems. The CLAM fluids show
   gas geochemistry much more affected by fluid-sediment interaction, Lower
   He-3/He-4 ratios (R/R(A) = 3.7-3.8) and higher CO2/He-3 ratios (>
   10(11)) may reflect involvement of gas species introduced during
   secondary fluid circulation within the sedimentary pile. Magmatic
   activity is the main contributor of gas species to the hydrothermal
   fluids in both the JADE and CLAM sites, although fluid-sediment
   interaction modifies their composition, The relatively high abundance of
   CO2 in the Mid-Okinawa Trough hydrothermal systems reflects the
   geochemical nature of island are magma.}},

Abstract = {{Long, open-path, outdoor interferometric measurement of the index of
   refraction as a function of wavelength (spectral refractivity) requires
   a number of innovations. These include active compensation for vibration
   and turbulence. The use of electronic compensation produces an
   electronic signal that is ideal for extracting data. This allows the
   appropriate interpretation of those data and the systematic and fast
   scanning of the spectrum by the use of bandwidths that are intermediate
   between lasers (narrow bandwidth) and white light (broad bandwidth). An
   Environmental Interferometer that incorporates these features should be
   extremely valuable in both pollutant detection and pollutant
   identification. Spectral refractivity measurements complement the
   information available from spectral absorption instruments (e.g., a
   Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer). The Environmental
   Interferometer currently uses an electronic compensating device with a
   1-kHz response time, and therefore rapid spectral scans are feasible so
   that it is possible to monitor the time evolution of pollutant events.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) contains two domains of approximately
   equal size, both of the alpha/beta type. An alpha-helix consisting of
   the middle section of the 415-amino acid polypeptide chain, and the N-
   and C-termini reside in the interdomain hinge region {[}Watson, H. C.,
   et al. (1982) EMBO J. I, 1635-1640]. The C-terminal end is an integral
   part of the N-terminal domain. The consequences of the deletion of
   fifteen and three C-terminal amino acids on the conformational state and
   on the guanidine hydrochloride-induced and thermal unfolding of PGK were
   investigated by using near- and far-UV CD, tryptophan fluorescence,
   1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid binding, accessibility to chemical
   modification, and differential scanning calorimetry. The results of
   these studies indicate that the conformations of both domains and of the
   interdomain region were altered by these deletions. In the absence of
   the 15-amino acid C-terminal peptide {[}Delta(401-415)], the N-terminal
   domain exhibits several characteristics of a molten globule state,
   whereas the C-terminal domain retains native-like, although distinctly
   different, tertiary structure. Deletion of three C-terminal amino acids
   {[}Delta(413-415)] also globally affects PGK conformation, although to a
   much lesser extent. Both C-terminal deletions resulted in a significant
   decrease in protein stability, as demonstrated by their increased
   susceptibility to guanidine-induced and thermal denaturation. These
   results suggest that the formation of a native tertiary fold of PGK
   requires the presence of a complete polypeptide chain.}},

   nucleus. Each of the two nuclei is compact but lies on an extended
   diffuse component, which may be related to the start of the two tidal
   tails. The existence of two nuclei implies that the galaxy is still in
   the process of merging, in contrast to earlier suggestions that the
   merger was almost complete. The radio continuum is predominantly
   nonthermal emission from remnants of supernovae which occur about one
   every 3 years in each nucleus. We find no evidence for a Seyfert

Abstract = {{We recently identified a differentiation inhibitory factor (I-factor) in
   mouse myeloid leukemia M1 cells as a murine homolog of the human nm23-H2
   gene product, nm23 genes encode proteins that participate in tumor
   metastasis regulation and in various fundamental cellular processes,
   although their mechanisms of action are still unknown. Although all nm23
   proteins contain nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase activity, it has
   not been established that the enzyme activity mediated the various
   functions of nm23 proteins. In the present experiment, we examined the
   effect of nm23 proteins on various differentiation induction systems of
   human leukemic cells including HL-60, U937, HEL/S, KU812F, K562, and HEL
   cells. Native human erythrocyte NDP kinase protein inhibited the
   induction of erythroid differentiation of HEL, KU812 and K567 cells, but
   not the induction of monocytic or granulocytic differentiation of HL-60,
   U937 and HEL/S cells. The erythroid differentiation of HEL cells was
   inhibited by recombinant human nm23-H1, -H2, mouse nm23-M1, and -M2
   proteins. Moreover, both the mutant nm23-H2(His) protein and truncated
   nm23-H2 protein containing N-terminal (1-60) peptide, which do not have
   NDP kinase activity, also inhibited erythroid differentiation of HEL
   cells. These results suggest that (1) the differentiation inhibitory
   activity of I-factor/nm23 protein is not restricted to monocytic
   differentiation of M1 cells, (2) the inhibitory activity is exhibited
   without species specificity, and (3) the differentiation inhibitory
   activity of the nm23/NDP kinase protein is independent of its enzyme
   activity and requires the presence of N-terminal peptides.}},

   mass-loss rate. A high helium abundance (e.g., Y approximate to 0.28),
   as well as an inclusion of helium diffusion and oxygen-enhancement in
   stellar models, can lower the current age estimate for metal-poor
   globular clusters from 14 +/- 1.5 Gyr to obtain 11 +/- 1 Gyr,
   significantly relaxing the constraints on the Hubble constant, allowing
   values as high as 60 km s(-1) Mpc(-1) for a universe with the critical
   density and 90 km s(-1) Mpc(-1) for a baryon-only universe. The
   uncertainties of a high helium abundance and an instability strip
   induced mass loss near the turn-off in globular clusters are discussed.
   Ages lower than 10 Gyr are not possible even with the operation of both
   of these mechanisms unless the initial helium abundance in globular
   clusters is greater than 0.28, which can hardly be accommodated by
   indirect inferences of helium abundances in globular clusters.}},

Abstract = {{On the basis of DNA homology to bee venom hyaluronidase, it was recently
   suggested that the GPI-linked mammalian sperm antigen, PH-20, may
   function as a cell surface hyaluronidase {[}Gmachl, M., and Kreil, G.
   (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 3569-3573]. We have quantified
   the activity of the soluble acrosomal hyaluronidase of mouse sperm and
   further demonstrate the existence of a membrane-hound hyaluronidase,
   detected on both acrosome-intact and acrosome-reacted mouse sperm,
   distinct from the soluble form of the enzyme. The membrane-bound
   hyaluronidase was specifically released by PE-PLC, indicating that it is
   GPI linked. Acrosome-intact and acrosome-reacted sperm released several
   polypeptides (68, 44, 39, 34, 17, and 15 kDa) when treated with PI-PLC.
   In addition, GPI-Linked polypeptides unique to acrosome-intact or to
   acrosome-reacted sperm were identified. Fractionation of the

Abstract = {{A deep convective storm observed during the Central Equatorial Pacific
   Experiment (CEPEX) has been simulated using the two-dimensional version
   of a three-dimensional cloud dynamics, microphysics, and chemistry
   model. The simulated storm is characterized by the penetration of the
   cloud tower into the lower stratosphere and by a widespread cloud anvil.
   Clear evidence of vertical transport of water vapor through the
   convective turret to the upper troposphere has been found. A large
   amount of small ice crystals formed in; the cloud top and in the anvil
   together with graupels induced by frozen raindrops. Intense mixing of
   boundary layer air into the cloud caused by the deep convection can
   result in low ozone area inside the cloud turret and inside the anvil.
   However, simultaneously, stratospheric air with high ozone volume mixing
   ratio was brought into the cloud region in the troposphere, especially
   in the upper part of the anvil, which could play a significant role in
   the tropical tropospheric O-3 budget. Due to the deep convection, a
   significant fraction of boundary layer dimethyl sulfide (DMS) or other
   ocean-derived chemicals is also transferred to the free troposphere, but
   we find no evidence for significant transport to the stratosphere.}},

Abstract = {{Two polar polymers with different dielectric constants, poly(vinylidene
   fluoride) (PVDF) and poly (ethylene oxide) (PEG), were each blended with
   a chlorine-terminated poly(ethylene ether) (PEG) and one of the two
   salts, LiBF4 and LiCF3CO2, to form PEC-plasticized polymer electrolytes.
   The room-temperature ionic conductivity of the PEC-plasticized polymer
   electrolytes reached a value as high as 10(-4) S/cm. The
   room-temperature ionic conductivity of the PVDF-based polymer
   electrolytes displayed a stronger dependence on the PEC content than did
   the PEG-based polymer electrolytes. In PVDF/PEC/LiBF4 polymer
   electrolytes, the dynamic ionic conductivity was less dependent on
   temperature and more dependent on the PEC content than it was in
   PEO/PEC/LiBF4 polymer electrolytes. The highly plasticized PVDF-based
   polymer electrolyte film with a PEC content greater than CF4 (CF4
   defined as the molar ratio of the repeat units of PEC to those of PVDF
   equal to 4) was self-supported and nonsticky, while the corresponding
   PEG-based polymer electrolyte film was sticky. In these highly
   plasticized PVDF-based polymer elec trolytes, the curves of the
   room-temperature ionic conductivity vs. the salt concentration were
   convex because the number of carrier ions and the chain rigidity both
   increased with increase of the salt content. The maximum ionic
   conductivity at 30 degrees C was independent of the PEC content, but it
   depended on the anion species of the lithium salts in these highly
   plasticized polymer electrolytes. (C) 1995 John Wiley and Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{PsaC-C14D (cysteine 14 replaced by aspartic acid) contains a {[}3Fe-4S]
   and a {[}4Fe-4S] cluster in the F-B and F-A sites of the free protein
   {[}Yu, L., Zhao, J., Lu, W., Bryant, D. A., and Golbeck, J. H. (1993)
   Biochemistry 32, 8251-8258]. When PsaC-C14D is rebound to a photosystem
   I (PS I) core, the g-values of 2.043, 1.939, and 1.853 appear similar to
   F-A in a wild-type PS I complex {[}Zhao, J. D., Li, N., Warren, P. V.,
   Golbeck, J. H., and Bryant, D. A. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 5093-5099].
   The reconstituted PsaC-C14D-PS I complex does not contain a {[}3Fe-4S]
   cluster; rather, a set of resonances with a rhombic line shape, a g(av)
   of similar to 1.97, and broad line widths indicate the presence of a
   mixed-ligand {[}4Fe-4S] cluster, termed F-B', in the aspartate site.
   Both F-A and F-B' become photoreduced at 15 K, and show an interaction
   spectrum when reduced within the same reaction center. An
   electrochemical redox study shows that F-A and F-B' titrate with
   midpoint potentials near -600 mV at pH 10.0. Single-turnover flash
   experiments indicate that F-A and F-B' function as efficient electron
   accepters at room temperature, and NADP(+) photoreduction rates are
   about 70\% that of a reconstituted PsaC-PS I complex. A population of S
   = 3/2, {[}4Fe-4S] clusters was tentatively identified in the free
   PsaC-C14D protein by characteristic EPR resonances in the g = 5.3
   region. It is proposed that P700-F-X cores have a high affinity for
   PsaC-C14D that contains two cubane clusters, and that on rebinding, the
   mixed-ligand cluster in the F-B' Site crosses over from the S = 3/2 to
   the S = 1/2 spin state. These results show that electron throughput from
   F-X to ferredoxin in the PsaC-C14D-PS I complex remains efficient even
   though the spectroscopic and thermodynamic properties of F-A and F-B'
   are altered by the presence of the mixed-ligand iron-sulfur cluster in
   the F-B site.}},

Abstract = {{We consider duality transformations in N = 2, d = 4 Yang-Mills theory
   coupled to N = 2 supergravity. A symplectic and coordinate covariant
   framework is established, which allows one to discuss stringy
   `'classical and quantum duality symmetries'' (monodromies),
   incorporating T-and S-dualities. In particular, we shall be able to
   study theories (like N = 2 heterotic strings) which are formulated in
   symplectic basis where a `'holomorphic prepotential'' F does not exist,
   and yet give general expressions for all relevant physical quantities.
   Duality transformations and symmetries for the N = 1 matter coupled
   Yang-Mills supergravity system are also exhibited. The implications of
   duality symmetry on all N > 2 extended supergravities are briefly
   mentioned. We finally give the general form of the central charge and
   the N = 2 semiclassical spectrum of the dyonic BPS saturated states (as
   it comes by truncation of the N = 4 spectrum).}},

Abstract = {{Lurcher is an autosomal semidominant murine mutation. Lurcher
   heterozygotes (+/Lc) lose all their cerebellar Purkinje cells by
   adulthood. Explants from 2 days postnatal (P2) wild-type (+/+) and +/Lc
   cerebellar cortex were grown in vitro to investigate the role of local
   neuronal environment and afferent input on the degenerating +/Lc
   Purkinje cell. In Lurcher explants, Purkinje cells were maintained for
   up to 25 days in vitro. No significant difference was observed between
   +/+ and +/Lc Purkinje cell numbers from 10 to 20 days in vitro, as
   revealed by calbindin-D immunoreactivity. Growing file explants in
   association with +/+ explants resulted in no significant difference in
   Purkinje cell survival (10-20 days in vitro). Image analysis of the
   gross morphology of calbindin-D-immunostained Purkinje cells from +/+
   and +/Lc explants grown in vitro revealed a significant decrease in the
   total area and dendritic lengths of +/Lc Purkinje cells (15 and 20 days
   in vitro). The fine structure of +/Lc and +/+ Purkinje cells was
   examined under the electron microscope (10-25 days in vitro). No
   difference in ultrastructure was observed between +/Lc and +/+ Purkinje
   cells grown in vitro, and many features similar to normal Purkinje cell
   development in vivo were present. These included monosynaptic parallel
   fibre synapses with Purkinje cell dendritic spines, other interneuron
   synapses with Purkinje cell dendrites and soma, astroglial investment,
   and minimal extracellular space in the neuropil. Unusual features
   observed included a persistence of the perisomatic spines in some
   Purkinje cells, an absence of Nissl bodies in the Purkinje cell
   perikaryon, naked Purkinje cell dendritic spines, and occasional
   heterologous synapses. The results are discussed in the light of
   previous chimeric analysis of the Lurcher mutation, and a hypothesis is
   put forward to explain the survival of +/Lc Purkinje cells in vitro. (C)

Abstract = {{Cr3+ and Fe3+ EPR spectra in transition metal fluoride glasses (TMFG),
   pyrochlore CsZnGaF6 and amorphous GaF3 are found to be very similar.
   Then, it is inferred that the constituent octahedra of all these
   disordered fluoride compounds are characterized by closely related
   distortions. Two short-range structural models, based on CsZnGaF6 and
   GaF3, are worked out with the aim of characterizing octahedra in TMFG.
   The CsZnGaF6 model is developed using structural information on this
   compound. Amorphous GaF3 structure is simulated by using molecular
   dynamics calculations starting from rhombohedral GaF3. From the M-F
   distance and bonding angle distributions obtained from these two models,
   the Cr3+ and Fe3+ fine-structure parameter distributions are calculated
   with the help of the superposition model and finally the corresponding
   EPR spectra are computed. A good agreement is obtained simultaneously
   for the two local paramagnetic probes, which leads to a quantification
   of the short-range order in TMFG: constituent octahedra are only
   slightly distorted. It is interesting to note that the distributions of
   fine-structure parameters are very similar to the Czjzek ones previously
   used to simulate Cr3+ and Fe3+ spectra in TMFG.}},

Abstract = {{The propensity of hexagonal II phase formation plays an important role
   in the activity of mitochondrial ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase or
   H+-ATPase. The respiratory control ratio of reconstituted
   ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase or the ATP-induced membrane potential
   of reconstituted H+-ATPase became higher as the non-bilayer phospholipid
   phosphatidylethanolamine content of proteoliposomes increased. The
   highest respiratory control ratio or ATP-induced membrane potential was
   obtained in the case of 60-80\% phosphatidylethanolamine-containing
   proteoliposomes. Dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine could significantly
   enhance the respiratory control ratio of ubiquinol-cytochrome c
   reductase and ATP-induced membrane potential of H+-ATPase, while no
   obvious change could be observed when dielaidoylphosphatidylethanolamine
   was used. The bilayer to hexagonal II phase transition temperature of
   ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase-containing proteoliposomes
   reconstituted with phosphatidylcholine + phosphatidylethanolamine
   increases with decreasing content of phosphatidylethanolamine. Several
   additives such as the bilayer stabilizers, cholesterol 3-sulfate and
   carbobenzoxy-D-Phe-L-PheGly, or hexagonal II phase-forming promoters,

Abstract = {{Objective: to describe the clinical and epidemiological features of an
   outbreak of a viral infection affecting humans and horses.
   Setting: Stables in Hendra, a suburb of Brisbane.
   Subjects: affected horses and humans, and at-risk human contacts.
   Results: A pregnant mare died two days after arrival from a paddock
   elsewhere in Brisbane. Eight to 11 days later, illness (depression,
   anorexia, fever, dyspnoea, ataxia, tachycardia, tachypnoea and nasal
   discharge) was reported among 17 other horses from the same or an
   adjoining stable. Fourteen horses died or were put down. five and six
   days after the index mare's death, a stable-hand and then a horse
   trainer, both of whom had had close contact with the sick mare's mucous
   secretions, developed influenza-like illnesses. The stable-hand
   recovered out the the trainer developed pneumonitis, respiratory
   failure, renal failure and arterial thrombosis, and died from a cardiac
   arrest seven days after admission to hospital. A morbillivirus cultured
   from his kidney was identical to one isolated from the lungs of five
   affected horses. The two affected humans and eight other horses were
   seropositive for the infection, which was reproduced in healthy horses
   following challenge by spleen/lung homogenates from infected horses.
   There was no serological evidence of infection in 157 humans who had had
   contact with the stables or the sick horses or humans.
   Conclusions: A previously undescribed morbillivirus infected a probable
   21 horses and two humans; one human and 14 horses died. That no further
   cases were detected among humans suggests that the virus was of low
   infectivity. The source of infection remains undetermined.}},

Abstract = {{THE effects of NGF, BDNF, NT-3, BDNF plus NT-3 and LIF on substance P
   (SP) mRNA levels were analysed in axotomized dorsal root ganglia (DRGs)
   in vivo by quantitative in situ hybridization. The growth factors were
   applied on to the transected sciatic nerve. SP mRNA levels were
   decreased significantly 3 days after axotomy. NGF (1 mu g) fully
   counteracted the down-regulation of SP mRNA. Neither BDNF (10 mu g) nor
   NT-3 (10 mu g) alone had any effect. However, co-administration of BDNF
   together with NT-3 (10 mu g) distinctly reversed the decrease in SP
   mRNA. A similar effect was seen with a high (1.5 mu g) but not a low
   dose of LIF (0.15 mu g). Our data suggest that the present method of
   delivering growth factors to the transected sciatic nerve is a valid way
   to study in vivo effects of growth factors on peptide expression in
   DRGs. Moreover, SP expression is regulated by several growth factors in

Abstract = {{Previous studies demonstrated that tissue plasminogen activator-induced
   fibrinolysis in vitro is retarded in the presence of prothrombin (II)
   activation and that the anticoagulant-activated protein C appears
   profibrinolytic by preventing the formation of thrombin (IIa)-like
   activity during fibrinolysis. To disclose the molecular connection
   between the generation of IIa and the inhibition of fibrinolysis, a
   lysis assay that is sensitive to the antifibrinolytic effect of II
   activation was developed tend was used to purify a 60-kDa single-chain
   protein from human plasma. Because the lysis of a clot, produced from
   purified components, is retarded when this protein is present and when
   II activation occurs in situ, the protein was named TAFI
   (thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor). TAFI is cleaved by IIa
   yielding 35-, 25-, and 14-kDa products. Amino-terminal sequence analyses
   identified TAFI as a precursor of a plasma carboxypeptidase B (CPB).
   Formation of the 35-kDa product correlates with both prolongation of
   lysis time and CPB-like activity. Prolongation of lysis time saturates
   at about 125 nM TAFI. Activated TAFI inhibits the activation of
   Glu-plasminogen but does not prolong the lysis of clots formed in the
   presence of Lys-plasminogen. 2-Guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid, a
   competitive inhibitor of CPB, completely inhibits prolongation of lysis
   by activated TAFI in a purified system and the prolongation induced by
   II activation in barium-adsorbed plasma. This suggests that TAFI
   accounts for the antifibrinolytic effect that accompanies prothrombin
   activation and that activated protein C appears profibrinolytic by
   attenuating TAFI activation.}},

Abstract = {{In Escherichia coli, lysyl-tRNA synthetase activity is encoded by either
   a constitutive lysS gene or an inducible one, lysU, The two
   corresponding enzymes could be purified at homogeneity from a Delta lysU
   and a Delta lysS strain, respectively, Comparison of the pure enzymes,
   LysS and LysU, indicates that, in the presence of saturating substrates,
   LysS is about twice more active than LysU in the ATP-PPi exchange as
   well as in the tRNA(Lys) aminoacylation reaction. Moreover, the
   dissociation constant of the LysU-lysine complex is 8-fold smaller than
   that of the LysS-lysine complex, In agreement with this difference, the
   activity of LysU is less sensitive than that of LysS to the addition of
   cadaverine, a decarboxylation product of lysine and a competitive
   inhibitor of lysine binding to its synthetase, This observation points
   tla a possible useful role of LysU, under physiological conditions
   causing cadaverine accumulation in the bacterium. Remarkably, these
   conditions also induce lysU expression.
   Homogeneous LysU and LysS were also compared in Ap,A synthesis. LysU is
   only 8-fold more active than LysS in the production of this
   dinucleotide, This makes unlikely that the heat-inducible LysU species
   could be preferentially involved in the accumulation of Ap(4)A inside
   stressed Escherichia coli cells, This conclusion could be strengthened
   by determining the concentrations of Ap(4)N (N = A, C, G, or U) in a
   Delta lysU as well as in a lysU(+) strain, before and after a 1-h
   temperature shift at 48 degrees C. The measured concentration values
   were the same in both strains.}},

   protein that activates transcription by the sigma(54)-holoenzyme. To
   activate transcription, NtrC must hydrolyze ATP, a reaction that depends
   upon its being phosphorylated and forming an appropriate oligomer. In
   this paper we characterize `'constitutive'' mutant forms of the NtrC
   protein from Salmonella typhimurium; unlike wild-type NtrC, these forms
   are able to hydrolyze ATP and activate transcription in vitro without
   being phosphorylated. The amino acids altered in NtrC(constitutive)
   proteins are located in both the N-terminal regulatory domain and the
   central domain, which is directly responsible for transcriptional
   activation. The residues that are altered are not conserved among
   activators of the sigma(54)-holoenzyme, and are not identical even among
   Nt C proteins from members of different subgroups of the proteobacteria
   (purple bacteria). NtrC(constitutive) proteins are phosphorylated
   normally; phosphorylation increases their ability to hydrolyze ATP and
   activate transcription. Moreover, the oligomerization of these proteins
   that occurs when they bind to an enhancer also increases the ATPase
   activity of both unmodified and phosphorylated forms.
   Removal of the N-terminal regulatory domain from two NtrC(constitutive)
   proteins with amino acid substitutions in the central domain
   (NtrC(S160F) and NtrC(V2881)) leaves them active, indicating that
   essential oligomerization determinants lie outside the regulatory
   domain. This conclusion is confirmed by the observation that the ATPase
   activity of Delta N-NtrC(S160F) is greatly stimulated when it binds to
   an enhancer, and by the ability of this protein to activate
   transcription synergistically with a form of NtrC incapable of
   DNA-binding. Together with previous results indicating that
   oligomerization determinants do not lie in the C-terminal DNA-binding
   domain of NtrC; these results provide evidence that they lie in the
   central domain.}},

Abstract = {{We have previously shown that a tandem pair of (A/T)GATA(A/G) sequences
   in the promoter region of the Caenorhabditis elegans gut esterase gene
   (ges-1) controls the tissue specificity of ges-1 expression in vivo. The
   ges-1 GATA region was used as a probe to screen a C. elegans cDNA
   expression library, and a gene for a new C. elegans GATA-factor (named
   elt-2) was isolated. The longest open reading frame in the elt-2 cDNA
   codes for a protein of M(r) 47,000 with a single zinc finger domain,
   similar (approximately 75\% amino acid identity) to the C-terminal
   fingers of all other two-fingered GATA factors isolated to date. A
   similar degree of relatedness is found with the single-finger DNA
   binding domains of GATA factors identified in invertebrates. An upstream
   region in the ELT 8 protein with the sequence C-X(2)-C-X(16)-C-X(2)-C
   has some of the characteristics of a zinc finger domain but is highly
   diverged from the zinc finger domains of other GATA factors. The elt-2
   gene is expressed as an SL1 trans-spliced message, which can be detected
   at all stages of development except oocytes; however, elt-2 message
   levels are 5-10-fold higher in embryos than in other stages. The genomic
   clone for elt-2 has been characterized and mapped near the center of the
   C. elegans X chromosome. ELT-2 protein, produced by in. vitro
   transcription-translation, binds to ges-1 GATA-containing
   oligonucleotides similar to a factor previously identified in C. elegans
   embryo extracts, both as assayed by electrophoretic migration and by
   competition with wild type and mutant oligonucleotides. However, there
   is as yet no direct evidence that elt-2 does or does not control ges-1.}},

Abstract = {{The A2 domain (residues 373-740) of human blood coagulation factor VIII
   (fVIII) contains a major epitope for inhibitory alloantibodies and
   autoantibodies. We took advantage of the differential reactivity of
   inhibitory antibodies with human and porcine fVIII and mapped a major
   determinant of the A2 epitope by using a series; of active recombinant
   hybrid human/porcine fVIII molecules. Hybrids containing a substitution
   of porcine sequence at segment 410-508, 445-508, or 484-508 of the human
   A2 domain were not inhibited by a murine monoclonal antibody A2
   inhibitor, mAb 413, whereas hybrids containing substitutions at 387-403,
   387-444, and 387-468 were inhibited by mAb 413, This indicates that the
   segment bounded by Arg(484) and Ile(508) contains a major determinant of
   the A2 epitope. mAb 413 did not inhibit two more hybrids that contained
   porcine substitutions at residues 484-488 and 489-508, indicating that
   amino acid side chains on both sides of the Ser(488)-Arg(489) band
   within the Arg(484)-Ile(508) segment contribute to the A2 epitope. The
   484-508, 484-488, and 489-508 porcine substitution hybrids displayed
   decreased inhibition by A2 inhibitors from four patient plasmas,
   suggesting that there is little variation in the structure of the A2
   epitope in the inhibitor population.}},

Abstract = {{The relevant exposure to environmental pollutants or relevant
   confounders can virtually never be measured directly in sufficient
   detail in a sufficient number of people included in an epidemiological
   study. Instead, surrogate indicators of exposure are used that are
   implicitly or explicitly linked by (conceptual) models to the `relevant
   exposure'. Using specified indices (e.g., the coefficient of alienation
   and forecasting efficiency), the models of different forms can be
   compared and tested in special investigations. This can evaluate the
   criterion validity of the model through analysis of the agreement
   between the model estimates, based on measured surrogate indicators of
   the exposure, and the actual exposure. The perspective on the construct
   under study may further change the validity of the exposure indicator.
   Therefore, sub-studies evaluating the quality of exposure indicators
   should be considered as integral part of any study in environmental
   epidemiology, preferably as a pre-study or pilot study.}},

Abstract = {{Treatment of a wide variety of alcohols with trimethyl phosphite and

   bromide. Poor yields are generally obtained if solvents other than
   pyridine are employed or if carbon tetrabromide is replaced by carbon
   tetrachloride. The mildness of the procedure is illustrated by the
   conversion of the highly acid sensitive
   2-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityloxy)-1-phenylethanol to its dimethyl phosphate
   ester (74\%) and the base sensitive N-CBZ-tyrosine-p-nitrophenyl ester
   to the corresponding O-(dimethyl phosphate ester) (82\%). The
   availability of methods for the demethylation of methyl phosphate esters
   makes this oxidative phosphorylation reaction a mild and inexpensive

Abstract = {{The first synthesis of fully deprotected diimidotriphosphoric acid is
   described. The PNPNP sequence is obtained from an all protected cyclic
   precursor that can be regioselectively mono- or bis-functionalized with
   alcohols and amines in classical organic solvents. All protective groups
   can be removed at the end of the synthesis by catalytic hydrogenation to
   afford the corresponding PNPNP derivatives as a salt. The strategy
   developed allows a straightforward access to a new class of nucleotide

Abstract = {{Twelve sites around Gazi Bay, Kenya, were examined for macrobenthic
   infauna. Stations differed in human disturbance, vegetation, and
   sediment type (sandflat, beach, denuded and virgin mangrove sites, with
   Sonneratia, Rhizophora, Avicennia, Ceriops or Bruguiera vegetation).
   Sixteen higher taxa were counted; Isopoda, Amphipoda, Polychaeta,
   Cumacea and Tanaidacea were determined to family level (sometimes to
   genus or species). Total densities of infauna ranged from 265 to 6025
   ind m(-2).
   Gazi mangals had higher macrobenthos densities than other mangrove
   sediments described in literature and than the Gazi sandflats. The
   densities found in Gazi sandflats were comparable to similar habitats
   elsewhere.
   Virgin mangrove sediments were rich in mud and organic material, and
   were characterized by high densities of macro-Oligochaeta and Mollusca.
   Sandflats, beaches, exploited (denuded) and less dense mangroves or
   mangroves higher in the tidal zone (Bruguiera) were much more sandy and
   had a high abundance of Polychaeta and Nemertini.
   Structural patterns in the macrobenthos were only vaguely associated
   with vegetation type. Human impact (cutting) has resulted in a drastic
   decrease in densities of macro-infauna, possibly related to a reduction
   of organic material in the sediment.}},

   workplace and concern over lawsuits exhibited a significant relationship
   with the likelihood of sharing AIDS health information and gender was
   found to moderate the relationship between likelihood of sharing AIDS
   health information, and fear of AIDS in the workplace.  Male managers
   exhibited a higher level of fear of AIDS than female managers and did
   female managers, were found to be somewhat less likely than male
   managers to share AIDS health information with coworkers.  Study
   findings, suggestions for future research, and implications are

Abstract = {{It has previously been established that human rhinovirus 14 protease 3C
   binds specifically to the 5'-noncoding region of the viral RNA. A series
   of mutants of protease 3C and deletion or point mutants of the
   5'-noncoding region of the viral RNA were analyzed to elucidate the
   sites of interaction between the protease and the RNA. Amino acids in
   protease SC essential for RNA binding were found to be discontinuous in
   the amino acid sequence, and mutations which destroyed RNA binding did
   not affect the catalytic (proteolytic) activity of protease 3C. Based on
   the three-dimensional structure of rhinovirus 14 protease 3C, the RNA
   binding region is located in an extended area distinct from the
   catalytic triad. A single stem-loop structure of 27 nucleotides
   (stem-loop d) in the 5'-noncoding region was necessary and sufficient to
   bind protease 3C. Mutagenesis of either the base-paired stem or unpaired
   loop or bulge regions of stem-loop d suggested that the base-paired
   stem, but not the loop or bulge, carries important determinants of
   protease 3C binding. This conclusion is strengthened by the observation
   that rhinovirus 14 protease 3C bound specifically to the 5'-noncoding
   region of poliovirus RNA, and only the base-paired stem of stem-loop d
   is conserved between poliovirus and rhinovirus RNAs.}},

Abstract = {{Apoptosis, or programmed cell death (PCD), recently has emerged as an
   important homeostatic mechanism within several hematopoietic lineages.
   This process is subject to both positive and negative modulation by
   cytokines and within the erythroid lineage is inhibited by
   interleukin-3, stem cell factor, and erythropoietin (Epo). Through the
   expression of carboxyl-truncated Epo receptor mutants in FDC-P1 cells, a
   receptor form possessing 80 membrane-proximal cytoplasmic residues is
   shown to efficiently mediate Epo-dependent inhibition of PCD. This is in
   contrast to previous studies that attributed this activity to a distal
   carboxyl-terminal receptor subdomain (and/or heterodimerization of wild
   type Epo receptors with a truncated non-functional receptor form).
   Epo-dependent inhibition of PCD also is shown to be blocked by ectopic
   expression of kinase-deficient dominant-negative forms of Jak2 (Jak2
   Delta VIII and Jak2-829), further underlining a role of this
   membrane-proximal subdomain of the Epo receptor in the inhibition of
   PCD. To our knowledge, this comprises the first direct evidence for an
   essential role for a Jak tyrosine kinase (Jak2) in this apoptotic
   response pathway.}},
