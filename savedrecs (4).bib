Title = {{Holocene sea level dynamics drive formation of a large atoll island in
   the central Indian Ocean}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{195}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The impact of global environmental change on coral reef islands is
   uncertain with few studies having resolved the critical controls on
   island formation and change. Based on detailed, topographic surveys,
   sediment analysis and radiometric dating, we present a multi-phase model
   of the formation of a large inhabited reef island in the central Indian
   Ocean in response to Holocene sea level dynamics and transformations in
   reef development and reef ecology. The initial phase of island building
   occurred later than elsewhere reported in the Maldives, 2500-2100 years
   ago during the mid-Holocene sea level highstand. The island was able to
   support habitation shortly thereafter. Subsequent island expansion
   occurred as a consequence of relative sea-level fall and emergence of
   the reef platform that forced a transition in reef flat ecology and
   dominant sediment producers that contributed to island accumulation to
   the southwest. Small-scale sea level oscillations (+/- 0.8 m) over the
   past two millennia have driven periods of island accumulation, that
   intermittently reactivate geomorphic processes around the is-land
   shoreline. Significantly, the multiple phases of island development have
   occurred while the island has been continuously inhabited, demonstrating
   the adaptive capacity of the island community to multiple phases of
   change. Results highlight the complexity of reef island development and
   indicate that future physical trajectories will vary depending on not
   only relative sea level change, but how such changes modify water depth
   and wave regimes across reef surfaces, and changes in dominant sediment
   producers able to contribute to island building. This interrelationship
   differs between sites within and between reef regions and may account
   for currently expanding islands on reef surfaces.}},

Title = {{Drivers of plasticity n freeze tolerance in the intertidal mussel
   Mytilus trossulus}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{223}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Freezing is an extreme stress to living cells, and so freeze-tolerant
   animals often accumulate protective molecules (termed cryoprotectants)
   to prevent the cellular damage caused by freezing. The bay mussel,
   Mytilus trossulus, is an ecologically important intertidal invertebrate
   that can survive freezing. Although much is known about the biochemical
   correlates of freeze tolerance in insects and vertebrates, the
   cryoprotectants that are used by intertidal invertebrates are not well
   characterized. Previous work has proposed two possible groups of
   low-molecular weight cryoprotectants in intertidal invertebrates:
   osmolytes and anaerobic byproducts. In our study, we examined which
   group of candidate cryoprotectants correlate with plasticity in freeze
   tolerance in mussels using H-1 NMR metabolomics. We found that the
   freeze tolerance of M. trossulus varies on a seasonal basis, along an
   intertidal shore-level gradient, and with changing salinity. Acclimation
   to increased salinity (30 ppt compared with 15 ppt) increased freeze
   tolerance, and mussels were significantly more freeze tolerant during
   the winter. Mussel freeze tolerance also increased with increasing shore
   level. There was limited evidence that anaerobic byproduct accumulation
   was associated with increased freeze tolerance. However, osmolyte
   accumulation was correlated with increased freeze tolerance after high
   salinity acclimation and in the winter. The concentration of most low
   molecular weight metabolites did not vary with shore level, indicating
   that another mechanism is likely responsible for this pattern of
   variation in freeze tolerance. By identifying osmolytes as a group of
   molecules that assist in freezing tolerance, we have expanded the known
   biochemical repertoire of the mechanisms of freeze tolerance.}},

Title = {{Cultures of Fear: Individual Differences in Perception of Physical (but

Journal = {{EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{6}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Previous research indicates that dispositional worry about potential
   threats is associated with greater ingroup biases. However, the nature
   of this relationship within minority cultural groups, and the
   specificity of which threats matter most for this relationship, remain
   poorly understood. The current study thus aimed to build on existing
   work in three key ways: by simultaneously examining the effects of
   threat in both a mainstream and an immigrant population, by examining
   associations between threats and cultural practices and real-life
   interactions, and by addressing whether concerns about disease threats
   or physical threats were more robust predictors. Thus, we investigated
   the relative influence of physical- and disease-threat concerns for
   acculturation and ingroup preferences in both immigrant and
   non-immigrant Americans (N = 964, 171 immigrants). Immigrant Americans
   completed an acculturation survey in which their engagement with their
   heritage culture was compared with their engagement with mainstream
   American culture. Meanwhile, non-immigrant Americans responded to
   similar items assessing their engagement with US versus foreign cultural
   practices. Results indicated that dispositional worry about physical
   threats was associated with lower acculturation in immigrant
   participants, and lower engagement with foreign cultures in
   non-immigrant Americans. Further, in the combined sample, participants
   who were more concerned about physical threats were less likely to have
   had a romantic partner of a different ethnicity than their own. By
   contrast, dispositional worry about disease threat did not reliably
   predict cultural engagement or partner choice. These findings are
   consistent with the hypothesis that physical-threat concern leads to
   less engagement with foreign cultures.}},

Abstract = {{Balanced scorecard (BSC) is a quantified interpretation of organization
   strategy, which is delineated as a strategy map and describes the
   organizational performance on four perspectives of financial, customer,
   internal business process and learning and growth. The measures and
   objectives of BSC are derived from mission, vision and organization
   strategy. Organization strategy indicates how an organization creates
   value for the shareholders, customers and citizens. Furthermore,
   strategy is the very factor that guides an organization towards
   achieving its vision. In the same vein, the internal business process
   perspective describes the processes and measures that eventually lead to
   the desired level of performance in financial and customer perspectives.
   As a result, the existence of cause-and-effect relationships outlined in
   the form of strategy map are deemed as the guideline for the
   organization achievement. The cause-and-effect relationships determine
   the accurate route for strategy realization. Without having such
   associations, the organization is merely has access to a set of
   financial and non-financial measures. Taking the above into account, the
   present research has transformed the key measures in Iran's banking
   industry to quantified values and by using Granger causality test, it
   explores the cause-and-effect associations between the measures of
   process and financial perspectives. Eventually, it analyzes and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENDOVASCULAR RESUSCITATION AND TRAUMA MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{30-32}},
Month = {{WIN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Diaphragmatic injuries are rare in trauma victims, and
   mostly located on the left side. The standard approach is primary
   closure, using non-absorbable heavy interrupted sutures. Right-sided
   injuries are protected by the liver and such repair is not mandatory.
   However, closure of large defects, not suitable for primary suture,
   remains a challenging problem, especially in a military setting or in
   severely multiple-organ injured patients. Up until now, the single
   surgical solution in such situations is usage of absorbable mesh.
   Methods: The feasibility of a damage control closure technique for huge
   traumatic diaphragmatic injury was evaluated.
   Results: After creation of large diaphragmatic defects in an animal
   model, the defects were closed with an appropriately sized plastic
   (Bogota) bag and using a large abdominal pad, accordingly. The total
   procedure time was about 3 min and no chest re-protrusion was observed
   until completion of the experiment.
   Conclusions: This novel method is likely to be safe and simple to use as
   a damage control method and should be further investigated in proper
   models and clinically.}},

   toxic and more cost-effective than other membranes. The technique of
   EILM based on edible oils was used as a chemical process for Pb2+
   recovery from aqueous solution, using Aliquat 336 as an ionic liquid
   carrier and the ionic transport agent for Pb2+ ions in the membrane
   phase. The Tween 80 as a dispersive non-ionic surfactant was used for
   the emulsion formation. The kinetics and effective parameters on the
   membrane process performance were investigated. The results showed that
   factors such as the ratio of the internal phase to the organic phase,
   the concentration of ion carrier material, the surfactant concentration,
   and pH increasing had a positive effect on metal separation efficiency.
   The maximum lead separation was performed for 3 and 10 mu L of Aliquat
   336 and Tween 80, respectively, in 20 mL of the organic phase. A removal
   percentage of 95\% was achieved for 5 mg/L of lead in the feed phase.
   Using edible oil in this study was successfully developed to reduce the
   need for toxic organic solvents in preparing EILM for heavy metal
   solution treatment. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Hand washing is an important preventive measure to avoid
   transmission of Coronavirus Disease of 2019. Medical students should be
   acquainted with the World Health Organization's hand washing guidelines
   and should follow them to break the chain of spread of the virus. This
   study aims to find the acquaintance of medical undergraduates with the
   guidelines and to find out if they have started implementing these
   guidelines since the corona-virus outbreak.
   Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study, conducted among
   MBBS, BSc and PCL nursing students in first year to internship of a
   tertiary care hospital from May 2020 to August 2020, and ethical
   clearance was received from the Institutional Review Committee (ref no:
   IRC-LMC 11D/020) of Lumbini Medical College and Teaching Hospital. Data
   collection was done through online questionnaires. Data analysis of the
   obtained information was done in Microsoft-excel. Point estimate at 95\%
   Confidence Interval was calculated along with frequency and proportion
   for binary data.
   Results: Of 462 respondents, 265 (57.4\%) (52.9-61.9 at 95\% Confidence
   Interval) respondents followed the World Health Organization
   hand-washing guidelines during every hand wash. Among them 172 (37.2\%)
   participants had learned the guidelines through awareness programs. The
   majority of respondents belonged to 20-25 age groups, 275 (59.5\%), and
   the majority were pursuing an MBBS degree, 360 (77.9\%).
   Conclusions: We conclude that a notable number of medical undergraduates
   have been acquainted with standard hand-washing guidelines since the
   corona-virus outbreak, but some of them still do not follow the
   guidelines practically. Therefore, effective and impactful awareness
   programs need to be launched to improve hand hygiene practices.}},

Abstract = {{The proper understanding of earthquake geometry and location is very
   important to understand the seismicity of an area. In the present study,
   185 earthquakes that occurred in the northwest Himalaya of magnitude M-w
   > 0.6 between 2010 and 2013 were relocated using the Modified Joint
   Hypocenter Determination method. After examining seven velocity models,
   average V-P/V-S similar to 1.73 computed by Wadati diagram is used to
   improve the hypocenter locations of the earthquakes. Based on
   hypocentral distributions, these earthquakes were classified into four
   groups. Group 1 is along the Punjal Thrust in Hazara Kashmir Syntaxes.
   Group 2 belongs to the Indus-Kohistan Seismic Zone whereas group 3 is
   along the Besham dome and the fourth group is along the Main Mantle
   Thrust. Shallow crustal earthquakes were relocated to 0-50 km, deep
   earthquakes were relocated to 50-100 km, and much deep earthquakes were
   relocated to 250-350 km depth. This analysis will be helpful to
   understand the seismicity of the northwest Himalaya of Pakistan.}},

Journal = {{OPTIK}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{223}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A single-layer N719 sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 films have been
   successfully deposited on FTO-coated glass substrates using the
   screen-printing technique with four different thicknesses (10, 12, 14
   and 18 mu m) and used as simple and low cost photoanodes for
   dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The thickness was controlled by
   adjusting the distance between the screen-printing mesh and the
   FTO-coated substrate using the two height control bolts. The films were
   deposited using one-time screen-printing method. So that the multiple
   screen-printing and annealing cycles can be reduced. Furthermore, the
   cell fabrication time was reduced as well as the problem of
   recombination at the interfacial layers between the TiO2 films was
   avoided. The thickness of the TiO2 films was measured by the surface
   profilometer. The prepared photoanode samples were characterized using
   FESEM, EDX, AFM, and UV-vis-NIR spectroscopies. The ruthenium dye
   soaking time was optimized at 48 h. The photovoltaic parameters such as
   short circuit current density (I-sc), open-circuit voltage (V-oc), fill
   factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (eta) were measured for
   fabricated cells at room temperature under one sunlight 100 mW/cm(2)
   illumination using the solar simulator. The effect of TiO2 film
   thickness on the fabricated DSSCs performance parameters was studied.
   DSSC devices with average thickness 12 mu m achieved the highest
   conversion efficiency of 5.13 \% with J(sc) = 12.12 mA/cm(2), and V-oc =
   0.69 V. The obtained results revealed that the amount of the adsorbed
   dye increases with the increase in the TiO2 film thickness and thus
   improve photogenerated current. However, exceeding the optimum
   photoanode thickness results in decline in the photogenerated current
   and the overall efficiency due to back electrons recombination and the
   lower photoanode transmittance.}},

Title = {{The CH1 alpha domain of mucosal gp41 IgA contributes to antibody
   specificity and antiviral functions in HIV-1 highly exposed
   Sero-Negative individuals}},
Journal = {{PLOS PATHOGENS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{The antibody molecule comprises a variable domain conferring antigen
   specificity and affinity distinct from the heavy chain constant (CH)
   domains dictating effector functions. We here interrogate this paradigm
   by evaluating the unique influence of the CH1 alpha domain on epitope
   specificity and functions using two mucosal gp41-specific Fab-IgAs
   (FabA) derived from HIV-1 highly-exposed but persistently seronegative
   individuals (HESN). These HESN develop selectively affinity-matured
   HIV-1-specific mucosal IgA that target the gp41 viral envelope and might
   provide protection although by unclear mechanisms. Isotype-switching
   FabAs into Fab-IgGs (FabGs) results in a >10-fold loss in affinity for
   HIV-1 clade A, B, and C gp41, together with reduced neutralization of
   HIV-1 cross-clade. The FabA conformational epitopes map selectively on
   gp41 in 6-Helix bundle and pre-fusion conformations cross-clade, unlike
   FabGs. Finally, we designed in silico, a 12 amino-acid peptide
   recapitulating one FabA conformational epitope that inhibits the FabA
   binding to gp41 cross-clade and its neutralizing activity. Altogether,
   our results reveal that the CH1 alpha domain shapes the antibody
   paratope through an allosteric effect, thereby strengthening the
   antibody specificity and functional activities. Further, they clarify
   the mechanisms by which these HESN IgAs might confer protection against
   HIV-1-sexual acquisition. The IgA-specific epitope we characterized by
   reverse vaccinology could help designing a mucosal HIV-1 vaccine.
   Author summary
   In HIV-1 highly exposed persistently seronegative individuals (HESN),
   protection is a multifactorial phenomenon whereby mucosal IgA, but not
   IgG, play a determinant anti-viral role. The HESN IgA response focuses
   on conserved regions of the HIV-1 envelope gp41 subunit, in contrast
   with the broader IgG and IgA response observed in HIV-1-infected
   individuals. How protective only IgA, but not IgG, develop in HESN
   remains unclear. We addressed the role of the CH1 domain of each isotype
   in antigen recognition and functions by comparing mucosal gp41 specific
   Fab-IgA1 (FabA) derived from HESN with paired Fab-IgG1 (FabG). We show
   that structural differences in the CH1 alpha and gamma domains impact
   affinity constants, FabA having higher affinity for gp41 derived from
   clade A, B and C. FabA neutralization of clade A, B and C HIV-1
   infection and transfer from Langerhans to CD4+T cells were cross clade
   and higher than that observed with corresponding IgG. Accordingly, FabA
   and G recognize different gp41 epitopes on gp41 clade A, B and C gp41
   crystal structures. Using molecular modeling, we defined a peptide
   corresponding to one 3-D epitope common to gp41 clade A, B and C gp41
   specific for one of the FabA that reverses the FabA neutralizing
   activities. Altogether, we show here that the CH1 domain influences the
   antibody paratope and in turn its specificity and functional activities.
   The FabA cross-clade epitopes retrieved on gp41 could be useful in
   mucosa vaccine design against HIV-1.}},

Abstract = {{A single-phase transformerless midpoint clamped H-bridge zero-voltage
   switch-controlled rectifier inverter topology is proposed in this
   article for photovoltaic (PV) systems to address the issue of
   common-mode (CM) voltage and leakage currents. Apart from the full
   H-bridge inverter, the proposed voltage clamping circuit consists of two
   switches and a fullbridge diode which clamps the ac terminal to the dc
   midpoint (consisting of two dc-link capacitors) during the freewheeling
   period. As a result, the CM voltage is held constant, which makes it
   suitable for the grid-connected PV system. The operating principle and
   CM effect of the proposed topology are analyzed and compared with the
   conventional topologies. This is followed by the thermal analysis and
   loss calculation, which shows that the proposed circuit is more
   efficient over the conventional topologies. Validation is carried out
   using MATLAB-Simulink using the PLECS toolbox followed by a scale down
   prototype of 1.5 kW. It is shown that the proposed inverter has the 98\%
   +/- 1\% efficiency over a wide range of loads with a peak efficiency of
   98.96\%, and the total harmonic distortion of the output current
   relatively low (<= 1.8\%). The leakage current (i(cm)) is measured for
   different values of parasitic capacitance that reaches a maximum of
   16.65 mA for 330-nF capacitor under consideration, which is well below
   the limit set by different safety standards.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural pest infestation is as old as domestication of food crops
   and contributes a major share to the cost of crop production. In a
   transgenic pest control approach, plant production of Vip3A, an
   insecticidal protein from Bacillus thuringiensis, is effective against
   lepidopteran pests. A synthetic Vip3A gene was evaluated for efficacy
   against Spodoptera litura Fabricius (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae; cotton
   leafworm), Spodoptera exigua Hubner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae; beet
   armyworm), Spodoptera frugiperda Smith (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae; fall
   armyworm), Helicoverpa armigera Hubner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae; cotton
   bollworm), Helicoverpa zea Boddie (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae; corn
   earworm), Heliothis virescens Fabricius (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae; tobacco
   budworm), and Manduca sexta L. (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae; tobacco
   hornworm) in tobacco. In artificial diet assays, the concentration
   required to achieve 50\% mortality was highest for H. zea followed by H.
   virescens > S. exigua > H. armigera > M. sexta > S. frugiperda > S.
   litura. By contrast, in bioassays with detached leaves from Vip3A
   transgenic tobacco, the time until 50\% lethality was M. sexta > H.
   virescens > S. litura > H. zea > H. armigera > S. exigua. There was no
   significant correlation between the artificial diet and transgenic plant
   bioassay results. Notably, the two insect species that are best-adapted
   for growth on tobacco, M. sexta and H. virescens, showed the greatest
   time to 50\% mortality on Vip3A-transgenic tobacco. Together, our
   results suggest that artificial diet assays may be a poor predictor of
   Vip3A efficacy in transgenic plants, lepidopteran species vary in their
   sensitivity to Vip3A in diet- dependent manner, and host plant
   adaptation of the targeted herbivores should be considered when
   designing transgenic plants for pest control.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Today, online shopping has become one of the most important
   components of modern marketing that had both positive and negative
   consequences for customers. Objectives. The purpose of present research
   was to study the consequences of fear of identity theft in sport
   products online shopping from the perspective of physical education
   students. Methods. The present study is a descriptive-correlational
   survey and its statistical population includes all physical education
   students of Golestan province universities that 384 students were
   selected through available sampling as the statistical sample of the
   study. To collec research data, Hille et al (2015) fear of identity
   theft questionnaire, Chen et al (2015) perceived risk questionnaire and
   Chou \& Hsu (2016) willingness to online shop questionnaire were used.
   Validity of the questionnaires was verified by 8 masters of sport
   management and internal consistency of questionnaires by using
   Cronbach's alpha was determined respectively 0.86, 0.78 and 0.81. To
   analyze the data and identify the effects of research variables,
   structural equation modeling was used in the PLS software. Results. The
   result showed that fear of losing money in the customer has a positive
   and significant effect on perceived risk. The effect of fear of credit
   damage in the customer on perceived risk was positive and significant.
   Finally, the results showed that the effect of perceived risk on the
   physical education students' willingness to online shopping was negative
   and significant. Conclusion. According to the results of the study,
   increasing awareness of physical education students about the selling
   rules of sports websites and increasing the security of sport products
   websites in order to reduce consumers' fears and concerns are suggested.}},

Title = {{Ventricular fibrillation induced by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate under

Volume = {{68}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Ventricular fibrillation is an electrophysiological disorder
   leading to cardiac arrest that can be caused using chemicals. The
   2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-apb) is a poorly understood compound
   that modulates store operated calcium entry and gapjunctions and can
   provoke ventricular fibrillation. Our study aimed to investigate the
   effect of 2-apb on the work of an isolated rat heart and coronary
   vessels under normoxic conditions, as well as under conditions of
   hypoxia/reoxygenation, that affect intracellular calcium.
   METHODS: In order to accomplish this task, we used Langendorff rat heart
   preparation and multi-electrode registration of bioelectric activity of
   the heart with flexible arrays. An analysis of changes in the volume of
   coronary blood flow was also performed.
   RESULTS: Arrhythmogenic effect of 2-apb on an isolated rat heart was
   shown: an increase in the frequency and variability of the heart rhythm,
   a decrease in the electrical conductivity of the myocardium, and the
   appearance of ventricular fibrillation. Under hypoxic conditions, the
   arrhythmogenic effect of 2-apb decreased and no ventricular fibrillation
   was observed. In addition, 2-apb had a stabilizing effect on coronary
   vessels and weakened the effect of reoxygenation on the electrical
   activity of the heart.
   CONCLUSIONS: Obtained results indicate that the effect of arrhythmogenic
   chemicals, for example, proarrhythmic drugs that affect the myocardial
   {[}Ca2+](in). depended on the oxygen supply to the heart. The components
   of the store operated calcium entry and gap junctions can become
   promising therapeutic targets for controlling the physiological
   disorders of the heart and blood vessels caused or accompanied by
   reoxygenation.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents an experimental study of dust effect on the
   photovoltaic system's performance for various tilt angles in semi-arid
   environment. For analysis, eight PV modules were installed on the roof
   of a building at tilt angles of 0 degrees, 15 degrees, 30 degrees, and
   45 degrees with an azimuth angle of 0 degrees. Each pair of PV modules
   were installed at the same tilt angle. In each pair of modules, one was
   cleaned every two weeks and the other one was left under outdoor
   environmental condition. In order to analyze PV performances, the output
   power of the modules, as well as the climate parameters, were measured
   every one minute. The results showed that the reduction rate of PV
   performance due to dust accumulation is strongly dependent on the tilt
   angle. A dust storm has occurred in the mid-test period, which has
   reduced the daily average energy generated of PV modules at tilt angles
   of 0 degrees, 15 degrees, 30 degrees, and 45 degrees by 58.2\%, 27.8\%,
   21.7\%, and 20.7\%, respectively. However, for a few weeks before the
   dust storm, the average reduction ratio of the daily energy generated of
   PV modules due to dust accumulation was 8.6\% for the horizontal module
   and 0.8\% for the other tilted modules.}},

Abstract = {{Q fever is a zoonotic infection threatening human health, causing
   abortions in cattle, sheep and goats. Coxiella burnetii (C. burnetii)
   also causes serious problems such as low birth weight, infertility. This
   study is the first exemplary for analysis of Q fever around Black Sea
   region in Turkey. In the study, a total of 270 aborted fetuses (171
   cattle, 79 sheep, 20 goats) and 1069 tick samples were aimed to be
   searched by PCR method. C. burnetii DNA was detected in 8 (2.96 \%) of
   270 sheep specimens while it could not be found in cattle and goat
   specimens. 406 sample pools were created from 1069 tick samples (490
   male, 579 female) collected from 254 farm animals (187 cattle, 54 sheep,
   13 goats) and 11 of these were stated positive. Tick species determined
   as C. burnetii positive were Hyalomma marginatum, Hyalomma anoliticum
   excavatum, Hyalomma detritum and Boophilus annulatus. Agent isolation
   was carried out within embryonated eggs. Agents were stained with Giemsa
   and was showed. Sequence analysis was performed for TUR/SAM/coxiella\_1
   (MN917207) isolate and phylogenetic tree was created. This tree, created
   in compliance with IS1111 transposon gene, did not form different
   branches in regard to host affiliation (goat, sheep, tick, human) and
   geographical distribution. As a result, an important zoonotic agent, C.
   burnetii was diagnosed in sheep aborted fetuses and the infection was
   proved to have spread among sheep herds in Black Sea region. Besides, 4
   separate tick species found in our region hosted the agent and were
   found important for infection.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Prolonged grief disorder (PGD) is a new mental health
   disorder included in the WHO ICD-11 however, the operationalization of
   the guidelines still needs to be empirically validated, particularly in
   different cultural contexts. Here we provide a preliminary validation
   study of the new International Prolonged Grief Disorder Scale (IPGDS)
   that serves to be the first self-report questionnaire directly based on
   the ICD-11 PGD and contains culturally adapted items.
   Methods: In addition to core symptom items new culturally specific items
   were developed in two phases. Phase 1: key informant interviews with 10
   German-speaking and 14 Chinese experts in grief and mental health,
   followed by a focus group with four bereaved German-speaking
   participants. Phase 2: 214 German-speaking and 325 Chinese bereaved
   participants completed self-report questionnaires.
   Results: Phase 1 resulted in 19 potential culturally relevant items
   (e.g. feeling stuck in grief). Phase 2 exploratory factor analysis
   confirmed the one-dimensional nature of the IPGDS, additionally the
   32-item scale revealed two factors (core grief and culturally specific
   symptoms). Psychometric analysis revealed strong internal consistency,
   concurrent validity and criterion validity. Limitations: The
   German-speaking and Chinese samples significantly differed in terms of
   several demographic variables including age, gender and type of loss.
   Conclusions: This preliminary validity study confirms that the IPGDS is
   a valid and reliable measure of the new ICD-11 PGD guidelines. This is
   the first scale of disordered grief to contain both core items and
   culturally specific supplementary items and aims to improve the clinical
   utility of the ICD-11 narrative approach.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: We aimed to analyze factors associated with
   the period of viral shedding in patients with confirmed COVID-19 who
   experienced only mild symptoms. Materials and methods: We conducted a
   multicenter retrospective study from three community treatment centers
   (CTCs) of South Korea. All patients included were admitted to the three
   centers before 31 March 2020. We collected data about clinical
   characteristics and the result of real-time reverse transcription
   polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: Viral shedding was
   terminated within 32 days and 36 days in 75\% and 90\% of patients,
   respectively (range: 8-49 days). The mean period of viral shedding was
   23.8 +/- 8.7 days. In the multivariate Cox proportional hazards
   regression analysis, the existence of underlying comorbidities lowered
   the probability of the termination of viral shedding (HR = 0.561, 95\%
   CI 0.388-0.812). Female sex and presence of COVID-19-associated symptoms
   also lowered the probability, but the significance was marginal.

   Targeting Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase}},
Journal = {{NUTRIENTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Propolis is a resinous substance generated by bees using materials from
   various plant sources. It has been known to exhibit diverse
   bioactivities including anti-oxidative, anti-microbial,
   anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer effects. However, the direct
   molecular target of propolis and its therapeutic potential against skin
   aging in humans is not fully understood. Herein, we investigated the
   effect of propolis on ultraviolet (UV)-mediated skin aging and its
   underlying molecular mechanism. Propolis suppressed UV-induced matrix
   metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 production in human dermal fibroblasts. More
   importantly, propolis treatment reduced UV-induced MMP-1 expression and
   blocked collagen degradation in human skin tissues, suggesting that the
   anti-skin-aging activity of propolis can be recapitulated in clinically
   relevant conditions. While propolis treatment did not display any
   noticeable effects against extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK),
   p38, and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways, propolis exerted
   significant inhibitory activity specifically against phosphorylations of
   phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) and protein kinase B
   (Akt). Kinase assay results demonstrated that propolis can directly
   suppress phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity, with preferential
   selectivity towards PI3K with p110 alpha and p110 delta catalytic
   subunits over other kinases. The content of active compounds was
   quantified, and among the compounds identified from the propolis
   extract, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, quercetin, and apigenin were
   shown to attenuate PI3K activity. These results demonstrate that
   propolis shows anti-skin-aging effects through direct inhibition of PI3K
   activity.}},

Title = {{Trend and Prospect of Study on Chinese Medical History - Diversification
   of the Study on Medical History Study Through Integration and

Journal = {{KOREAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL HISTORY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{This study has focused on studying Chinese medical history for the past
   10 years (2010-2019). There has been no overall introduction to how the
   study of Chinese medical history has been carried out so far in Korea.
   To understand the trend for the recent 10 years, understanding of the
   period before that is needed. This study had classified the study trend
   of Chinese medical history from the 1950s when the study of Chinese
   medical history started in full swing until the last 10 years into the
   following three periods:
   First period: internal study period on Chinese medical history (the
   1950s-1980s)
   Second period: external study period on Chinese medical history (the
   1980s-1990s)
   Third period: diverse study period on Chinese medical history through
   integration and communication (2010-2019)
   There can be an opinion that various studies by each period have not
   been adequately reflected, and the classification has been excessively
   simplified. For example, the internal study has been considerably
   performed in the second period, and the consciousness of conflict
   between the internal study and external study remains in the third
   period. Nonetheless, the keywords that connote each period's
   characteristics for the past 70 years are considered the keywords
   presented above.
   The study of Chinese medical history has mainly placed importance on the
   modern times. Indeed, no change has been present as well. However, the
   fact that the study on the Chinese pre-modern medical history in Korean
   academia for the past 10 years has quantitatively grown from just a
   comparison of the number of papers can be identified. Also, the
   researchers and study themes have been confirmed to be diversified. In
   the past, ancient Chinese medicine was understood as a connection
   between Taoism and medicine. The environmental history researchers dealt
   with the connection between natural disasters and diseases, and just a
   few studies in the fields of medicinal herb distribution and the
   viewpoint of the body were carried out. Meanwhile, studies from the
   pre-Qin Dynasty to the Han Dynasty were carried out based on new data
   such as the archaeological relics and bamboo and wooden slips in the
   Korean academia for the past 10 years. Discovering new data is
   undoubtedly a driving force to activate studies.
   Studies on the Tang Dynasty Medical System and laws based on
   `Chunsungryeong' are significant achievements connecting the Qin Dynasty
   \& Han Dynasty and the Song Dynasty \& Yuan Dynasty. Identification of
   each period's medical system in medical history is the most essential
   thing, and the combination of environment and medical history is
   conducted. It is significant to examine medical history from the
   viewpoint of the academic disciplines' integration. Approaching medical
   history from the female viewpoint has already started in the U.S.,
   Europe, and Taiwan, and it is nice that such a study has been conducted
   in Korean academia.
   There are not many researchers on Chinese medical history in Korean
   academia. As several researchers have led the study, the study's
   concentration on specific periods or specific themes cannot be denied.
   The integration of systematic research achievements from the pre-Qin
   Dynasty until the Qing Dynasty is still minimal. Specifically, the study
   on pre-modern medical history targets a more extensive period than the
   study on modern medical history; therefore, researchers' density is low.
   This is why the possibility of intersection is not high in the period,
   region, and theme between researchers. This can be the source of an
   evaluation that study on medical history chain is sparse. It is wistful
   that the study continuity or systematic research is lacking. To overcome
   such a limitation, existing researchers need to conduct collaborative
   joint planning and research centered on particular themes through
   cooperation. They need to complement the study's sparse part in medical
   history through multidisciplinary co-research.
   Beyond the research centered on country study history, attempts to
   understand history as global history are being carried out. Studies on
   the exchange and interrelations between Western medicine and Chinese
   medicine have been performed in Chinese medical history. Nonetheless,
   studies on the exchange and interrelations of medical knowledge, medical
   systems, medicinal herbs, medical books, medical workforce, and diseases
   (epidemics) from global history are insufficient.
   Studies on a medical history that started from Chinese science and
   technology development history in the 1950s are developing to discuss
   one theme diversely. Plenty of studies on Chinese medical history need
   to be performed in various fields, including environmental history, the
   history of women, archeology, humanities, humanities therapy, integrated
   medical humanities, medical literature, medical theory, and medical
   system, which are the traditional fields.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the changes in postoperative
   aortic regurgitation (AR) and determine the predictors of significant AR
   and root reoperation after ascending aortic replacement (AAR) in
   patients with acute type A aortic dissection.
   Methods: From January 1995 to December 2017, 271 consecutive patients
   underwent valve/root-preserving AAR (n = 225) and root replacement (n =
   46). AR grade trend over time was analyzed by the ordinal mixed-effects
   model. Significant AR was defined as AR grade >= 3+ during the follow-up
   period. Predischarge and follow-up echocardiograms were obtained in
   95.6\% and 88.8\% of enrolled patients, respectively.
   Results: At predischarge, postoperative >= 2+ AR was present in 20
   (9.3\%) and 1 (2.3\%) patients in the AAR and root replacement groups,
   respectively. With increasing time after surgery, the grade of AR
   increased. At 10 years, 4.6\% of patients had developed 3+ or 4+ AR.
   Considering death as the competing risk, the 10-year cumulative
   incidence of significant AR was significantly higher in the AAR than in
   the root replacement group (12.3\% vs 2.2\%; P = .047). The risk of root
   reoperation at 10 years was not different between the groups (P = .118).
   On Cox analysis, preoperative >= 3+ AR (P = .002), postoperative >= 2+
   AR (P = .040), and false to true lumen ratio (P = .005) were associated
   predictors of significant AR.
   Conclusions: Although valve/root-preserving AAR demonstrated reasonable
   long-term outcomes when compared with root replacement, preoperative >=
   3+ AR, postoperative >= 2+ AR, and high false to true lumen ratio
   significantly increased the risk of significant AR. Therefore, careful
   echocardiographic surveillance may be warranted in patients with
   postoperative >= 2+ AR and small true lumen.}},

Journal = {{CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{119}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The present study aims to identify the trajectory pattern of truancy
   from early adolescence in South Korea and to examine the association of
   each trajectory pattern with social-ecological based factors. The
   participants were 2378 elementary school students who completed the
   Korean Welfare Panel Study at five time points that covered from late
   elementary school to the first year of high school. Latent Class Growth
   Analysis identified three truancy trajectories: truancy increasing
   group, truancy decreasing group, and non-truant group. At the individual
   level, the truancy increasing group was more likely to be composed of
   males and have higher levels of game use than non-truants. Both the
   truancy increasing and decreasing group were more likely to have higher
   levels of aggression and depression than the non-truant group. At the
   family level, non-traditional structures and poor parental affection
   were more associated with the truancy increasing group. At the
   peer/friend level, the truancy increasing group was more likely to have
   poor peer relations than the non-truant group or truancy decreasing
   group, and more likely to have associations with delinquent peers than
   the non-truant group. At the school level, the truancy increasing group
   reported being less likely to have positive relations with teachers, to
   engage in school activities, and to follow school rules than the
   non-truant group. These findings could allow for more specific and
   targeted interventions designed to meet the needs and risk factors
   associated with the different typologies of truants in South Korea.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Findings on sleep bruxism (SB) in patients with obstructive sleep apnea
   syndrome (OSAS) are controversial, and some of these findings have
   relied on in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG). We aimed to identify the
   factors associated with SB episodes in 100 patients with OSAS using
   in-laboratory PSG records. Subjects with OSAS were divided into those
   with and without SB episodes. We analyzed the differences in patient
   characteristics and PSG indices. Age, gender, height, weight, body mass
   index, neck, waist, and hip circumferences, and the rates of
   hypertension and diabetes mellitus were not significantly different
   between the two groups. A greater proportion of stage N2 sleep in the
   total sleep time, longer total sleep time, longer sleep time in a supine
   position, shorter sleep time in a nonsupine position, lower
   apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), lower AHI regardless of sleeping position,
   lower AHI during nonrapid eye movement sleep, and higher mean oxygen
   saturation level were associated with SB episodes in patients with OSAS.
   Among these factors, longer sleep time in a supine position remained a
   statistically significant factor in multivariate analysis. We conclude
   that longer sleep time in a supine position (especially >280 min) might
   be associated with SB episodes in patients with OSAS.}},

Abstract = {{High-frequency mechanical impact (HFMI) post-treatment is a proven
   method to improve the fatigue life of welded structures. The positive
   effects of HFMI treatment are influenced by the weld toe geometries and
   residual stresses. This study investigates the effect of geometric and
   mechanical improvements by HFMI treatment on fatigue strength with
   explicit consideration of the weld toe magnification factor. General
   fatigue life estimation method is based on experiment data, and residual
   stress may be considered in addition. In terms of HFMI-treated
   structures, geometric improvement also affects the fatigue life. Thus, a
   more efficient method is suggested by considering the weld toe
   magnification factor to assess the effects of HFMI treatment. First, the
   weld toe magnification factor in HFMI-treated conditions is calculated
   to consider the geometrical effect of HFMI treatment at the weld toe
   region. Second, a stress ratio model is introduced to consider the
   compressive residual stress by HFMI treatment based on the Paris
   equation. The results were validated by comparing them with the
   estimated fatigue life from previous studies on HFMI-treated welded

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Patients with gastric cancer who receive neoadjuvant therapy
   are staged before treatment (cStage) and after treatment (ypStage). We
   aimed to compare the prognostic reliability of cStage and ypStage, alone
   and in combination.
   Materials and Methods: Data for all patients who received neoadjuvant
   therapy followed by surgery for gastric adenocarcinoma from 2004 to 2015
   were extracted from the National Cancer Database. Kaplan-Meier
   (KM)curves were used to model overall survival based on cStage alone,
   ypStage alone, cStage stratified by ypStage, and ypStage stratified by
   cStage. P-values were generated to summarize the differences in KM
   curves. The discriminatory power of survival prediction was examined
   using Harrell's C-statistics.
   Results: We included 8,977 patients in the analysis. As expected,
   increasing cStage and ypStage were associated with worse survival. The
   discriminatory prognostic power provided by cStage was poor (C-statistic
   0.548), while that provided by ypStage was moderate (C-statistic 0.634).
   Within each cStage, the addition of ypStage information significantly
   altered the prognosis (P<0.0001 within cStages 1-IV). However, for each
   ypStage, the addition of cStage information generally did not alter the
   prognosis (P= 0.2874, 0.027, 0.061, 0.049, and 0.007 within ypStages
   0-IV, respectively). The discriminatory prognostic power provided by the
   combination of cStage and ypStage was similar to that of ypStage alone
   (C-statistic 0.636 vs. 0.634).
   Conclusions: The cStage is unreliable for prognosis, and ypStage is
   moderately reliable. Combining cStage and ypStage does not improve the
   discriminatory prognostic power provided by ypStage alone. A
   ypStage-based prognosis is minimally affected by the initial cStage.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Inter-mortality displacement (IMD) between cause-specific
   mortalities has not been introduced in air pollution epidemiology.
   Investigation into IMD would provide insights on the actual health
   burden of air pollution and interpretation of associations. We aimed to
   investigate IMD regarding short-term effect of air pollution on
   mortality.
   Methods: We illustrated manifestations and interpretations of
   lag-mortality associations. If IMD exists, a net increase of one
   cause-specific death can be offset by a net decrease of other
   cause-specific deaths. We conducted a time-series analysis to estimate
   associations of ambient particulate matter smaller than 10 mu m (PM10),
   ozone (O-3), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon
   monoxide (CO) with mortality, considering lags up to the previous 45
   days, for seven major cities of South Korea from 2006 to 2013.
   Attributable mortality cases were identified.
   Results: For O-3, respiratory mortality {[}11 929 cases, 95\% empirical
   confidence interval (eCI), 5358, 17 688 cases] was counterbalanced by
   cardiovascular mortality (-11 272 cases, 95\% eCI: -22 444, -629 cases).
   All-cause mortality was 37 148 cases (95\% eCI: 4448, 68 782 cases). For
   PM10, respiratory deaths were 9167 cases (95\% eCI: 563, 16 521 cases),
   and cardiovascular deaths were 6929 cases (95\% eCI: -11 793, 24 138
   cases). Estimates for SO2 were comparable to those for PM10. All-cause
   mortality attributable to NO2 was explained by short-term mortality
   displacement. No associations with mortality were found for CO.
   Conclusions: IMD may exist in the relationship between air pollution and
   mortality. The actual relationship between air pollution and
   cause-specific mortality may be masked by IMD.}},

Abstract = {{The solenoid coil is one of the most important design component for
   efficient electrical energy conversion in the structure of electric
   machines such as motors, generators, and transformers. When the current
   is applied to a multi-turn solenoid coil, a uniform magnetic field which
   is proportional to the number of coil windings is generated inside the
   coil, and the high-density magnetic field generated by the coil can be
   converted into mechanical kinetic energy by applying the strong
   electromagnetic force to a ferromagnetic object. However, the
   interaction between the current and magnetic field of the solenoid coil
   generates a strong electromagnetic force between each coil wire. In this
   paper, when the current flows in the multi-turn solenoid coil, the
   analysis method and numerical equation for calculating the
   electromagnetic expansion force generated in the radial direction of a
   multi-turn solenoid coil are proposed. Calculated results are verified

Abstract = {{Background: Past research has established the importance of discursive
   leadership in professional communication, but it has not systematically
   examined how conformity behaviors emerge as a potentially undesirable
   consequence of discursive leadership. Literature review: Review of the
   literature on the centrality of communication in leadership processes
   and conformity behavior suggest a void of analytic tools to adequately
   examine the negative consequences of discursive leadership. Research
   question: Are later interlocutors more likely to speak similarly to
   earlier ones if the earlier interlocutors occupy a more central position
   in the conversation network? Methodology: Based on 32,000 words of a
   transcribed meeting corpus, we measured conformity behaviors using Term
   Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency scores, which are widely used in
   the information retrieval setting. We also operationalized the strength
   of discursive leadership as a positional centrality measure in the
   conversation network using a matrix algebra approach in social network
   analysis. Results: Findings support the hypothesis that discursive
   leadership is associated with conformity in language aligned toward
   discursive leaders' opinions. Conclusions: This study makes theoretical
   advances in understanding leadership construction and conformity
   behaviors between leaders and followers using empirical, authentic
   meeting data. We also give business people an applied understanding of
   the process of discursive leadership, which may help them to improve
   communication efficacy in their organizations by reducing overly
   conforming behaviors. We recommend that future research include more
   diverse participants and be combined with a survey to supplement the
   conversation data.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate the cardiometabolic risk
   factors (CRFs) in community dwelling men based on a combination of body
   mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC). This cross-sectional
   study was based on 867 males between the ages of 20 and 71 years.
   Subjects were categorized into 4 groups by BMI and WC (Group 1, BMI < 25
   kg/m(2) and WC < 90 cm; Group 2, BMI < 25 kg/m(2) and WC > 90 cm; Group
   3, BMI > 25 kg/m(2) and WC < 90 cm; and Group 4 BMI > 25 kg/m(2) and WC
   > 90 cm). The proportion of subjects with a normal weight with high WC
   was 3.2\%. Among normal weight men with the high range of WC,
   significantly high Odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% CI were found for
   hypertriglyceridemia (3.8, 1.8-8.2) and high blood glucose (3.2,
   1.5-6.9). The probability that the general obesity group (Group 3) had
   one CRF was around twice that of the reference group (Group 1) (1.9 to
   2.1 times), but Group 2 had probability more than 4 times higher (4.3 to
   4.6 times). In community dwelling adult men, normal weight with high
   waist circumference was associated with the highest cardiometabolic
   risk. In conclusion, follow-up screening of those with high WC may be
   necessary to detect and prevent cardiometabolic diseases, particularly
   for men with a normal weight.}},

Abstract = {{We often use topical antibiotics for simple excisions or the skin after
   minor wounds. This is a long-standing practice to minimize scarring by
   preventing wound or surgical site infection to promote wound healing. Is
   this old practice the right way for today? Is there a scientific basis
   for it and can it persist? These questions are related to the increase
   in antibiotic-resistant bacteria in Korea. Currently, the guidelines for
   the use of oral antibiotics have been established and are being applied
   relatively well-controlled to prevent overuse and misuse, while
   discussions for evaluating the adequacy of the prophylactic use of
   topical antibiotics or establishing correct guidelines are lacking.
   Based on related research data, American Academy of Dermatology has been
   continuously campaigning against the abuse of prophylactic antibiotics
   by the public and doctors, following the increase in the abuse of
   topical antibiotics since 2013. Therefore, we discuss the necessity of
   using topical antibiotics for the prophylaxis based on literature
   evidence. Now is the time to make efforts to prevent the increase of
   antibiotic-resistant bacteria through the correct use and by reducing
   the prescription of topical antibiotics in Korea.}},

Abstract = {{The Crisis Management Manual is essential for safe and rapid evacuation
   in the event of an accident. However, the disaster response measures in
   the current ship evacuation manual are not systematic and are simple and
   impractical. In particular, the current instructions when the ship is
   heeling call for evacuation to the highest deck, in the opposite
   direction. This advice is dangerous, however, because it is isolated to
   a specific space, due to the walking limit angle according to the angle
   of heel during evacuation. This study focuses on the MV Sewol ferry
   accident on 16 April 2014, to evaluate the risk of isolation at sea when
   evacuating to the highest deck opposite in the direction of heeling when
   the ship was sinking. According to the initial angle of heel and various
   angular velocities, hazard maps were created for each safety factor to
   predict the risks for each situation, by performing a comprehensive
   evaluation of the safe and dangerous situations when evacuating to the
   highest deck. The problems and limitations of the current evacuation
   manuals and systems were identified, and the necessity of a new

Abstract = {{This study aims to investigate the relationship between company
   reputation and the implied cost of capital in Korean companies from 2003
   to 2016, based on research by Cao et al. (2015). In addition, we would
   like to examine the effect of tax avoidance. Company reputation
   increases corporate sustainability and enables sustainable management.
   In this study, Brandstock Top Index (BSTI), which represents Korea's top
   100 brands, was used as an interest variable representing company
   reputation. To examine the relationship between company reputation and
   implied cost of capital, the multiple linear regression analysis was
   conducted using various measures of implied cost of capital as a
   dependent variable. As a result of empirical analysis, company
   reputation and implied cost of capital showed a significant negative
   relationship. The higher the company's reputation, the less information
   asymmetry in the stock market, indicating that the implied cost of
   capital decreases. A significant negative relationship between company
   reputation and implied cost of capital was not found in a group that was
   aggressive in tax avoidance. The contributions of this study are as
   follows. First, we presented the empirical result that company
   reputation and implied cost of capital were negatively related in Korea.
   It showed empirically the importance of company reputation in the Korean
   stock market. Second, in addition to the relationship between company
   reputation and implied cost of capital, prior research was expanded
   considering tax avoidance.}},

   Both targets exhibited positrons with quasi-monoenergetic energy peaks
   while targets with concave curvature also showed increased number of
   positrons at the detector. The data is consistent with hybrid-PIC
   simulations confirming that the time-varying electric fields driven by
   electrons escaping from the target significantly change the trajectories
   of positrons. These simulations show a small radius of curvature on the
   rear side increases the relative focusing effect and the positrons to

Title = {{The Trend and Prospect of Medical Sociology: Its Concepts and the
   Interface with Medical History}},
Journal = {{KOREAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL HISTORY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{843-902}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Medical sociology has a long history, and it has been institutionalized
   and developed since the 1940s. This paper is about the history, trends,
   and prospects of medical sociology from the perspective of concepts as
   well as its interface with medical humanities. Sociology is a discipline
   that conceptualizes and theorizes social phenomena on the basis of
   collected data to best understand them. For this reason, we think that
   one of the best ways to understand medical sociology is to track the
   changes and developments in the concept and theory of medical sociology
   over time. Moreover, the development of concepts and theories does not
   occur only within the discussion of experts but also actively in
   interactions with the institutional position of medical sociology,
   medical knowledge and institutions and society.
   By reflecting on the changes in the theory and concept of medical
   sociology over the past 70 years from the 1950s to the present, we were
   able to understand the changes in research interests and research
   subject of medical sociology. Medical sociology has developed in
   response to the needs of the medical community and society. On the one
   hand, it developed a diverse understanding of healthcare, one of the key
   elements of the structure and culture of modern society, and on the
   other hand, it developed an understanding of how each individual
   experiences medical care as a dominant power. Since the 1990s, these
   seemingly conflicting two areas integrated into one through research
   subjects such as the growth of the general population and the health and
   social movement. Furthermore, the emergence of biotechnology, which
   began to develop in earnest beginning in the 1980s, presented a
   challenge for medical sociology.
   If the role of Parsons in the 1950s was to reflect the American medical
   system based on bacteriology and therapeutic drugs, after the 1960s,
   chronic disease became an important health problem due to changes in
   American society, and the experiences of patients suffering from chronic
   diseases became an important research subject. However, the rapid
   development of biotechnology from the 1980s was powerful enough to
   change the way we perceive our bodies. Our society has regarded our body
   as a sum of cells and a combination of various organs and body parts
   since the birth of modern medicine, but with the development of
   biotechnology, including genetics, we began to recognize our body as an
   expression of information contained in genes. The capitalist force
   driving biotechnology has degraded our bodies to the extent of our
   resources for the accumulation of genomic information.
   Finally, the concepts and theories developed by medical sociology can
   also be applied to understand the trends of medical history in the
   Korean Journal of Medical History provided that medical sociology and
   the medical history were embedded in the particular Korean historical
   context. Therefore, we hope these two medical disciplines cooperate
   further on the medical issues in Korea.}},

Abstract = {{A ternary composite of poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(caprolactone)
   (PCL), and carbon black (CB) shows the PCL-induced CB self-aggregation
   and percolation formation when the amount of the PCL phase as the
   secondary phase is as small as the amount of CB. Furthermore, when the
   drop size of the PCL phase becomes smaller, the ternary composite forms
   a percolation of high order structure, resulting in a remarkable
   enhancement of the electrical conductivity (similar to 4 x 10(-2) S/m
   with 4 wt.\% CB). To further control the percolation structure, the
   composite fabrication is controlled by splitting a typical single-step
   mixing process into two steps, focusing on the dispersion of the
   secondary PCL phase and the CB particles separately. Under the
   single-step mixing protocol, the ternary composite shows a structure
   with greater CB aggregation in the form of a high aspect ratio and large
   aggregates (aggregate perimeter similar to aggregate size 0.7).
   Meanwhile, the two-step mixing process causes the CB aggregates to
   expand and create a higher structure (aggregate perimeter similar to
   aggregate size 0.8). The reduced size of the secondary phase under a
   mixing condition with high shear force prior to the addition of CB
   provides a larger interfacial area for CB to diffuse into the PCL phase
   during the subsequent mixing step, resulting in a further expansion of
   CB aggregation throughout the composite. The particle percolation of
   such a high order structure is attributed to high storage modulus (G `),
   high Young's modulus, high dielectric loss (epsilon `'), and
   negative-positive switching of dielectric constant at high frequency (of
   103 Hz) of composite.}},

Abstract = {{To prevent the spread of HIV-1, a vaccine should elicit antibodies that
   block viral entry for all cell types. Recently, we have developed a
   virus capture assay to quantitatively examine early time points of
   infection. Here we present data on the ability of bNAbs to inhibit
   capture (1 h) or replication (48 h) of purified primary acute or chronic
   HIV or infectious molecular clones (IMCs) in human peripheral blood
   mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as quantified by qRT-PCR. Although bNAbs
   significantly inhibited HIV-1 replication in PBMCs in a virus subtype
   and in a PBMC-donor specific manner, they did not inhibit virus capture
   of primary viruses. In contrast, IMC capture and replication in PBMCs
   and purified CD4(+) T cells were significantly inhibited by bNAbs, thus
   indicating that unlike IMCs, primary HIV-1 may initially bind to other
   cell surface molecules, which leads to virus capture even in the
   presence of bNAbs. Our results demonstrate that the initial interactions
   and some aspects of infectivity of primary HIV-1 and IMCs are inherently
   different, which underscores the importance of studying virus
   transmission using primary viruses in in vitro studies, an issue that
   could impact HIV-1 vaccine design strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To provide practical guidelines for Mobius3D commissioning
   based on experiences of commissioning/clinical implementation of
   Mobius3D and MobiusFX as patient-specific quality assurance tools on
   multiple linear accelerators.
   Methods: The vendor-suggested Mobius3D commissioning procedures,
   including beam model adjustment and dosimetric leaf gap (DLG)
   optimization, were performed for 6 MV X-ray beams of six Elekta linear
   accelerators. For the beam model adjustment, beam data, such as the
   percentage depth dose, off-axis ratio (OAR), and output factor (OF),
   were measured using a water phantom and compared to the vendor-provided
   reference values. DLG optimization was performed to determine an optimal
   DLG correction factor to minimize the mean difference between
   Mobius3D-calculated and measured doses for multiple volumetric modulated
   arc therapy (VMAT) plans. Small-field VMAT plans, in which Mobius3D has
   dose calculate uncertainties, were initially included in the DLG
   optimization, but excluded later.
   Results: The measured beam data were consistent across the six linear
   accelerators. Relatively large differences between the reference and
   measured values were observed for the OAR at large off-axis distances
   (>5 cm) and for the OF for small fields (<3 x 3 cm(2)). The optimal DLG
   correction factor was 0.6 +/- 0.3 (range: 0.3-1.0) with small-field
   plans and 0.2 +/- 0.2 (0.0-0.5) without them.
   Conclusions: A reasonable agreement was found between the
   vendor-provided reference and measured beam models. DLG optimization
   results were dependent on the selection of the VMAT plans, requiring
   careful attention to the known dose calculation uncertainties of
   Mobius3D when determining a DLG correction factor.}},

Abstract = {{There are several types of absolute constructions (acs) in English.
   Among these, this article investigates the so-called what-with ac, which
   has not received much attention in the study of English grammar. This

   synchronic as well as a diachronic perspective, using much more
   representative and robust corpora than previous studies. Based on corpus
   data drawn from historical corpora such as COHA (Corpus of Historical
   American English, 400 million words), the article addresses questions
   about changes in the construction's syntactic, semantic and pragmatic
   properties. In addition, the article provides a Construction Grammar
   perspective, which supports previous research in arguing that the
   construction is undergoing the processes of grammatical

Journal = {{MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The flexible nature of organic thermoelectrics greatly extends the scope
   of applications of thermoelectric energy conversion. However, their
   relatively low electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient compared
   to those inorganic thermoelectrics limit the output current of
   thermoelectrics to having a low power factor. In this work, we
   fabricated poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate
   (PEDOT:PSS) composites by incorporating a carbon nanotube (CNT) sheet as
   a high-performance thermoelectric filler. The electrical conductivity
   and Seebeck coefficient of pure PEDOT:PSS and the composite films were
   measured and the corresponding power factors of the films were compared.
   Compared to the electrical conductivity of 0.74 S/cm and the Seebeck
   coefficient of 7.0 mu V/K noted for PEDOT:PSS films, both thermoelectric
   properties were remarkably enhanced for the PEDOT:PSS/CNT sheet
   composites, at 170 S/cm and 42.5 mu V/K, respectively. In terms of the
   power factor, the increase was almost 4 times higher, from 3.53 nW/m.K-2
   to 30.54 mu W/m.K-2, demonstrating a greatly improved ability to
   generate electrical energy for a thermoelectric device.}},

Title = {{Kahweol Ameliorates Cisplatin-Induced Acute Kidney Injury through
   Pleiotropic Effects in Mice}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICINES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Cisplatin is an effective chemotherapeutic agent, but its clinical use
   is frequently limited by its nephrotoxicity. The pathogenesis of
   cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) remains incompletely
   understood, but oxidative stress, tubular cell death, and inflammation
   are considered important contributors to cisplatin-induced renal injury.
   Kahweol is a natural diterpene extracted from coffee beans and has been
   shown to possess anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties.
   However, its role in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity remains
   undetermined. Therefore, we investigated whether kahweol exerts a
   protective effect against cisplatin-induced renal injury. Additionally,
   its mechanisms were also examined. Administration of kahweol attenuated
   renal dysfunction and histopathological damage together with inhibition
   of oxidative stress in cisplatin-injected mice. Increased expression of
   nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 4 and decreased
   expression of manganese superoxide dismutase and catalase after
   cisplatin treatment were significantly reversed by kahweol. Moreover,
   kahweol inhibited cisplatin-induced apoptosis and necroptosis in the
   kidneys. Finally, kahweol reduced inflammatory cytokine production and
   immune cell accumulation together with suppression of nuclear factor
   kappa-B pathway and downregulation of vascular adhesion molecules.
   Together, these results suggest that kahweol ameliorates
   cisplatin-induced renal injury via its pleiotropic effects and might be
   a potential preventive option against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: NASA has been making efforts to assess the carbon dioxide
   (CO2) washout capability of spacesuits using a standard CO2 sampling
   protocol.This study established the methodology for determining the
   partial pressure of inspired CO2 (PICO2) in a pressurized spacesuit. We
   applied the methodology to characterize PICO2 for the extravehicular
   mobility unit (EMU).
   METHODS: We suggested an automated and mathematical algorithm to find
   the end-tidal CO2 and the end of inspiration. We provided objective and
   standardized guidelines to identify acceptable breath traces, which are
   essential to accurate and reproducible calculation of the in-suit
   inhaled and exhaled partial pressure of CO2 (PCO2). The mouth
   guard-based method for measurement of inhaled and exhaled dry-gas PCO2
   was described. We, calculated all individual concentrations of PICO2
   inhaled by 19 healthy subjects classified into 3 fitness groups. The
   transcutaneous PCO2 was monitored as a secondary measure to validate
   washout performance.
   RESULTS: Mean and standard deviation values for the data collection
   performance and the CO2 metrics were presented (e.g., minimum time
   weighted average PCO2 at suited workloads of resting, 1000, 2000, and
   3000 (BTU.h(-1)) were 4.75 +/- 1.03, 8.09 +/- 1.39, 11.39 +/- 1.26, and
   14.36 +/- 1.29 (mmHg.s(-1)) All CO2 metrics had a statistically
   significant association and all positive slopes with increasing
   metabolic rate. No significant differences in CO2 metrics were found
   between the three fitness groups.
   DISCUSSION: A standardized and automated methodology to calculate PICO2
   exposure level is presented and applied to characterize CO2 washout in
   the EMU. The EMU has been operated successfully in over 400
   extravehicular activities (EVAs) and is considered to provide acceptable
   CO2 washout performance. Results provide a basis for establishing
   verifiable PCO2 requirements for current and future EVA spacesuits.}},

Abstract = {{The uncertainty of electric machines and drives is inherent in its
   manufacturing and assembly. Robust design optimization finds the design
   under these uncertainties that results in a minimal variance while
   satisfying all design constraints. To obtain an accurate result, the
   statistical model is significantly important. Moreover, several
   uncertainties from a single source can be involved owing to multiple
   components in the electrical machines and drives. However, this can
   drastically increase the numerical cost for the conventional robust
   design optimization technique. In this work an uncertainty
   characterization method is developed by using a percentile bootstrap
   interval to consider the experimental results from few prototypes and a
   kriging surrogate model to reduce the computational cost. Then the
   sample-based robust design optimization is applied to the
   surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor. It is seen that the
   developed methods can efficiently work to minimize both the mean and
   variance of the cogging torque while satisfying other design
   constraints.}},

Title = {{Dynamic drags acting on moving defects in discrete dispersive media:
   From dislocation to low-angle grain boundary}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{145}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Although continuum theory has been widely used to describe the
   long-range elastic behavior of dislocations, it is limited in its
   ability to describe mechanical behaviors that occur near dislocation
   cores. This limit of the continuum theory mainly stems from the discrete
   nature of the core region, which induces a drag force on the dislocation
   core during glide. Depending on external conditions, different drag
   mechanisms are activated that govern the dynamics of dislocations in
   their own way. This is revealed by the resultant speed of the
   dislocation. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework that
   generally describes the dynamic drag on dislocations and, as a result,
   derive a phenomenological cubic constitutive equation. Furthermore,
   given that a lowangle grain boundary (LAGB) can be regarded as an array
   of dislocations, we extend the model to describe the mobility law of
   LAGBs as a function of misorientation angle. As a result, we prove that
   both dislocations and LAGBs follow the developed constitutive equation
   with the same mathematical form despite their different governing drag
   sources. The suggested model is also supported by molecular dynamics
   simulations. Therefore, this work has significance for a fundamental
   understanding of the dynamic drag acting on defects and facilitates a
   general description of various drag mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{A study on the flora of Geomun Oreum, designated as a UNESCO World
   Natural Heritage Site, was surveyed in 2019. Vascular plants in this
   area revealed 310 taxa belonging to 90 families, 210 genera, 279
   species, one subspecies, 27 varieties, and three formas. The Geomun
   Oreum showed low mean annual temperature, but it was confirmed that the
   emergence of warm-temperate plant species and evergreen broad-leaved
   forests was prominent. These results were interpreted to be due to a
   great deal of precipitation, many frost-free days, and the difference
   between the highest and lowest temperatures depending on the
   geographical characteristics of Geomun Oreum. Geomun Oreum is evaluated
   as a relatively natural habitat given the limited access of visitors and
   management, but it was confirmed that Sedum tosaense, a critically
   endangered species of the rare plants designated by the International
   Union for Conservation of Nature, requires conservation plans in the

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{279}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{In support of successful biomass production of green microalga Ettlia
   sp. through attached cultivation, estimation of footprint biomass
   productivity and optimization of the system was evaluated through
   comprehensive simulation of solar irradiation. Both temporal and spatial
   variation of solar irradiation and biomass productivity on the surface
   of the microalgae-attached panel (MAP) with every combination of design
   factors (tilt angle, facing direction, height, and distance of the MAP)
   were closely studied. While an increase in the height to the distance
   ratio (HDR) increased footprint biomass productivity, fixing the
   distances at their minimum made steeper tilt angle more favorable for
   footprint biomass productivity by having a smaller minimum distance.
   Footprint biomass productivity over the height revealed another
   important design index, a critical height, where footprint biomass
   productivity becomes maximum and saturated. Ultimately, three optimum
   conditions were identified based on economic circumstances: (1)
   double-side vertically standing MAP facing east/west, (2) 1 m high
   single side MAP facing south with seasonal optimum angles, and (3) over
   2.5 m high single-side MAP facing west with seasonal optimum angles.
   Corresponding estimated yearly average footprint biomass productivities
   were 22, 11, and 11.5 g/m(2)/day at the height of 3 m, 1 m, and 3 m,

Abstract = {{This paper examines the longitudinal changes of Korean college students

   instrumentality, integrativeness, demotivation, and the perceived
   confidence in speaking English. Repeated-measures t-test/ANOVA indicated
   that students' initial motivation was maintained until the end of the
   academic year. Their confidence in speaking English increased in a
   statistically significant manner. However, student demotivation also
   increased despite the fact that it remained at a relatively low level.
   These findings portrayed that the online-offline blended English
   learning was an effective instructional medium for EFL students in their

Abstract = {{A transparent energy storage device is an essential component for
   transparent electronics. The increasing demand for high-power devices
   stimulates the development of transparent supercapacitors with high
   power density. A transparent electrode for such supercapacitors can be
   assembled via the electrophoretic deposition of an active material
   powder with a binder onto a transparent substrate. The properties of the
   binder critically influence the electrochemical behavior and performance
   of the resulting electrode. Ethyl cellulose (EC) is known as an
   eco-friendly, transparent, flexible, and inexpensive material. Here, we
   fabricated an electrode film with EC binder via electrophoretic
   deposition on an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate instead of using the
   conventional polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) binder. The assembled
   electrodes with EC and PTFE were compared to investigate the feasibility
   of EC as a binder from different perspectives, including homogeneity,
   wettability, electrochemical behavior, and mechanical stability. The EC
   enabled the formation of a homogeneous film composed of smaller
   particles and with a higher specific capacitance compared with films
   prepared with PTFE. The annealing improved the adhesion strength of the
   EC because of its glass transition; however, its hydrophobic nature
   limited utilization of the active material for charge storage.
   Subsequent electrochemical activation improved the wettability of the
   electrode, resulting in an increased capacitance of 60 F g(-1).
   Furthermore, even with the lower wettability of EC compared with that of
   PTFE, better rate performance was possible with the EC electrode. The
   increased mechanical stability after the annealing process ensured an
   excellent cycle life of 95 \% capacitance retention for 15,000 cycles.

Abstract = {{Faint z similar to 5 quasars with M-1450 similar to -23 mag are known to
   be potentially important contributors to the ultraviolet ionizing
   background in the postreionization era. However, their number density
   has not been well determined, making it difficult to assess their role
   in the early ionization of the intergalactic medium (IGM). In this work,
   we present the updated results of our z similar to 5 quasar survey using
   the Infrared Medium-deep Survey (IMS), a near-infrared imaging survey
   covering an area of 85 deg(2). From our spectroscopic observations with
   the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph on the Gemini-South 8 m telescope,
   we discovered eight new quasars at z similar to 5 with -26.1 <= M-1450
   <= -23.3. Combining our IMS faint quasars (M-1450 > -27 mag) with the
   brighter Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasars (M-1450 < -27 mag), we derive
   the z similar to 5 quasar luminosity function (QLF) without any fixed
   parameters down to the magnitude limit of M-1450{*} = -23 mag. We find
   that the faint-end slope of the QLF is very flat (alpha =
   -1.2+(1.4)(-0.6)),), with a characteristic luminosity of M-1450{*} =
   -25.8(-1.1)(+1.4) mag. The number denisty of z similar to 5 quasars from
   the QLF gives an ionizing emissivity at 912 angstrom of epsilon(912) =
   (3.7-7.1) x 10(23) erg s(-1) Hz(-1) Mpc(-3) and an ionizing photon
   density o (n)over dot(ion) = (3.0 - 5.7) x 10(49) Mpc(-3) s(-1). These
   results imply that quasars are responsible for only 10\%-20\% (up to
   50\% even in the extreme case) of the photons required to completely
   ionize the IGM at z similar to 5, disfavoring the idea that quasars
   alone could have ionized the IGM at z similar to 5.}},

Abstract = {{In children with concomitant food allergy and atopic dermatitis (AD),
   uncovering the causative food allergen is more arduous. We evaluated the
   basophil activation test (BAT) for its diagnostic value in children,
   including those with AD, for milk or egg allergy. We simultaneously
   measured serum-specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE) levels and performed
   BATs for cow's milk and egg white. We compared their overall diagnostic
   performance using the area under the receiver operating characteristic
   curve (AUC) with the Delong method and compared them in children with
   AD. Analyses were completed for 75 children for milk allergy and for 85
   children for egg allergy. The sIgE and percentage of basophils with the
   expression of CD63 were correlated for both milk (r = 0.384, p < 0.001)
   and egg (r = 0.557, p < 0.001). The AUC of sIgE (0.701) for milk allergy
   was significantly increased when combined with the BAT (0.805; p =
   0.029). In children with AD, the AUC of the BAT (0.924) for milk allergy
   was significantly larger than that of sIgE (0.701; p = 0.017). The BAT
   is a potentially useful diagnostic tool for milk allergy in children
   when combined with sIgE. Moreover, it may be a surrogate marker for milk
   allergy in children with AD.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the relationship between business cycle
   synchronization and trade integration in the Latin American region.
   Using data for 17 Latin American countries and the United States (US)
   from 1980 to 2018, we document the time-series characteristics of
   business cycle synchronization and intra- and inter-regional trade in
   the region and empirically test whether trade integration contributed to
   business cycle synchronization. The data demonstrate that the business
   cycle synchronization index has been steadily increasing in the region.
   Regional trade integration increased until the financial crisis in 2008
   and decreased slightly thereafter. The results of a system generalized
   method of moments (GMM) regression indicate that bilateral trade with
   the US significantly increased business cycle synchronization in the
   region, except during the 2000s, while regional trade had no significant
   effect. These results emphasize the importance of the indirect trade
   channel, especially with the US, as a main channel of business cycle
   synchronization in Latin America.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we propose a novel statistical eye-diagram estimation
   method considering nonlinear power/ground noise induced by parallel
   simultaneous switching output (SSO) buffers. Probability density
   functions (pdfs) of output step-responses affected by the SSO are
   derived based on the occurrence probability of each SSO pattern. From
   the derived output response pdfs, main-cursor (MC) pdfs and intersymbol
   interference (ISI) pdfs are defined. Statistical output responses are
   derived based on recursive convolution between the MC-pdfs and ISI-pdfs
   affecting each other. The proposed method, for the first time, considers
   steady-state responses affected by the SSO to estimate more accurate
   statistical eye-diagrams. The proposed method is verified by comparing
   the derived statistical eye-diagrams with eye diagrams obtained using
   full transient simulation. Also, bit error rate (BER) bathtub curves
   derived using the proposed method and full transient simulation are
   compared for verification. The proposed method is compared with the
   previous study to emphasize importance of the steady-state responses.
   Finally, the proposed method is expanded to consider previous bit
   patterns, which are also affected by the SSO.}},

Abstract = {{The estimation of the mineral resources and mineral reserves is the most

   suggest the revised KS for estimation of mineral resources and reserves
   which meets on international standards and overcomes its limitation. The
   three existing standards are integrated into one unified standard as

   total 205 cases were found and the results were compared. The FS
   responses and PS results were classified as benign, borderline and

   as 94\% (p<0.001).
   Conclusion: In our study we showed that even if all of the FS responses
   didn't match with its PS, FS has a very high rate of consistency. FS is
   a way to help the surgeon during the operation. However, it must not be
   forgotten that this method has its own pitfalls and limitations.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR GENETICS AND METABOLISM REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{25}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: The gangliosidoses are rare inherited diseases that result
   in pathologic accumulation of gangliosides in the central nervous system
   and other tissues, leading to severe and progressive neurological
   impairment and early death in the childhood forms. No treatments are
   currently approved for the gangliosidoses, and development of treatments
   is impaired by limited understanding of the natural history of these
   diseases.
   Objective: The objective of this study is to improve understanding of
   the juvenile gangliosidoses phenotypes and the late-infantile phenotypic
   subtype.
   Methods: Through a prospective natural history study of subjects with
   juvenile GM1- and GM2-gangliosidosis, a timeline of clinical changes was
   developed for the classic juvenile phenotypes and the late-infantile
   phenotypes and results of serial neurodevelopmental testing was
   analyzed.
   Results: Several candidate `outcome measures' were identified: changes
   in ambulation and verbalization skills, the communication domain from
   neurodevelopmental testing and the caregiver-reported socialization
   domain.
   Conclusions: The most common symptoms leading caregivers to seek a
   genetic diagnosis were changes in ambulation and verbalization.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To analyze the results of microsurgery for Spetzler-Martin
   (SM) grade I-III AVMs and evaluate the correlation of the Lawton-Young
   (LY) supplementary grade, supplemented Spetzler-Martin
   (SM-Supp/combined) score with the functional outcome.
   METHODS: A total of 42 patients with SM grade I-III AVMs who had
   undergone surgery at our institute during a 3-year period (June 2013 to
   May 2016) were included in the present study.
   RESULTS: All 42 patients had undergone primary surgery without previous
   embolization. Three patients (7.1\%) had died due to surgical site
   hematoma in the postoperative period. One patient was lost to follow-up.
   The mean followup period for the remaining patients was 27 +/- 14 months
   (range, 12-62 months). At the final follow-up examination of >= 12
   months (FFU), 92.7\% of the patients had a good outcome (modified Rankin
   scale {[}mRS] score <= 1) with an improved or unchanged mRS score in
   87.8\%. An AVM size >3 cm, diffuse AVM, SM grade III, and SM-Supp score
   >5 were associated with worsened mRS score at discharge and FFU. Higher
   LY grade (IV and V), eloquent MM location, deep venous drainage, age >40
   years, and unruptured presentation were not associated with worsened mRS
   score at both discharge and FFU. Of the 20 ARUBA-eligible patients, 19
   (95\%) had good outcomes. Postoperative angiograms for 39 patients
   revealed complete excision of the AVM in 37 (94.9\%) and a residual AVM
   in 2 (5.1\%).
   CONCLUSIONS: High cure rates and excellent clinical outcomes can be
   expected with microsurgery for most patients with SM grade I-Ill AVMs.
   An AVM size >3 cm, diffuse AVM nidus, SM grade III, and SM-Supp score >5
   are associated with postoperative worsening of functional scores in
   patients with SM grade I-III AVMs.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{136}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the dynamic fragmentation of geological materials is
   important to many fields, but is particularly significant for mining.
   Here, a series of expanding ring experiments are reported, investigating
   the dynamic fragmentation of a typical granite from a mining
   environment. In addition to in-situ diagnostics which measure
   time-resolved loading characteristics, fragments were soft-captured and
   analysed. Measured fragment size distributions agree well with existing
   theory, but show unexpected strain rate variation. Specifically, the
   reduction in fragment size with rate is shown to be limited as the
   fragments neared the material grain size, a phenomenon not previously
   observed. Inter-granular failure was confirmed by fractographic analysis
   of the recovered material. The phenomenon was hypothesised to be caused
   by the fragmentation being dominated by an intergranular fracture
   mechanism which becomes inhibited when fragments near the grain size.
   More generally, the approach provides a new experimental route through
   which the fragmentation of geological materials can be understood.}},

Journal = {{LEUKEMIA RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{99}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) is an infectious
   agent that can increase morbidity and mortality, especially in patients
   with neutropenia in haematology departments. We analysed VRE infections
   and mortality rates among VRE colonized patients with acute leukaemia,
   defined predisposing risk factors for infection and mortality, and
   investigated the influence of daptomycin or linezolid treatment on
   mortality.
   Patients-Methods: We included 200 VRE colonized adult acute leukaemia
   patients with febrile neutropenia between January 2010 and January 2016.
   Data were collected from electronic files.
   Results: There were 179 patients in the colonized group, and 21 patients
   in the infected group. Enterococcus faecium (van A) was isolated from
   all patients. The infection rate was 10.5 \%, and the types of
   infections noted were as follows: bloodstream (n = 14; 66.7 \%), skin
   and soft tissue (n = 3; 14.3 \%), urinary (n = 2; 9.5 \%), and others
   (9.5 \%). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, exposure to
   invasive procedures, coinfection status, and 15 days of VRE positivity
   were independent risk factors for VRE infections. In hospital mortality
   rates were 57.1 \% in the infected group, and 9.5 \% in the colonized
   group (p < 0.001). Older age, female gender, absolute neutropenia, and
   coinfection status were statistically significant predictor of survival.
   Conclusion: Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus infections are associated
   with high morbidity and mortality in haematology patients with
   neutropenia. Clinicians should be aware of predisposing risk factors for
   VRE infection to avoid unfavourable outcomes. We believe that larger
   studies are necessary regarding the influence of treatment with
   daptomycin and linezolid.}},

Abstract = {{In coastal floodplains, high river flows and high coastal water levels
   can result in extensive flooding. Twenty-first century climate change is
   expected to alter these flood mechanisms. In this study, a coastal city
   of Cork, Ireland is used as a case study to investigate changes in flood
   mechanisms, dynamics and extents due to climate change. A hydrodynamic
   flood model MSN\_Flood was used to compute potential future inundation
   patterns for a range of climate scenarios based on estimates of current,
   medium-range and high-end projections of extreme river flows and sea
   levels. Results illustrate that the flood mechanism is critical in
   controlling patterns and extent of inundation. Peak river discharges are
   the primary contributor to extreme flood events under the current
   climate scenario, however, high-end climate change could result in
   coastal inundation of comparable magnitude. The most extreme flood
   events affect the entire city centre - occurring as a result of a
   combination of fluvial and coastal drivers. The interaction of extreme
   fluvial discharges and coastal water levels is complex and characterised
   through comparison of multiple scenarios. This research establishes a
   best practice methodology for assessment of urban coastal-fluvial flood
   risk under a changing climate and can be used to determine
   climate-resilient flood management measures.}},

   between the two groups (p = 0.025). The majority of these complications
   (50\%) was constituted by mechanical failure associated with inflatable
   PPs. When patients were further segregated as those with and without
   diabetes type 2 (DM) and those who had and had not undergone radical
   pelvic surgery (RPS), the comparison of complication rates across these
   subgroups did not yield any significant difference.
   Conclusions: We determined in this study that semirigid (malleable) PPs
   were associated with lower complication rates compared to the inflatable
   group, particularly with regard to mechanic failure, and that DM and
   history of RPS did not make a difference in complication rates in
   patients planned to undergo PPI.}},

Abstract = {{Agreement and case assignment can be interdependent, partially
   independent, or independent of each other (Baker \& Vinokurova 2010;
   Baker 2014, 2015). These parametric options appear to have random
   distribution across languages. This paper claims on the basis of the
   comparison of the Ugric languages (Mansi, Khanty, and Hungarian) that
   the correlation of case and agreement or the lack of it may not be
   random. A strict correlation of case and agreement is attested in
   sentence structures displaying a fusion of grammatical functions and
   discourse roles. When these roles are encoded in distinct clausal
   domains, case and agreement have separate functions and licensing
   conditions, with case marking grammatical functions, and agreement
   associated with discourse roles. At the same time, relics of their
   former syntactic interdependence may survive in morphology, resulting in
   a partial correlation between case and agreement. It is shown that
   dependent case theory can account for the whole range of variation
   attested in the relation of case and agreement.}},

Volume = {{139}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{As the paradigm of production, use and consumption is currently shifting
   towards a circular economy, measures must be taken in the field of
   composite laminate recycling in order to prevent environmental
   pollution. In an effort to capitalise on the recyclability of
   thermoplastic composite laminates, a selection of in-house recycling and
   reuse routes are highlighted and compared in this research paper.
   Reprocessed compression moulded panels from shredded laminates
   demonstrated only 10-30\% strength of monolithic virgin materials.
   Therefore, a largely unexplored recycling method was applied by
   co-moulding shredded material as a core layer between continuous fibre
   skins. These sandwich-like panels had true upcycling potential to
   achieve monolithic laminate properties in flexural and impact loading;
   in tensile loading around 50\% performance was reached. Lastly, a
   promising reuse method was examined by reverse-thermoforming rejected
   parts. Wrinkle-free flat blanks with virgin-like properties could be
   produced for reuse purposes out of complexly shaped parts.}},

Abstract = {{Grit is defined as perseverance and long-term focus on goals. Grit may
   be helpful in surviving stroke for both survivors and caregivers. The
   purpose of this study was to investigate the level of grit among
   survivors of stroke and caregivers using health humanities to gain a
   deeper understanding of the lived experience of stroke survivors. A
   sample of convenience was used. Phase I (n = 22) utilized the Grit Scale
   survey. Phase II (n = 6) utilized phenomenological interviews. The Grit
   Scale survey data were analyzed with SPSS 25. Qualitative data were
   analyzed with the whole-parts-whole method of Giorgi, Dahlberg, Drew,
   and Nystrom. Grit scores were high for both survivors of stroke (3.77
   +/- 0.50) and caregivers (3.89 +/- 0.51). Themes emerging from the
   phenomenological interviews included: (a) gritty toughness, (b)
   challenges, (3) accomplishments, and (4) advice for health-care
   providers. Survivors of stroke and caregivers embodied high grit levels.
   Participants articulated the importance of long-term goals despite
   challenges. Understanding grit among survivors and caregivers may help
   clinicians develop best practices to better support these individuals.}},

Pages = {{119-126}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Freezing of Gait (FoG) is a motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD)
   that frequently occurs in the longterm sufferers of the disease. FoG may
   result to nursing home admission as it can lead to falls, and therefore,
   it impacts negatively on the quality of life. The focus of this study is
   the systematic evaluation of machine learning techniques in conjunction
   with varying size time windows and time/frequency domain feature sets in
   predicting a FoG event before its onset. In the experiments, the Daphnet
   FoG dataset is used to benchmark performance. This consists of
   accelerometer signals obtained from sensors mounted on the ankle, thigh
   and trunk of the PD patients. The dataset is annotated with instances of
   normal activity events, and FoG events. To predict the onset of FoG, the
   dataset is augmented with an additional class, termed `transition',
   which relates to a manually defined period prior to the occurrence of a
   FoG episode. In this research, five machine learning models are used,
   namely, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Gradient Boosting,
   Support Vector Machines using Radial Basis Functions, and Neural
   Networks. Support Vector Machines with Radial Basis kernels provided the
   best performance achieving sensitivity values of 72.34\%, 91.49\%,
   75.00\%, and specificity values of 87.36\%, 88.51\% and 93.62\%, for the
   FoG, transition and normal activity classes, respectively. (C) 2020

Title = {{Late Neolithic and Chalcolithic maritime resilience? The 4.2 ka BP event
   and its implications for environments and societies in Northwest Europe}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper deals with prehistoric communities at the end of the 3rd
   millennium BC in Northwest Europe in relation to the 4.2 ka BP climatic
   event. In particular, the question of the resilience of these
   communities to climatic change will be studied here by comparing various
   climatic records and analysing specific archaeological parameters for
   social and cultural change. These parameters include the duration and
   intensity of settlement occupation, the variability of subsistence
   activities (e.g. cereal cultivation, animal husbandry, hunting, fishing,
   and gathering) and the connectedness of communities within exchange
   networks. Rather than answering the often-asked yes/no question with
   regard to human-environment relations, our research asks what effect
   resulted from the 4.2 ka BP climatic event, and, from the perspective of
   resilience, how did communities adopt to these changes in their
   practices and cultural choices during the later 3rd millennium BC.
   In short, we maintain that climate change took place at the end of the
   3rd millennium BC, but the changes in humidity and temperature with
   their effects on vegetation were probably regionally varied across
   Northwest Europe. We also observe that the studied communities developed
   differently during the second half of the 3rd millennium BC. On the one
   hand, we identify new food storage and house building techniques in the
   Low Countries and Schleswig-Holstein and, on the other hand,
   substantiate population decrease on the Orkney Islands around 2300 BC.
   Finally, we note a development of the Bell Beaker phenomenon into an
   Early Bronze Age maritory of connected communities across the North Sea,
   in which these communities expressed their resilience to climate change.}},

Abstract = {{The Russian Red Cross Society was abolished in Soviet Russia in January
   1918, but the Soviet Red Cross was created only in 1923. Part of the
   Russian Red Cross Society (RRCS) staff was able to emigrate and continue
   its activities abroad, aimed at helping and supporting Russian
   emigration. The article investigates the role of the RRCS in emigration;
   analyzes the number of people who had received assistance, including
   medical aid; and states, in which European countries the RRCS was most
   active.
   The chapters of the International Red Cross rendered prodigious
   assistance to the Russian emigration: in particular, the American Red
   Cross financed a sanitarium for emigrants with tuberculosis, and
   provided assistance to an orphanage in Czechoslovakia. The Czechoslovak
   Red Cross, both directly and through the structures of the so-called
   Committee of Zemstvos and Towns for Assistance to Russian Citizens
   Abroad (Zemgor), participated in supporting emigration: it financed the
   stay of students in sanitariums and hospitals, and allocated funds for
   the functioning of the division of medical assistance at the Zemgor.
   Despite the fact that the Czechoslovak Red Cross was formed just in
   1919, on account of the active actions of its chairman, Alice Masaryk
   (the daughter of the Czechoslovak President), it was able to attract
   financial resources and organize assistance to people, including Russian
   emigrants.}},

Title = {{Dynamic biomass potential from agricultural land}},
Journal = {{RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{134}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The potential of biomass from agricultural land cannot be seen as a
   constant value over time, but rather as a dynamic one influenced by
   changes in many factors and characteristics. The most important include
   the amount of available agricultural land, the structure of cultivated
   crops, allocation of energy crops, the effect of a learning curve and
   the impact of climate change. Our method used for determination of
   biomass potential is based on usage of the GIS model that includes key
   parameters such as soil and climatic characteristics of farming plots
   and expected crop yields related to them, changes in arable land,
   planting area, utilization of biomass, and the influence of climate
   change. Results from modelling different scenarios for the Czech
   Republic show that allocating 20\% of arable land for energy crops
   increases biomass potential by 35\%, 30 PJ (compared with current nearly
   0\% allocation) on a time horizon 2040. If a learning curve effect for
   energy crops (impact of breeding and improved agmtechnologies on biomass
   yields) in the range of 1.5-2.5\% per year is considered, then biomass
   potential increases by 49\% (42 PJ) in total.}},

Abstract = {{Popular writers have long advanced distinctions between leadership and
   management, with different authors highlighting either their love for
   leaders or formanagers. Through three studies, we explore the
   discriminant validity, comparative value, and conditional relevance of
   leadership and management in decision-making contexts with theoretical
   and organizational implications. In study 1, we findboth similarities
   andsignificant distinctions betweentheprototype of ``leaders{''} who
   inspire, motivate, and guide, and managers who budget, hire, and
   supervise. In study 2, we confirm that leader activities are typically
   evaluated more positively than managerial activities, even in situations
   that are specifically designed to favor managerial skills. Finally, in
   study 3, we find that the seemingly unconditional love for leaders is
   tempered by slowing respondents down, thus overriding a relatively fast
   and automatic preference for leaders relative to managers. Collectively,
   our studies add empirical evidence to help nuance and ground
   long-standing academic debates and popular press claims about a topic
   with significant practical implications.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Advances in genomics and technology measuring body composition are now
   allowing sheep producers to select directly for increased lean meat
   yield (LMY) using Australian Sheep Breeding Values (ASBV). This
   experiment evaluated the impact of sire LMY ASBV on carcass composition,
   meat quality, nutrient and mineral content for lambs reared at pasture
   and finished in a feedlot. A 1\% unit increase in sire LMY ASBV resulted
   in progeny that were leaner (0.8\%) and had less fat (1.0\%) on carcass.
   There was also a 0.2\% reduction in the intramuscular fat content, a 3.2
   N increase in meat toughness determined by shear force at day 5 ageing,
   a reduction in the redness of the fresh meat and a lower iron content.
   It is concluded that Australian sheep producers will need to incorporate
   ASBVs for other aspects of meat quality when selecting sires with
   increased LMY to avoid deterioration in meat quality, nutritional
   content of lamb and fresh meat colour.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{46-56}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In climate science, climate models are one of the main tools for
   understanding phenomena. Here, we develop a framework to assess the
   fitness of a climate model for providing understanding. The framework is
   based on three dimensions: representational accuracy, representational
   depth, and graspability. We show that this framework does justice to the
   intuition that classical process-based climate models give understanding
   of phenomena. While simple climate models are characterized by a larger
   graspability, state-of-the-art models have a higher representational
   accuracy and representational depth. We then compare the
   fitness-for-providing understanding of process-based to data-driven
   models that are built with machine learning. We show that at first
   glance, data driven models seem either unnecessary or inadequate for
   understanding. However, a case study from atmospheric research
   demonstrates that this is a false dilemma. Data-driven models can be
   useful tools for understanding, specifically for phenomena for which
   scientists can argue from the coherence of the models with background
   knowledge to their representational accuracy and for which the model
   complexity can be reduced such that they are graspable to a satisfactory
   extent.}},

   against MAC Spoofing Attack}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{With the development of wireless networks and mobile devices, interest
   on indoor localization systems (ILSs) has increased. In particular,
   Wi-Fi-based ILSs are widely used because of the good prediction accuracy
   without additional hardware. However, as the prediction accuracy
   decreases in environments with natural noise, some studies were
   conducted to remove it. So far, two representative methods, i.e., the
   filtering-based method and deep learning-based method, have shown a
   significant effect in removing natural noise. However, the prediction
   accuracy of these methods severely decreased under artificial noise
   caused by adversaries. In this paper, we introduce a new media access
   control (MAC) spoofing attack scenario injecting artificial noise, where
   the prediction accuracy of Wi-Fi-based indoor localization system
   significantly decreases. We also propose a new deep learning-based
   indoor localization method using random forest(RF)-filter to provide the
   good prediction accuracy under the new MAC spoofing attack scenario.
   From the experimental results, we show that the proposed indoor
   localization method provides much higher prediction accuracy than the
   previous methods in environments with artificial noise.}},

Journal = {{BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-PROTEINS AND PROTEOMICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{1868}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The human I kappa B Kinase (IKK) is a multisubunit protein complex of
   two kinases and one scaffolding subunit that controls induction of
   transcription factor NF-kappa B activity. IKK behaves as an entity of
   aberrantly high apparent molecular weight in solution. Recent X-ray
   crystallographic and cryo-electron microscopy structures of individual
   catalytic subunits (IKK1/IKK alpha and IKK2/IKK beta) reveal that they
   are both stably folded dimeric proteins that engage in extensive
   homo-oligomerization through unique surfaces that are required for
   activation of their respective catalytic activities. The NEMO/IKK gamma
   subunit is a predominantly coiled coil protein that is required for
   activation of IKK through the canonical NF-kappa B signaling pathway.
   Here we report size-exclusion chromatography, multi-angle light
   scattering, analytical centrifugation, and thermal denaturation analyses
   of full-length human recombinant NEMO as well as deletion and
   disease-linked variants. We observe that NEMO is predominantly a dimer
   in solution, although by virtue of its modular coiled coil regions NEMO
   exhibits complicated solution dynamics involving portions that are
   mutually antagonistic toward homodimerization. This behavior causes NEMO
   to behave as a significantly larger sized particle in solution. Analyses
   of NEMO in complex with IKK2 indicate that NEMO preserves this
   structurally dynamic character within the multisubuit complex and
   provides the complex-bound IKK2 further propensity toward
   homo-oligomerization. These observations provide critical information on
   the structural plasticity of NEMO subunit dimers which helps clarify its
   role in diseases and in IKK regulation through oligomerization-dependent
   phosphorylation of catalytic IKK2 subunit dimers.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Increased frequencies of physiological episodes have been a
   significant concern for Naval Aviation for the last several years.These
   include several aircraft platforms, but no previously documented E-2D
   Hawkeye events.This report documents an episode in an E-2D, with
   multiple aircrew affected at the same time.
   CASE REPORT: While deployed aboard a U.S. aircraft carrier, five E-2D
   Hawkeyes aircrew were simultaneously exposed to the same
   over-pressurization during a routine sortie. Out of the five aircrew,
   four immediately reported hypoxic-like neurocognitive symptoms of
   ``mental slowing{''}, difficulty concentrating, and headache.They were
   evaluated and treated using standard protocol according to the
   Physiologic Event Clinical Practice Guidelines set by the Naval Safety
   Center. All aircrew were treated with 100\% ground level oxygen with
   resolution of symptoms.
   DISCUSSION: Although rare, physiological events may occur in multi
   passenger platforms such as the E-2D Hawkeye. Utilizing and strictly
   adhering to standard clinical practice guidelines provided an efficient
   process of evaluation by different flight surgeons concurrently that
   avoided a possible delay in treatment. After, eliminating other
   potential etiology for the crew's symptoms, a pressure-related mechanism
   of injury appears to be the most probable cause.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal nutrition is necessary for the growth of the fetus, and
   excessive intake of nutrients interferes with brain development in
   offspring. In the current study, the effect of treadmill running during
   pregnancy in obese maternal rats on spatial learning memory and spatial
   working memory in rat pups was investigated. Phosphorylation of
   phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt), and
   extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) was also
   identified in rat pups. Female rats were divided into the normal diet
   group and the high-fat diet group for 7 weeks, including pregnancy and
   lactation. Maternal treadmill running was performed for 4 weeks. The
   born rat pups were classified into a control group, a treadmill exercise
   group, a high-fat diet group, a high-fat diet and treadmill exercise
   group according to the status of maternal rats. Radial 8-arm maze task
   for spatial learning memory and Morris water maze task for spatial
   working memory were done. Western blot analysis was conducted to
   determine the expressions of PI3K, Akt, ERK1/2. In the current results,
   maternal treadmill running during pregnancy improved spatial learning
   memory and spatial working memory in rat pups born to obese maternal
   rats. This improving effect of memory was due to the enhanced
   phosphorylation of PI3K, Akt, and ERK1/2 by treadmill running.}},

Title = {{Utilization of light energy in phototrophic Gemmatimonadetes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY B-BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{213}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Gemmatimonas phototrophica is, so far, the only described phototrophic
   species of the bacterial phylum Gemmatimonadetes. Its cells contain a
   unique type of photosynthetic complex with the reaction center
   surrounded by a double ring antenna, however they can also grow in the
   dark using organic carbon substrates. Its photosynthesis genes were
   received via horizontal gene transfer from Proteobacteria. This raises
   two questions; how the horizontally transferred photosynthesis apparatus
   has integrated into the cellular machinery, and how much light-derived
   energy actually contributes to the cellular metabolism? To address these
   points, the photosynthetic reactions were studied on several levels,
   from photophysics of the reaction center to cellular growth. Flash
   photolysis measurements and bacteriochlorophyll fluorescence kinetic
   measurements documented the presence of fully functional type-2 reaction
   centers with a large light harvesting antenna. When illuminated, the
   bacterial cells reduced their respiration rate by 58 +/- 5\%, revealing
   that oxidative phosphorylation was replaced by photophosphorylation.
   Moreover, illumination also more than doubled the assimilation rates of
   glucose, a sugar that is mostly used for respiration. Finally, light
   increased the growth rates of Gemmatimonas phototrophica colonies on
   agar plates. All the presented data provide evidence that photosynthetic
   complexes are fully integrated into cellular metabolism of Gemmatimonas
   phototrophica, and are able to provide a substantial amount of energy
   for its metabolism and growth.}},

   silica by Carbothermic Reduction and Carburization at low temperature}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{256}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{This work was focused primarily on the investigation of the parameters
   effecting the formation of beta-SiC and their crystallite diameter.
   Previous works revealed that the preparation of silica used as a
   precursor was the key factor on the resulting particle features.
   Therefore, the work aimed to achieve obtaining ultrafine silica
   precursor with superfine crystallites at relatively low temperatures. In
   the result, a clear difference was observed between the finally obtained
   SiC powders in terms of conversion and particle morphology according to
   the preparation process. The use of a modified high energy ball milling
   system resulted in a considerable reduction in the size of the starting
   particle's diameter (>100 nm). The FTIR transmission spectra of the
   yielded nanowires confirmed the SiC composition with the peak near 950
   cm-1, which represents the LO stretching Si-C bond. The precursor
   preparation process improved the efficiency of Carbothermic Reduction
   and Carburization process used in the synthesis of SiC nanowires. The
   XRD findings indicated that all the precursors consisted of only
   amorphous silica, and the modified high energy ball milling system
   thermodynamically supported the crystal to amorphous conversion. The SEM
   micrographs revealed that the SiC nanowires had diameters of 50-100 nm
   with hundreds of microns in length. The SiC nanowire composed of
   ultrafine crystalline cubic SiC in beta form. As a result, the silica
   conversion to silicon carbide was successfully completed at a faster
   reduction rate and relative lower temperature (1475 degrees C for 4 h).}},

Abstract = {{Background Latest achievement technologies allow engineers to develop
   medical systems that medical doctors in the health care system could not
   imagine years ago. The development of signal theory, intelligent
   systems, biophysics and extensive collaboration between science and
   technology researchers and medical professionals, open up the potential
   for preventive, real-time monitoring of patients. With the recent
   developments of new methods in medicine, it is also possible to predict
   the trends of the disease development as well the systemic support in
   diagnose setting. Within the framework of the needs to track the patient
   health parameters in the hospital environment or in the case of road
   accidents, the researchers had to integrate the knowledge and
   experiences of medical specialists in emergency medicine who have
   participated in the development of a mobile wireless monitoring system
   designed for real-time monitoring of victim vital parameters. Emergency
   medicine responders are first point of care for trauma victim providing
   prehospital care, including triage and treatment at the scene of
   incident and transport from the scene to the hospital. Continuous
   monitoring of life functions allows immediate detection of a
   deterioration in health status and helps out in carrying out principle
   of continuous e-triage. In this study, a mobile wireless monitoring
   system for measuring and recording the vital parameters of the patient
   was presented and evaluated. Based on the measured values, the system is
   able to make triage and assign treatment priority for the patient. The
   system also provides the opportunity to take a picture of the injury,
   mark the injured body parts, calculate Glasgow Coma Score, or
   insert/record the medication given to the patient. Evaluation of the
   system was made using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). In
   particular we measured: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use,
   attitude, intention to use, patient status and environmental status.
   Methods A functional prototype of a developed wireless sensor-based
   system was installed at the emergency medical (EM) department, and
   presented to the participants of this study. Thirty participants,
   paramedics and doctors from the emergency department participated in the
   study. Two scenarios common for the prehospital emergency routines were
   considered for the evaluation. Participants were asked to answer the
   questions referred to these scenarios by rating each of the items on a
   5-point Likert scale.
   Results Path coefficients between each measured variable were
   calculated. All coefficients were positive, but the statistically
   significant were only the following: patient status and perceive
   usefulness (beta=0.284, t=2.097), environment (both urban a nd rural)
   and perceive usefulness (beta=0.247, t=2.570; beta=0.329, t=2.083,
   respectively), and perceive usefulness and behavioral intention
   (beta=0.621 t=7.269). The variance of intention is 47.9\%.
   Conclusions The study results show that the proposed system is well
   accepted by the EM personnel and can be used as a complementary system
   in EM department for continuous monitoring of patients' vital signs.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: The Lauren classification of gastric adenocarcinoma
   describes three histological subtypes, the intestinal, the diffuse and
   the mixed type carcinoma. The metastatic pattern of gastric
   adenocarcinoma by histological subtype has not been studied.
   Methods: Gastric adenocarcinoma patients with metastatic disease at the
   time of diagnosis between 1999 and 2017 were identified through the
   Netherlands Cancer Registry. The Lauren classification was determined
   based on pathology reports archived in the Dutch Pathology Registry and
   was linked to individual cases in the Netherlands Cancer Registry.
   Results: Among 8 231 newly diagnosed, metastatic and evaluable gastric
   adenocarcinoma patients, 57 \% had an intestinal type carcinoma, 38 \%
   patients had a diffuse type carcinoma and 5 \% had a mixed type
   carcinoma. Intestinal type carcinomas more often metastasized to the
   liver (57 \% versus 21 \%, p < 0.0001) and lungs (13 \% versus 7 \%, p <
   0.0001), whereas diffuse type carcinomas more often metastasized to the
   peritoneum (58 \% versus 29 \%, p < 0.0001) and bones (9 \% versus 6 \%,
   p < 0.0001). Patients with a diffuse type carcinoma had a worse survival
   perspective regardless of the number or the location of the metastases.
   Conclusion: In this national cohort study, metastatic gastric
   adenocarcinoma of the intestinal type had a predilection for the liver
   and that of the diffuse type for the peritoneum.}},

   deposition (MOCVD) were successfully used in nitrogen-polar GaN
   metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) high-electron-mobility transistors

   ultra-low contact resistances (R-C) were demonstrated. In this study,
   MOCVD was used for the contact regrowth, eliminating the need for an MBE
   growth step. A metal-to-2DEG (two-dimensional electron gas) contact
   resistance (R-C) of 0.16 omega mm was demonstrated, comparable to the
   ultra-low contact resistances that were previously reported for contacts
   regrown by MBE. N-Polar MISHEMTs fabricated using this technology
   achieved breakdown voltages over 2000 V, with a specific on-resistance
   (R-ON) of 3.5 m omega cm(2)( 8.8 omega mm), and a dynamic R-ON increase
   of 12\% at 400 V. The drain current density was 620 mA mm(-1) at V-GS =

   actuators around the airfoil leading edge. The plasma actuators were
   arranged in different layouts (e.g., orientation, number, and width of
   exposed electrodes) to evaluate their effects on the anti-icing
   performance under a typical glaze icing condition pertinent to aircraft
   inflight icing phenomena. While the dynamics ice accretion or anti-icing
   process over the airfoil surface before and after turning on the plasma
   actuators was recorded by using a high-resolution imaging system, a
   high-speed infrared thermal imaging system was used to quantitatively
   map the temperature distributions over the airfoil surface. The
   experimental results clearly reveal that, with the same power
   consumption level, the plasma actuators in streamwise layout would
   result in higher plasma-induced surface heating and faster runback of
   the unfrozen water over the airfoil surface, thereby, having a
   noticeably better anti-icing performance, in comparison to those in
   spanwise layout. The plasma actuators in streamwise layout were found to
   not only be able to prevent ice accretion near the airfoil leading edge,
   but also allow the plasma-induced surface heating to convect further
   downstream to delay/prevent the runback ice formation near the airfoil
   trailing edge. A proper combination of the plasma actuation strength and
   the plasma discharge coverage over the airfoil surface was found to
   result in the optimum performance for aircraft anti-icing applications.

Title = {{Effective dose of radiation per screw in surgery of adolescent
   idiopathic scoliosis: matched pair analysis of 293 pedicle screws
   inserted using three different techniques}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHILDRENS ORTHOPAEDICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Reports on heterogenous groups of patients have indicated that
   pedicle screw insertion guided by navigation (PIN) leads to, for the
   patient, higher doses of radiation compared with pedicle screw insertion
   guided by fluoroscopy (PIF). This would be a major concern, especially
   in paediatric deformity correction.
   Methods After a power analysis (aiming at > 0.8) 293 pedicle screws
   which were inserted in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis
   were analyzed by comparing effective dose and fluoroscopy time per screw
   for three different techniques. Groups 2 and 3 were matched to Group 1
   by Lenke type of scoliosis. Group 1 were prospectively enrolled
   consecutive patients that have been operated on by PIN with image
   acquisition by preoperative CT scan (CTS). Group 2 were consecutive
   retrospectively matched patients who have been operated on by PIN with
   image acquisition by an intraoperative 3D scan (3DS). Group 3 were
   consecutive retrospectively matched patients who have been operated on
   by PIF.
   Results Mean dose of radiation per screw was 1.0 mSv (sd 0.8) per screw
   in CTS patients, 0.025 mSv (sd 0.001) per screw in 3DS patients and
   0.781 mSv (sd 0.12) per screw in PIF patients. The difference was
   significant (p < 0.0001).
   Conclusion When we compared different techniques of navigation,
   navigation by image acquisition with CTS showed a significantly higher
   (by 97.5\%) dose of radiation per screw for the patient than navigation
   by image acquisition by a 3DS. Navigation by 3DS showed significantly
   lower effective dose per screw for the adolescent patients than the
   fluoroscopic technique.}},

Abstract = {{The brown marmorated stink bug Halyomorpha halys is one of the most
   harmful invasive insect species worldwide. Originating from Asia, this
   species invaded first North America and later the European continent,
   where it has soon become widely spread. There have been no official data
   of the presence of H. halys on territory of the Republic of North
   Macedonia, although the species was recorded in the neighbouring
   countries: Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece and most recently in Albania. This
   paper reports the first record of H. halys in two regions of R. North
   Macedonia: in the town of Gevgelija, situated close to the Greek border
   and in the capital Skopje. The transport as a stowaway and natural
   dispersal across borders are discussed as potential pathways of
   introduction of the pest species in this country. The establishment and
   further spread of H. halys in R. North Macedonia could be expected in
   the future.}},

Title = {{Perturbation of the human gastrointestinal tract microbial ecosystem by
   oral drugs to treat chronic disease results in a spectrum of individual
   specific patterns of extinction and persistence of dominant microbial
   strains}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Oral drugs can have side effects such as diarrhea that indicate the
   perturbation of the gut microbial community. To further understand the
   dynamics of perturbation, we have assessed the strain relatedness of
   samples from previously published data sets from pre and post bowel
   evacuation, episodes of diarrhea, and administration of oral drugs to
   treat diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.
   Methods
   We analyzed a total of published five data sets using our
   strain-tracking tool called Window-based Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV)
   Similarity (WSS) to identify related strains from the same individual.
   Results
   Strain-tracking analysis using the first data set from 8 individuals pre
   and 21-50 days post iso-osmotic bowel wash revealed almost all microbial
   strains were related in an individual between pre and post samples.
   Similarly, in a second study, strain-tracking analysis of 4 individuals
   pre and post sporadic diarrhea revealed the majority of strains were
   related over time (up to 44 weeks). In contrast, the analysis of a third
   data set from 22 individuals pre and post 3-day exposure of oral
   metformin revealed that no individuals had a related strain. In a fourth
   study, the data set taken at 2 and 4 months from 38 individuals on
   placebo or metformin revealed individual specific sharing of pre and
   post strains. Finally, the data set from 18 individuals with rheumatoid
   arthritis given disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs methotrexate or
   glycosides of the traditional Chinese medicinal component Tripterygium
   wilfordii showed individual specific sharing of pre and post strains up
   to 16 months.
   Conclusion
   Oral drugs used to treat chronic disease can result in individual
   specific microbial strain change for the majority of species. Since the
   gut community provides essential functions for the host, our study
   supports personalized monitoring to assess the status of the dominant
   microbial strains after initiation of oral drugs to treat chronic
   disease.}},

Pages = {{17-20}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{By examining railway workers' narratives of poussire (dust) and their
   practices of repair work in the train depot at Rufisque, Senegal, the
   article reveals how the workers' understanding of dust encapsulates a
   toxic mixture, not only of pollution and sand but also asbestos lodged
   in the coaches. Attendant to the corporeal and intimate stories of the
   workers and the histories of the trains imported from India, the article
   sheds light on how workers handle their daily encounters with the
   granular materiality of the toxic dust as it seeps into the bodies of
   machines and workers, conditioning their past and future. In the context
   of institutional as well as industrial negligence, despite an awareness
   of the dangers, the workers continue their unsafe practices in toxic
   environments for fear of losing their jobs. The article argues that
   disentangling the nostalgic, future and toxic aspects of the railway,
   helps to demonstrate how an otherwise fleeting, invisible toxicant -
   unequally distributed and travelling across geographies - remains stuck
   in the organisms of both men and machines.}},

Title = {{Equipment Development for Small and Urban Conservation Farming Systems}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURE-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The number of local small farms in the USA is on the rise due to a
   consumer demand for locally grown produce such as tomatoes. These farms
   often use small walk-behind tractors, but most field activities are
   still performed by hand requiring heavy physical labor. Recent efforts
   from USDA have been encouraging producers to adopt no-till techniques
   using cover crops for benefits such as reduced runoff and soil erosion,
   increased infiltration and water holding capacity, increased soil
   organic carbon, decreased soil compaction and improved weed control.
   However, lack of specialized no-till equipment inhibits widespread
   adoption of cover crops. To help small farms reduce hand labor and
   adoption of conservation systems with cover crops, no-till equipment
   such as a no-till drill, powered roller/crimper, and no-till
   transplanter have been developed for walk-behind tractors at the
   National Soil Dynamics Laboratory in Auburn (AL, USA). A replicated
   three-year field test (2017-2019) was conducted to evaluate
   effectiveness of the experimental powered coulter drill to plant cereal
   rye cover crop (Secale cereale, L.), patented powered roller/crimper to
   terminate rye, and transplanting cash crop tomato (Solanum lycopersicum
   L.) seedlings with a patented no-till transplanter. These three pieces
   of equipment were compatible with BCS 853 walk-behind tractor. The
   experiment was conducted on two different soils: Hiwassee sandy loam
   soil and Davidson clay to determine the performance of developed
   machines under different soil types. Results have shown that the powered
   coulter drill generated effective rye seed emergence (83\%) for optimum
   biomass production. The experimental powered roller/crimper generated
   95\% rye termination rate three weeks after rolling, and the no-till
   transplanter performed as anticipated providing less than 10\% variation
   of plant spacing uniformity. Tomato yield varied among years ranging
   from 15.9 Mg ha(-1) to 28.3 Mg ha(-1) and was related to different soil
   and weather conditions at each growing season. Numerically higher tomato
   yield on Davidson clay might be associated with less insect/pathogen
   pressure, higher plant available water, and reduced weed pressure due to
   greater cereal rye biomass production. Results from this experiment
   indicate that developed experimental equipment can be a practical
   solution for small no-till farming operations with cover crops.}},

Abstract = {{The frame model was developed in cognitive psychology and imported into
   the philosophy of science in order to provide representations of
   scientific concepts and conceptual taxonomies. The aim of this article
   is to show that beside the representation of scientific concepts the
   frame model is an efficient instrument to represent and analyze
   scientific theories. That is, we aim to establish the frame model as a
   representation tool for the structure of theories within the philosophy
   of science. For this, we will develop the notion of a theory frame and
   distinguish between theory frames for qualitative theories in which
   scientific measurement is based on nominal scales and theory frames for
   quantitative theories in which measurement is based on ratio scales. In
   three case studies, we will apply frames to a psychological, a
   linguistic, and a physical theory, thereby showing that the frame model
   is a powerful and intuitively accessible instrument to analyze the laws
   of scientific theories, the determination of theoretical concepts, the
   explanatory role of theoretical concepts, the abductive introduction of
   a new theoretical concept, the distinction between the core and the
   periphery of a theory, the diachronic development of a theory, and the
   distinction between qualitative and quantitative scientific concepts.
   Finally, we will provide a comparison to the structuralist view of
   theories, one of the most elaborated and applied models of theory
   representation.}},

Abstract = {{This work demonstrates a method to optimize materials and dimensions of
   piezoelectric cantilevers for electronic nose applications via finite
   element analysis simulations. Here we studied the optimum piezoelectric
   cantilever configuration for detection of cadaverine, a biomarker for
   meat ageing, to develop a potential electronic nose for the meat
   industry. The optimized cantilevers were fabricated, characterized,
   interfaced using custom-made electronics, and tested by approaching meat
   pieces. The results show successful measurements of cadaverine levels
   for meat pieces with different ages, hence, have a great potential for
   applications within the meat industry shelf-life prediction.}},

Title = {{Synthesis and combustion inhibition efficiency of iron short-chain
   perfluorocarboxylates}},
Journal = {{FIRE SAFETY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{118}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This study reports an experimental exploration of the combustion
   inhibition efficiency of iron short-chain perfluorocarboxylates, namely,
   iron trifluoroacetate (FeTFA) and iron pentafluoropropionate (FePFP).
   The aim is to develop a new phosphor-free fire-extinguishing agent. The
   synthesized FeTFA and FePFP were characterized by ultraviolet-visible
   spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray
   fluorescence measurements, and fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry.
   The FeTFA and FePFP ligands (i) coordinate with the iron ions in
   bridging form via carboxylate oxygens, (ii) contain no Cl-, and (iii)
   are hexanuclear complexes with chemical formulas of C18F27O22Fe6 and
   C27F45O22Fe6, respectively. Suppression trials and thermogravimetric
   measurements revealed that (i) both FeTFA and FePFP have higher
   combustion inhibition ability at lower suppressant concentrations than
   ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (an active component in conventional
   fire-extinguishing agents), (ii) FePFP is remarkably more
   inhibition-efficient than FeTFA, and (iii) neither FeTFA nor FePFP
   hinder cellulose pyrolysis and char combustion in the condensed phase.
   Thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry measurements confirmed that (i) the
   main gas-phase decomposition product of FeTFA and FePFP is CF3, and (ii)
   FePFP is a better CF3 generator than FeTFA. The different inhibition
   abilities of the two complexes were attributed to their different CF3
   generation abilities and eases of decomposing the complex.}},

   energy storage unit}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{32}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Energy storage and demand response are becoming an increasingly valuable
   solution for the enhancement of stability and reliability of the
   electricity grid with high penetration of distributed energy sources
   such as wind and solar. This paper proposes an intelligent energy
   management scheme to allow different distributed generation sources and
   energy storage technologies to actively participate in demand response
   via the deployed smart meter infrastructure. A Distributed
   Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (D-SMES) device is integrated
   into the network to deliver instantaneous and large bursts of power to
   support the grid under short-term disturbances. The proposed demand
   response-based energy management algorithm receives, via the smart meter
   infrastructure, the information from the electricity network such as the
   energy cost, upper load adjustment limit, and the State-of-Charge (SOC)
   of the storage system then, under very specific conditions, a decision
   is formulated as a control signal for charging or discharging the
   storage system, aiming at minimizing the total energy while avoiding any
   load shedding. The effectiveness of the proposed demand response
   approach for controlling generation, storage and demand coordination and
   energy cost reduction is demonstrated on a sample power system simulated
   in MATLAB/SimPowerSystems toolbox and evaluated under different case

Volume = {{223}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the performances of a-Si: H(n-i-p) /mu c-Si: H(n-i-p)
   tandem solar cell based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si: H) and
   hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (mu c-Si: H) with thinner active
   layers were investigated by using numerical simulation. For simulation,
   a one-dimensional computer code AMPS-1D was used to investigat the
   effect of the top single cell n(+) layer nature, the effect of the top
   single cell n(+) mu c-Si: H layer doping concentration (ND) and, the
   effect of the two active layers thicknesses, i-a-Si: H layer and i-mu
   c-Si: H layer on the performances of the tandem cell. However, the merit
   figures, like J(V) characteristics at dark and under illumination, the
   electric fields, the energy band diagrams and, the cell output
   parameters are calculated and investigated.
   According to our calculations it is found that, by using a n(+)mu c-Si:
   H layer with a doping concentration value ND = 1019 cm(-3) instead of a
   n(+) a-Si: H layer in the n-i-p top single cell the tandem solar cell
   performances were performed. It is also obtained, a values of 50 nm and
   600 nm for the active layers i-a-Si: H and i-mu c-Si: H thicknesses,
   respectively, are recommended for a-Si: H/mu c-Si: H tandem solar cell
   good performances. Lastly, the tandem solar cell with top single cell
   n(+)mu c-Si :H layer and with a thinner active layers thicknesses has
   the higher output parameters (J(SC)=10.52 mA/cm(2), V-OC=1414 mV, FF =
   80.2 \% and, the efficiency = 12.14 \%).}},

Abstract = {{This paper assessed the importance of primary school development in
   relation to community life, availability of funding, and attractiveness
   of rural municipalities in the suburban, intermediate and peripheral
   countryside of the Czech Republic. The importance of primary schools was
   analysed based on empirical research of the mayors of small
   municipalities in regions at the NUTS 3 level, i.e. suburban countryside
   in a large metropolitan area (the Central Bohemia Region), intermediate
   - stabilised rural region with a low population density (the South
   Bohemia Region) and predominantly rural region, internal periphery (the
   Vysocina Region). The results are discussed in three main themes: (1)
   general importance of schools for municipal development, (2) factors for
   school maintenance/absence in the village, and (3) development problems
   of municipalities in particular types of rural regions. Generally, the
   study findings prove the above division depending on whether there is a
   school within the municipality, with disparities with different types of
   rural areas not significant. Representatives of rural municipalities
   with a school confirmed that that the school is an important element in
   terms of community life and the attractiveness of the municipality for
   current and future residents, whereas in municipalities without schools,
   the necessary institutional memory to assess the importance and
   potential of a school was missing. Therefore, schools are only perceived
   as a provider of education without the possibility to positively
   influence the life within the municipality. This approach to
   understanding primary schools in conjunction with trends in rural
   outmigration in distant rural municipalities enhances the vicious circle
   of socio-economic shrinkage.}},

Abstract = {{A mild thermal solvolysis process using alcohols for the valorization of
   technical Protobind soda lignin into crude lignin oil (CLO) is
   presented. The solubilization process results in lower molecular weight
   lignin fragments (1250-1550 g mol(-1)cf. 2500 g mol(-1) of parent
   lignin), while rejecting heavy compounds and other solid impurities. The
   influence of the reaction temperature (100-350 degrees C), residence
   time (0.5-4 h), lignin : solvent ratio (1 : 15-1 : 2 w/v) and alcohol
   solvent (methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, and 1-octanol) on the
   amount and type of products is investigated. At a high lignin loading
   (ratio < 1 : 5 w/v) and under optimum conditions for lignin
   solubilization (T = 200 degrees C, t = 0.5 h), the condensation
   reactions and solvent consumption are minimized. Methanol exhibits the
   highest solvolytic efficacy resulting in an overall lignin
   solubilization degree of 61 wt\%, which includes some heavier lignin
   fractions originating from condensation reactions. The other alcohols
   resulted in a lignin solubilization degree of 57 wt\% for ethanol, 53
   wt\% for 1-propanol, 51 wt\% for 1-butanol and 38 wt\% for 1-octanol.
   The solvent losses based on GC-MS analysis of the obtained CLOs were 1.1
   wt\% for methanol, 1.4 wt\% for ethanol and 2.2 wt\% for 1-butanol.
   Hansen solubility parameters are employed to discuss the effect of
   solvent on the solubilization process. Gel permeation chromatography and
   heteronuclear single quantum coherence NMR of solubilized fractions
   revealed cleavage of beta-O-4 bonds during thermal solvolysis,
   explaining the molecular weight reduction. Methanol is the most
   favourable solvent and is utilized in solubilization of 5 different
   biorefinery lignins. In all cases, this led to CLO with a lower
   molecular weight of the lignin fragments, a lower polydispersity and an
   increased hydroxyl group content.}},

   collected data for renewable energy, water availability, governance, and
   environmental degradation for the period of 1988 to 2018 from the World
   Development Indicator. In panel data estimation, if cross-sectional
   dependence exists, it produces biased estimates. Therefore, this study
   applied a newly developed technique, dynamic common correlated effect,
   which produces efficient estimates in the presence of cross-sectional
   dependence. This study found that foreign direct investment positively
   and significantly increases environment degradation (beta = 0.69 {*},
   {*} indicates the significance level at less than 1\%) while renewable
   energy and water availability cause to reduce environment degradation
   (beta = -0.08 {*}{*}, beta = -0.09 {*}{*}, {*}{*}indicates the
   significance level at less than 5\%). Moreover, the study also found
   that governance significantly strengthens the relationship of renewable
   energy and water availability with environment degradation (beta = 0.37
   {*}{*}, beta = 0.24 {*}{*}) while governance significantly weakens the
   relationship of foreign direct investment and environmental degradation
   (beta = -0.34 {*}). The study suggests that South Asian countries should
   improve political institutions, and promote renewable energy, water
   availability, and clean production to improve the environment quality.}},

Abstract = {{Chip manufacturers introduce redundancy at various levels of CPU design
   to guarantee correct operation, even for worst-case combinations of
   non-idealities in process variation and system operating conditions.
   This redundancy is implemented partly in the form of voltage margins.
   However, for a wide range of real-world execution scenarios these
   margins are excessive and merely translate to increased power
   consumption, hindering the effort towards higher energy efficiency in
   both HPC and general purpose computing. Our study on the x86-64 Haswell
   and Skylake multicore microarchitectures reveals wide voltage margins,
   which vary across different microarchitectures, different chip parts of
   the same microarchitecture, and across different workloads. We find that
   it is necessary to quantify voltage margins using multi-threaded and
   multi-instance workloads, as characterization with single-threaded and
   single-instance workloads that do not stress the CPU to its full
   capacity typically identifies overly optimistic margins that lead to
   errors when applied in realistic program execution scenarios. In
   addition, we introduce, deploy and evaluate a run-time governor that
   dynamically reduces the supply voltage of modern multicore x86-64 CPUs.
   Our governor employs a model that takes as input a set of performance
   metrics which are directly measurable via performance monitoring
   counters and have high predictive value for the minimum tolerable supply
   voltage (V-min), to predict and apply the appropriate reduction for the
   workload at hand. Compared with the conventional DVFS governor, our
   approach achieves up to 42 percent energy savings for the Skylake family
   and 34 percent for the Haswell family for complex, real-world
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is expected to produce shifts in species distributions as
   well as behavioural and physiological adaptations to find suitable
   conditions or to cope with the altered environment. The paper wasps
   Polistes dominula and Polistes gallicus are closely related species,
   native in the European Mediterranean region and North Africa. P.
   dominula has expanded its range to the relatively cooler climates of
   Northern and Eastern Europe, but P. gallicus remained in its original
   distribution area. In order to reveal their metabolic adaptation to the
   current climate conditions, and the impact on energy demand at future
   climate conditions, we investigated the respiratory metabolic rate (CO2
   production) of P. dominula from Austria and P. gallicus from Italy. In
   contrast to the metabolic cold adaptation hypothesis their standard
   metabolic rate was nearly the same and increased in a typical
   exponential course with increasing ambient temperature. The metabolic
   rate of active wasps was higher than the standard metabolic rate and
   increased with the wasps' activity. There was no obvious difference in
   the active metabolism between the two species, with the exception that
   some P. gallicus individuals showed some extraordinary high values. A
   simultaneous measurement of metabolic rate and body temperature revealed
   that increased CO2 production was accompanied by endothermic activity.
   The two investigated populations of paper wasps are quite similar in
   their metabolic response to temperature, although they live in different
   climate regions. The spread of P. dominula into cooler regions did not
   have significant influence on their active and standard metabolic rate.}},

Abstract = {{Current changes in the business environment mean that the pursuit of
   economic development-without accounting for social welfare and

   article aims to assess the differences in the use of marketing mix tools
   (5P) according to the concept of sustainable development in countries
   with different socioeconomic conditions. The empirical study was based
   on 262 questionnaires conducted among small and medium-sized enterprises
   (SMEs) operating in two different countries, i.e., 150 companies
   operating in Poland (as an example of a developed country) and 112 in
   Sri Lanka (as an example of a developing country). The obtained results
   show that there are statistically significant differences between the
   analyzed markets in terms of implementing sustainable marketing tools.
   The results allow us to conclude that the sustainable marketing mix

Abstract = {{Soluble, redox-active organic materials hold promise as charge-storage
   species for flow batteries; however, chemical stability during extended
   operation remains a key challenge. While a number of spectroscopic and

   steps. Here, we use microelectrode voltammetry to observe nonaqueous
   flow battery electrolytes directly, simultaneously identifying the rate
   of self-discharge (reversible material loss) and material decay
   (irreversible material loss). We validate this technique using ferrocene
   as a stable model redox couple, examine and address sources of error,
   and, finally, demonstrate its capability by assessing the decay of a
   well-studied and moderately-stable substituted dialkoxybenzene
   {[}2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)benzene]. These results

Abstract = {{Simple Summary
   Detailed natural history information is still lacking for many species
   of soil-dwelling invertebrates. We asked whether the larvae (wireworms)
   of two click beetle species, which are most abundant in European boreal
   forests, feed on live roots of forest plants. The weight of root pieces
   of downy birch, Scots pine, Norway spruce and wavy hair-grass, offered
   to wireworms in a laboratory experiment, did not decrease, indicating
   that these larvae did not consume live root tissues. Therefore, Athous
   subfuscus and Dalopius marginatus should be excluded from the lists of
   forest pests damaging tree roots.
   The life histories of many soil-dwelling invertebrates remain poorly
   studied. The larvae of two click beetle species, Athous subfuscus and
   Dalopius marginatus, which are most abundant in European boreal forests,
   are both classified as omnivorous and are included in lists of
   root-damaging pests. Nevertheless, we are not aware of any direct proof
   of their ability (or inability) to consume plant roots. In this study,
   we asked whether these larvae actually feed on the roots of forest
   plants in the absence of other food sources. Live roots of boreal forest
   plants, including trees (Betula pubescens, Picea abies and Pinus
   sylvestris) and grass (Deschampsia flexuosa), were offered to click

   placed in vials with the wireworms did not decrease, indicating that the
   larvae of these click beetle species did not feed on live roots, even in
   the absence of other food sources. This suggests that the feeding niches
   of A. subfuscus and D. marginatus larvae are narrower than previously
   thought and do not include live plant tissues. Therefore, these click
   beetle species should be excluded from the lists of forest pests

Title = {{Use of ICF in Rehabilitation: a Clinical Case}},

Abstract = {{The article describes a clinical case of a patient with an acute
   cerebrovascular accident (CVA) at the second stage of medical
   rehabilitation, conducted by a psychologist as part of a
   multidisciplinary team. It presents the main concepts and content of the
   International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health
   (ICF). Attention is drawn to a unified language of its application,
   available to all members of such a multidisciplinary team implementing
   the process of rehabilitation. The importance of psychological
   evaluation within the ICF categories for effective interaction between
   this team's specialists has been shown. A specific feature of this case
   was a possibility of using categories belonging to almost all the ICF
   sections.
   The purpose of this work is to introduce psychologists to a clinical
   psychologist's competencies and possibilities of applying the ICF in the
   rehabilitation of patients with an acute CVA at the second stage of
   medical rehabilitation.
   Materials and methods. The article focuses on a clinical case of a
   female patient with an acute CVA during the early recovery period at the
   second stage of medical rehabilitation with a description of the
   dynamics of her psychological status, using the ICF categories.
   Results. The article provides a list of psychological domains presented
   in the following ICF sections: ``Body Functions{''}, ``Activity and
   Participation{''}, and ``Environmental Factors{''}, which can be used by
   a clinical psychologist within rehabilitation activities. The
   rehabilitation diagnosis for this patient with an acute CVA in her early
   recovery period was provided by means of the ICF categories based on her
   individual characteristics and impairments, and the dynamics of recovery
   has been revealed. The ICF domains are presented with an indication of
   the content aspect and the degree of impairment.
   Discussion of results. The clinical case demonstrates the importance of
   taking into account personal and environmental factors when describing
   one's rehabilitation diagnosis and organizing the rehabilitation
   process. Applying the ICF categories makes the patient's features and
   problems clear to all the multidisciplinary team members. The main
   difficulties of working with the ICF are related to the selection of
   domains due to the discrepancy between the conceptual apparatus of
   foreign and domestic psychology. The importance of understanding the
   semantic component of the domain has been shown.
   Limitations of screening tests have been noted, and the need to conduct
   a qualitative analysis of mental disorders within the framework of a
   personality-oriented approach has been updated.
   Conclusions. Applying the ICF allows one to maintain a productive
   interaction with all the members of the multidisciplinary team, describe
   the patient's current problems and visually assess the dynamics of
   recovery. At the same time, its use in the practice of a clinical
   psychologist requires a specialist to have a deep understanding of the
   content of the ICF psychological domains and skills to select them for
   each specific case.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The authors of the present thesis carried out a comparative
   analysis of three different computer software packages - FSL, SPM and
   FuncTool - for the processing of fMRI scans.
   Purpose: The aim of the thesis was the analysis of the volume of regions
   functionally active during the stimulation of the centres evaluated as
   well as the location of those regions in relation to the tumour
   boundaries, and then the comparison of the results.
   Material and methods: Thirty eight patients with a diagnosed tumour of
   the left hemisphere, qualified for a neurosurgical operation, underwent
   fMRI. The functions of speech, motion and sensation were evaluated.
   Imaging data were processed for all the acquired scans with the use of
   each of the three software packages assessed.
   Results: For the FuncTool software package the calculated differences in
   the distances were several times greater than those calculated using FSL
   and SPM. The differences in the volume of the functionally active
   regions derived from the calculations with the use of the FSL and SPM
   software packages were statistically different for four out of the six
   functions evaluated.
   Conclusions: The conclusions of the analysis in question showed that the
   FSL and SPM packages could be used interchangeably in the functional
   mapping of the brain with the purpose of the planning of neurosurgical
   operations. The FuncTool software package is less precise than FSL and
   SPM.}},

Abstract = {{After the presidential election in Belarus on August 9, 2020, which
   according to the official data, was won by the then President Alexander
   Lukashenko, mass protests against falsifications began in the country.
   Believers of various denominations joined these actions. Therefore, the
   leadership of the country's religious organizations were faced with the
   question of determining their attitude toward these actions. The
   leadership of the largest religious organization in Belarus, the
   Belarusian Orthodox Church, initially expressed some dissatisfaction
   with the authorities' violence. The then exarch of this church, Pavlo,
   despite congratulating Lukashenko on his election victory, still
   expressed some sympathy to the protesters. However, after the change of
   the head of this church, which was carried out on August 25 by the Synod
   of the Russian Orthodox Church (part of which is the Belarusian Orthodox
   Church), the situation changed. The new exarch of Belarus, Benjamin, met
   with Lukashenko and showed a positive attitude towards his regime,
   although many Orthodox believers and even the priesthood supported the
   protesters. However, the leadership of the Catholic Church in Belarus
   condemned the violence of the authorities, upon which the authorities
   started putting pressure on the Catholic Church. They have isolated its
   head, Metropolitan Tadevush Kandrusevich, by not allowing him to
   re-enter the territory of the Republic of Belarus. As for Protestants,
   Jews, Muslims, Old Believers, and other religious organizations that do
   not have much influence in Belarusian society, their leaders try to
   distance themselves from political issues without explicitly supporting
   either side. However, some members of these denominations, including
   clergy, participated in the protests.}},

Journal = {{CLASSICAL QUARTERLY}},

Volume = {{70}},

Abstract = {{Quo usque tandem abutere, Catilina, patientia nostra? ('Just how much
   longer, really, Catiline, will you abuse our patience?'). The famous
   incipit-'And what are you reading, Master Buddenbrook? Ah, Cicero! A
   difficult text, the work of a great Roman orator. Quousque tandem,
   Catilina. Huh-uh-hmm, yes, I've not entirely forgotten my Latin,
   either'- already impressed contemporaries, including some ordinarily not
   so readily impressed. It rings through Sallust's version of Catiline's
   shadowy address to his followers, when he asks regarding the injustices
   they suffer (Cat. 20.9): quae quousque tandem patiemini, o fortissumi
   uiri? ('Just how much longer, really, will you put up with these, o
   bravest men?'). More playfully, and less well-known, Sallust employed
   the expression again in a speech by Philippus (Hist. 1.77.17 M./67 R.):
   uos autem, patres conscripti, quo usque cunctando rem publicam intutam
   patiemini et uerbis arma temptabitis? ('But you, members of the Senate,
   just how much longer will you suffer our Republic to be unsafe by your
   hesitation and make an attempt on arms with words?'). Soon afterwards it
   served Cicero's son, who, as governor of Asia, put down Hybreas fils for
   having dared to quote from his father's work in his presence (Sen. Suas.
   7.14): `age', inquit {[}sc. Marcus Tullius], `non putas me didicisse
   patris mei: ``quousque tandem abutere, Catilina, patientia nostra{''}?'
   ('{''}Come now{''}, he said, ``do you think that I do not know by heart
   my father's `Just how much longer, really, Catiline, will you abuse our
   patience'?{''}'). Just about the same time, Livy recalled it in order to
   colour Manlius' exhortation of his followers (6.18.5): quousque tandem
   ignorabitis uires uestras, quas natura ne beluas quidem ignorare uoluit?
   horizontal ellipsis audendum est aliquid uniuersis aut omnia singulis
   patienda. quousque me circumspectabitis? ('Just how much longer, really,
   will you remain ignorant of your own strength, which nature has willed
   even brutes to know? horizontal ellipsis We must dare all together, or
   else, separately, suffer all. Just how much longer will you keep looking
   round for me?'). Thereafter Quintilian would refer to it twice, when
   discussing apostrophe and rhetorical questions (Inst. 4.1.68, 9.2.7),
   just a couple of years before Tacitus has the maladroit Q. Haterius
   encourage Tiberius to seize the reins-quo usque patieris, Caesar, non
   adesse caput rei publicae? ('Just how much longer, Caesar, will you
   suffer the absence of the head of state?', Ann. 1.13.4); a few decades
   later still, Apuleius puts it into the mouth of the slave who chastises
   his master, now in asinine form (Met. 3.27): `quo usque tandem', inquit,
   `cantherium patiemur istum paulo ante cibariis iumentorum, nunc etiam
   simulacris deorum infestum?' ('{''}Just how much longer, really,{''} he
   said, ``will we suffer this old gelding to attack the animals' food just
   a little while ago and now even the gods' statues?{''}'). He trusted, no
   doubt, that the famous question would alert his readers more than
   anything to the many `similarities between Catiline and Lucius', in
   order to have them appreciate this `ludicrous copy of Cicero's
   arch-enemy'.
   Some time after, and in a different corner of the Empire altogether, a
   teacher's bronze statue would carry the inscription:VERBACICRO |

Journal = {{PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Ultrafiltration is a powerful method used in virtually every
   pharmaceutical bioprocess. Depending on the process stage, the
   product-to-impurity ratio differs. The impact of impurities on the
   process depends on various factors. Solely mechanistic models are
   currently not sufficient to entirely describe these complex
   interactions. We have established two hybrid models for predicting the
   flux evolution, the protein rejection factor and two components'
   concentration during crossflow ultrafiltration. The hybrid models were
   compared to the standard mechanistic modeling approach based on the
   stagnant film theory. The hybrid models accurately predicted the flux
   and concentration over a wide range of process parameters and
   product-to-impurity ratios based on a minimum set of training
   experiments. Incorporating both components into the modeling approach
   was essential to yielding precise results. The stagnant film model
   exhibited larger errors and no predictions regarding the impurity could
   be made, since it is based on the main product only. Further, the
   developed hybrid models exhibit excellent interpolation properties and
   enable both multi-step ahead flux predictions as well as time-resolved
   impurity forecasts, which is considered to be a critical quality
   attribute in many bioprocesses. Therefore, the developed hybrid models
   present the basis for next generation bioprocessing when implemented as
   soft sensors for real-time monitoring of processes.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims: LMA CTrach (TM), a new intubating conduit, has a
   thicker shaft compared to that of the intubating laryngeal mask airway
   (ILMA) due to the embedded optical fibres of the system. This causes
   difficulty during insertion despite normal mouth opening. Utility of two
   manoeuvres to overcome this was evaluated. Methods: From our experience
   with LMA CTrach (TM) we found that two manoeuvres can be helpful to
   facilitate the insertion of LMA (a) dorsal and downward pressure over
   the shaft at the point where it hinges against the incisors while
   continuing the one handed rotational insertion of LMA (b) Lateral
   insertion of the LMA till the cuff is inside the oral cavity and then
   rotation of the LMA by 90 degrees and then complete the insertion. A
   retrospective analysis of 200 insertions of LMA CTrach (TM) was done to
   evaluate the utility of these manoeuvres. Results: Out of 200
   insertions, 15 were found to be difficult. Manoeuvre `a' was applied in
   13 cases to facilitate the insertion and manoeuvre `b' was applied in 2
   cases where insertion was not possible despite manoeuvre `a'. Insertion
   was successful in these cases after the application of the described
   manoeuvres. Conclusion: The two manoeuvres described above can be useful
   when LMA CTrach (TM) insertion into the oral cavity is obstructed by the
   incisor teeth.}},

Abstract = {{The CO2 gas separation performance of aminated reduced graphene oxide
   (A-rGO) incorporated PEBAX mixed matrix composite membranes, by means of
   amination heating time and A-rGO loading, is reported. The 5 h of
   heating time resulted in an essential molecular sieving property for CO2
   separation, thus used in membrane fabrication. The selective
   PEBAX/A-rGO5 layers were fabricated on top of the polysulfone supporting
   layer by a dip-coating method. The A-rGO was well-dispersed, the
   selective and support layers were seamlessly attached. The CO2
   permeability and CO2/N-2 selectivity of the PEBAX/A-rGO5 was greater
   than that of pristine PEBAX. 3 wt\% of A-rGO5 loading resulted as the
   optimum since the gas selectivity decreased at higher loading. The
   PEBAX/A-rGO5 performance, which was slightly above the Robeson 2008
   upper bound of permeability-selectivity relation for CO2/N-2 gas
   separation, shows a promising application for industrial CO2 gas
   separation process.}},

Title = {{A New Retrieval of Sun-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence in Water from
   Ocean Colour Measurements Applied on OLCI L-1b and L-2}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{The retrieval of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence is greatly
   beneficial to studies of marine phytoplankton biomass, physiology, and
   composition, and is required for user applications and services.
   Customarily phytoplankton chlorophyll fluorescence is determined from
   satellite measurements through a fluorescence line-height algorithm
   using three bands around 680 nm. We propose here a modified retrieval,
   making use of all available bands in the relevant wavelength range, with
   the goal to improve the effectiveness of the algorithm in optically
   complex waters. For the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI), we
   quantify a Fluorescence Peak Height by fitting a Gaussian function and
   related terms to the top-of-atmosphere reflectance bands between 650 and
   750 nm. This algorithm retrieves, what we call Fluorescence Peak Height
   by fitting a Gaussian function upon other terms to top-of-atmosphere
   reflectance bands between 650 and 750 nm. This approach is applicable to
   Level-1 and Level-2 data. We find a good correlation of the retrieved
   fluorescence product to global in-situ chlorophyll measurements, as well
   as a consistent relation between chlorophyll concentration and
   fluorescence from radiative transfer modelling and OLCI/in-situ
   comparison. Evidence suggests, the algorithm is applicable to complex
   waters without needing an atmospheric correction and vicarious
   calibration, and features an inherent correction of small spectral
   shifts, as required for OLCI measurements.}},

Abstract = {{The first part of the paper is dedicated to the presentation of the
   understanding of Isaiah Berlin's two concepts of political liberty:
   positive and negative. Special attention is paid to defining the
   negative conception of liberty and the value of pluralism. The second
   part of the paper lists some relevant and influential remarks that have
   been made - or that can be made - to Berlin's binary classification of
   liberty, as well as the responses of the apologists of negative liberty.
   Alternative conceptualizations of liberty are also presented, primarily
   MacCallum's ``tripartite{''} and Skinner's and Pettit's ``republican{''}
   visions, in order to sharpen the points of contention. In short
   conclusion, it is suggested that negative liberty is not enough, but is
   a necessary condition for any meaningful discourse to be made about
   it.The author is convinced that such an interpretation coincides with
   Berlin's intention.}},

Journal = {{ACROSS LANGUAGES AND CULTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{195-216}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the following question: to what extent does
   neural machine translation (NMT) - a relatively new approach to machine
   translation (MT), which can draw on richer contextual information than
   previous MT architectures - perform explicitation shifts in translation
   and how are these shifts realised in linguistic terms? In order to
   answer this question, the paper attempts to identify instances of
   explicitation in the machine-translated version of a research report on
   carbon dioxide capture and storage. The machine-translated text was
   created using the publicly available generic NMT system DeepL. The human
   translation of the research report was analysed in a prior research
   project for instances of explicitation and implicitation (Kruger 2015).
   After a brief quantitative discussion of the frequency and distribution
   of explicitation shifts identified in the Deep!, output as compared to
   the shifts identified in the human translation of the research report,
   the paper analyses in detail several examples in which Deept, performed
   explicitation shifts of various kinds. The quantitative and qualitative
   analyses are intended to yield a tentative picture of the capacity of
   state-of-the art neural machine translation systems to perform
   explicitation shifts in translation. As explicitation is understood in
   this article as an indicator of translational text-context interaction,
   the explicitation performance of NMT can - to some extent - be taken to
   be indicative of the ``contextual awareness{''} of this new MT
   architecture.}},

Abstract = {{In situ high-temperature powder X-ray diffraction (HTPXRD), differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetry (TG) of three natural
   borosilicates have been performed in the temperature range of 25-1200
   degrees C. Axinite-(Mn) melts incongruently at 900 degrees C with the
   formation of anorthite and bustamite. Leucosphenite decomposes at 850
   degrees C to form fresnoite and cristobalite. According to DSC data,
   kornerupine decomposes at 1177 degrees C to form sapphirine, indialite,
   and spinel as the products of heating kornerupine. The values of the
   thermal expansion tensor and its orientation were determined using the
   HTPXRD data. The study showed that the three borosilicates expand weakly
   and almost isotropically. The average bulk thermal expansion
   coefficients are 21.3, 22.7, and 32.9 x 10(-6)degrees C-1 for
   axinite-(Mn), kornerupine, and leucosphenite, respectively.
   Leucosphenite has the maximum volumetric expansion, most likely due to
   the pronounced layered character of its crystal structure. The least
   symmetric structure of axinite-(Mn) has the maximum anisotropy of
   thermal expansion in the temperature range of 600-900 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{(4-Oxo-2-thioxothiazolidin-3-yl)acetic acids exhibit a wide range of
   pharmacological activities. Among them, the only derivative used in
   clinical practice is the aldose reductase inhibitor epalrestat.
   Structurally related compounds,
   {[}(5Z)-(5-arylalkylidene-4-oxo-2-thioxo-1,3-thiazolidin-3-yl)]acetic
   acid derivatives were prepared previously as potential antifungal
   agents. This study was aimed at the determination of aldose reductase
   inhibitory action of the compounds in comparison with epalrestat and
   evaluation of structure-activity relationships (SAR). The aldose
   reductase (ALR2) enzyme was isolated from the rat eye lenses, while
   aldehyde reductase (ALR1) was obtained from the kidneys. The compounds
   studied were found to be potent inhibitors of ALR2 with submicromolar
   IC50 values.
   (Z)-2-(5-(1-(5-butylpyrazin-2-yl)ethylidene)-4-oxo-2-thioxothiazolidin-3
   -yl)acetic acid (3) was identified as the most efficacious inhibitor
   (over five times more potent than epalrestat) with mixed-type
   inhibition. All the compounds also exhibited low antiproliferative
   (cytotoxic) activity to the HepG2 cell line. Molecular docking
   simulations of 3 into the binding site of the aldose reductase enzyme
   identified His110, Trp111, Tyr48, and Leu300 as the crucial interaction
   counterparts responsible for the high-affinity binding. The selectivity
   factor for 3 in relation to the structurally related ALR1 was comparable
   to that for epalrestat. SAR conclusions suggest possible modifications
   to improve further inhibition efficacy, selectivity, and biological
   availability in the group of rhodanine carboxylic acids.}},

Abstract = {{In the experiment on the white Wistar rats, the authors evaluated
   kidneys changes in urolithiasis modelling (Kidney stone disease, KSD)
   and the possibility of correcting these changes by internal use of the

   studies revealed structural pathological changes in the kidneys in the
   form of changes of the part of glomeruli capillaries and gross changes
   in the kidneys tubules and interstitial layers. At the same time, the
   functional kidneys activity is manifested in the form of increased
   urination and a significant increase in urination. Urine metabolic
   characteristics are also change. The use of MW leads to an improvement
   in the capillaries of the renal corpuscles structure and almost complete
   restoration of the tubules structure. The functional activity of the
   kidneys and the quality of urine have significantly improving. The
   authors believe that the organic compounds of MW, which mainly determine
   its biological activity, contribute to the improvement of the regulation

Title = {{Bosphorus Coastal Road and Settlements Between Besiktas and Bebek in
   1939 Plan}},
Journal = {{ICONARP INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURE AND PLANNING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{54-80}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   The aim of the study is to question whether this plan, which was signed
   by Henri Prost and showing the settlements between Besiktas and Bebek on
   the European side of the Bosphorus in detail and explains them in
   cross-sections, is implemented or not, and to reveal the effect of the
   plan on the formation of current state of the Bosphorus coasts. In the
   study, which decisions are taken during the planning process are also
   questioned.
   Design/Methodology/Approach
   In the study, the city centers of Besiktas, Ortakoy, Arnavutkoy,
   Kurucesme, Bebek and the settlements between them and the conditions of
   the coastal road before, in and after 1939 are examined with the help of
   maps and aerial photographs. With the aerial photographs that have
   survived until today, the physical change of the urban texture over time
   and its current situation are also revealed.
   Findings
   As a result of the examination, it was determined that most of the plan,
   which was approved in 1939, was implemented between 1956-1958, during
   the Menderes period. In this process, many settlements lost their
   original urban texture, historical structures, and architectural
   identities. It can be said that the seeds of the pile road, which was
   built during the Dalan period and cut the connection of the mansions
   with the sea, was planted with this plan. It was also possible to obtain
   some clues about the planning approach of the Prost period from this
   plan. Accordingly, it can be listed as opening squares, turning dead-end
   streets into streets, widening the streets, and cleansing
   industrial-related spaces from the coastline. The fact that these plan
   decisions are encountered in other regions of Istanbul during the Prost
   period, suggests that although Prost did not draw the 1939 plan, it had
   a share in its design.
   Research Limitations/Implications
   Due to the lack of a clear aerial photograph or map after 1939 until
   1955, the year in which the changes foreseen in this plan were applied
   could not be determined clearly, and the time interval was stated.
   Originality/Value
   This plan, being one of the first steps of the Bosphorus coastal
   regulations on the European side, is an original document that has not
   been evaluated in previous research. This plan was drawn when Henri
   Prost was working as an urban planning specialist in the Istanbul
   Municipality Zoning Directorate and it bears the signature of Prost's
   approval.}},

Abstract = {{The problem raised in the study is also due to the lack of a common
   conceptual framework explaining the conditionality of foreign students'
   realization by subjective characteristics. The purpose of the paper is
   to present and analyze the results of an empirical study of
   self-attitude indicators as subject predictors of students'
   self-realization in a foreign cultural environment. The study was
   conducted in 2019-20 among students of the Peoples' Friendship
   University of Russia getting undergraduate and Master's degrees in
   Humanities. 412 respondents aged 18-25 took part in the survey. The
   authors used ``Multidimensional questionnaire of self-identity{''}
   method by S. I. Kudinov; ``Test - questionnaire of self-attitude{''}
   method by V. V. Stolin, S. R. Panteleev; the self-assessment diagnostic
   technique by Dembo-Rubinstein in A. M. Prikhozhan's modification;
   ``Individual preferences of self-expression sphere{''} questionnaire by
   S. S. Kudinov; methods of mathematical and statistical analysis
   (descriptive statistics, cluster analysis, K. Pearson's correlation
   analysis, factor analysis, the program of standard statistical package
   ``Statistica-7.0{''}. In the course of an empirical study of students in
   a multinational university it was found that the respondents'
   self-realization is carried out mainly in the course of educational
   activities. As a result of cluster analysis, three groups of respondents
   with dominant indicators of self-attitude have been identified, which
   were conventionally designated as positive-stable, negative-rigid and
   socially dependent type of self-attitude. It is determined that
   respondents with a positive-stable type of self-attitude demonstrate
   most successful self-fulfillment due to the expression of such personal
   qualities as self-acceptance, self-confidence, faith in their
   possibilities and abilities, self-management. At the same time, the
   greatest difficulties in self-realization are experienced by students
   with a socially dependent type of self-attitude, due to low self-esteem,
   external self-regulation and constant expectation that others would
   evaluate their activities, actions and reactions.}},

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION: In contrast to most colorectal carcinomas arising from
   pedunculated or sessile protruded adenomas, submucosal-invasive (pT1)
   colorectal carcinoma exhibiting a depressed surface (hereinafter,
   ``depressed colorectal carcinoma,{''} identified by means of
   high-definition endoscopy) is considered to be derived from depressed
   precursors. We hypothesized that depressed colorectal neoplasms have
   unique clinicopathological features different that are different from
   those of protruded and flat colorectal neoplasms.
   METHODS: We classified 27,129 colorectal neoplasms (909 pT1 carcinomas
   and 26,220 adenomas) resected between 2001 and 2017 into depressed (211
   carcinomas and 109 adenomas), flat (304 carcinomas and 11,246 adenomas),
   and protruded subtypes (394 carcinomas and 14,865 adenomas) and compared
   their clinicopathological features. As exploratory analyses of pT1
   carcinomas, we conducted whole-exome sequencing for 19 depressed and 8
   protruded subtypes and RNA sequencing for 8 depressed and 8 protruded
   subtypes.
   RESULTS: pT1 carcinomas were more common in depressed lesions (66\%)
   than in protruded (2.6\%) and flat lesions (2.6\%) (P < 0.001). Compared
   with nondepressed pT1 carcinomas, depressed pT1 carcinomas were
   positively correlated with lymphovascular invasion, tumor budding, and
   massive submucosal invasion and inversely correlated with the presence
   of an adenoma component (all P < 0.001). Depressed adenomas were more
   likely to contain high-grade dysplasia than nondepressed adenomas (49\%
   vs 11\%, P < 0.001). A KRAS mutation was observed only in one of the 19
   depressed pT1 carcinomas. Relative to protruded carcinomas, depressed
   carcinomas generally exhibited higher expression of genes related to
   angiogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
   DISCUSSION: Depressed colorectal neoplasms may harbor a unique
   combination of malignant histopathological phenotypes and molecular
   features.}},

   metabolism, showed the same localization as that of indoleamine
   2,3-dioxygenase-1 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-2, suggesting these
   are functional enzymes. Interferon-gamma added to placental villous
   explant culture markedly stimulated expression level of both mRNA and
   immunoreactivity of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1. The different
   cellular expression and interferon-gamma sensitivity of these enzymes at
   the maternal-fetal interface suggests distinct physiological roles for
   each enzyme in normal human viviparity.}},

Abstract = {{The layers of a high-temperature novel GaAs:Fe diluted magnetic
   semiconductor (DMS) with an average Fe content up to 20 at. \% were
   grown on (001) i-GaAs substrates using a pulsed laser deposition in a
   vacuum. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive
   x-ray spectroscopy investigations revealed that the conductive layers
   obtained at 180 and 200 oC are epitaxial, do not contain any
   second-phase inclusions, but contain the Fe-enriched columnar regions of
   overlapped microtwins. The TEM investigations of the non-conductive
   layer obtained at 250 oC revealed the embedded coherent Fe-rich clusters
   of GaAs:Fe DMS. The x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy investigations
   showed that Fe atoms form chemical bonds with Ga and As atoms with
   almost equal probability and thus the comparable number of Fe atoms
   substitute on Ga and As sites. The n-type conductivity of the obtained
   conductive GaAs:Fe layers is apparently associated with electron
   transport in a Fe acceptor impurity band within the GaAs band gap. A
   hysteretic negative magnetoresistance (MR) was observed in the
   conductive layers up to room temperature (RT). MR measurements point to
   the out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy of the conductive GaAs:Fe layers
   related to the presence of the columnar regions. The studies of the
   magnetic circular dichroism confirm that the layers obtained at 180, 200
   and 250 oC are intrinsic ferromagnetic semiconductors and the Curie
   point can reach up to at least RT in case of the conductive layer
   obtained at 200 oC. It was suggested that in heavily Fe-doped GaAs
   layers the ferromagnetism is related to the Zener double exchange
   between Fe atoms with different valence states via an intermediate As
   and Ga atom.}},

Abstract = {{Difficulties in learning (and thus teaching) statistical inference are
   well reported in the literature. We argue the problem emanates not only
   from the way in which statistical inference is taught but also from what
   exactly is taught as statistical inference. What makes statistical
   inference difficult to understand is that it contains two logics that
   operate in opposite directions. There is a certain logic in the
   construction of the inference framework, and there is another in its
   application. The logic of construction commences from the population,
   reaches the sample through some steps and then comes back to the
   population by building and using the sampling distribution. The logic of
   application, on the other hand, starts from the sample and reaches the
   population by making use of the sampling distribution. The main problem
   in teaching statistical inference in our view is that students are
   taught the logic of application while the fundamental steps in the
   direction of construction are often overlooked. In this study, we
   examine and compare these two logics and argue that introductory
   statistical courses would benefit from using the direction of
   construction, which ensures that students internalize the way in which
   inference framework makes sense, rather than that of application.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: In this study, we assessed the effect of question type and
   answer options on support for lowering nicotine levels in cigarettes to
   make them less addictive. Methods: We surveyed 540 US adults using Prime
   Panels. Participants randomly received: (1) one of 2 Likert-type
   questions and (2) a forced-choice question on a range of policy options,
   with responses in one of 2 orders. Generalized linear models examined
   policy support using a latent outcome variable. Results: Overall, 53\%
   of smokers and 77\%-81\% of former/never smokers supported the policy.
   With Likert questions, support was higher when `support' options were
   presented first; with the forced-choice question, there were no answer
   order effects. Few smokers (21\%) supported the policy consistently,
   compared to 47\% of former and 52\% of never smokers. In the
   multivariate latent model, current smokers (b = -0.13, 95\% CI: -0.24,
   -0.02) and former smokers (b = -0.48, 95\% CI: -0.58, -0.38) were
   significantly less likely to support the low nicotine policy compared to
   never smokers. Conclusions: Survey design, including question type and
   the response order, resulted in a substantial difference in participant
   responses. Better and multiple questions may be needed before drawing
   conclusions about mandatory reduced nicotine cigarettes support,

Abstract = {{Objective: To compare rates of ocular hypertension (OHT) in eyes
   receiving 40 mg sub-Tenon triamcinolone (STT), 0.7 mg dexamethasone
   implant (DEX), and 2 mg intravitreal triamcinolone (IVT).
   Methods: This study is a single-centre, retrospective case series. All
   patients receiving STT and DEX between 4/1/2014 and 3/1/2017 and IVT
   between 3/1/2012 and 3/1/2017 with a minimum of 3 months' follow-up were
   included. OHT was defined as an intraocular pressure (IOP) >24 mm Hg.
   Patients receiving any other form of topical, oral, or intravitreal
   steroid were excluded.
   Results: 113 eyes from 104 patients in the STT group, 122 eyes from 109
   patients in the DEX group, and 109 eyes from 103 patients in the IVT
   group were included. The mean number of injections for each eye was 1.7
   in the STT group, 2.6 for the DEX group, and 2.8 for the IVT group (p <
   0.001). Twenty eyes (17.7\%) developed OHT in the STT group, 19 eyes
   (15.6\%) developed OHT in the DEX group, and 14 eyes (12.8\%) developed
   OHT in the IVT group (p = 0.60). IOP was controlled in all eyes with
   observation, topical IOP-lowering medication, or surgical intervention.
   The rate of incisional glaucoma surgery was 1.7\% in the STT group,
   1.6\% in the DEX group, and 0\% in the IVT group (p = 0.55).
   Conclusions: The rate of OHT was similar across treatment groups. The
   proportion of OHT in patients with a history of glaucoma was no
   different from that in patients without a history of glaucoma. All cases
   were successfully managed with observation, medical treatment, or
   incisional surgery.}},

Abstract = {{The article describes an elaboration of the X-in-the-loop (XiL) testing
   environment for a thermal management system (TMS) intended for the
   traction electric drive of an electric vehicle, which has each of its
   wheels driven by an in-wheel motor. The TMS features the individual
   thermal regulation of each electric drive using a hydraulic layout with
   parallel pipelines and electrohydraulic pumps embedded into them. The
   XiL system is intended as a tool for studying and developing the TMS
   design and controls. It consists of the virtual part and the physical
   part. The former simulates the vehicle operating in a driving cycle with
   the heat power dissipated by the electric drive components, which
   entails the change in their temperature regimes. The physical part
   includes the TMS itself consisting of a radiator, pipelines, and pumps.
   The physical part also features devices intended for simulation of the
   electric drive components in terms of their thermal and hydraulic
   behaviors, as well as devices that simulate airflow induced by the
   vehicle motion. Bilateral, real-time interactions are established
   between the two said parts combining them into a cohesive system, which
   models the studied electric vehicle and its components. The article
   gives a description of a laboratory setup, which implements the XiL
   environment including the mathematical models, hardware devices, as well
   as the control loops that establish the interaction of those components.
   An example of using this system in a driving cycle test shows the
   interaction between its parts and operation of the TMS in conditions
   simulated in both virtual and physical domains. The results constitute
   calculated and measured quantities including vehicle speed, operating
   parameters of the electric drives, coolant and air flow rates, and
   temperatures of the system components.}},

Abstract = {{ZrO2 (Zirconia) nanoparticles (NPs), PANI (polyaniline), and ZrO2/PANI
   nanocomposites (NCs) were successfully synthesized using CTAB
   (Hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide) and SDS (Sodium dodecyl sulfate)
   surfactants by following the co-precipitation method. The structural
   phase analysis of as-prepared, annealed nanoparticles, and
   nanocomposites was done using the XRD (x-ray diffraction) technique. The
   crystallite size of pure SDS and CTAB assisted ZrO2 NPS comes out to be
   19 and 17 nm, respectively. After the formation of NCs, the size has
   been reduced to 15.7 and 15.9 nm, respectively for the same samples. The
   effect of surfactants on the dye adsorption mechanism was studied using
   XRD and UV-vis spectroscopy. The prepared NPs and NCs were utilized as
   an adsorbent for the removal of organic dye methylene blue (MB) which is
   used as a model compound. UV-vis spectra of the supernatant solution
   were taken and studied to detect the relative decrease in the dye
   concentration with time. The as-prepared CTAB assisted ZrO2/PANI NCs
   show higher adsorption activity than annealed CTAB assisted ZrO2/PANI
   whereas a reversal trend in the adsorption activity was observed for
   SDS-assisted ZrO2/PANI NCs. Various kinetic models were implemented and
   correlated to the experimental data to elucidate the working mechanism
   for dye adsorption and to set up, a relation in the adsorption activity
   of surfactant modified NPs and NCs.}},

Abstract = {{Lynch syndrome is a prevalent hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome.
   While colorectal cancer is the most common gastrointestinal (GI) cancer
   in Lynch syndrome, there is also increased risk of gastric and small
   intestinal cancers. Recommendations for upper GI cancer surveillance in
   Lynch syndrome vary widely with limited data supporting effectiveness.
   Herein, we collected data on individuals with a diagnosis of Lynch
   syndrome seen at our tertiary care referral center. We identified
   individuals who underwent upper endoscopy and those with upper GI
   cancers, and associated demographics, genetic testing results, and
   endoscopic information. Standard statistical analyses were performed.
   Among 295 individuals with Lynch syndrome seen at our center, 217
   (73.6\%) underwent 660 total upper endoscopies. Of these 217,
   precancerous upper endoscopy findings included Barrett's esophagus (7,
   3.2\%), gastric intestinal metaplasia (18, 8.3\%), and duodenal adenomas
   (4, 1.8\%), and Helicobacter pylori was identified in 6 (2.8\%). Upper
   GI cancers were diagnosed in 11 individuals (3.7\%), including
   esophageal in 1, gastric in 6, and duodenal in 4. Five (1.7\%) of these
   upper GI cancers were identified on surveillance. Individuals with upper
   GI cancers identified on surveillance were older at first surveillance
   endoscopy, with median age 63.3 versus 44.9 years (P < 0.001). Of the
   upper GI cancers detected on surveillance, 80\% (4/5) occurred within 2
   years of last upper endoscopy and 80\% were stage I. In conclusion,
   upper endoscopy surveillance in Lynch syndrome identifies upper GI
   cancers. For individuals with Lynch syndrome who undergo upper GI
   surveillance, a short surveillance interval may be warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Signal estimation at the antenna is a major challenge of the antenna
   array structure because the received signals have different directions.
   Therefore, in this paper, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied to the
   uniform circular array for the optimization of array structure in regard
   to its geometry. On the optimized array structure, four different
   algorithms (Estimation of Signal Parameter via Rotational Invariance
   Technique - ESPRIT, First Order Forward Prediction - FOFP, Beamscan, and
   Multiple Signal Classification - MUSIC) have been implemented in order
   to estimate the signal direction accurately with quick estimation time.
   The accuracy has been calculated with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
   indices. From the experimental analysis, it has been found that the
   performance of the ESPRIT algorithm is better than the others in terms
   of accuracy and estimation time.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose some alternative formulations and estimation of
   technical and allocative inefficiency in the presence of some exogenous
   variables in the context of a panel stochastic frontier model which
   includes time-invariant firm effects (heterogeneity) along with
   time-varying technical inefficiency and random noise. These exogenous
   variables are used to explain technical and allocative inefficiency as
   well as firm heterogeneity. The presence of these exogenous variables
   allows us to relax some of the assumptions made in a recent paper by Lai
   and Kumbhakar (2019). These variables also allow to add flexibility in
   estimating the model parameters as well as both technical and allocative
   inefficiency and costs therefrom. More specifically, the incidental
   parameters problem associated with firm heterogeneity in the production
   function as well in the first-order conditions of cost minimization can
   be avoided by parameterizing them in terms of the exogenous variables.
   We propose and implement model comparison based on Bayes factors and
   marginal likelihood. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate the epidemiological status of diabetes mellitus
   (DM)-related complications in Japan. Methods: The subjects were 3.11
   million Japanese individuals who were registered in the Japanese claim
   database between 2005 and 2014. Subjects with a diagnosis associated
   with codes related to DM and/or DM-related complications as classified
   by the International Classification of Diseases version 10 and those who
   were prescribed any therapeutic agents for DM were considered to have
   DM. The status of ocular, renal, and neural complications was
   investigated. Results: A total of 66,923 patients with DM were included.
   The prevalence of subjects with DM was 3.8\% in 2005 and 4.2\% in 2014.
   The most frequent complication was diabetic retinopathy (23.6\%, 95\%
   CI: 21.7-25.5\%), followed by diabetic nephropathy (14.8\%, 95\% CI:
   14.0-15.6\%) and diabetic neuropathy (4.9\%, 95\% CI: 4.5-5.3\%). Among
   the subjects with ocular complications, 1.8\% had proliferative diabetic
   retinopathy, 1.1\% had diabetic macular edema (DME), 0.3\% had
   neovascular glaucoma, and 1.5\% had vitreous hemorrhage. Only DME
   significantly increased during the study period. The frequencies of the
   ocular and neural complications significantly decreased, while that of
   renal complications significantly increased during the study period.
   Conclusions: Ocular complications were the most common DM-related major
   complications in Japan. Notably, DME significantly increased in recent
   years.}},

Abstract = {{The green mussel (Perna viridis) is one of the most
   commercially-important cultured species along the coast of Thailand. In
   this study, a suitable aquaculture site-selection model (SASSM) was
   developed to identify the most suitable areas in the inner part of the
   Gulf of Thailand (InnerGoT) for green mussel culture. Satellite-derived
   chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and hydrodynamic model outputs for sea surface
   temperature (SST), salinity, maximum water current (MWC), and bathymetry
   between 2018 and 2019 were used as input to the SASSM. The results show
   that suitability scores in mussel aquaculture areas were lowest (1-3)
   during the Southwest (SW) monsoon, rainy season (July-August), and
   highest (6-7) during the Northeast (NE) monsoon, cold season
   (November-December). Moderate suitability scores (4-5) were obtained
   during the monsoon transition from the NE monsoon to the SW monsoon,
   summer (April-May). The study area was further divided into three zones:
   the western, central, and eastern regions. The western and eastern parts
   showed high suitability scores (5-7) while the central zone exhibited
   low suitability scores (2-4). The model results show a similar pattern
   to the actual mussel production in the study area. Seasonal events
   (i.e., flood and dry seasons) were incorporated into the model to
   examine the seasonal effects on the suitable mussel aquaculture areas.
   The suitability scores during the SW monsoon in 2018 were more sensitive
   to changes in SST and salinity relative to 2019. The higher freshwater
   discharge and lower temperature in 2018 relative to 2019 resulted in the
   accrual of suitable aquaculture areas. This pattern is consistent with
   the productions of the green mussel, where higher production was
   recorded in 2018 (2002.5 t) than in 2019 (410.8 t). However,
   correlations among atmospheric (air temperature, rainfall, and wind) and
   oceanographic factors (SST and MWC) were significant in the western and
   central regions, suggesting that the suitability of green mussel
   aquaculture in these regions is vulnerable to environmental
   disturbances. Thus, the SASSM can be a powerful tool in providing useful
   information on spatial management for marine aquaculture in
   environmentally-dynamic coastal systems.}},

Abstract = {{The C57BL/6J (B6J) mouse strain has been widely used as a control strain
   for the study of metabolic diseases and diet induced obesity (DIO). B6J
   mice carry a spontaneous deletion mutation in the nicotinamide
   nucleotide transhydrogenase ( Nnt ) gene eliminating exons 7-11,
   resulting in expression of a truncated form of Nnt , an enzyme that
   pumps protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. It has been
   proposed that this mutation in B6J mice is associated with epigonadal
   fat mass and altered sensitivity to diet induced obesity. To define the
   role of Nnt in the development of diet induced obesity, we generated
   first backcross (BC1) hybrids of wild type Nnt C57BL/6NTac and mutated
   Nnt C57BL/6JRj {[}(C57BL/6NTacxC57BL/6JRj)F1xC57BL/6NTac]. Body weight
   gain and specific fat-pad depot mass were measured in BC1 hybrids under
   high fat diet conditions. Both sexes of BC1 hybrids indicate that mice
   with Nnt wild type allele are highly sensitive to DIO and exhibit higher
   relative fat mass. In summary, our data indicate that the Nnt mutation
   in mice is associated with sensitivity to DIO and fat mass.}},

Abstract = {{Cryptographic co-processors are integral to the modern System-on-Chips.
   Flexibility in such designs serves dual purpose, i.e., it enables
   acceleration of different essential cryptographic primitives
   (Encryption/Authentication/Pseudo Random Number Generation (PRNG)) and
   also results in design compaction via resource sharing. In this context,
   a novel resource-shared crypto-coprocessor, named AE\$HA-3 is presented,
   which combines two National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
   standardized algorithms, i.e., Advance Encryption Standard (AES) and
   Secure Hash Algorithm-3 (SHA-3). Due to algorithmic dissimilarities, so
   far no resource-shared implementation enabling AES key scheduling/
   enc/dec and SHA-3 has been presented. AE\$HA-3 exploits resource-sharing
   for area reduction, i.e., integration of Look-Up-Tables (I-Tables) for
   AES enc/dec; logical optimization of Six Input Equation (SixIE) for
   SHA-3; a Unified XOR Section to carry out both key whitening in AES and
   SHA-3 transformations. Furthermore, the AES key scheduling was performed
   using the same resource-shared hardware. The proposed AE\$HA-3 on Xilinx
   Virtex FPGA family results in highest hardware efficiency in terms of
   Throughput per Slice (TPS), along with a 49.37\% area consumption
   reduction, when compared against the smallest stand-alone
   implementations presented to date.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Increasing the total protein content and reducing the casein
   to whey ratio in milks consumed with breakfast cereal reduce
   postprandial blood glucose (BG).
   Objectives: We aimed to explore associations between plasma amino acids
   (AAs), BG, and glucoregulatory hormones.
   Methods: In this repeated-measures design, 12 healthy adults consumed
   cereal (58 g) and milks (250 mL) with 3.1 wt\% or high 9.3 wt\% protein
   concentrations and with casein to whey ratios of either 80:20 or 40:60.
   Blood was collected at 0, 30, 60, 120, 140, 170, and 200 min for
   measurement of the primary outcome, BG, and for the exploratory outcomes
   such as plasma AA, gastric emptying, insulin (INS), and glucoregulatory
   hormones. Measures were made prior to and after an ad libitum lunch at
   120 min. Exploratory correlations were conducted to determine
   associations between outcomes.
   Results: Pre-lunch plasma AA groups {[}total (TAA), essential (EAA),
   BCAA, and nonessential (NEAA)] were higher after 9.3 wt\% than 3.1 wt\%
   milks by 12.7\%, 21.4\%, 20.9\%, and 7.6\%, respectively (P = 0.05),
   while post-lunch AA groups were higher by 10.9\%, 19.8\%, 18.8\%, and
   6.0\%, respectively (P <= 0.05). Except for NEAA, pre-lunch AAs were
   higher after 40:60 than 80:20 ratio milks by 4.5\%, 8.3\%, and 9.3\% (P
   <= 0.05). When pooled by all treatments, pre-lunch AA groups associated
   negatively with BG (r/rho >= -0.45, P <= 0.05), but post-lunch only TAA
   and NEAA correlated (r >= -0.37, P < 0.05). Pre-lunch BG was inversely
   associated with Leu, Ile, Lys, Met, Thr, Cys-Cys, Asn, and Gln (r/rho >=
   -0.46, P <= 0.05), but post-lunch, only with Thr, Ala, and Gly (r >=
   -0.50, P <= 0.05). Pre-lunch associations between AA groups and INS were
   not found.
   Conclusions: Protein concentration and the ratio of casein to whey in
   milks consumed at breakfast with cereal affect plasma AA concentrations
   and their associations with decreased BG. The decrease in BG could be
   explained by INSindependent mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2VO) in rodents
   induces chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, mimicking vascular dementia in
   elderly people. It causes inflammation and oxidative stress, leading to
   neuronal loss in the hippocampus, white matter injuries and impairments
   of spatial learning and memory. Thai Herbal Sahatsatara formula (STF)
   has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions which might protect
   neurons and white matter. This experiment was to investigate the
   possible protective effects of STE. Twenty-eight middle-aged male Wistar
   rats (12 months old) were divided into 4 groups: Sham+sterile water
   (SW), 2VO+SW, 2VO+STF300 and 2VO+STF1000. All animals daily received
   either SW, STF 300 mg/kg or STF 1000 mg/kg orally after 2VO induction
   until the end of the experiment. Spatial learning and memory test were
   examined after 2VO induction for 60 days whereas the numbers of
   hippocampal neurons and white matter changes in the corpus callosum were
   investigated after the end of the behavioral test. Chronic cerebral
   hypoperfusion significantly caused spatial learning and memory deficits
   and white matter injuries in the corpus callosum while the numbers of
   hippocampal neurons were not significantly affected. STF (1000 mg/kg)
   attenuated the impairments of spatial learning and learning flexibility
   and white matter injuries. This is the first study to demonstrate the
   ability of Sahatsatara formula to attenuate spatial learning and
   learning flexibility impairments after chronic cerebral hypoperfusion by
   protecting the white matter in the corpus callosum. The results support
   the potential application of Sahatsatara formula against chronic
   cerebral hypoperfusion.}},

Abstract = {{There is no proven medical therapy to inhibit the progression of
   abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in the clinical setting. To develop a
   novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of AAA, we focused on
   vaccination targeting Ang II (angiotensin II) and assessed the effect of
   an Ang II peptide vaccine on the progression of AAA using a rat model.
   Ang II peptide was conjugated with KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin)
   carrier protein to induce a sufficient immune response. Male rats were
   subcutaneously immunized with Ang II-KLH with an adjuvant on days 0, 14,
   and 28. Aortic dilatation was induced by intraluminal incubation with
   elastase on day 35. Treatment with Ang II vaccine successfully induced
   the production of a high titer of anti-Ang II antibodies. Immunization
   with Ang II vaccine resulted in a significant reduction in expansion of
   the aortic diameter compared with control rats, without a blood
   pressure-lowering effect. Four weeks after operation, the increase in
   Ang II in the aneurysm wall was significantly inhibited by treatment
   with Ang II vaccine. Inhibition of Ang II action led to suppression of
   the inflammatory response in the AAA wall through attenuation of the NF
   kappa B (nuclear factor kappa B) and c-jun N-terminal kinase signaling
   cascades. Treatment with Ang II vaccine inhibited accumulation of
   macrophages in the AAA wall. In addition, expression of TNF-alpha (tumor
   necrosis factor alpha) and activation of MMP (matrix
   metalloproteinase)-2 and MMP-9 were also inhibited by treatment with Ang
   II vaccine, resulting in protection against the destruction of elastic
   fibers. This vaccine therapy could become a potent therapeutic option to
   treat patients with AAA.}},

   that the accuracy in determining the impact parameter at the attainable
   energy resolution of the hadron calorimeter is inadequate for using the
   calorimeter in the MPD/NICA and CBM/FAIR projects. The error is as large
   as 35\% at the beam energy of 2.5 GeV even for peripheral collisions.
   Secondary processes during the motion of spectators through a nucleus
   make an additional contribution to the error for central and mid-central
   collisions.}},

Abstract = {{The recovery of zinc and lead from Yahyali non-sulphide flotation
   tailing using sulfuric acid followed by sodium hydroxide leaching in the
   presence of potassium sodium tartrate was experimentally investigated.
   In the acidic leaching stage, the effects of pH, solid-to-liquid ratio
   and temperature on the dissolution of zinc from the tailing were
   explored. 82.3\% Zn dissolution was achieved at a pH of 2, a temperature
   of 40 degrees C, a solid-to-liquid ratio of 20\% and a leaching time of
   2 h, whereas the iron and lead dissolutions were determined to be less
   than 0.5\%. The sulfuric acid consumption was found to be 110.6 kg/t
   (dry tailing). The leaching temperature had no beneficial effect on the
   dissolution of zinc from the tailing. The acidic leach solution was
   subjected to an electrowinning test. The cathode product consisted of
   99.8\% Zn and 0.15\% Fe. In the alkaline leaching stage, the Pb
   dissolution increased slightly in the presence of potassium sodium
   tartrate. More than 60\% of Pb was taken into the leach solution when
   the leaching temperature increased from 40 to 80 degrees C. The final
   leach residue was analyzed by XRD and XRF. The XRD results indicated
   that the major peaks originated from the goethite and quartz while minor
   peaks stem from smithsonite and cemssite. The XRF analysis demonstrated
   that the residue contained 70.3\% iron oxide. Based on the sequential
   leaching experiments, the zinc and lead were excellently depleted from
   the flotation tailing, leaving a considerable amount of iron in the
   final residue.}},

   The study design applied in this research was a survey method with a
   quantitative approach to help understand the relationship between
   variables. This study used a convenience random sampling technique to
   collect the information of students in several state universities in
   Indonesia. The participants of this study were students in the second
   and third-year study who enrolled in the course of entrepreneurship and
   education and actively participated in programs of entrepreneurship.
   This investigation confirms four hypotheses and rejects the two
   hypotheses proposed. In more detail, entrepreneurship education
   successfully influences entrepreneurial self-efficacy and students'
   attitudes toward entrepreneurship. However, it failed in promoting
   students' intention of being an entrepreneur. On the other hand,
   entrepreneurial self-efficacy has an impact on entrepreneurial attitude,
   while entrepreneurial attitude does not influence on students'
   entrepreneurial intentions. Lastly, from this study, it showed that
   entrepreneurial attitude insufficient in mediating entrepreneurship

Title = {{Evaluation of Cognitive Performance following Fish-Oil and Curcumin

Abstract = {{Background: Obesity accelerates age-related cognitive decline, which is
   partly mediated by vascular dysfunction.
   Objective: The aim was to test the hypothesis that supplementation with
   fish oil and curcumin can enhance cognitive performance by improving
   cerebral circulatory function in overweight or obese middle-aged to
   older adults.
   Methods: In a 16-wk double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention trial,
   adults {[}50-80 y; BMI (kg/m(2)): 25-40] were randomly assigned to
   either fish oil (2000 mg/d DHA + 400 mg/d EPA), curcumin (160 mg/d), or
   a combination. Effects on cerebrovascular function (primary outcome) and
   cardiovascular risk factors were reported previously. Effects on
   cognitive performance and cerebrovascular responsiveness (CVR) to
   cognitive stimuli are reported herein. One-factor ANOVA with post hoc
   analyses was conducted between groups in the whole cohort and in males
   and females separately. Two-factor ANOVA was conducted to assess
   independent effects of fish oil and curcumin and a potential
   interaction. Correlations between outcomes (those obtained herein and
   previously reported) were also examined.
   Results: Compared with placebo, fish oil improved CVR to a processing
   speed test (4.4\% +/- 1.9\% vs. -2.2\% +/- 2.1\%; P = 0.023) and
   processing speed in males only (Z-score: 0.6 +/- 0.2 vs. 0.1 +/- 0.2; P
   = 0.043). Changes in processing speed correlated inversely with changes
   in blood pressure (R = -0.243, P = 0.006) and C-reactive protein (R =
   -0.183, P = 0.046). Curcumin improved CVR in a working memory test
   (3.6\% +/- 1.2\% vs. -0.2\% +/- 0.2\%, P = 0.026) and, in males only,
   performance of a verbal memory test compared with placebo (Z-score: 0.2
   +/- 0.1 vs. -0.5 +/- 0.2, P = 0.039). Combining fish oil with curcumin
   did not produce additional benefits.
   Conclusions: Improvements in processing speed following fish-oil
   supplementation in middle-aged to older males might be mediated by
   improvements in circulatory function. Mechanisms underlying the
   cognitive benefit seen with curcumin are unknown. As cognitive benefits
   were found in males only, further evaluation of sex differences in
   responsiveness to supplementation is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE In patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH),
   poor outcomes have been shown to be correlated with subsequent cerebral
   vasospasm (CV) and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). The identification
   of novel biomarkers may aid in the prediction of which patients are
   vulnerable to developing vasospasm, cerebral ischemia, and neurological
   deterioration.
   METHODS In this prospective clinical study at North Shore University
   Hospital, patients with aSAH or normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) with
   external ventricular drains were enrolled. The concentration of
   macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in CSF was assessed for
   correlation with CV or DCI, the primary outcome measures.
   RESULTS Twenty-five patients were enrolled in the aSAH group and 9 were
   enrolled in the NPH group. There was a significant increase in aggregate
   CSF MIF concentration in patients with aSAH versus those with NPH (24.4
   +/- 19.2 vs 2.3 +/- 1.1 ng/ml, p < 0.0002). Incidence of the day of peak
   MIF concentration significantly correlated with the onset of clinical
   vasospasm (rho = 0.778, p < 0.0010). MIF concentrations were
   significantly elevated in patients with versus those without evidence of
   DCI (18.7 +/- 4.93 vs 8.86 +/- 1.28 ng/ml, respectively, p < 0.0025).
   There was a significant difference in MIF concentrations between
   patients with infection versus those without infection (16.43 +/- 4.21
   vs 8.5 +/- 1.22 ng/ml, respectively, p < 0.0119).
   CONCLUSIONS Preliminary evidence from this study suggests that CSF
   concentrations of MIF are correlated with CV and DCI. These results,
   however, could be confounded in the presence of clinical infection. A
   study with a larger patient sample size is necessary to corroborate
   these findings.}},

Title = {{Forest degradation impacts firewood consumption patterns: A case study
   in the buffer zone of Inlay Lake Biosphere Reserve, Myanmar}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Firewood is a major energy source, especially in developing countries.
   Because firewood is often collected from forest, forest quality may
   affect firewood consumption patterns. Here, we evaluated the impact of
   forest degradation on firewood consumption patterns in a rural area of
   Myanmar. Household interviews were conducted for a total of 143
   households from 20 villages, and per capita consumption rates for each
   household were calculated. The per capita consumption rates of
   households that only used firewood for cooking were regressed against
   several potentially important factors, including an index of forest
   degradation. Approximately 85\% of sample households used firewood for
   cooking. The average per capita annual firewood consumption rate for
   cooking was 530 kg for households that used exclusively firewood for
   cooking. The regression analysis clearly showed that open forest area
   ratio, an indicator of forest degradation, had a negative effect on per
   capita annual firewood consumption rate. In addition to open forest
   ratio, household size, elevation, and the consumption rate of firewood
   for drying cigar leaves were strongly related to per capita annual
   firewood consumption rate. However, the nearest distance to forest had a
   weak relationship with per capita annual firewood consumption, although
   previous studies have suggested that the nearest distance to forest
   negatively affects the firewood consumption rate. Combined with previous
   studies showing that fuelwood collection causes forest degradation, we
   conclude that forest degradation and decreases in firewood consumption
   mutually affected each other. Additional studies are needed to assess
   the role of forest degradation in maintaining local livelihoods. (C)

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL STABILITY AND DYNAMICS}},

Number = {{13, SI}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The importance of allowing for the many different types of structural
   interaction that have an effect on the performance of light gauge
   members when used in practical situations is emphasized. A distinction
   is drawn between internal interactions involving the various plate
   elements of the steel profiles and external interactions involving the
   other components in the system. Although full-scale testing of
   representative systems can capture this behavior, the costs involved
   make this an impractical general basis for design; codified methods
   generally consider only isolated plates within members and isolated
   members within systems, thereby neglecting the potentially beneficial
   effects of both forms of interaction. Properly used, modern methods of
   numerical analysis offer the potential to systematically allow for both
   forms of interaction - provided the numerical models used have been
   adequately validated against suitable tests. The use of such an approach
   is explained and illustrated for three commonly used structural systems:
   roof purlins, floor beams, and columns in stud walls. In each case, it
   is shown that, provided sufficient care is taken, the numerical approach
   can yield accurate predictions of the observed test behavior. The
   subsequently generated large portfolio of numerical results can then
   provide clear insights into the exact nature of the various interactions
   and, thus, form the basis for more realistic design approaches that are
   both more accurate in their predictions and which lead to more economic
   designs. Building on this, modifying existing arrangements so as to
   yield superior performance through specific modifications is now
   possible. Two such examples, one in which improved interconnection
   between the components in a system is investigated and a second in which
   prestressing is shown to provide substantial enhancement for relatively
   small and simple changes, are presented.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{275}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A multi-stack pushdown system is a natural model of concurrent programs.
   The basic verification problems are undecidable and a common trend is to
   consider under-approximations of the system behaviors to gain
   decidability. In this paper, we restrict the semantics such that a
   symbol that is pushed onto a stack scan be popped only within a given
   number of contexts involving s, i.e., we bound the scope (in terms of
   number of contexts) of matching push and pop transitions. This
   restriction permits runs with unboundedly many contexts even between
   matching push and pop transitions (for systems with at least three
   stacks). We call the resulting model a multi-stack pushdown system with
   scope-bounded matching relations(SMPDS). We show that the configuration
   reachability and the location reachability problems for SMPDS are both
   PSPACE-complete, and that the set of the reachable configurations can be
   captured by a finite automaton. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {{CATALYSTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In view of the development of efficient processes for the synthesis of
   high-value compounds, the combination of bio- and chemocatalysis is
   highly promising. In addition, implementation of immobilized catalysts
   into continuous setups allows a straightforward separation of the target
   compound from the reaction mixture and ensures uniform product quality.
   In this work, we report the optimization of a chemoenzymatic tandem
   reaction in continuous flow and its extended application for the
   synthesis of pharmacologically active resveratrol and pterostilbene. The
   tandem reaction involves enzymatic decarboxylation of coumaric acid
   employing encapsulated phenolic acid decarboxylase from B. subtilis and
   a Heck coupling of the obtained vinylphenol with an aryl iodide using
   heterogeneous Pd-Ce-Sn oxides implemented in a packed bed reactor. By
   optimization of the reaction conditions for the limiting cross-coupling
   step, the yield of (E)-4-hydroxystilbene using the fully continuous
   setup could be more than doubled compared to previous work. Furthermore,
   the improved chemoenzymatic cascade could also be applied to the
   synthesis of resveratrol and pterostilbene in a continuous fashion.
   Leaching of the metal catalyst at high temperatures limited the process
   in many perspectives. Therefore, the feasibility of a reactor setup with
   reversed flow was experimentally evaluated and approved.}},

Abstract = {{Throughout an animal's life, species may occupy different environments
   and exhibit distinct life stages, known as ontogenetic shifts. The life
   histories of most sharks (class: Chondrichthyes) are characterized by
   these ontogenetic shifts, which can be defined by changes in habitat and
   diet as well as behavioral changes at the onset of sexual maturity. In
   addition, fishes experience indeterminate growth, whereby the brain and
   body grow throughout the organism's life. Despite a presupposed lifelong
   neurogenesis in sharks, very little work has been done on ontogenetic
   changes in the brain, which may be informative about functional shifts
   in sensory and behavioral specializations. This study quantified changes
   in brain-body scaling and the scaling of six major brain regions
   (olfactory bulbs, telencephalon, diencephalon, optic tectum, cerebellum,
   and medulla oblongata) throughout ontogeny in the Atlantic sharpnose
   shark, Rhizoprio-nodon terraenovae. As documented in other fishes, brain
   size increased significantly with body mass throughout ontogeny in this
   species, with the steepest period of growth in early life. The
   telencephalon, diencephalon, optic tectum, and medulla oblongata scaled
   with negative allometry against the rest of the brain throughout
   ontogeny. However, notably, the olfactory bulbs and cerebellum scaled
   hyperallometrically to the rest of the brain, whereby these structures
   enlarged disproportionately as this species matured. Changes in the
   relative size of the olfactory bulbs throughout ontogeny may reflect an
   increased reliance on olfaction at later life history stages in R.

   throughout ontogeny may be indicative of the ability to capture faster
   prey or an increase in migratory nature as this species moves to
   offshore habitats, associated with the onset of sexual maturity.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   A fundamental goal of continuous process improvement programs is to
   evaluate and improve the ratio of actual to expected mortality. To study
   this, we examined contributors to error-associated deaths during two
   consecutive periods from 1996 to 2004 (period 1) and 2005 to 2014
   (period 2). METHODS
   All deaths at a level I trauma center with an anticipated probability of
   death less than 50\% and/or identified through process improvement
   committees were examined. Demographics were assessed for trend only
   because period 1 data were only available in median and interquartile
   range. Each death was critically appraised to identify potential error,
   with subsequent classification of error type, phase, cause, and
   contributing cognitive processes, with comparison of outcomes made using
   chi(2) test of independence. RESULTS
   During period 1, there were a total of 44,401 admissions with 2,594
   deaths and 64 deaths (2.5\%) associated with an error, compared with
   60,881 admissions during period 2 with 2,659 deaths and 77 (2.9\%)
   associated with an error. Deaths associated with an error occurred in
   younger and less severely injured patients in period 1 and were likely
   to occur during the early phase of care, primarily from failed
   resuscitation and hemorrhage control. In period 2, deaths occurred in
   older more severely injured patients and were likely to occur in the
   later phase of care primarily because of respiratory failure from
   aspiration. CONCLUSION
   Despite injured patients being older and more severely injured,
   error-associated deaths during the early phase of care that was
   associated with hemorrhage improved over time. Successful implementation
   of system improvements resolved issues in the early phase of care but
   shifted deaths to later events during the recovery phase including
   respiratory failure from aspiration. This study demonstrates that
   ongoing evaluation is essential for continuous process improvement and
   realignment of efforts, even in a mature trauma system.}},

Abstract = {{Sustained-release carriers with intrinsic luminescence exhibit the
   potential to combine imaging with bioactive agent delivery in practice.
   This study reports the synthesis and properties of CT, which is a
   gel-forming and highly tunable non-conjugated polymer with intrinsic
   luminescence. Owing to the excitation wavelength-dependent emission
   tunability of CT, optical imaging can be performed in a wide range of
   excitation wavelengths. This study is the first proof-of-concept study
   successfully integrating the property of clusterization-triggered
   emission into carrier design for combining imaging with bioactive agent
   delivery. By using cancer therapy as a practical example, our results
   demonstrate that CT is a depot system that cannot only enhance in vivo
   antitumor efficacy but can also allow its location and gelation process
   to be tracked in real time by giving an intrinsic blue-colored
   fluorescence signal. Together with its high biocompatibility, CT shows
   high practical potential for executing self-illuminating therapy to
   tackle cancer. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Terrestrial Water Storage Changes Using GPS: A Case Study over Taiwan}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{It is a typical ill-conditioned problem to invert GPS-measured loading
   deformations for terrestrial water storage (TWS) changes. While previous
   studies commonly applied the 2nd-order Tikhonov regularization, we
   demonstrate the truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD)
   regularization can also be applied to solve the inversion problem. Given
   the fact that a regularized estimate is always biased, it is valuable to
   obtain estimates with different methods for better assessing the
   uncertainty in the solution. We also show the general cross validation
   (GCV) can be applied to select the truncation term for the TSVD
   regularization, producing a solution that minimizes predictive
   mean-square errors. Analyzing decade-long GPS position time series over
   Taiwan, we apply the TSVD regularization to estimate mean annual TWS
   variations for Taiwan. Our results show that the TSVD estimates can
   sufficiently fit the GPS-measured annual displacements, resulting in
   randomly distributed displacement residuals with a zero mean and small
   standard deviation (around 0.1 cm). On the island-wide scale, the
   GPS-inferred annual TWS variation is consistent with the general
   seasonal cycle of precipitations. However, on smaller spatial scales, we
   observe significant differences between the TWS changes estimated by GPS
   and simulated by GLDAS land surface models in terms of spatiotemporal
   pattern and magnitude. Based on the results, we discuss some challenges
   in the characterization of TWS variations using GPS observations over
   Taiwan.}},

Abstract = {{Visual perception is not always veridical but can be influenced by
   factors such as ease of acting, energetic cost, and even body type of
   the observer. This notion is called action-specific perception. Several
   effects of action capability on visual perception have been found, but
   there is much controversy as to whether these effects are truly
   perceptual. Because perception cannot be measured directly, resolving
   the controversy relies on ruling out alternative explanations through
   systematic testing. We combined one of the most robust action-specific
   effects (the Pong effect) with one of the primary suggestions for
   exploring an alternative explanation, namely whether the effect persists
   across instructions that emphasize different aspects of the task. The
   Pong effect was robust to the type of instructions. The results provide
   critical evidence that the Pong effect is truly perceptual, furthering
   the argument that a person's ability to act can influence visual
   perception.}},

Abstract = {{In a cognitive radio network (CRN), the primary users (PUs) do not
   operate their spectra, full time. Thus, they can sell them to the
   secondary users (SUs), for a second use, during the free time slots. In
   this article, we assume that the market is perfect, monopolized by a
   single PU, and all players are rational. After formulating the PU's
   profit, we established a necessary and sufficient condition that
   guarantees the introduction of the PU into the market. In addition, the
   expressions of the SUs' profits, showed us that in non-cooperative form,
   some ones got zero profit, even after maximizing their profits.
   Therefore, we have considered to study the effect of cooperation on the
   profits of this category of SUs. By following this step, we established
   a cooperation strategy, to avoid zero profits for all SUs. In order to
   analyze the impact of this cooperation on the PU, we have expressed the
   profits of the PU in the cooperative and non-cooperative forms; as
   result, we found that the cooperation between SUs brought better than
   the non-cooperative form.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In an optomechanical system consisting of two Fabry-Perot cavities fed
   by squeezed light and coupled via Coulomb interaction, we respectively
   use the logarithmic negativity, Gaussian discord and Gaussian coherence
   to analyze the behavior of three different indicators of
   nonclassicality, namely the entanglement, quantum discord and quantum
   coherence. We perform the rotating wave approximation and work in the
   resolved sideband regime. In two bi-mode states (optical and
   mechanical), the coherence is generally found to be greater than
   entanglement and discord. More interestingly, we show that the Coulomb
   interaction can be used either to degrade or enhance the nonclassical
   properties of the optical subsystem. In addition, compared with the
   discord and coherence, the mechanical entanglement is found strongly
   sensitive to both thermal and Coulomb effects, and it requires a minimum
   value of cooperativity to be generated. Remarkably, this minimum
   increases when increasing the Coulomb coupling strength. Finally, we
   notice that an optimal transfer of quantum correlations between the
   optical and mechanical subsystems is achieved in the absence of the
   Coulomb interaction.}},

   SW Iran: Regional tectonic implications from subsidence analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{204}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Subsidence analysis of 42 exploration wells in the Zagros foreland basin
   indicates the tectonic evolution of the basin since Early Cretaceous.
   The impact of inherited basement structures on the basin evolution is
   documented in this study. Subsidence maps show that the architecture of
   the basin dramatically changed during the Cretaceous. In the Central
   Zagros, the Hercynian palaeo-high (i.e. Wadi Al Batin palaeo-high),
   which affected sedimentation until the Early Cretaceous time gradually
   disappeared and the South Pars palaeo-high within the central Persian
   Gulf started to show more impact on sedimentation.
   The palaeo-highs in the Zagros basement have different geometrical
   characteristics and origin. The Hercynian and South Pars are
   wide-wavelength palaeo-highs with a regional-scale impact on subsidence.
   In contrast, the Hendijan, Kharg-Mish and Kazerun palaeo-highs with
   different orientations and quite smaller wavelengths show different
   impact on the subsidence pattern. These kinds of palaeo-highs could be
   related to re-activation of pre-existing basement faults. Whereas South
   Pars and Hercynian paleo highs are possibly related to thermal expansion
   or contraction of the crust. The Hendijan and Kharg-Mish palaeo-highs
   with the NE-SW orientation were intensively re-activated during Turonian
   time. On the contrary, the Kazerun Fault with the N-S orientation became
   more active and considerably influenced sedimentation during the last 20
   Ma. Selective re-activation of deep-seated faults might have taken place
   as a result of changes in the orientation of the far-field stress in the
   region. Understanding the complexities of inherited structures and their
   impact on reservoir characteristics can support future exploration
   activities in the Zagros foreland basin.}},

Title = {{Additively Printed Multilayer Substrate Using Aerosol-Jet Technique}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC PACKAGING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Printing technologies, such as aerosol-jet, open possibilities of
   miniaturizing interconnects and designing circuits on nonplanar
   surfaces. Aerosol-jet is a direct-printing technique that provides an
   alternative manufacturing option to traditional subtractive methods that
   entail lithography or etching. Additionally, the aerosol-jet technique
   allows the circuits fabrication using noncontact method. Wide impact
   areas range from healthcare to wearables to future automotive
   applications. The aerosol-jet printer from Optomec utilized in this
   study consists of two types of atomizers, depending on ink viscosity.
   The ultrasonic atomizer, supports ink with a viscosity range of 1-5 cP,
   and the pneumatic atomizer that has a larger range of 1-1000 cP. This
   paper focuses on utilizing the aerosol-jet technique, using both
   atomizers to develop process parameters, in order to successfully print
   bimaterial, multilayer circuitry. The insulating material between two
   conductive lines used in the paper is of very high viscosity of 350 cP,
   which is suitable for the pneumatic atomizer and silver nanoparticle ink
   with comparatively low viscosity of 30 cP for the ultrasonic atomizer as
   a conductive ink. This paper also presents a statistical modeling
   approach that predicts line attributes, including microvia-diameter,
   before starting the print process, enabling us to pre-adjust the
   dimensions in computer-aided design for the desired output. Process
   parameters can obtain a fine print with satisfactory electrical
   properties, which develops improved dimensional accuracy. The importance
   of precleaning the substrate in addition to the printing process
   efficiency gaged as a function of process capability index and process
   capability ratio is also presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the relationship between economic complexity and
   income inequality. Using panel data on eighty-eight countries from 2002
   to 2017 and two estimation methods, this paper finds that economic
   complexity is significantly associated with higher income inequality.
   Moreover, because building economic sophistication is a long and costly
   process, we further identify whether the changes in the nature of this
   relationship is conditional on the evolution of other economic and
   social factors. The results provide qualified evidence that when the
   level of education, government spending, and trade openness reach
   certain thresholds, they facilitate the beneficial aspects of higher
   economic complexity on reducing with income inequality. Conversely, in
   an environment with less education, ineffective government spending, and
   low economic openness, economic complexity fails to reduce income
   inequality. Our findings are relevant for policymakers in tailoring
   their policies toward combating inequality in the process of developing
   a knowledge-based economy. (C) 2020 Economic Society of Australia,

Abstract = {{I set up a three-country business cycle model with one advanced (AE) and

   wave of foreign investments, which amplify the macroeconomic boom. The
   spillovers effects are welfare improving for the other EME, which can
   borrow at a lower interest rate. Moderate capital controls may be useful
   to EMEs to affect the interest rate at which they trade international
   bonds. Coordination among EMEs in setting capital controls delivers
   relatively small welfare gains compared with the Nash equilibrium. (C)

Abstract = {{Considerable effort has gone into investigating mechanisms that underlie
   the developmental transition in which mammalian cardiomyocytes (CMs)
   switch from being able to proliferate during development, to essentially
   having lost that ability at maturity. This problem is interesting not
   only for scientific curiosity, but also for its clinical relevance
   because controlling the ability of mature CMs to replicate would provide
   a much-needed approach for restoring cardiac function in damaged hearts.
   In this review, we focus on the propensity of mature mammalian CMs to be
   multinucleated and polyploid, and the extent to which this may be
   necessary for normal physiology yet possibly disadvantageous in some
   circumstances. In this context, we explore whether the concept of the
   myonuclear domain (MND) in multinucleated skeletal muscle fibers might
   apply to cardiomyocytes, and whether cardio-MND size might be related to
   the transition of CMs to become multinuclear. Nuclei in CMs are almost
   certainly integrators of not only biochemical, but also-because of their
   central location within the myofibrils-mechanical information, and this
   multimodal, integrative function in adult CMs-involving molecules that
   have been extensively studied along with newly identified
   possibilities-could influence both gene expression as well as
   replication of the genome and the nuclei themselves.}},

Title = {{First-line immune-checkpoint inhibitor plus chemotherapy versus
   chemotherapy alone for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer: a
   meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN MEDICAL ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction:
   Platin-based chemotherapy (CT) has long been the first-line
   standard-of-care for patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung
   cancer (ES-SCLC). Adding immune-checkpoint inhibitor(s) to CT (ICI+CT)
   in this setting is an option of interest, although its benefit is
   apparently modest.
   Methods:
   This meta-analysis was conducted on randomized trials comparing
   first-line ICI+CT versus CT alone for ES-SCLC. Outcomes included overall
   survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate
   (ORR), response at 12 months and adverse events (AEs). Subgroup analyses
   were computed according to the immunotherapy used, performance status
   (PS), age, platinum salt, liver metastases and brain metastases at
   diagnosis.
   Results:
   The literature search identified one randomized phase II
   (ECOG-ACRIN-5161) and four phase III trials (CASPIAN, IMPOWER-133,
   KEYNOTE-604 and Reck et al. 2016) that included 2775 patients (66\%
   males, 95\% smokers, median age: 64 years, PS = 0 or 1). ICI+CT was
   significantly associated (hazard ratio {[}95\% confidence interval])
   with prolonged OS {[}0.82 (0.75-0.89); p < 0.00001] and PFS {[}0.81
   (0.75-0.87); p < 0.00001], with OS benefits for anti-PD-L1 {[}0.73
   (0.63-0.85); p < 0.0001] or anti-PD-1 {[}0.76 (0.63-0.93); p < 0.006]
   but not for anti-CTLA-4 {[}0.90 (0.80-1.01), p = 0.07]. ORRs for ICI+CT
   or CT alone were comparable {[}odds ratio 1.12 (0.97-1.00); p = 0.12],
   but responses at 12 months favored ICI+CT {[}4.16 (2.81-6.17), p <
   0.00001]. Serious grade-3/4 AEs were more frequent with ICI+CT {[}odds
   ratio 1.18 (1.02-1.37); p = 0.03]. Compared with CT, no ICI+CT benefit
   was found for ES-SCLC with brain metastases at diagnosis {[}HR 1.14
   (0.87-1.50); p = 0.34].
   Conclusions:
   First-line ICI+CT appears to be superior to CT alone for ES-SCLC except
   for patients with brain metastases at diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{Pleuropulmonar y blastoma (PPB) is a ver y rare pediatric lung disease.
   It can progress from abnormal epithelial cysts to an aggressiv e sarcoma
   with poor survival. PPB is difficult to diagnose as it can be confounded
   with other cystic lung disorders, such as congenital pulmonary airway
   malformation (CPAM). PPB is associated with mutations in DICER1 that
   perturb the microRNA (miRNA) profile in lung. How DICER1 and miRNAs act
   during PPB pathogenesis remains unsolved. Lung epithelial deletion of
   the Yin Yang1 (Yy1) gene in mice causes a phenotype mimicking the cystic
   form of PPB and affects the expression of key regulators of lung
   development. Similar changes in expression were observed in PPB but not
   in CPAM lung biopsies, revealing a distinctiv e PPB molecular signature.
   Deregulation of molecules promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition
   (EMT) was detected in PPB specimens, suggesting that EMT might
   participate in tumor progression. Changes in miRNA expression also
   occurred in PPB lung biopsies. miR-125a-3p, a candidate to regulate YY1
   expression and lung branching, was abnormally highly expressed in PPB
   samples. Together, these findings support the concept that reduced
   expression of YY1, due to the abnormal miRNA profile resulting from
   DICER1 mutations, contributes to PPB development via its impact on the
   expression of key lung developmental genes. This article has an
   associated First Person interview with the joint first authors of the
   paper.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic cold stress has long-term dramatic effects on the animal immune
   and neuroendocrine systems. As one of the important regions of the
   brain, the hippocampus is the main region involved in response to
   stressors. Nevertheless, the impact to the hippocampus following cold
   exposure and the underlying mechanism involved are not clear. To
   evaluate the response of the hippocampus during chronic cold stress,
   male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 4 degrees C, 3 h per day for 1 week,
   after which neuroinflammation and the molecular and signaling pathways
   in the hippocampus response to cold stress were investigated. To confirm
   the potential mechanism, BV2 cells were treated with gamma-aminobutyric
   acid (GABA) and BAY 11-7082 and MCC950, then the activation of microglia
   and key proteins involved in the regulation of inflammation were
   measured. We demonstrated that chronic cold stress induced the
   activation of microglia, the emergence of neuroinflammation, and the
   impairment of neurons in the hippocampus, which might be the result of
   GABA-mediated activation of nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)
   inflammasome and the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling
   pathway.y}},

Title = {{Do 3-D Printed Handheld Models Improve Surgeon Reliability for
   Recognition of Intraarticular Distal Radius Fracture Characteristics?}},

Abstract = {{Background For fracture care, radiographs and two-dimensional (2-D) and
   three-dimensional (3-D) CT are primarily used for preoperative planning
   and postoperative evaluation. Intraarticular distal radius fractures are
   technically challenging to treat, and meticulous preoperative planning
   is paramount to improve the patient's outcome. Three-dimensionally
   printed handheld models might improve the surgeon's interpretation of
   specific fracture characteristics and patterns preoperatively and could
   therefore be clinically valuable; however, the additional value of 3-D
   printed handheld models for fractures of the distal radius, a
   high-volume and commonly complex fracture due to its intraarticular
   configuration, has yet to be determined.
   Questions/purposes (1) Does the reliability of assessing specific
   fracture characteristics that guide surgical decisionmaking for distal
   radius fractures improve with 3-D printed handheld models? (2) Does
   surgeon agreement on the overall fracture classification improve with
   3-D printed handheld models? ( 3) Does the surgeon's confidence improve
   when assessing the overall fracture configuration with an additional 3-D
   model?
   Methods We consecutively included 20 intraarticular distal radius
   fractures treated at a Level 1 trauma center between May 2018 and
   November 2018. Ten surgeons evaluated the presence or absence of
   specific fracture characteristics (volar rim fracture, die punch, volar
   lunate facet, dorsal comminution, step-off > 2 mm, and gap > 2 mm),
   fracture classification according to the AO/Orthopaedic Trauma
   Association (OTA) classification scheme, and their confidence in
   assessing the overall fracture according to the classification scheme,
   rated on a scale from0 to 10 (0 = not at all confident to 10 = very
   confident). Of 10 participants regularly treating distal radius
   fractures, seven were orthopaedic trauma surgeons and three upper limb
   surgeons with experience levels ranging from 1 to 25 years after
   completion of residency training. Fractures were assessed twice, with 1
   month between each assessment. Initially, fractures were assessed using
   radiographs and 2-D and 3-D CT images (conventional assessment); the
   second time, the evaluation was based on radiographs and 2-D and 3-D CT
   images with an additional 3-D handheld model (3-D printed handheld model
   assessment). On both occasions, fracture characteristics were evaluated
   upon a surgeon's own interpretation, without specific instruction before
   assessment. We provided a sheet demonstrating the AO/OTA classification
   scheme before evaluation on each session. Multi-rater Fleiss's kappa was
   used to determine intersurgeon reliability for assessing fracture
   characteristics and classification. Confidence regarding assessment of
   the overall fracture classification was assessed using a paired t- test.
   Results We found that 3-D printed models of intraarticular distal radius
   fractures led to no change in kappa values for the reliability of all
   characteristics: volar rim (conventional kappa 0.19 {[}95\% CI 0.06 to
   0.32], kappa for 3-D handheld model 0.23 {[}95\% CI 0.11 to 0.36],
   difference of kappas 0.04 {[}95\% CI -0.14 to 0.22]; p = 0.66), die
   punch (conventional kappa 0.38 {[}95\% CI 0.15 to 0.61], kappa for 3-D
   handheld model 0.50 {[}95\% CI 0.23 to 0.78], difference of kappas 0.12
   {[}95\% CI -0.23 to 0.47]; p = 0.52), volar lunate facet (conventional
   kappa 0.31 {[}95\% CI 0.14 to 0.49], kappa for 3-D handheld model 0.48
   {[}95\% CI 0.23 to 0.72], difference of kappas 0.17 {[}95\% CI -0.12 to
   0.46]; p = 0.26), dorsal comminution (conventional kappa 0.36 {[}95\% CI
   0.13 to 0.58], kappa for 3-D handheld model 0.31 {[}95\% CI 0.11 to
   0.51], difference of kappas -0.05 {[}95\% CI -0.34 to 0.24]; p = 0.74),
   step-off > 2 mm (conventional kappa 0.55 {[}95\% CI 0.29 to 0.82], kappa
   for 3-D handheld model 0.58 {[}95\% CI 0.31 to 0.85], difference of
   kappas 0.03 {[}95\% CI -0.34 to 0.40]; p = 0.87), gap > 2 mm
   (conventional kappa 0.59 {[}95\% CI 0.39 to 0.79], kappa for 3-D
   handheld model 0.69 {[}95\% CI 0.50 to 0.89], difference of kappas 0.10
   {[}95\% CI -0.17 to 0.37]; p = 0.48). Although there appeared to be
   categorical improvement in kappa values for some fracture
   characteristics, overlapping CIs indicated no change. Fracture
   classification did not improve (conventional diagnostics: kappa 0.27
   {[}95\% CI 0.14 to 0.39], conventional diagnostics with an additional
   3-D handheld model: kappa 0.25 {[}95\% CI 0.15 to 0.35], difference of
   kappas: -0.02 {[}95\% CI -0.18 to 0.14]; p = 0.81). There was no
   improvement in self-assessed confidence in terms of assessment of
   overall fracture configuration when a 3-D model was added to the
   evaluation process (conventional diagnostics 7.8 {[} SD 0.79 \{95\% CI
   7.2 to 8.3\}], 3-D handheld model 8.5 {[}SD 0.71 \{95\% CI 8.0 to 9.
   0\}], difference of score: 0.7 {[}95\% CI -1.69 to 0.16], p = 0.09).
   Conclusions Intersurgeon reliability for evaluating the characteristics
   of and classifying intraarticular distal radius fractures did not
   improve with an additional 3-D model. Further studies should evaluate
   the added value of 3-D printed handheld models for teaching surgical
   residents and medical trainees to define the future role of 3-D printing
   in caring for fractures of the distal radius.

Abstract = {{Altered mental status can have many causes ranging from emergent
   intracranial pathologies to more insidious, systemic toxic aetiologies.
   We report a rare case of dermato-neuro syndrome in a 71-year-old man
   with a known history of scleromyxoedema. The patient initially presented
   with encephalopathy which quickly progressed to generalised tonic-clonic
   seizures and coma. While his presentation fits with other, although
   rare, cases of dermato-neuro syndrome, it is imperative to rule out
   lethal, more common causes of altered mentation. Due to the rarity and
   difficulty in diagnosis of dermato-neuro syndrome, there is a
   significant debate regarding the optimal management as there are no
   standardised treatment protocols. In our case, the patient was
   successfully treated with plasmapheresis resulting in improved

Abstract = {{Terrestrial vertebrate trace fossils are relatively abundant in
   mid-to-late Triassic and early Jurassic deposits in the British Isles
   but to date none at all have been recorded from the Rhaetian, the final
   stage of the Triassic. This represents a persistent gap in the
   terrestrial ichnological record. We present the first Rhaetian track to
   be recognised in the British Isles, found at Aust Cliff on the south
   bank of the Severn Estuary near Bristol in SW England. This locality is
   well known for disarticulated remains of Rhaetian fossil reptiles
   including some terrestrial species but in 2006 a track (TECMAG0161) was
   found for the fist time. Although the specimen was found ex-situ the
   palynological data from the surrounding matrix confirms a Rhaetian age.
   The track was examined with CT scanning and photogrammetry. We
   tentatively assign the track to the ichnogenus Procolophonichnium based
   on size and digit proportions. The isolated nature of the specimen
   offers little concrete information about the track maker but such tracks
   have previously been attributed to parareptiles or therapsid
   trackmakers. The specimen adds a datapoint to an otherwise
   ichnologically empty period of time in the British Isles. The track also
   provides solid evidence for a {[}locally] terrestrial environment in a
   sequence that is otherwise considered predominantly marine or estuarine.
   This discovery suggests that there may be more such tetrapod tracks of
   Rhaetian age preserved, at least at Aust, and further searching will
   hopefully lead to the current minimal dataset being expanded. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Volcanic rocks from the Davis Strait were studied to elucidate the
   tectonomagmatic processes during rifting and the start of seafloor
   spreading, and the formation of the Ungava transform zone between Canada
   and Greenland. The rocks are from the wells Hekja O-71, Gjoa G-37,
   Nukik-2 and Hellefisk-1, and from dredges on the northern Davis Strait
   High. Ages range from Danian to Thanetian (dinocyst palynozones P2 to
   P5, 62.5-57.2 Ma). The rocks are predominantly basaltic, but include
   picrites on the Davis Strait High. Calculated mantle potential
   temperatures for the Davis Strait High are c. 1500 degrees C, suggesting
   the volume of magma generated was large; this is consistent with
   geophysical evidence for magmatic underplating in the region. The rare
   earth element patterns indicate residual mantle lithologies of spinel
   peridotite and, together with Sr-Nd isotopes, indicate melting beneath
   regionally extensive, depleted asthenosphere beneath a lithosphere of
   thickness similar to, or thinner than, beneath Baffin Island and
   distinctly thinner than beneath West Greenland. Some sites include
   basalts with more enriched compositions. Depleted and enriched basalts
   in the Hellefisk well show contemporaneous melting of depleted and
   enriched mantle components in the asthenosphere. The Hekja and Davis
   Strait High basalts and picrites have unique, ultradepleted compositions
   with (La/Sm)(N) < 0.5, (Tb/Lu)(N) < 1 and Nb/Zr = 0.013-0.027. We
   interpret these compositions as a product of the melting regime within
   the Ungava transform zone, where the melting column would be steep-sided
   in cross-section and not triangular as expected at normal spreading
   ridges. Magmatism along the transform stopped when the tectonic regime
   changed from transtension to transpression during earliest Eocene time.}},

Journal = {{UROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{146}},
Pages = {{43-48}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether a financial incentive changed research
   patterns among residents over a 12-year period.
   METHODS At our institution, beginning July 2016, any resident work that
   led to a PubMed citation was awarded \$1,000. A review of the PubMed
   database and the regional meeting of the South Central Section of AUA
   (SCS/AUA) presentation itineraries were used to quantify and qualify the
   participation in research by these residents before and after
   introduction of the financial incentive.
   RESULTS Scholarly activity from thirty out of thirty possible residents
   was evaluated. The monetary incentive resulted in increased production
   post-incentive (6.33) vs pre-incentive (2.44) in average total
   authorship participation published to PubMed per year (P = .0125). The
   average number of PubMed primary authorships per resident per year
   increased from 0 in July 2007-June 2008 to 0.7 in July 2018-June 2019,
   displaying upward trajectory. Average primary authorship of research
   produced per year presented at SCS/AUA and published to PubMed increased
   postincentive (9.00) vs pre-incentive (4.89) (P = .0479). More review
   articles and less basic science research were published after the
   incentive.
   CONCLUSION Offering financial incentives to urology residents increased
   publications and meaningful participation in research. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Title = {{Highly Active Trifloaluminate Ionic Liquids as Recyclable Catalysts for
   Green Oxidation of 2,3,6-Trimethylphenol to Trimethyl-1,4-Benzoquinone}},

Abstract = {{An effective method for the synthesis of
   2,3,6-trimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone via the oxidation of
   2,3,6-trimethylphenol as the key step in the in the preparation of
   vitamin E was presented. An aqueous solution of H2O2 was used as the
   oxidant and Lewis acidic trifloaluminate ionic liquids
   {[}emim]{[}OTf]-Al(OTf)(3), chi(Al(OTf)3) = 0.25 or 0.15 as catalysts.
   Trifloaluminate ionic liquids were synthesised by the simple reaction
   between 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate (triflate)
   {[}emim]{[}OTf] and aluminium triflate used in sub-stoichiometric
   quantities. The influence of the reaction parameters on the reaction
   course, such as the amount and concentration of the oxidant, the amount
   of catalyst, the amount and the type of organic solvent, temperature,
   and the reaction time was investigated. Finally,
   2,3,6-trimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone was obtained in high selectivity (99\%)
   and high 2,3,6-trimethylphenol conversion (84\%) at 70 degrees C after 2
   h of oxidation using a 4-fold excess of 60\% aqueous H2O2 and acetic
   acid as the solvent. The catalytic performance of trifloaluminate ionic
   liquids supported on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (loading of active
   phase: 9.1 wt.\%) was also demonstrated. The heterogeneous ionic liquids
   not only retained their activity compared to the homogenous
   counterparts, but also proved to be a highly recyclable catalysts.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional technique for determining the soil texture and other soil
   properties is performed in laboratory which is a time consuming task. In
   this paper, machine learning algorithms are deployed to classify the
   soil texture and its properties without any intervention of laboratory
   equipment using the satellite images recorded by Landsat 8. These images
   are used to extract the terrain properties of the region which is
   integrated with weather data for the specific region and the vegetation
   index which are the major factors affecting the soil condition. A major
   aim of this paper is to design a robust technique for extracting,
   transforming Landsat images to numerical data and pre-processing the
   data for classifying the soil property. Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) is
   utilized to segregate and remove noise from the Landsat images for
   subsequent processing. A significant amount of noise is present in the
   raw data which affects the accuracy of the analysis. Terrain features
   are extracted after noise removal from the MNF transformed images and
   merged with the weather data, and vegetation index for a period of time
   and then classified using voting classifier of the ensemble modeling or
   analysis of the soil texture of the region. The voting is performed by
   integrating the results of logistic regression, support vector machine
   and decision tree. With this study, the consolidated dependence of the
   soil texture on the environmental factors is analyzed and a cross
   validation accuracy of 94.44\% is obtained.}},

Abstract = {{People living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) have excess risk
   of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Arterial inflammation
   is the hallmark of atherogenesis and its complications. In this study we
   aimed to perform a head-to-head comparison of fluorine-18
   fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography
   ({[}F-18]FDG PET/CT) and Gallium-68 pentixafor positron emission
   tomography/computed tomography {[}Ga-68]Ga-pentixafor PET/CT for
   quantification of arterial inflammation in PLHIV. We prospectively
   recruited human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients to
   undergo {[}F-18]FDG PET/CT and {[}Ga-68]Ga-pentixafor PET/CT within two
   weeks of each other. We quantified the levels of arterial tracer uptake
   on both scans using maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and
   target-background ratio. We used Bland and Altman plots to measure the
   level of agreement between tracer quantification parameters obtained on
   both scans. A total of 12 patients were included with a mean age of
   44.67 +/- 7.62 years. The mean duration of HIV infection and mean CD+
   T-cell count of the study population were 71.08 +/- 37 months and 522.17
   +/- 260.33 cells/mu L, respectively. We found a high level of agreement
   in the quantification variables obtained using {[}F-18]FDG PET and
   {[}Ga-68]Ga-pentixafor PET. There is a good level of agreement in the
   arterial tracer quantification variables obtained using {[}F-18]FDG
   PET/CT and {[}Ga-68]Ga-pentixafor PET/CT in PLHIV. This suggests that
   {[}Ga-68]Ga-pentixafor may be applied in the place of {[}F-18]FDG PET/CT
   for the quantification of arterial inflammation.}},

Title = {{Diverging ideas of health? Comparing the basis of health ratings across
   gender, age, and country}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{267}},
Number = {{SI}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Self-rated health (SRH) is arguably the most widely used
   generic health measurement in survey research. However, SRH remains a
   black box for researchers. In our paper, we want to gain a better
   understanding of SRH by identifying its determinants, quantifying the
   contribution of different health domains to explain SRH, and by
   exploring the moderating role of gender, age groups, and the country of
   residence.
   Method: Using data from 61,365 participants of the fifth wave (2013) of
   the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) living in
   fifteen European countries, we explain SRH via linear regression models.
   The independent variables are grouped into five health domains:
   functioning, diseases, pain, mental health, and behavior. Via dominance
   analysis, we focus on their individual contribution to explaining SRH
   and compare these contributions across gender, three age groups, and
   fifteen European countries.
   Results: Our model explains SRH rather well (R-2 = .51 for females/.48
   for males) with functioning contributing most to the appraisal
   (.20/.18). Diseases were the second most relevant health dimension
   (.14/.16) followed by pain (.08/.07) and mental health (.07/.06). Health
   behavior (.02/.01) was less relevant for health ratings. This ranking
   held true for almost all countries with only little variance overall. A
   comparison of age groups indicated that the contribution of diseases and
   behavior to SRH decreased over the life-course while the contribution of
   functioning to R-2 increased.
   Conclusion: Our paper demonstrates that SRH is largely based on diverse
   health information with functioning and diseases being most important.
   However, there is still room for idiosyncrasies or even bias.}},

Title = {{Allocation factors for meat coproducts: Dataset to perform life cycle
   assessment at slaughterhouse}},
Journal = {{DATA IN BRIEF}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{33}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The sharing of total environmental impacts between the different
   products of a multi-output system is crucial in Life Cycle Assessment.
   ISO standards recommend subdivision then substitution methods when
   possible. Sometimes, allocations rules are necessary. They consist of
   allocating the total impact to the different products in proportion to a
   value that characterize the products. They can be based on physical
   parameters (such as mass, protein, dry matter, etc.) or the economic
   value of coproducts can be used as a proxy. As they are based on various
   type of parameters, allocation rules can lead to significantly different
   environmental impact results. Then a consensus is difficult to reach
   between stakeholders as for example in meat sector. To make the debate
   going further, Chen et al. (2017) proposed a new allocation method based
   on biophysical parameters (Chen et al., 2017). Adapted from previous
   methods, they propose to allocate impacts in proportion to the energy
   needed for the growth, the maintenance and the activity of each tissue.
   The method has been judged as scientifically viable but also
   particularly difficult to apply due to the amount of necessary data and
   to the complexity of the calculation model. In a recent project, we
   developed a freeware to easily calculate biophysical allocation factors
   as well as mass and economic factors to allow a fair comparison:
   MeatPartTool. We also collected data to create a dataset of mass,
   economic and biophysical allocation factors for a large range of beef
   (132 individuals), calf (54 individuals) and lamb (14 individuals) at
   the slaughterhouse stage. This data paper provides both primary data and
   calculated allocation factors. (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by

Abstract = {{Many studies examining the biological function of recombinant proteins
   and their effects on the physiology of mammalian cells stipulate that
   the proteins be purified before being used as therapeutic agents. In
   this study, we explored the possibility of using unpurified recombinant
   proteins to treat mammalian cells. The recombinant protein was used
   directly from the expression source and the biological function was
   compared to purified commercially available, equivalent protein. The
   model for this purpose was recombinant FGF-2, expressed by Pichia
   pastoris, which was used to treat the murine fibroblast cell line,
   NIH/3T3. We generated a P. pastoris strain (yHL11) that constitutively
   secreted a biologically active recombinant FGF-2 protein containing an
   N-terminal c-myc epitope (Myc-FGF-2). Myc-FGF-2 was then used without
   purification either a) in the form of conditioned mammalian cell culture
   medium orb) during co-cultures of yHL11 with NIH/3T3 to induce higher
   proliferation and motility of NIH/3T3 cells. The effects of Myc-FGF-2 on
   cell physiology were comparable to commercially available FGF-2. To our
   knowledge, this is the first time the physiology of cultured mammalian
   cells had been successfully altered with a recombinant protein secreted
   by P. pastoris while the two species shared the same medium and culture
   conditions. Our data demonstrated the biological activity of unpurified
   recombinant FGF-2 on NIH/3T3 cells and provided a foundation for
   directly using unpurified recombinant proteins expressed by P. pastoris
   with mammalian cells, potentially as wound-healing therapeutics.}},

   process}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{162}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This study shares a side-by-side numerical and experimental examination
   on the features of overhanging structure in the SLM process. The
   simulation model was achieved by incorporating Fresnel reflections in
   the laser beam through the ray-tracing model. The CFD model was employed
   to investigate different overhanging situations, including perpendicular
   and parallel overhanging melt tracks on a cuboid block, as well as
   parallel melt tracks on an inclined block. The process parameters are
   found to strongly affect the surface morphologies of the overhanging
   melt track where voids caused by interfacial instability and geometrical
   defects namely discontinuities were observed. The subsequent defects
   caused by the discontinuity have also been investigated in both
   simulation and experiment. In the range of this study, it found that
   high laser power alleviates the discontinuity phenomenon of the
   overhanging melt track. However, by applying high laser power at high
   energy density, the high value of melt pool depth was formed, causing
   warpage to the overhanging printed part. Nevertheless, employing high
   laser power while maintaining low energy density can eliminate
   phenomenon such as irregular pores, partially-melted powder, deep melt
   pool formation and geometrical inaccuracy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are an important class of excitatory
   receptors in the central nervous system of arthropods. In the ticks
   Ixodes ricinus, the functional and pharmacological properties of
   nicotinic receptors located in their neurons are still unknown. The
   objective of this study was to characterize the pharmacological
   properties of tick nicotinic receptors using membrane
   microtransplantation in Xenopus laevis oocytes and two-electrodes
   voltage clamp method. The membranes microtransplanted were extracted
   from the tick synganglion. We found that oocytes microtransplanted with
   tick synganglion membranes expressed nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
   subtypes which were activated by acetylcholine (1 mM) and nicotine (1
   mM). Currents induced by pressure application of acetylcholine and
   nicotine were diminished by 10 nM alpha-bungarotoxin and
   methyllycaconitine, suggesting that they expressed two subtypes of
   nicotinic receptors, alpha-bungamtoxin-sensitive and -insensitive,
   respectively. In addition, we found that nicotine receptors expressed in
   the synganglion membranes were poorly sensitive to the neonicotinoid
   insecticides clothianidin (CLT), imidacloprid (IMI), acetamiprid (ACE)
   and thiamethoxam (TMX), in agreement with their lack of activity as
   acaricides. Interestingly, current amplitudes were strongly
   potentialized in the presence of 1 mu M PNU-120596. CLT was more active
   as an agonist than IMI, TMX and ACE. Finally, we demonstrated that
   microtransplantation of purified membrane from the tick synganglion can
   be a valuable tool for the development and screening of compounds
   targeting tick nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes.}},

Abstract = {{Metal(loid) pollution in aquatic ecosystems has become a cause for
   concern, particularly in areas where communities depend on services from

   Dam, an impoundment in one of the most polluted river systems in
   Southern Africa, the Olifants River. The concentrations of metal(loid)s
   were measured using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission
   spectrophotometry (ICP-OES; Perkin Elmer, Optima 2100DV). The data
   generated attest that in aquatic ecosystems, metal(loid)s do not remain
   in suspension in the water column, but sink down to the bottom sediment
   where they accumulate or get taken up by receptor organisms such as
   fish. It further confirm that there is a clear separation on the extent
   to which metal(loid)s are accumulating in different tissues and liver
   mostly accumulate higher concentration followed by gills and muscle,
   respectively. These data can be useful to guide future studies aiming to
   understand the dynamics, pathways and fate of metal(loid)s in relation

Abstract = {{Family rules, routines, and resources shape children's creativity.
   However, little is known about how parents' creative self-concepts and
   creative activity are related to the lifestyle adults create in their
   families. Family lifestyle might be operationalized as referring to
   domain-general dimensions of family social functioning (cohesion,
   flexibility, communication, and family satisfaction) and domain-specific
   factors related to creativity, namely, family climate for creativity
   (encouragement to experience novelty and varieties, encouragement to
   nonconformism, support of perseverance in creative efforts,
   encouragement to fantasize). To explore the link between parents'
   creativity-related characteristics and family lifestyle, 303 Polish
   parents (57\% mothers) of children aged between 6 and 10 (M = 7.99; SD =
   1.38) reported on their creative self-concept (creative self-efficacy
   and creative personal identity), creative activity, overall family
   lifestyle, and climate for creativity in their families. We found that
   parents' creative self-concept and their creative activity predict
   support for creativity in the family and more general balanced and
   satisfying family relationships. We discuss these findings, point new
   paths for future research, and suggest possible interventions to
   strengthen families as creativity-fostering environments.}},

Abstract = {{Due to their short half-lives, repeated administration of
   anti-hyperglycemic drugs can cause pain, discomfort, tissue damage, and
   infection in diabetic patients. Therefore, there is a need to develop
   long-term drug delivery systems to treat diabetes and its complications.
   C-peptide can prevent diabetic complications, including diabetic
   vasculopathy, but its clinical application is limited by its short
   half-life. Here, we developed K9-C-peptide (human C-peptide conjugated
   to an elastin-like biopolymer) and investigated its long-term influence
   on hyperglycemia-induced vascular dysfunction using an aortic
   endothelium model in diabetic mice. Using pharmacokinetics and in vivo
   imaging, we found that subcutaneously injected K9C-peptide formed a
   hydrogel depot that slowly released human C-peptide into the blood
   circulation for 19 days. Administration of K9-C-peptide, human
   C-peptide, or K8 polypeptide had no effect on body weight or blood
   glucose levels. The slow release of C-peptide from K9-C-peptide
   hydrogels provided prolonged prevention of oxidative stress,
   inflammatory responses, and endothelial apoptosis in a
   hyperglycemiainduced vascular dysfunction model using the diabetic mouse
   aorta. Subcutaneous administration of unbound human C-peptide and K8
   polypeptide were used as negative controls and had no effects. These
   results suggest that K9-C-peptide is suitable for the long-term delivery
   of human C-peptide for treating vascular dysfunction in diabetic
   patients. (c) 2020 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Sign Language Recognition Using Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Networks
   with Wi-Fi Signals}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Sign language is an important way for deaf people to understand and
   communicate with others. Many researchers use Wi-Fi signals to recognize
   hand and finger gestures in a non-invasive manner. However, Wi-Fi
   signals usually contain signal interference, background noise, and mixed
   multipath noise. In this study, Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) is
   preprocessed by singular value decomposition (SVD) to obtain the
   essential signals. Sign language includes the positional relationship of
   gestures in space and the changes of actions over time. We propose a
   novel dual-output two-stream convolutional neural network. It not only
   combines the spatial-stream network and the motion-stream network, but
   also effectively alleviates the backpropagation problem of the
   two-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) and improves its
   recognition accuracy. After the two stream networks are fused, an
   attention mechanism is applied to select the important features learned
   by the two-stream networks. Our method has been validated by the public
   dataset SignFi and adopted five-fold cross-validation. Experimental
   results show that SVD preprocessing can improve the performance of our
   dual-output two-stream network. For home, lab, and lab + home
   environment, the average recognition accuracy rates are 99.13\%,
   96.79\%, and 97.08\%, respectively. Compared with other methods, our
   method has good performance and better generalization capability.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TISSUE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Scaffolds that are used for bone repair should provide an adequate
   environment for biomineralization by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).
   Recently, decellularized pulp matrices (DPM) have been utilized in
   endodontics for their high regenerative potential. Inspired by the
   dystrophic calcification on the pulp matrix known as pulp stone, we
   developed acellular pulp bioscaffolds and examined their potential in
   facilitating MSCs mineralization for bone defect repair. Pulp was
   decellularized, then retention of its structural integrity was confirmed
   by histological, mechanical, and biochemical evaluations. MSCs were
   seeded and proliferation, osteogenic gene expression, and
   biomineralization were assessed to verify DPM's osteogenic effects in
   vitro. MicroCT, energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), and histological analyses
   were used to confirm that DPM seeded with MSCs result in greater
   mineralization on rat critical-sized defects than that without MSCs.
   Overall, our study proves DPM's potential to serve as a scaffolding
   material for MSC-mediated bone regeneration for future craniofacial bone
   tissue engineering.}},

Title = {{Applying Deep Learning to the Heat Production Planning Problem in a
   District Heating System}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{District heating system is designed to minimize energy consumption and
   environmental pollution by employing centralized production facilities
   connected to demand regions. Traditionally, optimization based
   algorithms were applied to the heat production planning problem in the
   district heating systems. Optimization-based models provide near optimal
   solutions, while it takes a while to generate solutions due to the
   characteristics of the underlying solution mechanism. When prompt
   re-planning due to any parameter changes is necessary, the traditional
   approaches might be inefficient to generate modified solutions quickly.
   In this study, we developed a two-phase solution mechanism, where deep
   learning algorithm is applied to learn optimal production patterns from
   optimization module. In the first training phase, the optimization
   module generates optimal production plans for the input scenarios
   derived from operations history, which are provided to the deep learning
   module for training. In the second planning phase, the deep learning
   module with trained parameters predicts production plan for the test
   scenarios. The computational experiments show that after the training
   process is completed, it has the characteristic of quickly deriving
   results appropriate to the situation. By combining optimization and deep
   learning modules in a solution framework, it is expected that the
   proposed algorithm could be applied to online optimization of district
   heating systems.}},

Abstract = {{A new broadband wrapped bowtie with resistively loaded antenna (WBRLA)
   is designed for near zone impulse radar applications. The figure of
   merit (FOM) is proposed to evaluate the pulse radiating performance to
   determine the antenna parameters. The six slots and resistors with 5 mm
   interval on the radiator are determined on the basis of the FOM for a
   newly designed WBRLA. An inclusion factor of the conventionally loaded
   resistive profile is considered and applied to a curved structure of the
   WBRLA. The WBRLA, with the inclusion factor of 0.6 loaded case, has
   shown to be the best performance with respect to an absorbing ability at
   lower frequency (800 MHz to 4 GHz), good fidelity factor, and reduced
   late-time ringing. The simple radar imaging experiment performed at the
   end demonstrates that the newly designed WBRLA with the reduced aperture
   size is a very promising pulsed radar sensor and could be applied to the
   near area sensing applications.}},

Abstract = {{Several recently developed technologies for molecular imaging have been
   applied to magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for cancer. In particular,
   various MR sequences with biocompatible polymer-based magnetic
   nanoparticles (pMNPs) have been applied for the MR imaging of cancer.
   However, there are several limitations to this approach, and passive
   contrast agents are not yet sufficiently targeted. This is a particular
   challenge for gastric cancer owing to the interference from stomach
   contents. Therefore, in this study we developed targeting contrast agent
   and assessed its feasibility for early gastric cancer diagnosis using a
   mouse model. Specifically, we synthesized pMNPs, which enable both
   T2-weighted (T2) and ultra-short TE (UTE) MR imaging using hyaluronic
   acid as the polymer, which binds to the receptor CD44, a recently
   identified biomarker of gastric cancer. Both MR sequences (T2, UTE) were
   analyzed with respect to imaging effects and targeting to the pMNPs. In
   vitro assessments showed no significant cytotoxicity of the pMNPs to
   MKN-45 and MKN-28 cells and confirmed the cellular uptake of the pMNPs.
   MR signal enhancement was identified after pMNPs injection to the mice,
   and the pMNPs gradually accumulated in the tumors. Based on the results,
   we suggest that pMNPs serve as useful probes for imaging stem-like
   cancer cells, and can further provide new possibilities by
   simultaneously confirming Tl and T2 MR imaging effects.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   The nodlike receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)
   inflammasome is a critical player in vascular pathology as it regulates
   caspase-1-mediated interleukin (IL)-1 beta processing. Physical activity
   ameliorates obesity-induced inflammation and vascular dysfunction, but
   the mechanisms responsible for these positive changes are incompletely
   understood. Here, the protective effect of physical activity on the
   inflammasome-associated vascular dysfunction in obesity and its putative
   mechanisms were investigated. Methods
   Mice were fed a control low-fat diet (LFD) or a high-fat diet (HFD; 45\%
   of calories from fat) and provided with running wheel access (LF-RUN or
   HF-RUN) or denied wheel access for our sedentary condition (LF-SED or
   HF-SED). The NLRP3 inflammasome-associated pathway, including NLRP3,
   caspase-1, and IL-1 beta, in mice aorta was examined by RT-qPCR and
   FLICA and DAB staining. The protein expression of zonula occluden-1
   (ZO-1), ZO-2, adiponectin (APN), and adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) in
   aortic endothelial cells was determined by immunofluorescence double
   staining. Intracellular reactive oxidative stress and nitric oxide (NO)
   production were monitored with fluorescence probes, dihydroethidium, and
   diaminofluorecein. Results
   HFD increased caspase-1 and IL-1 beta at mRNA and protein levels in
   endothelial cells of the aorta, and this was attenuated by voluntary
   running. HFD decreased ZO-1 and ZO-2 expression and reduced APN and
   AdipoR1 signaling; these were restored by running. The elevated
   intracellular superoxide (O-2(.-)) production observed in HF-SED was
   ameliorated in HF-RUN. Finally, HF-RUN improved NO production in the
   aorta compared with HF-SED. Conclusions
   Our findings suggest that voluntary running ameliorates mechanisms
   associated with vascular dysfunction by suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome,
   improving NO production, and reducing oxidative stress. Such benefits of
   physical activity may be, at least in part, associated with APN-AdipoR1
   signaling and tight junction protein expression.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally thought of as a pediatric diagnostic and therapeutic
   dilemma, the diagnostic rate and spectrum of inborn errors of metabolism
   (IEM) in the adult population is largely unknown. A retrospective chart
   review of patients seen by the Michigan Medicine Adult Medical Genetics
   Clinic for clinical evaluation from 2014 to 2018 was conducted. Patients
   referred for a primary indication possibly consistent with an IEM were
   considered. Variables included age at genetic evaluation, symptom onset
   age, sex, clinical course, organ systems involved, developmental
   history, family history and prior genetic testing. Of patients evaluated
   during the study period, 112 were referred for an indication possibly
   consistent with an IEM and underwent a complete biochemical workup with
   an IEM diagnostic rate of 9.8\% achieved. An additional 9.8\% were
   diagnosed with a non-IEM genetic diagnosis. Management changes were
   implemented in all IEM diagnoses. Metabolic disorders in the adult
   population are under-recognized and under-diagnosed. This report
   demonstrates the need for clinicians to consider these diagnoses in
   adults and either refer to a genetics clinic or initiate a biochemical
   workup. As advances in diagnosis, treatment, and life expectancy of
   patients with IEMs increases, recognizing and diagnosing these
   conditions can significantly impact care.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To evaluate whether the use of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4)
   inhibitors and their cardiac tissue distribution profile and
   anticalcification abilities are associated with risk of aortic stenosis
   (AS) progression.
   Methods Out of the five different classes of DPP-4 inhibitors, two had
   relatively favourable heart to plasma concentration ratios and
   anticalcification ability in murine and in vitro experiments and were
   thus categorised as `favourable'. We reviewed the medical records of 212
   patients (72 +/- 8 years, 111 men) with diabetes and mild-to-moderate AS
   who underwent echocardiographic follow-up and classified them into those
   who received favourable DPP-4 inhibitors (n=28, 13\%), unfavourable
   DPP-4 inhibitors (n=69, 33\%) and those who did not receive DPP-4
   inhibitors (n=115, 54\%).
   Results Maximal transaortic velocity (Vmax) increased from 2.9 +/- 0.3
   to 3.5 +/- 0.7 m/s during follow-up (median, 3.7 years), and the changes
   were not different between DPP-4 users as a whole and non-users
   (p=0.143). However, the favourable group showed significantly lower Vmax
   increase than the unfavourable or non-user group (p=0.018). Severe AS
   progression was less frequent in the favourable group (7.1\%) than in
   the unfavourable (29.0\%; p=0.03) or the non-user (29.6\%; p=0.01)
   group. In Cox regression analysis after adjusting for age, baseline
   renal function and AS severity, the favourable group showed a
   significantly lower risk of severe AS progression (HR 0.116, 95\% CI
   0.024 to 0.551, p=0.007).
   Conclusions DPP-4 inhibitors with favourable pharmacokinetic and
   pharmacodynamic properties were associated with lower risk of AS
   progression. These results should be considered in the preparation of
   randomised clinical trials on the repositioning of DPP-4 inhibitors.}},

Title = {{Which Factors Influence Clinical Outcomes After Superior Capsular
   Reconstruction Surgery?}},
Journal = {{ORTHOPAEDIC JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background:
   Arthroscopic superior capsular reconstruction (ASCR) has recently been
   introduced as an alternative treatment for patients with massive
   irreparable rotator cuff tears. However, the results of ASCR are still
   limited, and little information about retear after ASCR or subsequent
   treatment has been reported.
   Purpose:
   To investigate the retear rate of patients who underwent ASCR and to
   analyze the clinical outcomes of treatments performed for a retear.
   Study Design:
   Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3.
   Methods:
   This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from
   42 patients (46 shoulders) who underwent ASCR between March 2015 and
   April 2018. All patients were divided into 2 groups: those with no
   retear (30 shoulders) and those with retear (16 shoulders). Pre- and
   postoperative clinical and radiological results were compared between
   the 2 groups. The retear pattern and treatment outcomes of the retear
   group were analyzed.
   Results:
   The overall incidence of retear was 35\% (16/46). No difference was
   found in preoperative demographic or clinical data between the 2 groups.
   Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging data showed a significant
   between-group difference in the preoperative Goutallier grade of the
   subscapularis (1.5 +/- 1.1 in the no-retear group vs 2.5 +/- 1.3 in the
   retear group; P = .016). In the retear group, there were 10 cases of
   lateral side tears, 3 cases of midsubstance tears, 2 cases of medial
   side tears, and 1 case of medial and lateral tears. Reoperation was
   performed in 8 patients who had lateral insertion tear.
   Conclusion:
   Overall, clinical scores improved after ASCR in patients with massive
   irreparable rotator cuff tears. However, 35\% (16/46) of the patients
   showed retear, and lateral side retear occurred in 68\% (11/16). The
   clinical outcome of the patients with preoperative subscapularis atrophy
   or postoperative lateral side retears was worse, and reoperation was
   often required. Therefore, it is important that the lateral side be
   firmly fixed during the ASCR procedure.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Dose assessments were required for the epidemiological study of
   residents living near nuclear power plants. In the present work,
   environmental pathway models have been applied to estimate radiation
   doses to residents living near the nuclear power plants in Taiwan. Best
   estimates of doses were made for residents by their age groups in
   different compass sectors centered at the nuclear power plants. In each
   sector, radiation doses were assessed using the averaged environmental,
   consumption and lifestyle data. For epidemiological analyses of cancer
   risks in different organs or tissues, individual organ absorbed doses
   were assessed for both the airborne and waterborne effluent releases.
   Such assessments were performed based on the historic data, including
   measured effluent releases, detected meteorological parameters, and
   surveyed data on the production and consumption of local agricultural,
   fishery and livestock products, etc. Exposure pathways consisted of the
   external irradiations from air submersion, ground deposition and water
   immersion plus the internal irradiations from inhalation and ingestion.
   Age-dependent annual intakes and occupancy time were locally surveyed.
   Dose conversion coefficients were taken from published data after
   International Commission on Radiological Protection Publication 60.
   Annual doses and cumulated doses during residence were assessed and
   examined for their dependence on age, organ and compass sector.}},

   include a ship, speedboat, and buoy. The proposed deep learning model is
   compared to a universal trained model that detects and classifies
   objects into general classes, such as a person, dog, car, and boat, and
   results show that the proposed model outperforms the other in the
   detection of maritime objects. Different deep neural network structures
   are then compared to obtain the best detection performance. The proposed
   model also shows a real-time detection speed of approximately 30 frames
   per second. Hence, it is expected that the proposed model can be used to
   detect maritime objects and reduce risks while at sea.}},

Abstract = {{Preterm labor and birth are the primary causes of neonatal morbidities
   and mortalities. The early detection and treatment of preterm uterine
   muscular contraction are crucial for the management of preterm labor. In
   this work, a ring electrode with a wireless electrical recording and
   stimulating (RE-WERS) system was designed, fabricated, and investigated
   for the non-invasive monitoring of uterine contraction/relaxation as a
   diagnostic and therapeutic tool for preterm labor. By using an organ
   bath system, we confirmed that the uterine contraction force in mice can
   be decreased by the application of electrical stimulation. Then, the
   RE-WERS system was inserted non-invasively through the vagina to the
   cervix of a pregnant minipig, and it successfully recorded the uterine
   contraction and reflect signals when various electrical stimulating
   conditions were applied. The difference in the uterine signals before
   and after the injection of a labor induction drug, such as oxytocin and
   prostaglandin F2 alpha, was recorded, and the difference was remarkable.
   In addition, the uterine signal that was recorded was well matched with
   the signal of the electromyography (EMG) kit during open abdominal
   surgery. It seemed that the continuous and various electrical
   stimulations affected the delay or inhibition of childbirth in the
   pregnant minipig.}},

Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to improve portion size
   estimation aids (PSEAs) used in the nutrition survey of the Korea
   National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) and validate
   the accuracy and precision of the newly developed aids.
   SUBJECTS/METHODS: We conducted intensive interviews with survey experts
   in KNHANES and consulted with experts to collect opinions about
   improvement of PSEAs. Based on the results of the interviews, 5 types of
   PSEAs (rice bowl, earthen pots, mounds, measuring spoons, and thickness
   sticks) were newly developed using 3-dimensional (3D) modeling or
   modification of color or shape. Validation tests were conducted with 96
   adults 20 years old or older. For the rice bowl and earthen pots, the
   participants were asked to select the more similar PSEA in size after
   being shown the real dishes. For the mounds, measuring spoons, and
   thickness sticks, the participants were presented with actual plates of
   food and asked to estimate the given portion sizes using the given
   PSEAs.
   RESULTS: The improved 2-dimensional (2D) picture aid for the rice bowl
   reflecting the size distortion by angle of view using 3D modeling was
   perceived more closely to the actual size than the current 2D picture
   (P< 0.001). The change of the color of 2D pictures and 3D models, the
   change of shape of the measuring spoons, and the 3-dimensionalization of
   the 2D mounds had no significant improvement in the subjects'
   perception.
   CONCLUSIONS: The currently used 2D PSEAs need to be fully redesigned
   using 3D modeling to improve subjects' perception. However, change of
   color or shape will not be necessary. For amorphous foods, it is
   suggested that more evaluation be performed before reaching a final
   conclusion in the use of PSEAs, or alternative ways to improve accuracy
   of estimation need to be explored.}},

Abstract = {{Colorectal cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers in Korea and
   globally. In this study, we aimed to characterize the differential serum
   metabolomic profiles between pre-operative and post-operative patients
   with colorectal cancer. To investigate the significant metabolites and

   samples from 68 patients (aged 20-71, mean 57.57 years). Untargeted and
   targeted metabolomics profiling in patients with colorectal cancer were
   performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Untargeted
   analysis identified differences in sphingolipid metabolism, steroid
   biosynthesis, and arginine and proline metabolism in pre- and
   post-operative patients with colorectal cancer. We then performed
   quantitative target profiling of polyamines, synthesized from arginine
   and proline metabolism, to identify potential polyamines that may serve
   as effective biomarkers for colorectal cancer. Results indicate a
   significantly reduced serum concentration of putrescine in
   post-operative patients compared to pre-operative patients. Our
   metabolomics approach provided insights into the physiological
   alterations in patients with colorectal cancer after surgery.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to analyze longitudinal changes in retinal
   microstructures following acute optic neuritis and to identify the
   factors that affect those changes using spectral-domain optical
   coherence tomography (OCT). Forty-eight eyes of 37 patients with a first
   episode of optic neuritis and 48 eyes of 48 healthy controls were
   enrolled. Patients underwent serial OCT and visual function testing for
   more than six months. Individual layers from macular OCT were segmented
   with an automated algorithm. The total retinal layer (TRL), nerve fiber
   layer (NFL), ganglion cell layer (GCL) and inner plexiform layer (IPL)
   of optic neuritis eyes showed significant thinning with time over 6-15
   months (p < 0.001 for all). The outer nuclear layer (ONL) showed a later
   decrease in thickness (p = 0.007). The outer retinal layer (ORL) showed
   an increase (p = 0.007) in thickness at two to five months which was
   sustained over time. Low visual acuity and neuromyelitis optica (NMO)
   immunoglobulin (Ig) G were associated with changes in the thickness of
   the GCL, IPL, and ONL over time (p < 0.05 for all). Low visual acuity
   was also associated with changes in the thickness of the NFL over time
   (p = 0.033). Dynamic changes of retinal microstructures varied according
   to the retinal layer examined after an optic neuritis attack. Initial
   visual acuity and NMO-IgG were found to be significant factors affecting
   the changes in thickness of each retinal layer. These results will lead
   to a better understanding of the pathologic changes that occur in eyes
   with optic neuritis.}},

Abstract = {{The green alga Botryococcus braunii produces abundant hydrocarbons, in
   the form of drop-in biodiesel, which promoted interest in the species as
   a renewable fuel. However, despite the observation of dense populations
   in the wild, Botryococcus grows very slowly in culture, severely
   limiting its potential for development as a bioresource. Undertaking a
   biodiscovery program, we found new strains of Botryococcus in locations
   ranging from tropical to temperate Australia and from both fresh and
   brackish waters. As part of the ecophysiological characterisation of
   this new biodiversity, lipid and pigment compositions were studied for
   six new strains from six different locations. The strains were
   inoculated in either freshwater or brackish (salinity of 4)-based medium
   and maintained over 150 days. The growth of cultures was studied
   continuously, while lipid and pigment composition were analysed at final
   harvest on day 150. No significant differences in growth rate between
   fresh and brackish media were observed. Some strains were more tolerable
   of brackish conditions than others with a link between salinity
   tolerance and original location. The use of lower salinity (4 ppt) had a
   minimal effect on lipid composition, with only two of the six strains
   showing a different hydrocarbon profile in comparison to the other
   strains; pigment composition showed only minor variations for fresh and
   brackish water cultures, although the concentrations varied
   significantly with the freshwater cultures containing higher pigment
   concentrations.}},

   psoriasis in Indonesia, specifically those who received narrowband
   ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) phototherapy. Methods: This retrospective study
   using data obtained from phototherapy and medical records of psoriasis
   patients who received phototherapy in 2014-2019 was conducted at the
   Dermatovenereology Clinic of Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo National General
   Hospital. Results: Among 24 geriatric patients with psoriasis who
   received NB-UVB phototherapy, the median age of onset was 61 years
   (range, 36-74 years). Regarding comorbidities, 15 patients (62.5\%) had
   dyslipidemia, 15 patients (62.5\%) had hypertension, 11 patients
   (45.8\%) had obesity, 9 patients (37.5\%) had periodontitis/gingivitis,
   9 patients (37.5\%) had type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 6 patients
   (25.0\%) had hyperuricemia. Conclusion: Some comorbidities have been
   associated with psoriasis, including metabolic syndrome and
   periodontitis. The data from this study could help physicians in
   evaluating and making appropriate clinical decisions when managing
   psoriasis patients in the geriatric population.}},

Abstract = {{Pyrethroids are an important class of insecticides, and thousands of
   tons of these compounds are used in the United States every year. This
   study characterized exposures to pyrethroids and assessed demographic,
   socioeconomic, and lifestyle factors that modulate pyrethroid exposure
   using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
   (NHANES) 2007-2012, a nationally representative survey of the
   non-institutionalized population of the United States. Urinary levels of
   commonly used biomarkers of pyrethroid exposure, including
   3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), 4-fluoro-3-phenoxybenzoic acid (F-PBA),
   and cis-dibromovinyl-dimethylcyclopropane carboxylic acid (DBCA), were
   determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The
   detection rate of 3-PBA, a nonspecific metabolite of several
   pyrethroids, was 78.1\% in adults (N = 5233) and 79.3\% in children (N =
   2295). The detection rates of all other pyrethroid metabolites were
   <10\%. The median urinary level of 3-PBA in adults was 0.47 mg/L
   (interquartile range, 0.14-1.22 mg/L). For children, the median urinary
   level was 0.49 mg/L (interquartile range, 0.17-1.29 mg/L). Age, gender,
   family income-to-poverty ratio (PIR), levels of physical activity,
   alcohol intake, and body mass index were associated with 3-PBA levels in
   adults. In children, age, gender, race/ethnicity, and PIR were
   associated with 3-PBA levels. 3-PBA levels also differed significantly
   across NHANES cycles, with higher levels observed in NHANES 2011-2012.
   Geometric mean 3-PBA levels in U.S. adults were 0.41 mg/L in NHANES
   2007-2008, 0.41 mg/L in NHANES 2009-2010, and 0.66 mg/L in NHANES
   2011-2012. In U.S. children, geometric mean 3-PBA levels were 0.40 mg/L
   in NHANES 2007-2008, 0.46 mg/L in NHANES 2009-2010, and 0.70 mg/L in
   NHANES 2011 -2012. These results demonstrate that pyrethroid exposures
   remain a current environmental health concern and lay the foundation for
   further preclinical and epidemiological studies assessing human health
   risks associated with pyrethroids. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{The ADRB1 (Adrenoceptor Beta 1) and ADRB2 Genes Significantly Co-express
   with Commonly Mutated Genes in Prostate Cancer}},
Journal = {{DISCOVERY MEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{Background: Beta blockers act on the beta-adrenergic receptors ADRB1 and
   ADRB2 to reduce heart rate and blood pressure. Observational studies
   have revealed strong risk reductions in metastasis and cancer-specific
   mortality with the use of beta-blockers in patients with some cancers.
   But observational studies of prostate cancer have reported conflicting
   results. Objectives: We examined the relationship of ADRB1 (Adrenoceptor
   beta 1) gene expression and ADRB2 (Adrenoceptor beta 2) gene expression
   with Forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1) gene expression in prostate cancer.
   We also analyzed survival data of solid tumor patients with respect to
   beta 1 (ADRB1) and beta 2 (ADRB2) adrenergic receptor gene expression.
   Methods: We examined the genomics of prostate cancer and other solid
   primary tumors in the GDC TCGA Prostate Cancer (PRAD) data set. The
   Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) contains the analysis of over 11,000 tumors
   from 33 of the most prevalent forms of cancer. Results: The presence of
   somatic mutations {[}Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small
   insertion/deletion polymorphism (INDELS)] in FOXA1 alters ADRB1 and
   ADRB2 gene expression. The correlation of FOXA1 gene expression with
   ADRB1 and ADRB2 gene expression is highly significant. Alterations in
   FOXA1 genes, ADRB1 genes, and ADRB2 genes are significantly
   co-occurrent, indicating that they may work in tandem to drive tumor
   formation and development. Increased ADRB1 and ADRB2 expressions reduce
   the overall survival of solid tumor patients in the GDC Pan Cancer set.
   Conclusions: FOXA1 signaling may regulate ADRB1 and ADRB2 expression, as
   well as androgen receptor expression. Analysis of these tumor mutations
   might indicate whether an individual prostate cancer patient will
   respond to beta blockers.}},

Abstract = {{Air-liquid interface (ALI) systems have been widely used in recent years
   to investigate the inhalation toxicity of many gaseous compounds,
   chemicals, and nanomaterials and represent an emerging and promising in
   vitro method to supplement in vivo studies. ALI exposure reflects the
   physiological conditions of the deep lung more closely to subacute in
   vivo inhalation scenarios compared to submerged exposure. The
   comparability of the toxicological results obtained from in vivo and in
   vitro inhalation data is still challenging. The robustness of ALI
   exposure scenarios is not yet well understood, but critical for the
   potential standardization of these methods. We report a cause-and-effect
   (C\&E) analysis of a flow through ALI exposure system. The influence of
   five different instrumental and physiological parameters affecting cell
   viability and exposure parameters of a human lung cell line in vitro
   (exposure duration, relative humidity, temperature, CO2 concentration
   and flow rate) was investigated. After exposing lung epithelia cells to
   a CeO2 nanoparticle (NP) aerosol, intracellular CeO2 concentrations
   reached values similar to those found in a recent subacute rat
   inhalation study in vivo. This is the first study showing that the NP
   concentration reached in vitro using a flow through ALI system were the
   same as those in an in vivo study.}},

Title = {{You must choose, but choose wisely: Model-based approaches for microbial
   community analysis}},
Journal = {{SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{151}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Soil microbial community data produced by next-generation sequencing
   platforms has introduced a new era in microbial ecology studies but
   poses a challenge for data analysis: huge tables with highly sparse data
   combined with methodological limitations leading to biased analyses.
   Methodological studies have attempted to improve data interpretation via
   data transformation and/or rarefaction but usually neglect the
   assumptions required for an appropriate analysis. Advances in both
   mathematics and computation are now making model-based approaches
   feasible, especially latent variable modeling (LVM). LVM is a
   cornerstone of modern unsupervised learning that permits the evaluation
   of evolutionary, temporal, and count structure in a unified approach
   that directly incorporates the data distribution. Despite these
   advantages, LVM is rarely applied in data analyses of the soil
   microbiome. Here, we review available methods to handle the
   characteristics of soil microbial data obtained from next-generation
   sequencing and advocate for model-based approaches. We focus on the
   importance of assumption checking for guiding the selection of the most
   appropriate method of data analysis. We also provide future directions
   by advocating for the consideration of the dataset produced by
   sequencing as a representation of microbial detections instead of
   abundances and for the adoption of hierarchical models to convert these
   detections into estimated abundances prior to evaluating the microbial
   community. In summary, we show that model assessment is important for
   qualifying interpretations and can further guide refinements in
   subsequent analyses. We have only begun to understand the factors
   regulating soil microbial communities and the impacts of this microbiota
   on the environment/ecosystem. Understanding the assumptions of new
   methods is essential to fully harness their power to test hypotheses
   using high-throughput sequencing data.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the implementation of nursing
   actions in anesthesia guided by the Patient Safety Checklist: Nursing
   Anesthetic Procedure and the difficulties in performing patient care.
   Design: A cross-sectional study.
   Methods: Nursing actions were evaluated in 282 anesthetic procedures of
   adult patients undergoing general anesthesia in three periods of
   anesthesia in a private hospital operating room in Brazil, from January
   to July 2018. The evaluated outcomes were the number of items performed
   by nurses during anesthesia periods and limitations for applying the
   Patient Safety Checklist: Nursing Anesthetic Procedure instrument.
   Findings: Execution of the nursing actions presented a mean percentage
   of 85.6, highlighting the anesthetic induction stage and differences
   between the periods before induction and reversal. The main items not
   performed in evaluating the nursing care in anesthesia were as follows:
   the anesthesia equipment test (84; 29.78\%) in the preinduction period;
   the evaluation of adequate ventilation (132; 46.81\%) in the induction
   period; and the tracheal aspiration assistance (62; 21.98\%) during
   reversal. Receiving a call from another room with care interruption was
   highlighted among the nurses' justifications for not performing the
   activities and difficulty in continuing care because of shift change.
   Conclusions: The execution of nursing care actions in anesthesia mainly
   occurred during the period related to induction, with limitations
   because of dimensioning of operating rooms and simultaneous procedures.

Abstract = {{Infections with endoparasites are common in dogs. Some of these
   parasites are potentially zoonotic and therefore a public health
   concern. A survey was conducted in twenty-six small animal practices to
   evaluate the prevalence of endoparasites in Belgian and Dutch owned dogs
   older than 6 months as well as risk factors associated with infection.
   Out of 239 faecal samples screened (168 in Belgium and 71 in the
   Netherlands), 18 dogs were tested positive for at least one type of
   endoparasite with three dogs co-infected with two parasitic species.
   Toxocara sp. was the most frequently found endoparasite (4.6\%). Three
   other dogs were positive for Angiostrongylus vasorum (1.4\%) using the
   Baermann method and confirmed in one dog by the Angiodetect (R) test.
   Age and predation behaviour were identified as two risk factors
   associated with endoparasite infection. Although the majority (77\%) of
   the owners in this study reported to administer at least one
   anthelmintic treatment per year, only a minority of them (24.3\%) were
   aware of the risk to human health, indicating that owner awareness is
   suboptimal. For dog owners, human toxocarosis and other potential
   zoonoses remain an underestimated health concern. The implementation of
   sustainable parasite control strategies should be promoted taking also
   into account the public health risk.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aim. Environmental and occupational exposure to high dust
   levels are known to be associated with lung function impairment. We
   assessed the ambient air quality in the working environment and the
   respiratory health of female stone quarry workers in Lubumbashi,
   Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in a context of severe economic,
   security, and health crises. Methods. This was a case-control study
   conducted in three stone quarry sites. Participants were 256
   dust-exposed female stone quarry workers matched to 256 unexposed female
   office workers and market tax collectors (N = 512). They each answered a
   structured respiratory health questionnaire and underwent physical
   examination and a lung function test with the use of a spirometer and
   peak flow meter. Quality of ambient air in the working environment was
   assessed by means of a BRAMC air quality monitor (BR-AIR-329). Results.
   Results showed that exposed women did not use any personal protective
   equipment (PPE); in quarry sites, abnormally high levels of PM2.5 (205
   +/- 13.2 mu g/m(3) vs. 31.3 +/- 10.3 mu g/m(3) in control sites; p <
   0.001) and volatile organic compounds (VOC, 2.2 +/- 0.2 mu g/m(3) vs.
   0.5 +/- 0.3 mu g/m(3), respectively; p < 0.01) were found. Furthermore,
   respiratory complaints were more common among exposed women (32.4\% vs.
   3.5\% in controls; p < 0.01), who had abnormal chest auscultation and
   reduced lung capacity than controls (mean PEFR: 344.8 +/- 2.26 and 405
   +/- 67.7 L/s, respectively; p < 0.001 Conclusion. Findings from this
   study show that in the midst of severe crises in the DRC, women stone
   quarry workers are exposed to abnormally high levels of respiratory
   hazards, which contribute to impaired lung function. There is a need to
   regulate quarry work and improve the working conditions in quarry sites
   in the DRC.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To investigate mandibular morphology in adults affected by
   posterior unilateral crossbite (PUXB) and to evaluate the hemi
   mandibular volumes from the crossbite (CB) and non-CB sides of the same
   patients.
   Methods: Thirty-eight cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images were
   consecutively recruited and the Digital Imaging and Communications in
   Medicine (DICOM)-formatted scans were volume rendered into a surface
   three-dimensional (3D) mesh model and volumes to obtain the 3D model of
   the mandibular bone. To achieve the surface point-to-point analysis of
   the mandibular models, a reverse engineering software was used. The same
   procedure was performed for an age-matched control group (19 CBCT
   images).
   Results: Total mandibular volume showed a difference of 2.46 cm(3)
   between patients and controls, which was not statistically significant.
   A mean difference of 1.53 cm(3) was found comparing the hemi mandibular
   volumes from the CB and non-CB sides of PUXB patients, this difference
   was statistically significant (P = 0.01). Findings for the
   surface-to-surface deviation analysis, demonstrated a higher percentage
   of mismatch in patients PUXB, over 10\% at 0.5 mm tolerance level.
   Limitations: Limitations are related to the intrinsic surfaces matching
   methodology, that make difficult to evaluate discrepancies among
   different mandibular anatomical units.
   Conclusion: Adult patients affected by PUXB show a greater mandibular
   structural asymmetry compared to controls because of a lower matching
   percentage obtained from the surface-to-surface matching technique.}},

Abstract = {{Aims
   The prevalence of combined abnormalities of femoral torsion (FT) and
   tibial torsion (TT) is unknown in patients with femoroacetabular
   impingement (FAI) and hip dysplasia. This study aimed to determine the
   prevalence of combined abnormalities of FT and TT, and which subgroups
   are associated with combined abnormalities of FT and TT.
   Methods
   We retrospectively evaluated symptomatic patients with FAI or hip
   dysplasia with CT scans performed between September 2011 and September
   2016. A total of 261 hips (174 patients) had a measurement of FT and TT.
   Their mean age was 31 years (SD 9), and 63\% were female (165 hips).
   Patients were compared to an asymptomatic control group (48 hips, 27
   patients) who had CT scans including femur and tibia available for
   analysis, which had been acquired for nonorthopaedic reasons.
   Comparisons were conducted using analysis of variance with Bonferroni
   correction.
   Results
   In the overall study group, abnormal FT was present in 62\% (163 hips).
   Abnormal TT was present in 42\% (109 hips). Normal FT combined with
   normal TT was present in 21\% (55 hips). The most frequent abnormal
   combination was increased FT combined with normal TT of 32\% (84 hips).
   In the hip dysplasia group, 21\% (11 hips) had increased FT combined
   with increased TT. The prevalence of abnormal FT varied significantly
   among the subgroups (p < 0.001). We found a significantly higher mean FT
   for hip dysplasia (31 degrees; SD 15)degrees and valgus hips (42 degrees
   (SD 12 degrees)) compared with the control group (22 degrees (SD 8
   degrees)). We found a significantly higher mean TT for hips with
   cam-type-FAI (34 degrees (SD 6 degrees)) and hip dysplasia (35 degrees
   (SD 9 degrees)) compared with the control group (28 degrees (SD 8
   degrees)) (p < 0.001).
   Conclusion
   Patients with FAI had a high prevalence of combined abnormalities of FT
   and TT. For hip dysplasia, we found a significantly higher mean FT and
   TT, while 21\% of patients (11 hips) had combined increased TT and
   increased FT (combined torsional malalignment). This is important when
   planning hip preserving surgery such as periacetabular osteomy and
   femoral derotation osteotomy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper highlights major activities and achievements in soil science
   by professors at the University of Alberta (U of A), which provide
   incredible benefits to society, provincially, nationally, and globally.
   Evolution of the soils profession in Alberta commenced in 1919 with the
   hiring of F.A. Wyatt, who developed the Department of Soil Science (DSS)
   and initiated a soil survey program in Alberta. J.D. Newton joined the
   department in 1922, teaching and supporting soil surveys that led to a
   fertilizer program greatly benefitting agriculture. With time,
   opportunities and problems were encountered with utilization of soils. U
   of A soil scientists conducted inventories, conducted innovative
   research, developed superior management techniques, and through evolving
   education and extension, continuously helped bring improvements to how
   we utilized and managed soil resources. The DSS 100 yr evolution is
   chronicled under the themes of pedology (including soil survey), soil
   fertility, soil sustainability (conservation, land reclamation, and
   contaminant remediation), with embedded specialized studies within these

   results showed that EF instruction could significantly improve vertical
   CMJ kinetic variables. Retention was achieved and vertical CMJ kinetic
   variables were maintained for subjects in the EF group.ConclusionsThis
   study showed that using EF instructions improved vertical CMJ kinetics
   compared to IF instructions. EF is suggested to apply to CMJs for
   improving performance based on the exact athletic demands.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: No effective therapy is available for unresectable soft-tissue
   sarcomas (STS). This unmet clinical need prompted us to test whether
   chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4)-specific chimeric antigen
   receptor (CAR)-redirected cytokine-induced killer lymphocytes (CAR.CIK)
   are effective in eliminating tumor cells derived from multiple STS
   histotypes in vitro and in immunodeficient mice.
   Experimental Design: The experimental platform included patient-derived
   CAR.CIK and cell lines established from multiple STS histotypes. CAR.CIK
   were transduced with a retroviral vector encoding second-generation
   CSPG4-specific CAR (CSPG4-CAR) with 4-1BB costimulation. The functional
   activity of CSPG4-CAR.CIK was explored in vitro, in two- and
   three-dimensional STS cultures, and in three in vivo STS xenograft
   models.
   Results: CSPG4-CAR.CIK were efficiently generated from patients with
   STS. CSPG4 was highly expressed in multiple STS histotypes by in silico
   analysis and on all 16 STS cell lines tested by flow cytometry.
   CSPG4-CAR.CIK displayed superior in vitro cytolytic activity against
   multiple STS histotypes as compared with paired unmodified control CIK.
   CSPG4-CAR.CIK also showed strong antitumor activity against STS
   spheroids; this effect was associated with tumor recruitment,
   infiltration, and matrix penetration. CSPG4-CAR.CIK significantly
   delayed or reversed tumor growth in vivo in three STS xenograft models
   (leiomyosarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, and
   fibrosarcoma). Tumor growth inhibition persisted for up to 2 weeks
   following the last administration of CSPG4-CAR.CIK.
   Conclusions: This study has shown that CSPG4-CAR.CIK effectively targets
   multiple STS histotypes in vitro and in immunodeficient mice. These
   results provide a strong rationale to translate the novel strategy we
   have developed into a clinical setting.}},

Title = {{Low-Dose Bisphenol A in a Rat Model of Endometrial Cancer: A CLARITY-BPA
   Study}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{128}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Bisphenol A (BPA) is known to be biologically active in
   experimental models even at low levels of exposure. However, its impact
   on endometrial cancer remains unclear.
   OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate whether lifelong exposure to
   different doses of BPA induced uterine abnormalities and molecular
   changes in a rat model.
   METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 5 doses of BPA {[}0, 25,
   250, 2,500, or 25,000 mu g/kg body weight (BW)/d] or 2 doses of 17 alpha
   - ethynylestradiol (EE2) (0.05 and 0.5 mu g/kg BW/d) starting from
   gestational day 6 up to 1 y old according to the CLARITY-BPA consortium
   protocol. The BW, uterus weight, and histopathology end points of the
   uteri were analyzed at postnatal (PND) day 21, 90, and 365. Estrous
   cycling status was evaluated in PND90 and PND365 rats. Transcriptomic
   analyses of estrus stage uteri were conducted on PND365 rats.
   RESULTS: Based on the analysis of the combined effects of all testing
   outcomes (including immunohistological, morphological, and estrous cycle
   data) in a semiblinded fashion, using statistical models, 25 mu g/kg
   BW/d BPA {[}BPA(25)], or 250 mu g/kg BW/d BPA {[}BPA(250)] exerted
   effects similar to that of EE2 at 0.5 mu g/kg BW/d in 1-y-old rats.
   Transcriptome analyses of estrus stage uteri revealed a set of 710 genes
   shared only between the BPA(25) and BPA(250) groups, with 115 of them
   predicted to be regulated by estradiol and 57 associated with female
   cancers. An interesting finding is that the expression of 476 human
   orthologous genes in this rat BPA signature robustly predicted the
   overall survival (p = 1.68 x 10(-5), hazard ratio = 2.62) of endometrial
   cancer patients.
   DISCUSSION: Lifelong exposure of rats to low-dose BPA at 25 and 250 mu
   g/kg BW/d altered the estrous cycle and uterine pathology with
   similarity to EE2. The exposure also disrupted a unique low-dose
   BPA-gene signature with predictive value for survival outcomes in
   patients with endometrial cancer.}},

   Chromosomes}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed the whole-genome experimental maps of nucleosomes in
   Drosophila melanogaster and classified genes by the expression level in
   S2 cells (RPKM value, reads per kilobase million) as well as the number
   of tissues in which a gene was expressed (breadth of expression, BoE).
   Chromatin in 5 `-regions of genes we classified on four states according
   to the hidden Markov model (4HMM). Only the Aquamarine chromatin state
   we considered as Active, while the rest three states we defined as
   Non-Active. Surprisingly, about 20/40\% of genes with 5 `-regions mapped
   to Active/Non-Active chromatin possessed the minimal/at least modest
   RPKM and BoE. We found that regardless of RPKM/BoE the genes of Active
   chromatin possessed the regular nucleosome arrangement in 5 `-regions,
   while genes of Non-Active chromatin did not show respective specificity.
   Only for genes of Active chromatin the RPKM/BoE positively correlates
   with the number of nucleosome sites upstream/around TSS and negatively
   with that downstream TSS. We propose that for genes of Active chromatin,
   regardless of RPKM value and BoE the nucleosome arrangement in 5
   `-regions potentiates transcription, while for genes of Non-Active
   chromatin, the transcription machinery does not require the substantial
   support from nucleosome arrangement to influence gene expression.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Pain is a multidimensional experience mediated by distributed neural
   networks in the brain. To study this phenomenon, EEGs were collected
   from 20 subjects with chronic lumbar radiculopathy, 20 age and gender
   matched healthy subjects, and 17 subjects with chronic lumbar pain
   scheduled to receive an implanted spinal cord stimulator. Analysis of
   power spectral density, coherence, and phase-amplitude coupling using
   conventional statistics showed that there were no significant
   differences between the radiculopathy and control groups after
   correcting for multiple comparisons. However, analysis of transient
   spectral events showed that there were differences between these two
   groups in terms of the number, power, and frequency-span of events in a
   low gamma band. Finally, we trained a binary support vector machine to
   classify radiculopathy versus healthy subjects, as well as a 3-way
   classifier for subjects in the 3 groups. Both classifiers performed
   significantly better than chance, indicating that EEG features contain
   relevant information pertaining to sensory states, and may be used to
   help distinguish between pain states when other clinical signs are
   inconclusive.}},

Abstract = {{In a longitudinal study we examined the impact of age on negative
   emotional reactions, compliance with health guidelines and knowledge
   about the virus during the COVID-19 epidemic. A total of 2509 people
   participated in a two-phase study: 1424 participants in the first phase
   (March 12-21) and 1085 participants in the second phase (April 23 to May
   5). Age was categorized into 4 groups: age 18 to 30, age 31 to 40, age
   41 to 50, and age 51 and over. In the first and second phase, compliance
   with health guidelines was highest among participants over the age of
   50. Knowledge was significantly higher in the second phase than in the
   first among participants over age 50 and those between the ages of 40
   and 50. In the second phase, knowledge did not differ by age group.
   Negative emotional reactions were significantly higher in the first
   phase than in the second. Moreover, negative emotional reactions were
   higher among participants up to age 30 than among all other
   participants. Perceived susceptibility did not differ by phase or by age
   group. The paper underscores the impact of age during the COVID-19
   epidemic and points to the necessity of taking the needs of different
   age groups into consideration.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives
   Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a common feature of mixed connective
   tissue disease. However, many patients do not meet the criteria for
   mixed connective tissue disease and thus may be diagnosed as
   interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features. The aim of this study
   was to characterize ILD associated with anti-ribonucleoprotein (RNP)
   antibodies. Methods
   Chest computed tomography scans of patients with anti-RNP antibody who
   were seen between January 2011 and October 2015 were reviewed. The
   underlying disease was classified with international criteria using
   clinical and serological features. Results
   Among 544 patients with anti-RNP antibodies, 188 had a chest computed
   tomography scan, and 48 (26\%) of them had radiological features of ILD.
   The presence of ILD was significantly associated with dyspnea, crackles,
   arthritis, Raynaud phenomenon, myositis, and sicca syndrome. The most
   frequent pattern was nonspecific interstitial pneumonia in 39 patients
   (81\%). Among patients with ILD, 17 (35\%) had a radiological pattern
   consisting of cysts and ground-glass attenuation not fulfilling the
   lymphoid interstitial pneumonia criteria. In 3 patients, cysts were
   related to fibrosis; in 14 patients, cysts corresponded to an original
   ILD pattern. Conclusions
   Interstitial lung disease was found in 26\% of patients with anti-RNP
   antibodies independently of the underlying disease. Anti-RNP-associated
   ILD mainly corresponds to nonspecific interstitial pneumonia or an
   original pattern consisting of cysts and ground-glass attenuation.}},

Title = {{A deep learning-based algorithm for detection of cortical arousal during
   sleep}},
Journal = {{SLEEP}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Study Objectives: The frequency of cortical arousals is an indicator of
   sleep quality. Additionally, cortical arousals are used to identify
   hypopneic events. However, it is inconvenient to record
   electroencephalogram (EEG) data during home sleep testing. Fortunately,
   most cortical arousal events are associated with autonomic nervous
   system activity that could be observed on an electrocardiography (ECG)
   signal. ECG data have lower noise and are easier to record at home than
   EEG. In this study, we developed a deep learning-based cortical arousal
   detection algorithm that uses a single-lead ECG to detect arousal during
   sleep.
   Methods: This study included 1,547 polysomnography records that met
   study inclusion criteria and were selected from the Multi-Ethnic Study
   of Atherosclerosis database. We developed an end-to-end deep learning
   model consisting of convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural
   networks which: (1) accepted varying length physiological data; (2)
   directly extracted features from the raw ECG signal; (3) captured
   long-range dependencies in the physiological data; and (4) produced
   arousal probability in 1-s resolution.
   Results: We evaluated the model on a test set (n = 311). The model
   achieved a gross area under precision-recall curve score of 0.62 and a
   gross area under receiver operating characteristic curve score of 0.93.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrated the end-to-end deep learning
   approach with a single-lead ECG has the potential to be used to
   accurately detect arousals in home sleep tests.}},

Journal = {{POLYMERS}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A novel Trichloromethane (TCM)/2,2,2-Trifluoroethanol (TFE) solvent
   system was developed for fabricating electrospun thermoplastic
   polyurethane (TPU) nanofibers. TPU solution stability made from this
   novel solvent system was improved compared to that from the traditional
   N, N-Dimethylformamide (DMF)/Tetrahydrofuran (THF) solvent system. The
   minimum TPU solution concentration that can be electrospun was decreased
   to 0.5\% w/v. The conductivity and viscosity of the TPU solution
   increased with the increasing ratio of TFE in the solvent system. The
   obtained electrospun TPU nanofibers fabricated from this novel solvent
   system showed smooth morphology and uniform diameter distribution.
   Mechanical strength of TPU nanofibers was improved using this new
   solvent system. Young's modulus and tensile strength of the electrospun
   TPU nanofiber meshes first decreased and then increased, while the
   strain elongation ratio first increased and then decreased. The new
   solvent system significantly improves the fiber elongation ratio while
   maintaining the modulus and tensile strength. The chemical structure of
   the TPU was not affected by the TCM/TFE solvent system. Electrospun TPU
   nanofiber meshes prepared by using the TCM/TFE solvent system showed
   better cytocompatibility, which means the electrospun TPU fibrous
   scaffold has great potential in biomedical application.}},

Abstract = {{An overview of current thermal challenges in transport electrification
   is introduced in order to underpin the research developments and trends
   of recent thermal management techniques. Currently, explorations of
   intelligent thermal management and control strategies prevail among car
   manufacturers in the context of climate change and global warming
   impacts. Therefore, major cutting-edge systematic approaches in
   electrified powertrain are summarized in the first place. In particular,
   the important role of heating, ventilation and air-condition system
   (HVAC) is emphasised. The trends in developing efficient HVAC system for
   future electrified powertrain are analysed. Then electric machine
   efficiency is under spotlight which could be improved by introducing new
   thermal management techniques and strengthening the efforts of driveline
   integrations. The demanded integration efforts are expected to provide
   better value per volume, or more power output/torque per unit with
   smaller form factor. Driven by demands, major thermal issues of
   high-power density machines are raised including the comprehensive
   understanding of thermal path, and multiphysics challenges are addressed
   whilst embedding power electronic semiconductors, non-isotropic
   electromagnetic materials and thermal insulation materials. Last but not
   least, the present review has listed several typical cooling techniques
   such as liquid cooling jacket, impingement/spray cooling and immersion
   cooling that could be applied to facilitate the development of
   integrated electric machine, and a mechanic-electric-thermal holistic
   approach is suggested at early design phase. Conclusively, a brief
   summary of the emerging new cooling techniques is presented and the keys
   to a successful integration are concluded.}},

Abstract = {{Bearings are vital parts of many mechanical equipment, the vibration
   signal analysis of bearings with local defects is important in guiding
   the fault diagnosis. In this paper, a dynamic analysis method is
   proposed to investigate the vibration response of the deep groove ball
   bearings (DGBBs) with local defect using a new displacement excitation
   function based on the Hertz contact theory and Newton's second law. The
   DGBB is modeled as a two degrees-of-freedom system, and an additional
   friction force in the defect zone, the influence of centrifugal force,
   the gravity of rolling elements, and lubrication traction/slip force
   between rolling elements and raceway are considered. And this model is
   used to study the dynamic signals of DGBB under different fault sizes
   and rotation speeds. Results indicate that the simulation signal has
   many continuous impacts and change over the time which is closer to the
   actual situation compared with the one-shot impulse function such as
   rectangular or half-sine or piecewise function when the rolling elements
   passed through the defect zone. Finally, the validity of the proposed
   model is verified by experiments. The simulated and experimental results
   indicate that the proposed model would achieve a more appropriate and
   accurate dynamic simulation.}},

Abstract = {{A summary of the diffusion and development of time-geography in East
   Asia, specifically in Japan and China, is presented in this article.
   Previous studies have provided reviews of time-geographic research and
   space-time behaviour research in both countries. Few studies, however,
   have told the story about how and why time-geography diffused into East
   Asia. By showing and analysing the academic life paths of Yoshio Arai
   and Yanwei Chai, we conclude that the development of time-geography in
   Japan and China goes hand in hand with their academic progress.
   Moreover, the interactions within their academic life paths mark some
   key events that promoted time-geography significantly. The similarities
   and differences between their academic life paths are also analysed in
   this article. Both scholars shared some common research topics, such as
   childcare problems, urban spatial structures and socioeconomic
   transformations, which were also the most prominent characteristics of
   time-geography in East Asia. In addition, the socioeconomic backgrounds
   of their academic life paths are also quite similar, which reflects the
   close relationship between time-geography and societal needs. Finally,
   this article discusses the effectiveness and disadvantages of the
   academic life path method, as the method has proven to be an important
   tool in analysing the role that key scholars play in promoting a certain
   discipline. In conclusion, the diffusion and development of
   time-geography in East Asia can hardly have happened without both
   individual scholars' hard work and the exchange and cooperation
   activities between scholars.}},

Abstract = {{Cronobacter spp. is a conditioned pathogen found mainly in milk powder;

   Knockout of bcsG in DSM 18707 was associated with markedly reduced
   biofilm formation and exopolysaccharide content relative to the wild
   type. Moreover, fluorescence microscopy revealed that the knockout
   mutants had comparatively lower biofilm density. In the knockout
   mutants, bcsA, flgJ, and flhE were up-regulated in the first three days

Title = {{Effects of Cold Stress and Ammonia Concentration on Productive
   Performance and Egg Quality Traits of Laying Hens}},
Journal = {{ANIMALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Simple Summary
   In the cold season, in order to alleviate the adverse effect of the low
   temperature, restricting or reducing ventilation is one of the common
   methods to preserve indoor heat to ensure the suitable temperature for
   hens in many poultry houses with no heating equipment. However,
   ventilation is the most important means to discharge ammonia in the
   house and ensure the indoor air quality in poultry farms. Measure of
   limiting ventilation to save energy usually causes the accumulation of
   gaseous ammonia released by poultry manure, which results in an
   increased indoor ammonia concentration. Therefore, studying the
   performance of laying hens exposed to a long-term ammonia concentration
   is of great significance for ventilation management in winter. In
   addition, it is not clear how the interaction between low temperature
   and ammonia concentration affects the performance of laying hens.
   Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effects of temperature,
   ammonia and their interaction on productive performance and egg quality
   of laying hens breeding from the start to the peak period of laying. The
   study is of great significance to the poultry industry regarding the
   ventilation management in winter from the perspective of controlling
   temperature and ammonia concentration. It is also a reference for
   ensuring layer productive performance and egg quality.
   In a cold climate, ensuring indoor air quality and heat preservation
   simultaneously has always been a difficult problem in the poultry house.
   The current study was carried out in order to determine the effects of
   chronic low temperature and ammonia concentration on productive
   performance and egg quality of commercial laying hens. 576 18-week-old
   Hy-line Brown hens were used in this study. Birds were housed in cages
   and received for 20-week exposure to low temperature and ammonia in six
   artificial environmental chambers. Birds were randomly assigned into six
   treatments: treatment 1 (T1, 20 degrees C, <= 5 ppm, control group),
   treatment 2 (T2, 20 degrees C, 20 ppm), treatment 3 (T3, 20 degrees C,
   45 ppm), treatment 4 (T4, 8 degrees C, <= 5 ppm), treatment 5 (T5, 8
   degrees C, 20 ppm) and treatment 6 (T6, 8 degrees C, 45 ppm). Daily feed
   intake (DFI), feed efficiency (FE), egg production (EP) and body weight
   (BW) were recorded and calculated from 19 weeks of age. Egg samples were
   collected at 22, 26, 30, 34 and 38 weeks of age and egg weight (EW),
   shell breaking strength (SBS), albumen height (AH), yolk weight (YW),
   shell weight (SW), shell thickness (ST) and Haugh unit (HU) were
   measured. The results of the present study indicated that low
   temperature and excessive ammonia decreased the EP of hens compared with
   those of the T1 birds. Low temperature increased DFI of hens thereby FE
   showed significant differences among treatments. During the early period
   of the experiment, low temperature treatment increased the BW of laying
   hens, but this trend of increase was suppressed by the treatment of
   ammonia with the prolongation of the experimental period. Egg quality
   was also affected by low temperature and excessive ammonia. At different
   experimental periods, egg quality traits of hens exposed to the cold and
   ammonia stress presented significant differences compared to those of
   control birds. The present study indicated that the effect of ammonia
   was more pronounced on hens than that of low temperature at the early
   and peak laying period in terms of several main traits of productive
   performance and egg quality under long term hens breeding.}},

Title = {{Rare fungus, Mortierella capitata, promotes crop growth by stimulating

   community}},
Journal = {{SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{151}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Rhizosphere and endosphere microorganisms are recognized as an extended
   plant genome. Changes in rhizosphere and endosphere microbial community
   structure are closely linked to plant nutrition uptake, development and
   immunity. Mortierella is a saprophytic oleaginous fungus, with various
   agricultural benefits, which have triggered interest in recent years.
   Here, we conducted Mortierella capitata inoculation experiments in a
   climate chamber. M. capitata inoculation increased biomass, chlorophyll
   and gibberellic acid content in maize. The concentration of available
   soil phosphorus was also increased, while O-2 concentration and soil
   density decreased. Further, the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial
   structure was evaluated by MiSeq sequencing. M. capitata inoculants
   increased rhizosphere bacterial diversity and significantly altered
   rhizosphere bacterial community composition. Yet, the influence of M.
   capitata on fungal community structure was not significant according to
   ANOSIM analysis. RNA-seq was used to ascertain differentially expressed
   genes (DEGs) in maize roots following M. capitata inoculation. Genes
   encoding chitinase, peroxidase, lipid transfer protein, sugars exported
   transporter, and various transcription factor proteins were
   significantly up-regulated. All the DEGs, soil and plant basic
   properties were used to construct a co-occurrence network for modularity
   analysis. The whole network was divided into five modules based on
   Louvain algorithm, including organic substances metabolism and hormone
   regulation, nucleobases metabolism, stimulus response, primary
   metabolism and an unknown module. The stimulus response module showed
   the closest correlation with biomass, soil oxygen, and M. capitata,
   while genes in the primary metabolism module were closely associated
   with plant gibberellic acid and available soil phosphorus. Our results
   highlight that the rare fungus M. capitata can promote crop growth
   directly by altering the root gene expression levels, and indirectly via
   interaction with indigenous rhizosphere bacteria.}},

Year = {{2020}},

Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The cultural meme is the smallest unit constituting a dynasty ` s
   culture, which has the same inheritance and variability as biological
   genes. Here, based on the name of cultural relics, we extract cultural
   memes through semantic word segmentation, word frequency statistics, and
   the synonym merging method, and construct dynasty cultural meme vectors.
   We analyzed color, auxiliary, texture, shape, and overall networks of
   five types of model to construct the culture network, using the social
   network analysis method, and explored the clustering and degrees of
   centrality characteristics of cultural memes. We then analyzed the
   similarities and differences among cultures of the dynasties. The main
   conclusions are as follows: (1) Cultural memes represent different
   cultural characteristics of dynasties, and the inheritance and
   differences among dynasties' cultures are closely related to their
   historical background. (2) Prevalence memes construct the cultural label
   of dynasties, which can roughly restore the cultural appearance of
   dynasties through fewer prevalence memes. (3) The use of community
   detection with a cultural meme network can determine the clustering of
   dynasties ` cultures, and the degree of centrality further reflects the
   main cultural characteristics presented by successive dynasties.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) on the magnetic
   vortex gyrations in a Permalloy nanodisk are investigated using
   micromagnetic simulation under the excitation of an out-of-plane
   spin-polarized current. It is found that spin-polarized current can
   drive the vortex to display two mode gyrations in the presence of DMI.
   Mode I gyration is like the conventional gyration studied in previous
   studies with the similar gyration radius, velocity and the
   eigenfrequency. However, the velocity of mode II gyration is about 2
   times higher than that of mode I gyration, but with half gyration
   radius. And the eigenfrequency in mode II gyration is higher than that
   in mode I gyration by one order of magnitude. In addition, simulation
   calculations reveal that the magnetic vortex of these two mode gyrations
   can be triggered to gyration in shorter time compared with the
   conventional gyration.}},

Abstract = {{Given that beta-lactam antibiotic resistance mediated by
   metallo-beta-lactamases (M beta Ls) seriously threatens human health, we
   designed and synthesized nineteen hydroxamic acids with
   benzenesulfonamide, which exhibited broad-spectrum inhibition against
   four tested M beta Ls ImiS, L1, VIM-2 and IMP-1 (except 6, 13 and 18 on
   IMP-1, and 18 on VIM-2), with an IC50 value in the range of 0.6-9.4,
   1.3-27.4, 5.4-43.7 and 5.2-49.7 mu M, respectively, and restored
   antibacterial activity of both cefazolin and meropenem, resulting in a
   2-32-fold reduction in MIC of the antibiotics. Compound 17 shows
   reversible competitive inhibition on L1 with a Ki value of 2.5 mu M and
   significantly reduced the bacterial load in the spleen and liver of mice
   infected by E. coli expressing L1. The docking studies suggest that 17
   tightly binds to the Zn(II) of VIM-2 and CphA by the oxygen atoms of
   sulfonamide group, but coordinates with the Zn(II) of L1 through the
   oxygen atoms of hydroxamic acid group. These studies reveal that the
   hydroxamic acids with benzenesulfonamide are the potent scaffolds for
   the development of M beta L inhibitors.}},

Title = {{A highly specific and sensitive fluorescence quenching probe for
   carcinoembryonic antigen detection based on tetrapod Au nanostars with
   Ag coating}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{25}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The fluorescence quenching properties of Ag-coated Au tetrapod nanostars
   have been studied via fluorescence spectroscopic techniques. Because of
   the intense plasmonic light absorption and the corresponding
   fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), the fluorescence
   quenching effect of Au tetrapod nanostars could be greatly enhanced by
   Ag coating. What's more, the fluorescence quenching ability of Ag-coated
   Au tetrapod nanostars could be further increased by tuning the size of
   inner Au tetrapod nanostars or the thickness of the outer Ag coating. In
   the study of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) detection based on the
   fluorescence probe of Ag-coated Au tetrapod nanostars, surface
   modification of antibody conjugation has been carried out to guarantee
   the specificity. Under the optimized conditions, the fluorescence
   efficiency of the Ag-coated Au tetrapod nanostars probe exhibits a
   linear response to CEA concentration ranging from 10-280 pg/mL, and the
   corresponding theoretical detection limit (LOD) is as low as 8.2 pg/mL.
   Interference experiment results shows that the influence from the
   interfering proteins could be neglected in the detection, and it has
   been successfully applied to detect CEA in real samples. Compared with
   other optical detection techniques of CEA, this method based on
   fluorescence quenching of Ag-coated Au tetrapod nanostars has better
   performance because of the special geometry features including regular
   tips and Ag coating.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrafine particles (UPs)/amorphous phases (APs) reinforced composites
   was deposited on the TA15 titanium alloy via a laser cladding (LC) of
   the Co-Al-B4C-CeO2 mixed powders; a LC technique (the laser power 900 W,
   the scanning speed 2.5 mm/s) favored APs/UPs to be produced owing to the
   transient existence of the laser molten pool (laser pool), its COF was
   in a range of 0.390-0.425. Then, the monolayer graphene oxide sheets
   (MGOSs)/ carbon nanotubes (CNTs) reinforced composites were formed on
   this LC fabricated coating by a mean of LC of
   Co-Al-B4C-CeO2-(MGOSs/CNTs). Noting that a laser beam irradiated on
   MGOSs/CNTs also the pre-melted powders, huge amounts of MGOSs/CNTs were
   melted but kept partial MGOSs/CNTs in the solid states; also lots of UPs
   were produced in the atomic arrangements of APs/MGOSs, considering that
   partial UPs could obtain large quantity of the energy from a laser beam,
   forming lattice distortions. Identification of the synthetic UPs and
   MGOSs/CNTs in such LC composites, more importantly an UPs' effect,
   contributes the theoretical/experimental basis to improve quality of the
   laser 3D print fabricated composites.}},

Title = {{The influence of Europa's plumes on its atmosphere and ionosphere}},
Journal = {{ICARUS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{352}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Europa, one of the Galilean satellites, has a tenuous, oxygen-dominated
   atmosphere that is usually referred to as a collision-less exosphere.
   Coupled to the neutral atmosphere and in contact with Europa's surface,
   a tenuous ionosphere exists on Europa, whose presence has been revealed
   by multiple observations. Such an ionosphere is thought to be produced
   by solar photoionization and electron-impact ionization of the oxygen in
   the atmosphere. However, a recent study showed that the maximum
   ionosphere coincides with intermittent water plume on Europa, suggesting
   that water plays an important role in the formation of the ionosphere.
   Based on the assumption of horizontal uniformity in the middle of the
   plume, we use the Caltech/Jet Propulsion Laboratory one-dimensional
   KINETICS model to construct profiles of neutral and ionized species near
   the plume region. The simulation results, which show that the ionization
   reactions are initiated by water electron-impact ionization and
   photoionization and continued by charge transfer between water and
   oxygen molecules, have successfully reproduced the observations. We find
   that H2O+ is the dominant species only above the ionopause. Below the
   ionopause, the density of H2O+ is orders of magnitude lower than the
   density of O-2(+), which is the major composition below the ionopause.
   Our model has also been used to study the dissociation processes of
   water molecules from the plumes, which can be regarded as an alternative
   source for the oxygen in the atmosphere.}},

   report the pH stimuli-responsive luminescent behavior of ZGMP and its
   possible mechanism. Taking the intriguing feature of pH responsive
   persistent luminescence, we explore ZGMP as autofluorescence-free probes
   to achieve stimuli-activated signal switch for biosensing by integrating
   enzyme catalysis reaction mediated pH modulation. The pH-responsive
   persistent luminescence also makes ZGMP promising for high-level

Abstract = {{A prediction method to improve the accuracy of fatigue life prediction
   for engine mounts is proposed, which is based on wavelength packet
   analysis and stress power density. The stress power spectral density of
   the fatigue failure site is simulated and experimentally verified
   through transfer function theory. The Dirlik method and bandwidth
   coefficient are used to determine fatigue life. The main frequency bands
   that affect life expectancy are analyzed through wavelet packet theory.
   And a bench test is performed to verify the results of different fatigue
   life prediction methods. Results revealed that wavelength packet
   analysis yields low relative errors between the predicted and
   experimental life expectancy. The prediction method based on wavelength
   packet analysis has high accuracy and will improve the results of the
   fatigue life prediction for key automobile components.}},

Abstract = {{The Hirota bilinear method is studied in a lot of local equations, but

   present more general bright soliton solutions, which describes the
   dynamics of soliton solutions in quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein
   condensations. Under some reasonable assumptions, one-bright-soliton and
   two-bright-soliton solutions are constructed analytically by the
   improved Hirota method. From the gauge equivalence, we can see the
   difference between the solutions of the nonlocal GP equation and the

Abstract = {{Starting with Hirota bilinear form of (2+1)-dimensional
   Caudrey-Dodd-Gibbon-Kotera-Sawada equation, a class of lump solutions, a
   strip soliton, a pair of resonance solitons as well as the rogue wave
   have been obtained through symbolic computation. Firstly, two lump
   solutions are derived, consisting of six free parameters, while the
   other three accord with non-zero determinant condition which guarantee
   locality and analyticity for the solutions. Secondly, the interaction
   phenomenon between a lump wave and a stripe soliton is reflected.
   Interaction figures show that the lump wave can be absorbed by the
   stripe wave or separate from it. Thirdly, by a novel ansatz of
   hyperbolic function and quadratic function, a fresh transformation for
   the rogue wave and a pair of resonance solitons have been discovered,
   that a peak profiled rogue wave emerges from one of the resonance wave
   and transfers to another, and finally fades away. At the same time,
   numerical simulations are demonstrated to visualize the mechanism of the
   above solutions.}},

   the safety potential field theory}},
Journal = {{PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{559}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{In order to adequately characterize the driving risks that vehicles face
   during the lane change process and ensure that vehicles perform safer
   lane change decisions, a vehicle lane change model based on the safe
   potential field theory is established in this paper. Firstly, the
   driving risk encountered during the vehicle lane-changing process is
   evaluated, and the spatial distribution of the safety potential field
   under different motion states during the vehicle driving process is
   given based on the potential field theory. Secondly, the critical
   distances between vehicles at the end of the lane-change process are
   summarized according to the distribution of different safety potential
   fields of relevant vehicles during the lane change process. Compared
   with the traditional critical distance calculation model, the method
   proposed in this paper can dynamically characterize the trend of the
   critical distance of the vehicle under different velocity and
   acceleration conditions. Based on this, according to the characteristics
   that various types of vehicle movement status can be perceived in
   real-time under the CAVs environment, the safety-critical time required
   for lane change under various motion states of the vehicle is
   summarized, and the minimum safety distance lane change model based on
   the safety potential field theory is finally established. Numerical
   simulation analysis of the model shows that the model can characterize
   the effects of various motion parameters on the lane change results. The
   research results can provide some theoretical support for related
   researches such as vehicle lane changing, vehicle autonomous driving,
   and vehicle group optimization control in the intelligent networked
   environment in the future. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: To investigate the protective effect of recombinant human
   brain natriuretic peptide (rhBNP) on myocardial injury after acute
   carbon monoxide poisoning (ACOP).
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients with
   ACOP and high risk of cardiac events admitted to our hospital, and
   grouped them into rhBNP group and control group according treatments
   they received. Patients in control group received conventional treatment
   while those in rhBNP group were treated with rhBNP intravenously for 72
   hours on the basis of conventional treatment. Levels of amino-terminal
   pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), cardiac troponin I (cTnI),
   serum creatine kinase MB fraction (CK-MB), aldosterone (ALD),
   angiotensin II (AT II), and endothelin-1 (ET-1) prior to and after
   treatment of rhBNP or conventional treatment were collected. Corrected
   QT dispersion (QTcd) results were calculated based on the
   electrocardiography data. The left ventricular end diastolic diameter
   (LVEDD), interventricular septal thickness (IVS), left ventricular
   ejection fraction (LVEF), and stroke output (SV) were measured using
   color Doppler echocardiography. Major adverse cardiovascular events
   (MACEs) that occurred within 1 month after treatment were recorded.
   Results: A total of 135 patients in the rhBNP group and 136 patients in
   the control group were enrolled. Baseline characteristics between the
   two groups were similar at admission. Levels of cTnI, CK-MB, and ET-1 in
   the rhBNP group were significantly lower than those in the control group
   at day 1, 2 and 3 after treatment (P<0.05). Compared with the control
   group, levels of QTcd, ALD and AT II in the rhBNP group were
   significantly lower at day 3 after treatment (P<0.05). After 7 days of
   treatment, the reduction of NT-proBNP in the rhBNP group was
   significantly greater than that in the control group at each clay
   (P<0.05), and LVEF, SV and LVEDD in the rhBNP group were all greater
   than those in the control group. After 1 month of treatment, the
   incidence of MACEs in the rhBNP group was significantly lower than that
   in the control group.
   Conclusions: For patients with ACOP and high risk of cardiac events,
   early treatment of rhBNP can protect injured cardiomyocytes, prevent the
   injury of carbon monoxide on heart, and reduce the incidence of MACE.}},

Title = {{Comparison of antimicrobial efficacy of eravacycline and tigecycline
   against clinical isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae in China: In vitro
   activity, heteroresistance, and cross-resistance}},

Abstract = {{Aims: The aims of this study were to compare the antimicrobial efficacy
   of Eravacycline (Erava) versus tigecycline (Tig) in vitro against
   clinical isolates of S. agalactiae from China and further to evaluate
   the heteroresistance risk and resistance mechanisms of Erava.
   Methods: 162 clinical isolates of S. agalactiae were collected
   retrospectively and the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of
   Erava and Tig were determined by agar dilution. Moreover, Tetracycline
   (Tet) specific resistance genes, genetic mutations in Tet target sites,
   and sequence types (ST) profiles of clinical isolates of S. agalactiae
   were investigated with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments. The
   heteroresistance frequency of Erava and Tig in S. agalactiae was
   analyzed by population analysis profiling. Furthermore, the resistance
   mechanisms of both Erava and Tig were investigated in antibiotic-induced
   resistant S. agalactiae isolates in vitro.
   Results: The MIC values of Erava and Tig were shown with <= 0.25 mg/L
   and <= 0.5 mg/L, respectively, against clinical S. agalactiae isolates,
   including that harboring the Tet-specific resistance genes tet(K),
   tet(M), or tet(O). The heteroresistance frequency of Tig among the
   clinical isolates of S. agalactiae was 1.84\% (3/162), whereas no
   positive Erava heteroresistance was found. The enhanced MIC values of
   both Erava and Tig in the heteroresistance-derivative S. agalactiae
   clones could be reversed by the efflux pump inhibition experiments.
   Genetic mutations affecting 30S ribosome units (16SrRNA copies or 30S
   ribosome protein S10) could result in the cross resistance toward Erava
   and Tig in the antibiotic-induced resistant S. agalactiae isolates in
   vitro.
   Conclusions: Erava MIC values were nearly half of that of Tig against
   the clinical isolates of S. agalactiae from China and genetic mutations
   in the 30S ribosome units of Tet target sites (16SrRNA copies or 30S
   ribosome protein S10) participated in the resistance evolution of both
   Erava and Tig under the antibiotic pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer/conductor composite dielectric materials have a high dielectric
   constant. In recent years, composite dielectrics have become a study
   hotspot in high-density energy storage capacitors. However, high
   dielectric loss and high electrical conductivity make the application of
   the composite materials very limited. In order to obtain composite
   materials with high dielectric constant, low dielectric loss and low
   conductivity, we added the insulating boron nitride (BN) filler into
   polymer/Cr2AlC composites. As a conductive filler, Cr2AlC
   ternary-layered-compound (MAX) ceramic has an interface polarization
   with the polymer matrix, thereby increasing the dielectric constant of
   the composites. The insulating BN has a very low electrical
   conductivity, which can effectively reduce the electrical conductivity
   and dielectric loss of the composites. Compared with the binary
   polymer/Cr AlC composite materials, the ternary polymer/Cr AlC/BN
   composite materials can achieve the low dielectric loss and low
   conductivity as well as properly-lowered dielectric constant. The
   ternary composite material filled with 10 wt\% Cr2AlC and 2 wt\% BN has
   a dielectric constant of about 30, a dielectric loss of about 0.7 and a
   conductivity of about 4.6 x 10(-7) S m(-1) at 100 Hz. In this work,
   high-performance composite dielectrics were prepared through good
   cooperation between conductive and insulating ceramic fillers, which
   might provide an idea for design of promising energy storage capacitors.}},

Abstract = {{Portland cement-based formulations blended with radiopacifying agents
   are popular endodontic materials for various root filling and pulp
   capping applications. Iodoform (CHI3) is an alternative candidate
   radiopacifier whose impact on the setting, bioactivity, antimicrobial
   properties and cytotoxicity of white Portland cement were evaluated in
   this study. Isothermal conduction calorimetry and Si-29 magic angle
   spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MAS NMR) showed that
   20 wt\% iodoform had no significant impact on the kinetics of cement
   hydration with respect to the formation of the major calcium silicate
   hydrate (C-S-H) gel product (throughout the 28-day observation).
   Conversely, transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that iodine
   was incorporated into the ettringite (Ca6Al2(SO4)(3)(OH)(12)center dot
   26H(2)O) product phase. Both iodoform-blended and pure Portland cements
   exhibited comparable biocompatibility with MG63 human osteosarcoma cells
   and similar bioactivity with respect to the formation of a
   hydroxyapatite layer upon immersion in simulated body fluid. By virtue
   of their high alkalinity, both cements inhibited the growth of
   Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli.
   However, in all cases, iodoform enhanced the antimicrobial effect and
   significantly reduced the minimum bactericidal concentration of the
   cement. In conclusion, iodoform offers antimicrobial advantages in
   Portland cement-based formulations where oral biofilm formation
   threatens the success of root filling materials and dentine substitutes.
   The reactivity with the calcium aluminosulfate components of the
   hydrating cement matrix warrants further research to understand the
   long-term stability of the cement matrix in the presence of iodoform.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{211}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The ``Nose-like{''} ion spectral structures are characterized by the
   deep inward penetration of ions from the near -Earth plasma sheet and
   can extend to low L shells in the inner magnetosphere. The stationary
   ``Nose-like{''} ion structures are believed to be driven by the
   stationary electric and magnetic field during quiet geomagnetic times.
   However, the global distribution picture, especially for each MLT, for
   both single and double stationary nose structures is still not reached.
   In this study, we statistically investigate the stationary
   ``Nose-like{''} ion spectral structure based on 2 years of Van Allen
   probes observations. We find a clear MLT dependence of the number of
   stationary noses, with a higher occurrence of single-nose structures
   from 13 to 03 MLT, while a higher occurrence of double-nose structures
   from 03 to 13MLT. This is confirmed by calculating the backward drift
   time using backward tracing method based on the dipole magnetic field
   and Weimer 96 electric field model for each MLT. Simulation results
   indicate that the ion spectral gap, which is formed due to long drift
   time or existence of the ion forbidden region, controls the nose
   structure at different MLT during geomagnetic quiet times. A possible
   physical explanation of this MLT dependence can be a combination of the
   ion spectral gaps created by the region of long drift time in the
   dayside within the nose energy range and the persistent dawn-dusk
   asymmetries in the convection electric field.}},

Journal = {{FLOW MEASUREMENT AND INSTRUMENTATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{76}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The online measurement of wet gas with extremely-low liquid loading
   (Lockhart-Martinelli parameter lower than 0.02) remains a challenge. In
   this study, three types of throttle devices, Venturi, orifice plate and
   cone, are compared experimentally with air-water two-phase flow in a
   horizontal pipe of inner diameter of 50 mm. High precision correlations
   are established to measure the gas and liquid flowrates via a single
   throttle device. Results show that the two-phase mass flow coefficient
   (K) of the three throttle devices all increase linearly with the liquid
   densiometric Froude number and the K correlations are established
   respectively to correct the gas mass flowrate deviation. The pressure
   loss ratio (delta) for Venturi is sensitive and monotonous to the liquid
   loading, which contributes to the high accuracy of liquid flowrate
   measurement. By incorporating the K correlations, both the gas and
   liquid mass flowrates can be predicted precisely. The relative error of
   the gas mass flowrate predicted by the Venturi is within +/- 2.0\% at
   95\% confidence level, and that of the liquid mass flowrate is within
   +/- 15\% at 90\% confidence level.}},

   forces of the friction disc in a planetary transmission system. In the
   MBD model, the radial clearance of the planet bearing is formulated, as
   well as the backlash between the outer gear teeth of the ring and
   friction disc teeth. However, the previous works in the literature only
   considered single radial clearance or backlash. The influences of the
   radial clearance of the planet bearing and backlash between the outer
   gear teeth of the ring and friction disc teeth on the vibrations and
   impact forces of the friction disc in the planetary transmission system
   are studied. The results give that a smaller radial clearance and
   backlash can be useful for decreasing both the vibrations and impact
   forces of the friction disc in the planetary transmission system. The
   MBD method can be applied to predict the vibrations and impact forces in
   the planetary transmission system as well.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid increase in the number of wireless devices in modern
   communication networks has significantly increased the number of
   interference sources, which severely impacts communication reliability.
   Adaptive interference cancellation is rapidly becoming a necessity for
   modern wireless networks. For interference cancellation, a digital
   beamformer adaptively adjusts its weight vector using an array
   processing algorithm. This, in turn, shapes the radiation pattern in a
   manner that minimizes interference power and maximizes the desired
   signal power. In this letter, we propose two
   atomic-norm-minimization-based methods to design a weight vector that
   can be used to cancel interference. We present numerical and
   experimental studies and compare with the minimum variance
   distortionless response beamformer, which outputs the highest possible
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). We show that our
   approach is robust to signal corruptions arising from carrier frequency
   offsets. Uniquely, our algorithm extracts the offset frequencies, thus
   enabling interference cancellation with maximum SINR.}},

Abstract = {{This study provides the evidence that the transactions of international
   investors in the stock market exacerbate the degree of market
   multifractality. We analyze shares cross-listed in an accessible market
   (H-shares in Hong Kong) and an inaccessible market (A-shares in mainland
   China) by applying the method of multifractal detrended fluctuation
   analysis (MF-DFA) from 01 January 2010 to 31 December 2019. The results
   based on MF-DFA confirm that the degree of multifractality in the
   accessible market is much stronger than the inaccessible market and
   intensifies with the increasing openness of the stock market. We find
   that the participations of international investors enhance the strength
   of multifractality by affecting both the long-range correlations and the
   fat tail distribution of the return series. Besides, the results also
   verify the impact of the stock market crash on multifractal strength.

Abstract = {{Polymer membranes for water treatment are constrained by the
   permeability-separation trade-off. Herein, two-dimensional (2D) zeolitic
   imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) made of benzimidazole interconnected with
   Zn ions are used to create 2D Zn-2(Bim)(4) molecular sieve nanosheets,
   which is explored as an asymmetric, thin-film composite (TFC)
   nanofiltration (NF) membrane for removing organic dyes and salts from
   water with a high water permeability under a low operating pressure (1
   bar). The 2D Zn-2(Bim)(4) TFC NF membrane is synthesized via ionic bonds
   between polycations and the peripheral hydroxy groups of 2D Zn-2(Bim)(4)
   nanosheets, regulating the assembly of 2D Zn-2(Bim)(4) to create a novel
   crack-free functional layer on top of a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)
   ultrafiltration membrane. FESEM and XPS confirmed the presence of a
   polycations-regulated ultrathin functional layer with a thickness of
   similar to 37 nm on the PVDF support. Benefiting from its structural
   feature, our 2D Zn-2(Bim)(4) TFC NF membrane could achieve an ultra-high
   flux of similar to 290 L/(m(2). h.bar) (5-10-fold higher than that of
   graphene-based membranes), good anti-fouling properties and high
   rejection rates (above 98\%) for organic dyes. Moreover, the
   desalinization rate is 50-75\%. That is, our membrane is endowed with NF
   capability, and its intrinsic ultrafiltration features (high water
   permeance, ultrafast, and energy-saving) are also well maintained. (C)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PROCESS CONTROL}},

Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{37-48}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Most modern chemical processes consist of a number of process units
   interconnected with mass and energy flows, often with energy integration
   and materials recycle loops. As such, faults (process faults, actuator
   faults, or sensor faults) often propagate to multiple process units
   (subsystems), causing significant difficulties in fault diagnosis for
   plantwide systems. In this paper, a general distributed fault diagnosis
   approach is proposed for plantwide chemical processes, which takes into
   account the interactions among process units. The distributed fault
   diagnostic observers are designed to be sensitive to the local faults
   (local sensitivity) and insensitive to faults in other process units
   (remote faults insensitivity) and disturbances. The above requirements
   are formulated as plantwide dissipativity conditions and the gains for
   the distributed estimators and residual generators are obtained offline
   by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. A case study of heat
   exchanger network is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed approach. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Magnesium alloys have been potential biodegradable implants in the areas
   of bone, cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal tract, and so on. The
   purpose of this study is to evaluate Mg-2Zn alloy degradation as a
   potential suture material. The study included Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats
   in vivo. In 24 male SD rats, tests in the leg muscle were conducted
   using traditional surgical incision and insertion of magnesium alloys of
   different designs into the tissue. The material degradation topography,
   elemental composition, and strength of the pins were analyzed. This
   paper explores magnesium pins with different cross-sectional shapes and
   diameters to establish a suitable pin diameter and shape for use as an
   oral stapler, which must have a good balance of degradation rate and
   strength. The results showed there were good bending strengths over
   different degradation periods in groups with diameters of 0.8 mm and 0.5
   mm, and no significantly different bending strength between the groups
   of triangle and round cross-section shapes with same diameter of 0.3 mm,
   although the degradation rate still needs to be improved.}},

Title = {{Adaptive Distance-Weighted Voronoi Tessellation for Remote Sensing Image
   Segmentation}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The spatial fragmentation of high-resolution remote sensing images makes
   the segmentation algorithm put forward a strong demand for noise
   immunity. However, the stronger the noise immunity, the more serious the
   loss of detailed information, which easily leads to the neglect of
   effective characteristics. In view of the difficulty of balancing the
   noise immunity and effective characteristic retention, an adaptive
   distance-weighted Voronoi tessellation technology is proposed for remote
   sensing image segmentation. The distance between pixels and seed points
   in Voronoi tessellation is established by the adaptive weighting of
   spatial distance and spectral distance. The weight coefficient used to
   control the influence intensity of spatial distance is defined by a
   monotone decreasing function. Following the fuzzy clustering framework,
   a fuzzy segmentation model with Kullback-Leibler (KL) entropy
   regularization is established by using multivariate Gaussian
   distribution to describe the spectral characteristics and Markov Random
   Field (MRF) to consider the neighborhood effect of sub-regions. Finally,
   a series of parameter optimization schemes are designed according to
   parameter characteristics to obtain the optimal segmentation results.
   The proposed algorithm is validated on many multispectral remote sensing
   images with five comparing algorithms by qualitative and quantitative
   analysis. A large number of experiments show that the proposed algorithm
   can overcome the complex noise as well as better ensure effective
   characteristics.}},

Title = {{Quasi-threshold phenomenon in noise-driven Higgins model}},
Journal = {{COMMUNICATIONS IN NONLINEAR SCIENCE AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{91}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The quasi-threshold phenomenon in Higgins model with mono-stability
   driven by Gaussian white noise is investigated. The initial excitation
   phase is identified as escaping event with a specific trajectory defined
   as the quasi-threshold. In the limit of weak noise, a group of
   differential equations governing the optimal exit path, quasi-potential
   and exponential prefactor are deduced via WKB approximation. Results
   show that the optimal path approaches the quasi-threshold with a nearly
   tangent way and almost follows the deterministic flow subsequently in
   the quasi-potential plateau, making it analogous to the bistable system.
   Numerical experiments verify not only the results of the optimal path
   but also the ones of the optimal fluctuational forces. Then the
   difference between the practical exit location and the position with
   minimal quasi-potential is also revealed by including the exponential
   prefactor into the expression of exit location distribution. Finally,
   the mean first passage time (MFPT) is evaluated theoretically with the
   secondary-order-approximation taken into consideration. These findings
   and computations shed light on exploring underlying qualitative
   mechanism and quantitative feature of excitation behaviors in biological
   systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the limited computing resources and battery capacity of existing
   mobile devices, it cannot meet the requirements of low load base station
   group for computing capacity and delay, and the emergence of mobile edge
   computing (MEC) technology provides the possibility for it. Therefore, a
   distributed task unloading strategy to low load base station group under
   MEC environment is proposed. Firstly, the communication resource,
   computing resource and task queue of low load base station group are
   modeled to quantify the energy cost in the process of task unloading.
   Then, the game theory is introduced, and the potential game model is
   used to solve the problem of distributed task unloading. The target
   function of energy optimization based on delay limitation is transformed
   into the potential game equation, and the mobile device selects MEC
   nodes according to the game results to calculate the unloading. Finally,
   based on the MATLAB platform, the algorithm is simulated, and the
   results show that the proposed potential game equation can converge to
   the Nash equilibrium. Compared with other algorithms, the proposed
   distributed task unloading algorithm can effectively save the energy
   consumption of task unloading.}},

Abstract = {{The Daqin Railway is China's first electrified double-track heavy-haul
   railway line dedicated to coal transportation. Over the years of
   operation, the tunnels have been covered with a thick layer of coal
   dust, which also pervades in the air. Worse is that the coal dust has
   even buried the rail joints in some sections, making the repair and
   maintenance of the line difficult. This paper introduces a coal-dust
   removal device for railway tunnels that integrates pipeline
   transportation with dust-collection techniques. The device is mainly
   composed of a power system, a conveying system, a dust-filtration and
   collection system, and a control and protection system. The key
   technical elements of the system, such as the dust-extraction method and
   dust-filtration and collection parameters, are optimized based on the
   characteristics of the coal dust in the tunnel (obtained via field
   trials), which greatly enhances the adaptability of the device.
   Coal-dust removal efficiency reached over 20 t/h, which improves the
   working environment, reduces the intensity of manual work required and
   solves the problem of coal-dust removal from the most polluted
   area-within 500 m of the tunnel entrance.}},

Journal = {{ANTIVIRAL RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Exposure to hepatitis E virus (HEV) bears a high risk of developing
   chronic infection in immunocompromised patients, including organ
   transplant recipients and cancer patients. We aim to identify effective
   anti-HEV therapies through screening and repurposing safe-in-human
   broad-spectrum antiviral agents. In this study, a safe-inhuman
   broad-spectrum antiviral drug library comprising of 94 agents was used.
   Upon screening, we identified gemcitabine, a widely used anti-cancer
   drug, as a potent inhibitor of HEV replication. The antiviral effect was
   confirmed in a range of cell culture models with genotype 1 and 3 HEV
   strains. As a cytidine analog, exogenous supplementation of pyrimidine
   nucleosides effectively reversed the antiviral activity of gemcitabine,
   but the level of pyrimidine nucleosides per se does not affect HEV
   replication. Surprisingly, similar to interferon-alpha (IFN alpha)
   treatment, gemcitabine activates STAT1 phosphorylation. This
   subsequently triggers activation of interferon-sensitive response
   element (ISRE) and transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs).
   Cytidine or uridine effectively inhibits gemcitabine-induced activation
   of ISRE and ISGs. As expected, JAK inhibitor 1 blocked IFN alpha, but
   not gemcitabine-induced STAT1 phosphorylation, ISRE/ISG activation, and
   anti-HEV activity. These effects of gemcitabine were completely lost in
   STAT1 knockout cells. In summary, gemcitabine potently inhibits HEV
   replication by triggering interferon-like response through STAT1
   phosphorylation but independent of Janus kinases. This represents a
   non-canonical antiviral mechanism, which utilizes the innate defense
   machinery that is distinct from the classical interferon response. These
   results support repurposing gemcitabine for treating hepatitis E,
   especially for HEV-infected cancer patients, leading to dual anti-cancer
   and antiviral effects.}},

Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{157}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the analytical process of the functionally graded
   porous (FGP) arch structure in an elevated thermal field. The FGP arch
   is reinforced by graphene platelets (GPLs). Analytical expressions are
   used to illustrate the distribution of the pores and GPLs in the cross
   profile. A small crown dent is considered by introducing a small point
   load on the crown portion. The nonlinear thin-walled shell theory is
   used to formulate the potential energy function of the deformed arch.
   Then, this energy function is expressed explicitly by assuming a cosine
   function to describe the radial displacement of the deformed arch. Two
   nonlinear formulae of equilibrium are obtained by differentiating the
   energy function, resulting in an implicit form of the critical
   temperature change, which reduces to an explicit form when the dent is
   negligible. Moreover, the derived analytical solutions are verified by
   an aluminum ring with homogeneity. Finally, an analysis is developed to
   estimate the effect of various geometric and material parameters on the
   critical temperature changes and the equilibrium plots.}},

Journal = {{ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{For higher integration density, X-band power amplifiers (PAs) with CMOS
   technology have been widely discussed in recent publications. However,
   with reduced power supply voltage and device size, it is a great
   challenge to design a compact PA with high output power and power-added
   efficiency (PAE). In the proposed design, a 40-nm standard CMOS process
   is used for higher integration with other RF building blocks, compared
   with other CMOS PA designs with larger process node. Transistor cells
   are designed with neutralization capacitors to increase stability and
   gain performance of the PA. As a trade-off among gain, output power, and
   PAE, the transistor cells in driving stage and power stage are biased
   for class A and class AB operation, respectively. Both transistor cells
   consist of two transistors working in differential mode. Furthermore,
   transformer-based matching networks (TMNs) are used to realize a
   two-stage X-band CMOS PA with compact size. The PA achieves an effective
   conductivity (EC) of 117.5, which is among the highest in recently
   reported X-band PAs in CMOS technology. The PA also attains a saturated
   output power (Psat) of 20.7 dBm, a peak PAE of 22.4\%, and a gain of
   25.6 dB at the center frequency of 10 GHz under a 1 V supply in 40-nm
   CMOS.}},

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to explore the risk factors of diabetes
   peripheral neuropathy (DPN) in type 2 diabetes mellitus, and to propose
   corresponding nursing intervention measures to provide the basis for
   early diagnosis, treatment and prevention of DPN. A retrospective
   analysis was performed on 130 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
   (T2DM) in the communities surrounding our hospital from January 2017 to
   June 2018. They were divided into a DPN group (62 cases) and non-DPN
   group (control group, 68 cases). First, a univariate analysis was
   performed. DPN or non-DPN were used as dependent variables, and
   statistically significant parameters in univariate analysis were used as
   independent variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was
   included to analyze the peripheral nerves in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
   At the same time, the patients with DPN were given individualized
   comprehensive nursing intervention. Univariate analysis showed that body
   mass index (BMI), diabetes duration, smoking history, drinking history,
   family history of diabetes, fasting blood glucose (FBG), postprandial
   blood glucose (PBG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), triglyceride (TG),
   high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), systolic blood pressure,
   24-h urine microalbumin excretion (24hmALB), glomerular filtration rate
   (GFR), serum creatinine in DPN group were significantly different from
   those in the control group (P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed
   that the duration of diabetes, PBG, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c),
   HDL-C, 24hmALB, and GFR were independent risk factors for DPN. The
   quality of life {[}Physiological function (PF), Role-physical (RP),
   Role-emotional (RE), General health (GH), Social function (SF), Mental
   health (MH), Bodily pain (BP), Vitality (VT)] in the DPN group was
   significantly improved after six months of individualized nursing
   intervention compared with that before intervention (P<0.05). In
   conclusion, the high risk factors of DPN should be identified as early
   as possible, to prevent and delay the occurrence and development of
   diabetes peripheral neuropathy, so as to improve the quality of life of
   these patients.}},

Title = {{Memory-aware resource management algorithm for low-energy cloud data
   centers}},

Abstract = {{The continuous advancement of cloud computing technology has driven the
   vigorous development of cloud data centers. This manifests itself not
   only in increasing numbers, but also in rapid expansion scale. At the
   same time, the problems of high energy consumption, high cost and high
   carbon emissions began to stand out. These factors have become a
   bottleneck restricting the further development of cloud computing
   technology. As a result of the application of virtualization technology,
   mature cloud service providers use virtual machines instead of physical
   machines to provide users with computing, storage and other services.
   Therefore, the scheduling algorithm of cloud tasks and virtual machines
   has been widely studied by academia as a core problem. However, most of
   the current cloud data center resource management algorithms take CPU
   utilization as the main consideration, and increase the CPU utilization
   through virtual machine integration to reduce the energy consumption of
   cloud data centers. However, these algorithms will cause waste and low
   utilization of other resources in the cloud data center due to excessive
   consideration of CPU utilization. This paper systematically analyzes the
   mapping relationship between cloud tasks, virtual machines and physical
   machines. At the same time, the performance of cloud tasks, virtual
   machines, and physical machines is modeled in the cloud data center. By
   comprehensively considering the CPU and memory characteristics of cloud
   tasks, the memory priority cloud task mapping rule is established. Based
   on the rule, the memory-aware resource management algorithm for
   low-energy cloud data centers (MALE) is proposed. The algorithm maps
   cloud tasks and deploys virtual machines according to the memory
   requirements of the cloud tasks, thereby achieving the goal of
   simultaneously reducing the total fee of cloud users and the energy
   consumption of cloud data centers. Finally, the algorithm is compared
   with the other three algorithms. The experimental simulation results
   show that the effect of the proposed algorithm in this paper is
   significantly better than the comparison algorithm for the total fee of
   cloud users and the energy consumption of the cloud data center. (C)

   sulfide based on AgCl-Ag coupled with porous carbon nitride}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{532}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we report the development of indirect Z-scheme
   heterojunction to construct a cathodic photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor
   for highly-selective detection of endogenous H2S using AgCl-Ag
   core-shell nanostructures coupled with porous carbon nitride (PCN) as
   cathode materials. As an electron mediator, Ag on the Z-scheme
   heterojunction transformed to Ag2S in the presence of H2S, resulting in
   the destruction of original charge-carrier migration pathway. Meanwhile,
   photo-induced charges on the then formed AgCl-Ag2S/PCN cannot be as
   effectively separated as they are on AgCl-Ag/PCN due to the straddling
   energy band alignments. A decrease in cathodic signal may be expected.
   Consequently, the H2S concentration could be quantitated by such
   corresponding decrease, which thus underlines a novel signal-off
   cathodic PEC bioanalysis strategy. More importantly, the `Z-scheme' PEC
   sensor based on AgCl-Ag/PCN exhibits analytical performance with high
   sensitivity, showing its potential to be applied to the areas of

Title = {{Cyclic-di-GMP Regulates the Quorum-Sensing System and Biocontrol
   Activity of Pseudomonas fluorescens 2P24 through the RsmA and RsmE
   Proteins}},
Journal = {{APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Pseudomonas fluorescens 2P24 is a rhizosphere bacterium that protects
   many crop plants against soilborne diseases caused by phytopathogens.
   The Pcol/PcoR quorum-sensing (QS) system and polyketide antibiotic
   2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (2,4-DAPG) are particularly relevant to the
   strain's biocontrol potential. In this study, we investigated the
   effects of c-di-GMP on the biocontrol activity of strain 2P24. The
   expression of the Escherichia coil diguanylate cyclase (YedQ) and
   phosphodiesterase (YhjH) in P. fluorescens 2P24 significantly increased
   and decreased the cellular concentration of c-di-GMP, respectively. The
   production of the QS signals N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) and
   2,4-DAPG was negatively regulated by c-di-GMP in 2P24. The regulatory
   proteins RsmA and RsmE were positively regulated by c-di-GMP. Genomic
   analysis revealed that 2P24 has 23 predicted proteins that contain
   c-di-GMP-synthesizing or -degrading domains. Among these proteins,
   C0J56\_12915, C0J56\_13325, and C0156\_27925 contributed to the
   production of c-di-GMP and were also involved in the regulation of the
   QS signal and antibiotic 2,4-DAPG production in P. fluorescens.
   Overexpression of C0156\_12915, C0J56\_13325, and C0156\_27925 in 2P24
   impaired its root colonization and biocontrol activities. Taken
   together, these results demonstrated that c-di-GMP played an important
   role in fine-tuning the biocontrol traits of P. fluorescens.
   IMPORTANCE In various bacteria, the bacterial second messenger c-di-GMP
   influences a wide range of cellular processes. However, the function of
   c-di-GMP on biocontrol traits in the plant-beneficial rhizobacteria
   remains largely unclear. The present work shows that the QS system and
   polyketide antibiotic 2,4-DAPG production are regulated by c-di-GMP
   through RsmA and RsmE proteins in P. fluorescens 2P24. The diguanylate
   cyclases (DGCs) C0J56\_12915, C0156\_13325, and C0156\_27925 are
   especially involved in regulating the biocontrol traits of 2P24. Our
   work also demonstrated a connection between the Gac/Rsm cascade and the
   c-di-GMP signaling pathway in P. fluorescens.}},

Title = {{Pre-operative prognostic nutritional index was associated with
   recurrence after surgery in giant cell tumor of bone patients}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BONE ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{25}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Giant cell tumors of bone (GCT) are benign with a local
   recurrence rate of approximately 20-50\%. Growing evidence suggests that
   inflammation plays an important role in tumor formation and progression.
   Inflammatory biomarkers, including prognostic nutritional index (PNI),
   neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio
   (PLR), have little data in predicting postoperative recurrence of GCT.
   Methods: We retrospectively investigated 105 patients with surgery for
   GCT between March 2010 and June 2019 at our hospital. Through the
   analysis of receiver operating characteristics (ROC), the optimal cutoff
   values of PNI, NLR and PLR were determined. Clinical features between
   PNI, NLR and PLR were tested with the chi(2) test. Univariate and
   multivariate analyses were applied to identify the prognostic factors.
   Results: The optimal cut-off points of PNI, NLR and PLR were 48.6, 2.4
   and 136.9, respectively. In univariate analysis, PNI, NLR, PLR, tumor
   size, Campanacci stage were significantly associated with
   recurrence-free survival (RFS). Cox multivariate regression analysis
   revealed that the PNI (p = 0.003) and Campanacci stage (p = 0.001) were
   independent prognostic factors for GCT.
   Conclusions: PNI can be regarded as a novel independent prognostic
   factor for predicting postoperative recurrence in GCT.}},

   channel sections under combined compression and major axis bending

Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{157}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an in-depth experimental and numerical investigation
   into the behaviour of laser-welded stainless steel channel sections
   under combined compression and bending moment about the major axis. Two
   laser-welded austenitic stainless steel plain channel sections were
   considered in the experimental investigation, and for each channel
   section, four eccentrically loaded stub column tests were conducted
   under various initial loading eccentricities. The experimental results
   were then adopted in a numerical investigation for the validation of
   finite element models, by means of which parametric studies were
   conducted to generate further structural performance data over a wider
   range of cross-section sizes and initial loading eccentricities. Both
   the obtained experimental and numerical results were carefully analysed
   and then used to evaluate the accuracy of the current codified design
   rules for welded stainless steel channel sections under combined
   compression and major axis bending. The evaluation results generally
   revealed that the codified design rules yield excessively conservative
   and scattered resistance predictions, owing to the neglect of the
   favourable material strain hardening of stainless steel and the
   beneficial stress redistribution within channel sections under combined
   loading. An improved design approach has been proposed through extension
   of the deformation-based continuous strength method (CSM) to the case of
   laser-welded stainless steel channel sections under combined compression
   and major axis bending. Quantitative evaluation of the new design
   approach was made through comparing the predicted resistances against
   the experimental and numerical failure loads, with the results revealing
   that the new design approach yields a much higher level of design
   accuracy and consistency than the current codified design rules.
   Finally, statistical analyses have been conducted to confirm the
   reliability of the new design approach according to EN 1990.}},

Abstract = {{Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) is a member of the Mycobacterium
   tuberculosis complex imposing a high zoonotic threat to human health.
   The limited efficacy of BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) and upsurges of
   drug-resistant tuberculosis require new effective vaccination approaches
   and anti-TB drugs. Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) is a
   preferential drug delivery system candidate. In this study, we
   formulated PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulating the recombinant
   protein bovine neutrophil beta-defensin-5 (B5), and investigated its
   role in immunomodulation and antimicrobial activity against M. bovis
   challenge. Using the classical water-oil-water solvent-evaporation
   method, B5-NPs were prepared, with encapsulation efficiency of 85.5\%
   +/- 2.5\%. These spherical NPs were 206.6 +/- 26.6 nm in diameter, with
   a negatively charged surface (zeta-potential -27.1 +/- 1.5 mV). The
   encapsulated B5 protein from B5-NPs was released slowly under
   physiological conditions. B5 or B5-NPs efficiently enhanced the
   secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1
   beta and IL-10 in J774A.1 macrophages. B5-NPs-immunized mice showed
   significant increases in the production of TNF-alpha and immunoglobulin
   A (IgA) in serum, and the proportion of CD4(+) T cells in spleen
   compared with B5 alone. In immunoprotection studies, B5-NPs-immunized
   mice displayed significant reductions in pulmonary inflammatory area,
   bacterial burden in the lungs and spleen at 4-week after M. bovis
   challenge. In treatment studies, B5, but not B5-NPs, assisted rifampicin
   (RIF) with inhibition of bacterial replication in the lungs and spleen.
   Moreover, B5 alone also significantly reduced the bacterial load in the
   lungs and spleen. Altogether, our findings highlight the significance of
   the B5-PLGA NPs in terms of promoting the immune effect of BCG and the
   B5 in enhancing the therapeutic effect of RIF against M. bovis.}},

Abstract = {{Galectin-8 and galectin-9 belong to tandem repeat-type galectins, and in
   the present study, these two genes were cloned in mandarin fish
   Siniperca chuatsi. The open reading frame (ORF) of the mandarin fish
   galectin-8 and galectin-9 contains 942, and 1008 bp, encoding 313 and
   335 amino acids, respectively. As a conserved feature, an N-terminal
   carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), and a C-terminal CRD were
   observed in each of the two galectins in mandarin fish. In healthy fish,
   galectin-8 and -9 were constitutively expressed in all organs/tissues
   examined, and their expression can be induced following the stimulation
   of LPS and poly(I:C). It is obvious that galectin-8 had a higher
   increase at mRNA level following the stimulation of poly(I:C). It is
   further demonstrated that mandarin fish galectin-8 inhibited the growth
   of Flavobacterium columnare and Streptococcus agalactiae, and in
   addition to the two species of bacteria, galectin-9 inhibited also the
   growth of Edwardsiella piscicida, which provides the basis for further
   understanding their antibacterial role in immune response of mandarin

Title = {{Fiber optic sensors enabled monitoring of thermal curling of concrete
   pavement slab: Temperature, strain and inclination}},
Journal = {{MEASUREMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{165}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{An intellectual system is developed to monitor concrete pavement slab
   subjected to external temperature fluctuations. Truly distributed
   fiber-optic temperature and strain sensors and an innovative Fabry-Perot
   interferometer-based optical fiber inclinometer are installed in the
   concrete pavement slab so as to monitor and evaluate its thermal curling
   process. The system is demonstrated to be effective in detecting the
   thermal curling of slab. The results substantiate that the top surface
   of the slab has a fast reaction rate to the heating/cooling process. The
   bottom surface temperature has a time-lag comparing to the top surface,
   which results in a sharp increase then a slow reduction in the
   top-vs-bottom temperature difference. In the light of the inclinometer,
   it is proven that the tilt angle of the curvature of the slab has a high
   degree of synchronization with the top-vs-bottom temperature difference.
   The temperature/strain distribution maps are also presented and uneven
   distributions of temperature and strain are captured. Moreover, taking
   the advantage of the multiplexing capacity of the distributed
   fiber-optic sensors, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the
   slab can be easily obtained and used to feed a finite element model.
   Finally, a three-dimensional finite element model is established to
   completely understand the curling process measured from the monitoring
   system. The model and the experimental data agree well with each other.
   While the sensors output realistic temperature and deformations at
   certain locations, the validated model is able to reveal more details of
   the nonlinearity inside the slab. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   providers or operators need to be aware of environmental protection and
   make products comply with the restrictions of international
   environmental regulations. Therefore, this study proposes a set of
   multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches for systematic green
   outsourcing evaluation. First, a team of experts is established to
   discuss mutually dependent relationships among criteria, and the
   decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) technique is
   applied to generate subjective influential weights. Then, a large amount
   of data from outsourcing providers is collected, and the criteria
   importance through the intercriteria correlation (CRITIC) method is used
   to obtain the objective influential weights. Finally, a novel
   classifiable technique for ordering preference based on similarity to
   ideal solutions (classifiable TOPSIS) is proposed to integrate the
   performance of green outsourcing providers and classify them into four
   levels. The classifiable TOPSIS improves the shortcomings of
   conventional TOPSIS and establishes a visual rating diagram to help
   decision-makers to distinguish the performance of outsourcing providers
   more clearly. Taking a Taiwanese multinational machine tool manufacturer
   as an example, the performance of outsourcing providers related to
   manufacturing activities was investigated to demonstrate the
   effectiveness and applicability of this proposed model.}},

Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Tuberculosis disease is a major global public health concern and the
   growing prevalence of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis is
   making disease control more difficult. However, the increasing
   application of whole-genome sequencing as a diagnostic tool is leading
   to the profiling of drug resistance to inform clinical practice and
   treatment decision making. Computational approaches for identifying
   established and novel resistance-conferring mutations in genomic data
   include genome-wide association study (GWAS) methodologies, tests for
   convergent evolution and machine learning techniques. These methods may
   be confounded by extensive co-occurrent resistance, where statistical
   models for a drug include unrelated mutations known to be causing
   resistance to other drugs. Here, we introduce a novel `cannibalistic'
   elimination algorithm ({''}Hungry, Hungry SNPos{''}) that attempts to
   remove these co-occurrent resistant variants. Using an M. tuberculosis
   genomic dataset for the virulent Beijing strain-type (n = 3,574) with
   phenotypic resistance data across five drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin,
   ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and streptomycin), we demonstrate that this
   new approach is considerably more robust than traditional methods and
   detects resistance-associated variants too rare to be likely picked up
   by correlation-based techniques like GWAS.
   Author summary
   Tuberculosis is one of the deadliest infectious diseases, being
   responsible for more than one million deaths per year. The causing
   bacteria are becoming increasingly drug-resistant, which is hampering
   disease control. At the same time, an unprecedented amount of bacterial
   whole-genome sequencing is increasingly informing clinical practice. In
   order to detect the genetic alterations responsible for developing drug
   resistance and predict resistance status from genomic data,
   bio-statistical methods and machine learning models have been employed.
   However, due to strongly overlapping drug resistance phenotypes and
   genotypes in multidrug-resistant datasets, the results of these
   correlation-based approaches frequently also contain mutations related
   to resistance against other drugs. In the past, this issue has often
   been ignored or partially resolved by either restricting the input data
   or in post-analysis screening-with both strategies relying on prior
   information. Here we present a heuristic algorithm for finding
   resistance-associated variants and demonstrate that it is considerably
   more robust towards co-occurrent resistance compared to traditional
   techniques. The software is available at https://github.com/julibeg/HHS.}},

Abstract = {{This article discusses the relationship between cinephilia and
   cinematographic canon, analyzing the paradox that the presence of
   television series in that canon represents for the period 2010-2019. To
   create a canon thoroughly, it is necessary to analyse the habits and
   behaviour of cinephiles, as well as the possibilities of accessing the
   film heritage. Beside the rise of streaming platform, the number of
   cinema -goers rose in the period under review. Streaming platforms are a
   complement to the Big Screen. Finally, after the analysis of the
   symbiosis between cinema and television, it has been analyzed the
   presence of series in the cinematographic canon for specialized
   magazines. The analysis is based on the selection of six worldwide
   publications. It has been revised the lists published by those
   magazines, at the end of the year, as well as the lists with the best
   films of the decade, during the period 2010-2019, and as a result,
   television series appear on several lists. The differences between
   cinema and television are becoming increasingly blurred.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-mission satellite altimetry (e.g., ERS, Envisat, TOPEX/Poseidon,
   Jason) data have enabled a synoptic-scale view of ocean variations in
   past decades. Since 2016, the Sentinel-3 mission has provided better
   spatial and temporal sampling compared to its predecessors. The
   Sentinel-3 Ku/C Radar Altimeter (SRAL) is one of the synthetic aperture
   radar altimeters (SAR Altimeter) which is more precise for coastal and
   lake observations. The article studies the performance of the Sentinel-3
   Level-2 sea level altimetry products in the coastal areas of the Baltic
   Sea and on two lakes of Estonia. The Sentinel-3 data were compared with
   (i) collocated Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) ship
   measurements, (ii) the Estonian geoid model (EST-GEOID2017) together
   with sea-level anomaly corrections from the tide gauges, and (iii)
   collocated buoy measurements. The comparisons were carried out along
   seven Sentinel-3A/B tracks across the Baltic Sea and Estonian lakes in
   2019. In addition, the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service
   (CMEMS) Level-3 sea-level products and the Nucleus for European
   Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) reanalysis outcomes were compared with
   measurements from Estonia's 21 tide gauges and the buoy deployed
   offshore. Our results showed that the uncertainty of the Sentinel-3
   Level-2 altimetry product was below decimetre level for the seacoast and
   the selected lakes of Estonia. Results from CMEMS Level-3 altimetry
   products showed a correlation of 0.83 (RMSE 0.18 m) and 0.91 (RMSE 0.27
   m) when compared against the tide gauge measurements and the NEMO model,
   respectively. The overall performance of the altimetry products was very
   good, except in the immediate vicinity of the coastline and for the
   lakes, where the accuracy was nearly three times lower than for the open
   sea, but still acceptably good.}},

Abstract = {{An in-depth understanding of lung cancer biology and mechanisms of tumor
   progression has facilitated significant advances in the treatment of
   lung cancer. There remains a pressing need for the development of
   innovative approaches to detect and intercept lung cancer at its
   earliest stage of development. Recent advances in genomics,
   computational biology, and innovative technologies offer unique
   opportunities to identify the immune landscape in the tumor
   microenvironment associated with early-stage lung carcinogenesis, and
   provide further insight in the mechanism of lung cancer evolution. This
   review will highlight the concept of immunoediting and focus on recent
   studies assessing immune changes and biomarkers in pulmonary
   premalignancy and early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. A protumor
   immune response hallmarked by an increase in checkpoint inhibition and
   inhibitory immune cells and a simultaneous reduction in antitumor immune
   response have been correlated with tumor progression. The potential
   systemic biomarkers associated with early lung cancer will be
   highlighted along with current clinical efforts for lung cancer
   interception. Research focusing on the development of novel strategies
   for cancer interception prior to the progression to advanced stages will
   potentially lead to a paradigm shift in the treatment of lung cancer and
   have a major impact on clinical outcomes. See all articles in this CEBP

Title = {{Investigation of cobalt hydroxysulfide as a new anode material for
   Li-ion batteries and its conversion reaction mechanism with Li-ions}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{401}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Multicomponent transition metal compounds (TMCs) with multiple anions
   have been actively researched due to their superior electrochemical
   properties. They transform into heterostructured materials with
   different band gaps during electrochemical reactions. This study is the
   first to introduce metal hydroxysulfide as an efficient anode material
   for use in lithium (Li)-ion batteries (LIBs). A model compound, cobalt
   hydroxysulfide (CoOHS) was employed to explore certain conversion
   reaction mechanisms with Li-ions. The reversible conversion reaction
   mechanism of CoOHS can be described by the reaction: 2Co + 2LiOH +
   2Li(2)S <-> Co(OH)(2) + CoS2 + 6Li(+) + 6e(-). Bare CoOHS showed a fast
   Li diffusion rate with high electrochemical kinetic properties, even at
   high current densities. To enhance its electrochemical properties, CoOHS
   was then successfully embedded within porous hollow carbon nanospheres
   using a facile two-step reaction process. In this respect, cobalt
   hydroxycarbonate was embedded within carbon shells using an in-situ
   precipitation process and transformed into CoOHS via a room temperature
   sulfidation process. The synergetic effect of the heterostructured
   interface originated from the high electrical conductivity of the
   double-anion transition metal compound and carbon shell, which
   contributed to the long-term cycle stability and superior rate
   capability of the newly designed anode material.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a numerical simulation is used to analyze heat-exchange
   behaviors of a double tube heat exchanger with a staggered oval
   cross-section pipe as the inner pipe. In addition, non-Newtonian
   nanofluid and water are considered to be the working fluid, respectively
   flowing in the inner tube and outer tube. The non-Newtonian nanofluid is
   composed of non-Newtonian base fluid and nanoparticle. Besides, a
   single-phase fluid model was adopted. The purpose of this study is to
   investigate the heat exchange behavior of non-Newtonian nanofluid
   concerning different flow behavior index, the inlet velocity and
   nanoparticle volume fraction. Therefore, the velocity distribution,
   isotherms contours, synergy angle distribution, the Nusselt number,
   pressure drop and performance evaluation criterion (PEC) had been
   studied and calculated. It can be discovered that the heat transfer
   performance becomes better when the flow behavior index decreases; the
   inlet velocity of the inner pipe decreases; the inlet velocity of the
   outer pipe increases and nanoparticle volume fraction decreases.}},

Abstract = {{A series of composite membranes based on sulfonated poly(arylene ether
   nitriles) (SPEN) with embedded tungstophosphoric acid (TPA) were
   prepared. The effect of TPA concentration on morphology, structure,
   thermal stability, mechanical strength, ion-exchange capacity and proton
   conductivity of SPEN-TPA composite membranes was studied in detailed.
   SEM images indicated the TPA were uniformly distributed throughout the
   SPEN membranes matrix, which is due to the hydrogen bonding networks and
   the electrostatic interactions in the composites. The existence of
   hydrogen bonds was also confirmed by FTIR. Benefiting from these, the
   composite membranes showed higher IEC, mechanical strength, and higher
   water uptake compared to pristine SPEN. The proton conductivity of the
   SPEN-TPA composite membranes were dominated by the TPA concentration.
   The proton conductivity of SPEN-50TPA achieved the highest value of
   0.107 S/cm at 80 degrees C, which is 4.4 times as high as that of
   pristine SPEN. Moreover, it also showed excellent long-term stability,
   as the TPA did not show any leakage after 120 h at 80 degrees C.
   Furthermore, activation energy of proton conductivity imply coexistence
   of Grotthuss and vehicle mechanisms in the composite membranes. These
   results indicate that SPEN-TPA composite membrane have great potential
   as proton exchange membrane with high performance.}},

Abstract = {{Debate continues about the benefits of adjuvant treatment in patients
   with T1a/b, node-negative, human epidermal growth factor receptor
   2-positive breast cancer. Using a population-based database, we found
   chemotherapy failed to render survival benefits for the cohort. Estrogen
   receptor status, rather than tumor size, was significantly associated
   with survival, which should be taken into account when making clinical
   decisions.
   Background: We conducted this study to evaluate whether patients with
   T1a/b, node-negative (N-\_), human epidermal growth factor receptor
   2-positive (HER2(+)) breast cancers benefited from adjuvant therapy, and
   explored better treatment strategies for these patients. Patients and
   Methods: Patients with T1a/b, N-, HER2(+) breast cancers during 2000
   through 2004 were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
   End Results (SEER) database. The Gray test was used to evaluate breast
   cancer-specific death (BCSD) and non-BCSD. To identify patients more
   suitable for chemotherapy, subgroup analyses were conducted according to
   tumor size and estrogen receptor (ER) status, and plots of hazard rate
   of death (HRD) were drawn to present the changes of BCSD. Results: A
   total of 2940 patients with T1a/b, N-, HER2(+) breast cancers were
   included; more patients in the T1b group received chemotherapy compared
   with the T1a group (65.18\% vs. 29.30\%; P < .001). Patients receiving
   chemotherapy did not benefit from it (5-year incidences of BCSD: 1.00\%
   in the non-chemotherapy group vs. 1.18\% in the chemotherapy group; P =
   .853). Compared with those in the Tla group, patients in the T1b group
   had similar prognosis (P = .532), whereas ER status was significantly
   associated with survival (P = .048). HRD had a peak in years 2 to 5,
   which was more obvious in the ER group. Conclusion: Chemotherapy, which
   is mainly decided by tumor size, fails to render survival benefits for
   patients with T1a/b, N-, HER2(+) breast cancers. ER status, rather than
   tumor size, is important for clinicians to make adjuvant treatment
   decisions. The peak of BCSD occurs 2 to 5 years after diagnosis, and an
   at least 5-year follow-up is recommended for these patients. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{A comprehensive study on the resistivity, magnetization and
   microstructure is carried out to understand the superconductivity and
   flux pinning behavior of hot-pressed Sr(0.6)K(0.4)Fe(2)As(2)tapes. The
   Sr(0.6)K(0.4)Fe(2)As(2)tapes possess excellent properties of highT(c)=
   36.2 K, large transportJ(c)of similar to 10(5)A cm(-2)at 10 T and 4.2 K,
   and high pinning potentialU(0)/k(B)with small field-dependence,
   demonstrating a great potential in high-field applications. The
   magneticJ(c)at various temperatures and flux pinning mechanism are
   exhibited for bothB//abandB//cdirections. Notably, a point pinning in
   combination with surface pinning appears in our samples, resulting in a
   strong flux pinning force. And the characteristic ratioB(irr)(//c)(0
   K)/B-irr(//ab)(0 K) is as low as 1.2, indicating that the vortex pinning
   abilities are nearly isotropic. Further transmission electron microscope
   characterization reveals that the anomalous pinning behavior is
   originated from the largely increased small-sized defects and the
   morphological differences along two directions. These positive results
   indicate that tailoring the pinning characteristic by creating
   micro-defects is crucial to improving theJ(c)value and suppressing the
   anisotropy in iron pnictides.}},

Title = {{Positive effects of zeolite powder on aerobic granulation: Nitrogen and
   phosphorus removal and insights into the interaction mechanisms}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{191}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aerobic granular sludge is considered one of the most promising
   biological wastewater treatment technologies of the 21st century.
   However, the long granulation time and poor treatment effect on N and P
   have severely limited its popularity and large-scale application. In
   this study, we systematically examine the strengthening effects of
   zeolite powder on granulation, N and P removal, and their interaction
   mechanisms. The addition of zeolite powder decreased sludge granulation
   time to 18 d, and improved average N and P removal rates by 4.48\% and
   2.22\%, respectively. The multi-pore and nutrient-rich environment of
   the zeolite powder is beneficial for maintaining microbial activity and
   granular stability. Moreover, its adsorption to N and P enriches their
   respective removal strains, improving their removal efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Long non-coding (lnc) RNAs serve crucial functions in human cancers.
   However, the involvement of the lncRNA B4GALT1-antisense RNA 1 (AS1) in
   non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been extensively studied.
   Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was performed to detect
   B4GALT1-AS1 levels in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Potential influences
   of B4GALT1-AS1 on biological functions of NSCLC were assessed through a
   series of in vitro experiments, and the molecular mechanism was
   determined via RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and bioinformatics
   analyses. The results of the present study demonstrated that knockdown
   of B4GALT1-AS1 significantly attenuated the proliferative ability and
   clonality of H1299 and A549 cells. In the present study, B4GALT1-AS1
   competed as an endogenous RNA by sequestering microRNA-30e (miR-30e)
   leading to an enhanced expression of SRY-box transcription factor 9
   (SOX9). The effects of silencing B4GALT1-AS1 on NSCLC cells
   proliferation could be ameliorated by inhibiting miR-30e or restoring
   SOX9. Hence, B4GALT1-AS1 acted as a lncRNA that drives tumor progression
   in NSCLC via the regulation of the miR-30e/SOX9 axis. The findings of
   the present study indicated that the B4GALT1-AS1/miR-30e/SOX9 axis maybe
   an effective target for NSCLC treatment and management.}},

Abstract = {{Arteriovenous fistulas are known to be one of the most enduring and safe
   hemodialysis access modalities. However, access preservation can be
   challenging in the setting of degeneration, including the development of

   risk thrombosis of the fistula, and covered stent use can predispose the
   access to infection and other stent complications. We present a case in
   which endovascular balloon occlusion was used to facilitate the use of
   ultrasound-guided thrombin injection to resolve a dialysis access
   pseudoaneurysm by transiently reducing flow and preventing
   thromboembolism. This method is a safe, effective, and minimally
   invasive technique that should be considered for salvage of autogenous
   access compromised by pseudoaneurysm development.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this article was to estimate the effect of Er, Cr: YSGG
   laser ablation on the surface crystal structure of human dentin with
   X-ray diffractometer (XRD). Er, Cr: YSGG laser with different energy
   densities were used to ablate human dentin, and XRD was used to analyze
   the changes of crystal structures, average particle size, and lattice
   parameters of hydroxyapatite (HA) crystals before and after laser
   irradiation. The results show that the average size of HA particles in
   dentin inorganic phase decreased slightly after laser irradiation with
   different energy densities, but the cell parameters did not change
   significantly. Based on XRD data, the ellipsoidal HA grain morphology of
   dentin before and after laser irradiation were obtained by Rietveld full
   pattern fitting of Popa model. The surface morphology and microstructure
   of dentin after laser irradiation were observed by scanning electron
   microscopy. It was found that the surface roughness of dentin increased
   obviously, there was no stained layer on the surface, no carbonization
   phenomenon and crack, and no obvious melting phenomenon. This study
   showed that the inorganic phase did not change after Er, Cr: YSGG laser
   ablation of human dentin, HA grains did not recrystallize, and large
   area melting was not observed on the dentin surface.}},

   Patients and Healthy Subjects}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) typically occurs in
   youths, and early accurate POTS diagnosis is challenging. A recent
   hypothesis suggests that upright cognitive impairment in POTS occurs
   because reduced cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) and cerebrovascular
   response to carbon dioxide (CO<INF>2</INF>) are nonlinear during
   transient changes in end-tidal CO<INF>2</INF>
   (P<INF>ETCO<INF>2</INF></INF>). This novel study aimed to reveal the
   interaction between cerebral autoregulation and ventilatory control in
   POTS patients by using tilt table and hyperventilation to alter the
   CO<INF>2</INF> tension between 10 and 30 mmHg. The cerebral blood flow
   velocity (CBFV), partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide
   (P<INF>ETCO<INF>2</INF></INF>), and other cardiopulmonary signals were
   recorded for POTS patients and two healthy groups including those aged
   >45 years (Healthy-Elder) and aged <45 years (Healthy-Youth) throughout
   the experiment. Two nonlinear regression functions, Models I and II,
   were applied to evaluate their CBFV-P<INF>ETCO<INF>2</INF></INF>
   relationship and cerebral vasomotor reactivity (CVMR). Among the
   estimated parameters, the curve-fitting Model I for CBFV and CVMR
   responses to CO<INF>2</INF> for POTS patients demonstrated an observable
   dissimilarity in CBFV<INF>max</INF> (p = 0.011),
   mid-P<INF>ETCO<INF>2</INF></INF> (p = 0.013), and
   P<INF>ETCO<INF>2</INF></INF> range (p = 0.023) compared with those of
   Healthy-Youth and in CBFV<INF>max</INF> (p = 0.015) and
   CVMR<INF>max</INF> compared with those of Healthy-Elder. With
   curve-fitting Model II for POTS patients, the fit parameters of
   curvilinear (p = 0.036) and P<INF>ETCO<INF>2</INF></INF> level (p =
   0.033) displayed significant difference in comparison with Healthy-Youth
   parameters; range of change (p = 0.042), P<INF>ETCO<INF>2</INF></INF>
   level, and CBFV<INF>max</INF> also displayed a significant difference in
   comparison with Healthy-Elder parameters. The results of this study
   contribute toward developing an early accurate diagnosis of impaired
   CBFV responses to CO<INF>2</INF> for POTS patients.}},

Abstract = {{The heritability levels of two traits for diabetes diagnosis, serum
   fasting glucose (FG) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)), were estimated
   to be 51-62\%. Studies have shown that cigarette smoking is a modifiable
   risk factor for diabetes. It is important to uncover whether smoking may
   modify the genetic risk of diabetes. This study included unrelated
   Taiwan Biobank subjects in a discovery cohort (TWB1) of 25,460 subjects
   and a replication cohort (TWB2) of 58,774 subjects. Genetic risk score
   (GRS) of each TWB2 subject was calculated with weights retrieved from
   the TWB1 analyses. We then assessed the significance of GRS-smoking
   interactions on FG, HbA(1c), and diabetes while adjusting for
   covariates. A total of five smoking measurements were investigated,
   including active smoking status, pack-years, years as a smoker, packs
   smoked per day, and hours as a passive smoker per week. Except for
   passive smoking, all smoking measurements were associated with FG,
   HbA(1c), and diabetes (P < 0.0033) and were associated with an
   exacerbation of the genetic risk of FG and HbA(1c) (P-Interaction <
   0.0033). For example, each 1 SD increase in GRS is associated with a
   1.68\% higher FG in subjects consuming one more pack of cigarettes per

Abstract = {{Objectives: To explore the perceived quality of care transitions from
   hospital to the home with referral to subsequent rehabilitation in the
   home, and factors associated with low perceived quality, in people with
   stroke.
   Design: Observational study. Setting and Participants: Eligible were
   patients with a suspected acute stroke admitted to 1 of 4 inpatient
   hospital units in the Stockholm region and discharged home with referral
   to a neurorehabilitation team in primary care.
   Methods: Data on perceived quality of care transitionwas collected with
   the Care Transition Measure (CTM15) 1 week after discharge. Additional
   data were mainly retrieved from medical records. To analyze difference
   in mean total score of the CTM-15 between participants' characteristics,
   length of hospital stay, disease-related data, and functioning, the
   Mann-Whitney U test and independent sample t test were used for
   dichotomized variables and 1-way analysis of variance and the Tukey post
   hoc test for variables with more than 2 groups. To analyze differences
   between participants with low and high perceived quality per item,
   univariable regression analyses were performed. Thereafter,
   multivariable regression models were created to explore associations
   between low perceived quality and the independent variables.
   Results: Mean age of the 189 participants was 75 years and 91\% had a
   mild or very mild stroke. The majority perceived most areas of the care
   transition to be of high quality. Nevertheless, several areas for
   improvement were identified. People with a more severe stroke perceived
   the quality of the care transition to be lower in comparison with those
   with a mild stroke. The association was weak between patient or clinical
   characteristics and the perceived quality.
   Conclusion and Implications: Our findings suggest that preparation for
   discharge and information and support for self-management postdischarge
   should be enhanced in the referral-based care transition after stroke.
   Special attention should be given to people with severe stroke. (C) 2020

Journal = {{MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{109}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) describes a group of clinically
   heterogeneous conditions that frequently affect people under the age of
   65 (Le Ber et al., 2013). There are multiple genetic causes of FTD,
   including coding or splice-site mutations in MAPT, GRN mutations that
   lead to haploinsufficiency of progranulin protein, and a hexanucleotide
   GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9ORF72. Pathologically, FTD is characterised
   by abnormal protein accumulations in neurons and glia. These aggregates
   can be composed of the microtubule-associated protein tau (observed in
   FTD with MAPT mutations), the DNA/RNA-binding protein TDP-43 (seen in
   FTD with mutations in GRN or C9ORF72 repeat expansions) or dipeptide
   proteins generated by repeat associated non-ATG translation of the
   C9ORF72 repeat expansion. There are currently no disease-modifying
   therapies for FTD and the availability of in vitro models that
   recapitulate pathologies in a disease-relevant cell type would
   accelerate the development of novel therapeutics. It is now possible to
   generate patient-specific stem cells through the reprogramming of
   somatic cells from a patient with a genotype/phenotype of interest into
   induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). iPSCs can subsequently be
   differentiated into a plethora of cell types including neurons,
   astrocytes and microglia. Using this approach has allowed researchers to
   generate in vitro models of genetic FTD in human cell types that are
   largely inaccessible during life. In this review we explore the recent
   progress in the use of iPSCs to model FTD, and consider the merits,
   limitations and future prospects of this approach.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background:
   The interdependence between patient and caregivers' health, which is
   when the patients' and informal caregivers' emotion, cognition and/or
   behavior affects that of the other person is well documented among dyads
   experiencing cancer and heart disease, but scant research has assessed
   interdependence among those with brain injuries or dementia and Latina/o
   populations. This study aimed to assess the interdependence of patient
   and caregiver depression, patient functional independence and caregiver
   burden among non-Latina/o and Latina/o and patients with brain injuries
   and dementia and their caregivers.
   Methods:
   Patients and caregiver dyads (n = 96) were recruited from a trauma
   hospital. Participants completed measures on patient and caregiver
   depression, patient functional independence and caregiver burden.
   Participants provided written informed consent. Patient inclusion
   criteria included: (1) diagnosis with a brain injury or dementia, (2)
   minimum age of 12, (3) community dwelling and (4) ability to verbally
   communicate and complete study measures. Caregivers were only included
   if they were informal, unpaid, family or a friend. Nonparametric
   Spearman's Rho correlations were conducted to test the study hypotheses.
   Discussion:
   There was consistently a statistically significant positive relationship
   between caregiver depression and caregiver burden for all groups. For
   non-Latina/o patient and caregiver dementia dyads, there were
   associations between patient depression and caregiver depression. For
   non-Latina/o dementia dyads, functional ability was only associated with
   patient depression. For Latina/o patient and caregiver brain injury and
   dementia dyads, the only statistically significant relationship was
   between caregiver depression and caregiver burden. Health services
   should embrace family-focused mental health and respite interventions.}},

Abstract = {{As global climate change persists, ectotherm viability is of concern
   because of their reliance on the external thermal environment survival.
   Ecologically relevant data on temperatures inhabitable by a species can
   be acquired by assessing critical thermal capacities, which are often
   reflected by the behavior and physiology of an organism. For treefrogs,
   thermal capacities could be influenced by a variety of important factors
   and are important for assessing the impact of climate change. Here, we
   assessed critical thermal tolerance in Cope's Gray Treefrogs (Hyla
   chrysoscelis) in Cookeville, Tennessee, in relation to capture date by
   measuring critical thermal maximum (CTmax), minimum (CTmin), and breadth
   over a season. The CTmax for H. chrysoscelis ranged from 28.2 degrees C
   to 43.0 degrees C, CTmin ranged from 1.0 degrees C to 22.5 degrees C,
   and breadth ranged from 8.0 degrees C to 41.0 degrees C. We found that
   frogs detected later in the season had significantly increased thermal
   breadths and significantly higher thermal tolerances, with a slight
   trend of greater cold tolerance. This study demonstrates that
   variability may exist in thermal tolerances within a population in
   relation to date, which may be a result of thermal acclimation.
   Variation in thermal capacity within a population may allow for
   persistence through climate change and is a useful knowledge for making
   future predictions.}},

   neuron damage induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Cerebral ischemia is one of the most common clinical diseases
   characterized by high morbidity and mortality. Neurocyte apoptosis and a
   cascade of inflammatory signals following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion
   injury (IRI) may contribute to secondary brain damage, resulting in
   severe neurological damage. It has been reported that dioscin, a natural
   steroid saponin, exerts anti-inflammatory properties against different
   diseases. The present study aimed to investigate the role of dioscin in
   oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) induction in hippocampal
   cells in vitro and in vivo. For the in vitro study, hippocampal cells
   were collected from rat embryos of gestational age of E18. The
   oxygen-glucose deprivation model in primary hippocampal neurons was used
   to mimic cerebral IRI in vitro. To select the optimum dioscin
   concentration and acting time, cell viability was evaluated by a Cell
   Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Neurons subjected to OGD/R were treated
   with dioscin and the inflammatory cytokines, high mobility group box
   chromosomal protein 1 (HMGB-1)/receptor for advanced glycation end
   products (RAGE) signaling molecules and apoptosis-associated genes were
   determined. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation
   was detected. Furthermore, the effects of dioscin on the antioxidant
   defense mechanisms were evaluated by measuring the activity of
   glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT)
   and the glutathione (GSH)/glutathione disulphide (GSSG) ratio. In
   addition, OGD/R-induced cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-HMGB-1 and
   treated with dioscin, and the neuronal cell apoptosis rate was
   determined using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated
   2-deoxyuridine 5-triphosphate-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay.
   The mRNA and protein expression levels of the inflammatory factors were
   measured using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction
   (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis, respectively. For the in vivo
   investigation, the oxidation and anti-oxidation system in rat
   hippocampal tissue was evaluated by detecting the expression of the
   aforementioned oxidative stress-associated proteins, 3-NT as well as
   8-oxo-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). In the hippocampal region, the apoptotic
   rate was determined using a TUNEL assay. The results demonstrated that
   dioscin at a dose of 400 ng/ml significantly reversed the increase in
   the expression levels of the inflammatory factors and attenuated those
   of apoptotic cytokines induced by OGD/R. Additionally, dioscin notably
   reversed the OGD/R-mediated activation of the HMGB-1/RAGE signaling
   pathway in vitro and in vivo. Cell treatment with dioscin significantly
   attenuated ROS production and increased the activity of antioxidant
   enzymes. Additionally, increasing the expression of HMGB-1 inhibited the
   protective effects of dioscin on cell apoptosis in the OGD/R-induced
   neurons. Furthermore, HMGB-1 overexpression reversed the antiapoptotic
   and anti-inflammatory effects of dioscin on neurons. The results of the
   present study indicated that dioscin exerted anti-inflammatory,
   antiapoptotic and antioxidant effects via the HMGB-1/RAGE signaling
   pathway. These results suggest a novel perspective of the protective
   effects of dioscin as a prospective remedial factor for IRI.}},

Title = {{Gas diffusion coefficient estimation of coal: A dimensionless numerical
   method and its experimental validation}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{162}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The diffusion coefficient is one of the key parameters to control gas
   desorption and transport kinetics in coal with pressure evolution.
   Accurate estimation of diffusion coefficient of coal is of great
   significance for coalbed methane production planning and coal mine gas
   control management. However, the most commonly used analytical method
   was found to underestimate the gas diffusion coefficient due the
   assumption of constant surface concentration in solving the Fick
   diffusion model. This study conducted a series of experiments to measure
   the gas adsorption and diffusion using the volumetric method. The Fick
   diffusion model was solved by both analytical method and the numerical
   method to estimate the gas diffusion coefficient based on the
   experimental data. We compared estimated diffusion coefficients from
   both the analytical and numerical approaches. It is found that the
   diffusion coefficient is a pressure dependent parameter and it
   negatively correlates with the pressure. The gas diffusivity in coal is
   also a gas type-dependent property. As observed, the CO2 diffusion
   coefficients were found to be higher than of CH4. It suggests CO2
   molecules diffuse faster than CH4 molecules through the same porous coal
   matrix. This may be attributed to CO2 molecules own relative smaller
   kinetic diameter than CH4 molecules. The analytical method will
   underestimate the gas diffusion coefficient because it assumes a
   constant gas concentration boundary condition. The numerical method is a
   better representation of the real gas diffusion process and we recommend
   to using the numerical method for the diffusion coefficient estimation
   if possible. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Are noncompulsory certifications persistently beneficial for incumbent

   institutions, given that they are likely to be conducive for start-ups
   suggested in prior studies? By exploring in emerging economy context
   with one cross-sectional and another longitudinal dataset of firms in
   China, we invoke legitimacy-based view to develop a concept named as
   institutional consciousness and find out distinctive effects of resource
   acquisitions from the public versus the government caused by
   noncompulsory certifications. Specifically, they on average only provide
   benefits toward achieving higher sales but trivial in obtaining
   subsidies whereas the two effects reverse from earlier years to late
   years when incorporating the temporal effects. This produces significant
   implications for entrepreneurs to acknowledge the distinguished roles of
   noncompulsory certifications to the different targets while enriches the
   legitimacy view of the significance of business strategies. The study
   further introduces a new perspective to disentangle the paradox of
   embedded agency issue in institutional changes while reminds the
   importance to treat the government as an organizational actor instead of

Abstract = {{Subsurface discontinuities are inevitably formed during the long-term
   operations of pipelines, oil tanks, ship hulls, and the like. However,
   it is still a big challenge to detect deeply buried subsurface
   discontinuities using existing nondestructive testing methods. In this
   paper, based on the high sensitivity of magnetic Barkhausen noise (MBN)
   to the movement of the domain walls, an MBN test under direct current
   (DC) magnetization is proposed for subsurface discontinuity detection.
   Under DC magnetization, subsurface discontinuities will distort the
   magnetic field distribution in the near-surface layer of the specimen
   and then affect the movement of the domain walls in this region.
   Meanwhile, through alternating current (AC) excitation, MBN testing is
   conducted to detect the movement of the domain walls to evaluate
   subsurface discontinuities. To validate the proposed technique, MBN
   experiments under DC magnetization are conducted to quantify subsurface
   discontinuities with different buried depths. Experimental results
   indicate that the proposed technique can detect subsurface
   discontinuities with buried depths of up to 5 mm, and the extracted MBN
   energy feature has an approximately linear relationship with the buried
   depth.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To explore the application value of cardiovascular extraction
   technique in the complex and/or complex malformation of congenital heart
   disease (CHD) and the application of deep learning to the diagnosis of
   medical imaging. Methods: Quantitative description of cardiovascular
   lesions and reconstruction of three-dimensional cardiovascular using
   angiographic images, the cardiovascular representation of the contrast
   image as a single pixel wide cardiovascular skeleton, using a rotating
   Gaussian function to enhance the image, using adaptive tracking circular
   template pair Enhanced cardiovascular images for cardiovascular
   extraction. The 360 cases of complex and/or complex malformation were
   analyzed and their association with clinical examinations such as
   echocardiography. Results: This group of 360 patients (including 75
   cases of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect, 62 cases of
   right ventricular double exit, 60 cases of tetralogy of Fallot, 52 cases
   of single ventricle, 42 cases of aortic dislocation, 15 cases of

   24 cases of postoperative examination) angiography. Compared with
   ultrasound, the latter was corrected in 34 cases, missed diagnosis in 30
   cases, and misdiagnosis in 16 cases of combined malformation. The
   detection and diagnosis of collateral vessels, coronary artery
   malformations and branches of pulmonary arteries and their abnormalities
   in complex and/or complex malformations are superior to
   echocardiography, and can measure pulmonary arterial and venous

Journal = {{SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL}},

Abstract = {{Metal oxide semiconductors are recognized as an excellent underlying
   substance for the assembly of gas sensors to detect the volatile organic
   compounds in industry or healthcare, but are constrained by their low
   selectivity and high operation temperature. In the present paper, we
   present a nanostructured p-type delafossite CuCrO2, synthesized by the
   hydrothermal method, that provides a high selectivity, stability and
   high dynamic response to triethylamine at a low temperature of 140
   degrees C. In-situ heating spectrum analysis and systematic gas sensing
   tests with the assistance of first principles calculations based on the
   density functional theory demonstrate that this ternary oxide takes a
   unique synergy mechanism for gas sensing process, rather than the
   ionosorption effect of ambient oxygen. It starts with the adsorption of
   gas molecules to the unsaturated coordinative metal sites of Cr, which
   is then followed by the dehydrogenation on Cu resulting in the formation
   of oxygen vacancies. This gas sensing mechanism successfully explains
   the extraordinary properties of CuCrO2 nanoparticles as a triethylamine
   sensor. This work delivers an exploratory approach to the assigned
   interaction of gas molecules and the sensitive layer at atomic scale,
   which provides ways to design and develop more advanced gas sensors for
   other material systems.}},

Abstract = {{Tuning the selectivity of oxygen reduction reaction to 2 e(-) pathway is
   of significant importance for hydrogen peroxide electrochemical
   generation. C-800 with superior 2 e(-) oxygen reduction reaction
   activity and inferior peroxide reduction reaction and peroxide
   disproportionation reaction activity is the most promising catalyst for
   hydrogen peroxide electrochemical generation. The thorough understanding
   of oxygen reduction reaction mechanism provides great insights into the
   catalyst design. Different pi-electron delocalization degree of carbon
   can tune the electron transferring ability out of catalyst surface and
   the density of active sites. A plausible volcano relationship of oxygen
   reduction reaction activity vs. pi-electron delocalization degree of
   carbon is established. High pi-electron delocalization degree benefits
   the electron transfer from catalyst surface to hydrated O-2 in outer
   Helmholtz plane but is unfavorable to the increase of active sites for
   the further adsorption and reduction of intermediate OOH. This work
   provides a new insight into the design of carbon materials for effective

Abstract = {{Background Little is known on the role of indirect clamp releasing in
   coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Loop isolation-based uploading
   preconditioning (LiuPhD) was modified to protect the heart from damage
   and the question of whether this can attenuate reperfusion injury after
   global myocardial ischemia was examined. Methods A post-hoc comparative
   analysis was conducted of a prospective single-arm trial on the use of
   the LiuPhD strategy for 60 multivessel-disease patients undergoing
   isolated first-time elective on-pump CABG versus 1:1 propensity
   score-matched patients from the historical database of the same center.
   Results A total of 120 matched patients had a median age of 62.0
   (interquartile range {[}IQR] 55.8-69.0) years, 27 (22.5\%) women, 35
   (29.2\%) with left main disease, and median follow-up of 18.5
   (10.9-35.4) months. The LiuPhD group had shorter post-bypass times than
   conventional controls (10 {[}6-13] vs 14 {[}10-19] mins; p = 0.003). The
   LiuPhD group had similar needs in terms of composite cardiac-specific
   interventions (38/60 vs 44/60; p = 0.29). At follow-up of safety, the
   risk for composite major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events was
   similar between groups (event-free survival: 82.3\% vs 73.8\%; hazard
   ratio 1.00 {[}0.39, 2.54], p log-rank test = 0.99). Conclusion The
   LiuPhD strategy is associated with short post-bypass times, comparable
   risk of myocardial injury, and similar safety compared with conventional
   direct clamp releasing.}},

Abstract = {{The current study aimed to investigate whether sarpogrelate and
   rosuvastatin possess anti-arterial injury, and attempted to elucidate
   the mechanism of action underlying this activity. Sarpogrelate, a
   5-hydroxytryptamine type 2A antagonist, is extensively used to prevent
   arterial thrombosis; however, its effects on atherosclerosis remain
   unknown. In the present study, sarpogrelate combined with rosuvastatin
   or rosuvastatin alone were administered to male ApoE(-/-) mice fed a
   high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks. Metabolic parameters in the blood
   samples were analyzed using an automatic analyzer. Aortic tissues were
   stained with hematoxylin and eosin for morphological analysis. The
   expression levels of oxidized-low density lipoprotein (LDL) specific
   scavenging receptors, lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein
   receptor-1 (LOX-1) and cluster of differentiation 68 were detected via
   immunostaining. mRNA expression levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6
   and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were determined via reverse
   transcription-quantitative PCR analysis, while protein expression levels
   of LOX-1 and phosphor(p)-ERK were determined via western blot analysis.
   The results demonstrated that sarpogrelate combined with rosuvastatin
   treatment significantly decreased total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol
   levels in the serum, and alleviated intimal hyperplasia and lipid
   deposition, accompanied by decreased inflammatory cell infiltration and
   lower expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, compared with
   rosuvastatin monotherapy or HFD treatment. Furthermore, sarpogrelate
   combined with rosuvastatin treatment significantly decreased the
   expression levels of LOX-1 and p-ERK. Taken together, these results
   suggest that the positive effects of sarpogrelate combined with
   rosuvastatin treatment on aortic injury may be associated with the
   regulation of the LOX-1/p-ERK signaling pathway. Sarpogrelate and
   rosuvastatin synergistically decreased aortic damage in ApoE(-/-) HFD
   mice, and thus provide a basis for the treatment of aortic injury caused
   by hyperlipidemia with sarpogrelate.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND. Corticosteroids are widely used in patients with COVID-19,
   although their benefit-to-risk ratio remains controversial.
   METHODS. Patients with severe COVID-19-related acute respiratory
   distress syndrome (ARDS) were included from December 29, 2019 to March
   16, 2020 in 5 tertiary Chinese hospitals. Cox proportional hazards and
   competing risks analyses were conducted to analyze the impact of
   corticosteroids on mortality and SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance, respectively.
   We performed a propensity score (PS) matching analysis to control
   confounding factors.
   RESULTS. Of 774 eligible patients, 409 patients received
   corticosteroids, with a median time from hospitalization to starting
   corticosteroids of 1.0 day (IQR 0.0-3.0 days) . As compared with usual
   care, treatment with corticosteroids was associated with increased rate
   of myocardial (15.6\% vs. 10.4\%, P = 0.041) and liver injury (18.3\%
   vs. 9.9\%, P = 0.001), of shock (22.0\% vs. 12.6\%, P< 0.001), of need
   for mechanical ventilation (38.1\% vs. 19.5\%, P < 0.001), and increased
   rate of 28-day all-cause mortality (44.3\% vs. 31.0\%, P < 0.001). After
   PS matching, corticosteroid therapy was associated with 28-day mortality
   (adjusted HR 1.46, 95\% CI 1.01-2.13, P = 0.045). High dose (>200 mg)
   and early initiation (<= 3 days from hospitalization) of corticosteroid
   therapy were associated with a higher 28-day mortality rate.
   Corticosteroid use was also associated with a delay in SARS-CoV-2
   coronavirus RNA clearance in the competing risk analysis (subhazard
   ratio 1.59, 95\% CI 1.17-2.15, P = 0.003).
   CONCLUSION: Administration of corticosteroids in severe COVID-19-related
   ARDS is associated with increased 28-day mortality and delayed
   SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus RNA clearance after adjustment fortime-varying
   confounders.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, with continuous focus on clean energy and environmental
   protection, the scale of photovoltaic generation industry in China has
   been gradually expanded, making great achievements. However, it also
   faces huge challenges and problems such as fierce market competition,
   serious photovoltaic curtailment, high cost, etc. In order to promote
   the sustainable development of photovoltaic industry, this paper
   constructs an energy storage-involved photovoltaic value chain (ES-PVC)
   consisting of three nodes for upstream, midstream and downstream, in
   which photovoltaic power suppliers, battery energy storage business and
   electric vehicle manufacturers locate respectively. The coupling problem
   for node enterprises in the value chain is studied by multi-objective
   optimization and G1 method, which is measured eventually via a single
   value transformed by ideal point method. Considering the particularity
   of issue, the paper proposes an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) to fit
   and solve the model. A best value chain is acquired via proposed
   approach whose feasibility and applicability are verified through
   comparative analysis with analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and linear
   assignment method (LAM) and sensitivity analysis. The implications and
   limitations are presented in the conclusion, aiming to provide
   theoretical reference for value management of photovoltaic enterprise
   and to get further research. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Instability behavior of bubble supported organic liquid membrane in
   extraction of low-concentration rare earths from in-situ leaching
   solutions of ion-adsorption ores}},
Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{159}},

Abstract = {{Gas bubble supported organic extractant liquid membrane exhibits a
   promising potential in enhanced extraction and separation of
   low-concentration rare earths from the in-situ leaching solutions of
   ion-adsorption ores. However, instability of organic liquid membrane on
   the surface of gas bubbles might result in dissolution loss of organic
   extractant in the flowing-out aqueous raffinates and bring serious
   organic pollution if the raffinates are recycled for re-leaching of
   rare-earth ores. The present work focuses on the mechanism of the
   instability of organic extractant P507 liquid membrane on the surface of
   bubbles during rare-earth extraction. Various effects, including volume
   flow rate of aqueous feed solution, initial aqueous pHs and
   concentrations of co-existing impurity ions, saponification degree of
   P507 and pre-loaded concentration of rare earths in organic phase, on
   the stability of organic liquid membrane are discussed. Experimental
   results reveal that the stability of organic liquid membrane depends on
   three kinds of forces exerting on the surface of bubbles, i.e., the
   shear force F-s, the interface tension F-t and the dispersion force F-d.
   The occurrence of F-t and F-d are benefit for the stability, but F-s is
   not. The competition of the two component forces of F-s respectively
   with F-t and F-d will result in instability of organic liquid membrane
   and an increase in the concentration of total organic phosphorus in the
   flowing-out raffinates. The present work provides a theoretical basis
   about how to control the stability of organic extractant liquid membrane
   on the surface of gas bubble. Based on the suggested new technique by
   bubble supported organic liquid membrane extraction, a green and
   environmentally friendly strategy is suggested for replacing the
   traditional ammonium bicarbonate precipitation to extract
   low-concentration rare earths from in-situ leaching solutions of
   ion-adsorption ores.}},

Abstract = {{SPIKE1, a DOCK family guanine nucleotide exchange factor, interacts with
   and activates the GTPase LjROP6 to mediate the polar progression of
   infection threads in Lotus japonicus.
   In legumes, rhizobia attach to root hair tips and secrete nodulation
   factor to activate rhizobial infection and nodule organogenesis.
   Endosymbiotic rhizobia enter nodule primordia via a specialized
   transcellular compartment known as the infection thread (IT). The IT
   elongates by polar tip growth, following the path of the migrating
   nucleus along and within the root hair cell. Rho-family ROP GTPases are
   known to regulate the polarized growth of cells, but their role in
   regulating polarized IT growth is poorly understood. Here, we show that
   LjSPK1, a DOCK family guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF),
   interacts with three type I ROP GTPases. Genetic analyses showed that
   these three ROP GTPases are involved in root hair development, but only
   LjROP6 is required for IT formation after rhizobia inoculation.
   Misdirected ITs formed in the root hairs of Ljspk1 and Ljrop6 mutants.
   We show that LjSPK1 functions as a GEF that activates LjROP6. LjROP6
   enhanced the plasma membrane localization LjSPK1 in Nicotiana
   benthamiana leaf cells and Lotus japonicus root hairs, and LjSPK1 and
   LjROP6 interact at the plasma membrane. Taken together, these results
   shed light on how the LjROP6-LjSPK1 module mediates the polarized growth
   of ITs in L. japonicus.}},

Title = {{Modeling tracer flowback behaviour for a fractured vertical well in a
   tight formation by coupling fluid flow and geomechanical dynamics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a pragmatic technique has been developed to describe
   tracer flowback behaviour for a vertically fractured well in a tight
   formation by coupling fluid flow and geomechanical dynamics. More
   specifically, the Barton-Bandis model is employed to describe the
   relationship between effective stress and fracture permeability, while
   tracer flowback profiles, which can reveal the fracture properties, are
   quantified by taking tracer dispersion and adsorption into account.
   Subsequently, this method considering two main mechanisms (i.e., tracer
   flow behaviour and fracture propagation dynamics) is separately
   validated with previous analytical solutions and then extends its
   application to a field case. In addition to tracer flowback
   concentration, the tracer recovery factor (TRF) is generated to analyze
   the tracer flowback behaviour. With considering geomechanics, the TRF is
   nearly 20\% higher than that without considering geomechanics. During
   the flowback period, tracer concentration profiles appear to be unimodal
   for reservoirs with a single fracture, while tracer concentration
   increases quickly at the initial stage and then decreases slowly as time
   proceeds. An increase in matrix permeability increases tracer flowback
   concentration and the TRF. A larger tracer dispersion coefficient leads
   to earlier arrival time for the tracer flowback concentration peak
   together with a lower TRF. Also, the stronger the tracer adsorption is,
   the lower the tracer flowback concentration and the TRF will be. A
   higher Young's modulus results in a lower tracer flowback concentration
   and TRF. An increase in minimum horizontal stress increases tracer
   flowback concentration. Other parameters, including maximum horizontal
   stress, fracture closure permeability, and normal fracture stiffness,
   are also examined and analyzed though less sensitive.}},

Abstract = {{Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1) is an important tumor
   suppressor in multiple cancers. However, the mechanisms behind its
   anti-tumor activity, particularly the relationship between BAI1 and
   metabolic aberrant of a tumor, remained unveiled. This study aimed to
   investigate whether BAI1 could inhibit biological functions in lung
   cancer A549 cells and the critical regulating molecules that induce
   metabolic reprogramming. Immunohistochemistry staining was performed to
   analyze whether variations in the expression of BAI1 in tumor tissues
   contributes to poor prognosis of lung cancer. Overexpressed BAI1
   (BAI1-OE-A549) and control (Vector-NC-A549) were generated by lentiviral
   transfection. Biological function assays (proliferation, apoptosis,
   colony formation, invasion and in vivo metastasis), as well as metabolic
   reprogramming (by the Warburg effect and the glycolytic rate), were
   performed in both groups. Our results indicated that lower levels of
   BAI1 contributed to poor prognosis of lung cancer patients. Furthermore,
   overexpressed of BAI1 dramatically inhibited proliferation, migration,
   invasion, colony formation and in vivo metastasis of A549 cells. The
   Warburg effect and the Seahorse assay revealed that BAI1-OE induced
   metabolism reprogramming by inhibiting the Warburg effect and
   glycolysis. Further exploration indicated that BAI1 induced metabolic
   reprogramming by upregulating stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) and
   inhibited 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR). Our
   study revealed a novel mechanism through which BAI1 acted as tumor
   suppressor by inducing metabolic reprogramming via the SCD1 and HMGCR

Title = {{Translocation and preservation of soil phytoliths in temperate regions
   and its implications for palaeoenvironment reconstruction}},
Journal = {{CATENA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{195}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The reliability of soil phytoliths within representatives of past
   phytolith assemblages in archaeological and palaeoecological contexts
   needs to be improved. In this study, we investigated soil phytolith
   representation by comparing phytoliths from plant communities with those
   from paired topsoils and those subjected to vertical translocation at 54
   sites in Northeast China. With respect to soil phytolith preservation in
   the soil-plant system, there is a reasonable correspondence between
   phytolith morphotypes from forested topsoil (or grassland topsoil) and
   those from the associated communities. But the comparison and contrast
   between phytoliths from topsoil and communities indicates that different
   phytolith morphotypes also exhibit different degrees of representational
   bias (R values). Additionally, for the vertical translocation of soil
   phytoliths, together with a phytolith translocation index (T), similar
   to 31\% and 19\% of the phytoliths are transported below the surface of
   the studied soil profiles in the forested and grassland regions,
   respectively. The translocation rates of different phytolith morphotypes
   in the forested samples are all larger than those in the grassland
   samples. Based on R and T values, the changes of revised topsoil
   phytolith indices are moderately in accord with actual plant richness
   and climatic changes. These results we show that the R and T values are
   effective parameters indicating the degree of soil phytolith
   preservation and can be used in future studies for developing training
   sets of modern phytolith assemblages. The results of our study provide a
   methodological template to investigate the extent to which phytolith
   assemblages in palaeoenvironmental contexts satisfy the criteria
   necessary to justify their use as a meaningful proxy of past ecological
   and climatic change.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Recently, extended multi-attribute profiles (EMAPs) have attracted much
   attention due to its good performance while applied to remote sensing
   images feature extraction and classification. Since the EMAPs connect
   multiple attribute features without considering the pixel-based
   Hyperspectral Image (HSI) classification, homogeneous regions may become
   unsmooth due to the noise to be introduced. To tackle this problem, we
   propose the weighted EMAPs (WEMAPs) to reduce the noise and smoothen the
   homogeneous regions based on weighted mean filter (WMF). Then, we
   construct multiscale WEMAPs to product multiscale feature in order to
   extract different spatial structures of the HSI and produce better
   classification results. Finally, a new joint decision fusion and feature
   fusion (JDFFF) framework is proposed based on the decision fusion (DF)
   and the multiscale WEMAPs (MWEMAPs) based on extreme learning machine
   (ELM) classifier. That is, the classification results from various
   scales are combined into a final one with ELM to perform the HSI
   classification. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm
   significantly outperforms many state-of-the-art HSI classification
   algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Paper-based sensors can be exploited to develop low-cost, disposable,
   and rapid assays for the detection of a large variety of analytes. We
   report a paper-based sensor system for a point-of-care (POC) nucleic
   acid amplification test that can quantitatively detect multiple genes
   from different pathogens. The POC system combines a paper sensor chip
   and a portable instrument, which is built on an Internet of Things (IoT)
   platform. The paper-based sensor provides the functions of reagent
   storage, sample transportation, and nucleic acid amplification. The IoT
   instrument uses an Arduino microcontroller to control temperature,
   collect fluorescence images, and store the data in cloud storage via a
   WiFi network. A compact fluorescence reader was designed to measure
   fluorescence images of the amplicons during a loop-mediated isothermal
   amplification reaction in real-time. The real-time detection capability
   enables the quantitative analysis of target genes. The results show that
   the paper-based sensor cam distinguish multiple genes of the genomic DNA
   extracted from Escherichia coli and Campylo-bacter jejuni, with the
   concentration as low as 2 x 10(3) copies/mu L. The affordable

Title = {{Effects of St and Re on propulsive performance of bionic oscillating
   caudal fin}},
Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{217}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Many fishes show an excellent swimming ability by agilely oscillating
   their fins, and the caudal fin is a main organ for a fish to propel
   itself. This propulsion mode provides inspiration to the design of
   biomimetic underwater vehicles. On this basis, we take an oscillating
   fin as our study subject and build a computational fluid dynamic model
   by mimicking the lunate caudal fin of tuna. Numerical simulations are
   performed to evaluate the effects of the Strouhal number (St) and
   Reynold number (Re) on the wake structure and hydrodynamic performance
   of the oscillating caudal fin. Navier-Stokes equations are used to solve
   the unsteady flow for the oscillating caudal fin, as well as the
   user-defined-function and dynamic mesh methods are applied to realize
   and track the instant locomotion, respectively. Then the validity and
   reliability of the numerical method are verified by experiments and
   convergence tests. Results show that the fish can obtain a larger
   instantaneous thrust force when the caudal fin flaps under a higher St
   but when its propulsive efficiency is mediocre or even worsens. This
   situation usually occurs during the escape or hunting actions of fish.
   Meanwhile, being in a turbulence flow, which corresponds to a larger Re,
   is helpful for the caudal fin to obtain a relatively higher thrust force
   and propulsive efficiency. Specially, a detailed analysis on the
   connection between the wake vortex topology, kinematics and force
   generation of the caudal fin is performed. Results suggests that the
   wake is dominated by one or two sets of complex vortex rings which
   convect at different oblique angles to the wake flow centerline. With
   various Re and St, the hydrodynamic performances of the caudal fin
   strongly depend on the flow dynamics underlying the force production,
   including the orientation, interconnection and dissipation rate of the
   vortex rings. Such as jet flows inducted by these vortex rings, play a
   critical role in the thrust force generation for an oscillating caudal
   fin.}},

Title = {{Effect of Surface Ultrasonic Rolling Treatment on Rolling Contact
   Fatigue Life of D2 Wheel Steel}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A GPM-30 fatigue machine was used to investigate the influence of
   surface ultrasonic rolling (SURT) on the rolling contact fatigue (RCF)
   life of D2 wheel steel. The experimental results present that the RCF
   life of the grinding processing sample is 4.1 x 10(5) cycles. During the
   RCF process, the flaking of the fine grain layer and high surface
   roughness of the grinding processing sample cause the production of RCF
   cracks. When the samples are treated by SURT with 0.2 MPa and 0.4 MPa,
   the RCF life is 9.2 x 10(5) cycles and 9.6 x 10(5) cycles, respectively.
   After SURT, the surface roughness of the samples is reduced, and a
   certain thickness of gradient-plastic-deformation layer and a
   residual-compressive-stress layer are produced. These factors lead to
   the improvement of the RCF property. However, when the static pressure
   increases to 0.6 MPa during SURT, the RCF life of the sample is reduced
   during RCF testing. The micro-cracks, which are formed during SURT,
   become the crack source and cause the formation of RCF cracks,
   decreasing of the RCF life.}},

Title = {{Wind loads and wind-resistant behaviour of large cylindrical tanks in
   square-arrangement group. Part 1: Wind tunnel test}},
Journal = {{WIND AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{483-493}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Large cylindrical floating-roof tanks, constructed as oil containers,
   are usually distributed regularly in open area and easily exposed to
   severe wind loads. However, wind pressures around these grouped squat
   tanks appear to have not been clearly given in design codes or
   thoroughly studied in existing researches. This paper conducts a
   detailed investigation on wind loads on the external wall of a four-tank
   group in square arrangement. To achieve that, wind tunnel tests are
   carried out on both empty and full tank groups, considering various wind
   angles and spacing. Results show that 3 regions in elevation can be
   identified on the tank shell according to the circumferential wind
   pressure distribution. The upper 2 regions cover a relatively small
   portion of the shell where excessive negative pressures are spotted,
   setting an alarm to the design of the top angle and stiffening rings. By
   comparing results on grouped tanks to those on an isolated tank,
   grouping effects concerning wind angle, tank position in group and
   spacing are discussed. Deviations on pressure distributions that will
   compromise structural safety are outlined, including the increase of
   negative pressures, the shift of maximum pressure locations as well as
   the change of positive pressure range. And, several potentially
   unfavourable wind pressure distributions are selected for further
   analyses.}},

Journal = {{PROGRESS IN ORGANIC COATINGS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{149}},

Abstract = {{Fluorinated PTFOA-b-PS(2 h) and PTFOA-b-PS(4 h) block copolymers with
   controllable molecular weights were synthesised by atom transfer radical
   polymerisation (ATRP) and used to form microporous and microspherical
   coatings on fibres using the static breath figure (BF) method. The
   structures and properties of the coatings were examined by scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS),
   and water contact angle (WCA) analysis. The fibre surface was complete
   coated with a microporous polymer in a water atmosphere using a 20 mg/mL
   PTFOA-b-PS(4 h) solution in CS2 as the finishing agent. The as-prepared
   fabric showed excellent hydrophobicity, with a WCA of 147.2 +/- 1.6
   degrees. On the other hand, the fibre surfaces were coated with
   excellent polymer microspheres in a methanolic atmosphere using a 10
   mg/mL PTFOA-b-PS(2 h) solution in THF; the WCA of the microsphere-coated
   fabric was 151.1 +/- 0.1 degrees. The WCA and EDS results reveal that
   synergism between the high roughness and low surface energy of the
   microspherical coating endows the fabric with super-hydrophobicity. At
   the same time, silanised block copolymers were synthesised by the
   silanisation of PTFOA-b-PS(2 h) and PTFOA-b-PS(4 h) and used to prepare
   microporous and microspherical coatings on fabrics. SEM showed that the
   silanised-PTFOA-b-PS(4 h)-coated fabric has a uniform and completely
   microporous morphology. A comparative study showed that both
   PTFOA-b-PS(2 h) and silanised-PTFOA-b-PS(2 h) form microspheres on fibre
   surfaces and that the latter exhibited hierarchical
   micro-nanostructures; the surface of fabric coated with this silanised
   polymer is super-hydrophobic, with a WCA of 152.2 +/- 2.3 degrees.
   Elemental distributions were determined by EDS, which revealed that the
   silanised-PTFOA-b-PS(2 h) microspheres contain more surface-migrating
   fluoropolymer segments, which produce hierarchical micro-nanostructures
   due to micro-phase separation. The air permeabilities and hardnesses of
   the silanised polymer-coated fabrics were also studied.}},

   text: An interpretable deep learning approach}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION \& MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The detrimental effects of insider trading on the financial markets and
   the economy are well documented. However, resource-constrained
   regulators face a great challenge in detecting insider trading and
   enforcing insider trading laws. We develop a text analytics framework
   that uses machine learning to predict ex-ante potentially opportunistic
   insider trading (using actual insider trading allegation by shareholders
   as the proxy) from corporate textual disclosures. Distinct from typical
   black-box neural network models, which have difficulty tracing a
   prediction back to key features, our approach combines the predictive
   power of deep learning with attention mechanisms to provide
   interpretability to the model. Further, our model utilizes
   representations from a business proximity network and incorporates the
   temporal variations of a firm's financial disclosures. The empirical
   results offer new insights into insider trading and provide practical
   implications. Overall, we contribute to the literature by reconciling
   performance and interpretability in predictive analytics. Our study also
   informs the practice by proposing a new method for regulators to examine
   a large amount of text in order to monitor and predict financial

Abstract = {{The present study aims to address the instability mode of the concrete

   indicates that the Non-Hertz contact theory has superiority compared to
   the widely applied simplified formulation on the spherical joint surface
   stress calculation, by contrasting the results of the finite element
   model and the data collected during field monitoring. Furthermore, the
   resistance of the overturning coefficient is calculated, and the result
   turns out that the critical resistance of the overturning coefficient
   based on the Non-Hertz contact theory is closer to the measured values

Title = {{Driving mechanism of concentrated rural resettlement in upland areas of
   Sichuan Basin: A perspective of marketing hierarchy transformation}},
Journal = {{LAND USE POLICY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{99}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Traditional rural landscape in Sichuan Basin was distinctive in China,
   characterized by highly dispersed rural settlements but a well-organized
   marketing system corresponding to the classic central-place hierarchy.
   In response to China's rapid socio-economic transformation during recent
   years, concentrated rural resettlement (CRR) has been widely adopted in
   Sichuan Basin to remold traditional dispersed rural settlements into the
   concentrated rural settlement (CRS). This study attempts to explore the
   driving forces of CRR practices through an engagement with the
   synchronous evolution of rural market-towns in the upland areas of
   Sichuan Basin. By an empirical study in the basin, we depicted the
   differentiated evolutions of the original market-towns driven by the
   accelerated industrialization and urbanization in recent years.
   Statistical analysis on 87 CRSs indicated that governmental subsidies,
   transport services, accessibility to intermediate market-towns and
   industrial development were critical in determining the CRR outcomes,
   while the role embedded in the standard market-towns was secondary. The
   evolution of the market-towns was common to that experienced in western
   developed countries, while CRR outcomes were underpinned but also
   limited by China's distinct institution. We argue that CRR planning in
   upland areas of Sichuan Basin should realign with the evolving
   market-town system to foster a spatial hierarchy compatible with the
   urban-rural integrated development.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, a compact broadband high-efficiency RF rectifier is
   presented for ambient RF energy harvesting (EH). A novel impedance
   matching network with an additional quarter-wavelength short-circuited
   stub was designed to achieve broadband impedance matching. After the
   branch was added, the parallel resonance point on track S-11 did not
   move, and the remaining points were compressed. The measurement results
   show that the proposed topology could realize a broadband
   high-efficiency rectifier for ambient RF EH, and the measured results
   were basically consistent with the simulation results. The measured
   efficiency is as high as 71.5\% for an input power level of 8 dBm. A
   1-2.4 GHz wide frequency band with an efficiency above 50\% is achieved
   for an input power level of 5 dBm with a terminal load of 1.6 k Omega.
   Moreover, the circuit had wide dynamic input power characteristics,
   whose measured values remained above 50\% with an input power of 3-14
   dBm.}},

Title = {{Flexural behavior of concrete-filled double-skin steel tubular beams
   after subject to high temperature}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{175}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Concrete-filled double-skin steel tubular (CFDST) specimens that exhibit
   lightweight, good ductility, and better bending resistance, can be used
   for beams. However, fire often causes great damage, and the flexural
   behavior of CFDST beams after subject to high-temperature has not been
   studied. To investigate the flexural behavior of CFDST beams after
   subject to high temperature, seven CFDST specimens after subject to high
   temperature were carried out four-point bending tests. The main
   parameters explored in the test include hollow ratio (0.31, 0.52, 0.72)
   and temperature (300 degrees C, 500 degrees C, 800 degrees C). The
   corresponding finite-element analysis (FEA) models were established, and
   the results showed good agreement with the test. The in-depth mechanism
   and systematic analysis including the influence of different hollow
   ratio, material property, and temperature on the whole process curve of
   CFDST after subject to high temperature are carried out using FEA
   models. It is found that the ultimate bending moment of CFDST after
   subject to high-temperature increases with hollow ratio and material
   property, but decreases with the temperature. The outer steel tube
   contributes the most to the ultimate bending moment, and the inner steel
   tube improves the ductility at a later stage. Specimens with a large
   hollow ratio (chi >= 0.52) have better bending capacity, and the
   ultimate bending moment of specimens with a small hollow ratio (chi <
   0.52) decrease the least with the change of temperature due to the
   protection of concrete. Based on the findings from the test and
   numerical studies, a temperature effect coefficient k(r) is proposed to
   represent the residual bearing capacity after subject to high
   temperature, and combined with three different codes to evaluate the
   ultimate bending moment. A comparison of test results showed the
   calculated results following the T/CCES 7-2020 (2020) had a good
   agreement. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Inhibition of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus by PKC
   inhibitor dequalinium chloride in vitro}},
Journal = {{VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{251}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{As a severe disease characterized by reproductive failure and
   respiratory distress, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome
   (PRRS) is one of the most leading threats to the swine industry
   worldwide. Highly evolving porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome
   virus (PRRSV) strains with distinct genetic diversity make the current
   vaccination strategy much less cost-effective and thus urge alternative
   protective host directed therapeutic approaches. RACK1-PKC-NF-kappa B
   signalling axis was suggested as a potential therapeutic target for PRRS
   control, therefore we tested the inhibitory effect of PKC inhibitor
   dequalinium chloride (DECA) on the PRRSV infection in vitro. RT-qPCR,
   western blot, Co-IP and cytopathic effect (CPE) observations revealed
   that DECA suppressed PRRSV infection and protected Marc-145 cells and
   porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) from severe cytopathic effects, by
   repressing the PKC alpha expression, the interaction between RACK1 and
   PKC alpha, and subsequently the NF-kappa B activation. In conclusion,
   the data presented in this study shed more light on deeper understanding
   of the molecular pathogenesis upon PRRSV infection and more importantly
   suggested DECA as a potential promising drug candidate for PRRS control.}},

Title = {{Machine learning-based glass formation prediction in multicomponent
   alloys}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{201}},
Pages = {{182-190}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Metallic glasses (MGs) have attracted considerable academic attention
   owing to their unique properties and great application prospects. Unlike
   other glassy materials, such as oxide glasses, MGs have limited glass
   forming-ability (GFA) that often leads to failure during new MG
   development. Although intensive studies have proposed various parameters
   and criteria enabling the evaluation of the GFA of MG samples, achieving
   accurate predictions of glass formation before the actual MG sample
   synthesis remains a great challenge and an open topic. In this study, we
   investigated the glass formation through the data-driven machine
   learning technique and trained a backpropagation neural network model
   based on a dataset assembled from thousands of ternary alloys. Applying
   the well-trained model, we accurately identified the MG and non-MG
   classes. More importantly, our model can effectively predict
   glass-formation likelihood of multicomponent alloys and locate the
   probable MG compositions without any prior experiment, thereby directing
   the MG design. From the model's predictions, we discovered several new
   MGs in the ribbon form. Glass-formation likelihood reveals the
   correlation with the thermodynamic and topological parameters, which
   provides insights into the GFA of MGs. (C) 2020 Acta Materialia Inc.

Volume = {{78}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Human auditory system is one of the most efficient and important
   biological system for human beings. To reproduce this system with
   electronic devices would profoundly advance artificial nervous system.
   However, emulating this system requires a complex architecture to mimic
   the biological auditory system functions such as listening, analyzing,
   and integrating instructions, which is still not available. Here, we
   report a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) actuated self-powered
   artificial auditory pathway to emulate the biological auditory
   functionalities, demonstrating its application in the intelligent
   neuromorphic computing and sound detection. The self-powered artificial
   auditory pathway consists of a femtosecond laser (fs) processed TENG and
   a field effect synaptic transistor (FEST) which functions as acoustic
   receptor and acoustic synapse, respectively. Moreover, the fs
   laser-induced auditory TENG exhibits broader frequency response with
   high sensitivity (129 mV/dB), and excellent empathy social behavior, and
   various typical synaptic functions can be well mimicked through TENG
   actuated FEST. Meanwhile, a self-adaptation artificial neuromorphic
   circuit with noise-adjustable behavior is demonstrated, which
   substantially improves the efficiency and accuracy of the instruction
   recognition process for more human-computer interaction system. This
   work provides an effective way to well mimic the biological auditory
   functions, which paves a new way to achieve the instruction recognition
   in a noise-intensity range ambient, and would profoundly decrease the
   power-consumption in the field of future neuromorphic systems.}},

Journal = {{FOOD CHEMISTRY}},

Abstract = {{beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases have attracted much attention in recent
   years due to their potential application in oligosaccharide production,
   in particular lacto-N-triose II (LNT2) and lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT)
   synthesis, which can be further used as backbone precursors for human
   milk oligosaccharides. A novel beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase gene from
   Tyzzerella nexilis (TnHex189) was heterologously expressed in Bacillus
   subtilis. The highest beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase activity of 14.5 U
   mL(-1) was obtained in a 5-L fermentor by fed-batch fermentation for 27
   h. TnHex189 was optimally active at pH 5.0 and 45 degrees C. It
   efficiently synthesized LNT2 with a conversion ratio of 57.2\% (4.7 g
   L-1). The synthesized LNT2 was further converted to LNnT by a reported
   beta-galactosidase (BgaD-D) in 8 h, with a conversion ratio of 17.3\%
   (6.1 g L-1). These unique synthesis activities may make this enzyme a
   good candidate for the food industry.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{50}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Organelle transport requires dynamic cytoskeleton remodeling, but
   whether cytoskeletal dynamics are, in turn, regulated by organelles
   remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that late endosomes, a type of
   prelysosomal organelles, facilitate actin-cytoskeleton remodeling via
   cytosolic translocation of immature protease cathepsin D (cathD) during
   microglia migration. After cytosolic translocation, late
   endosome-derived cathD juxtaposes actin filaments at the leading edge of
   lamellipodia. Suppressing cathD expression or blocking its cytosolic
   translocation impairs the maintenance but not the initiation of
   lamellipodial extension. Moreover, immature cathD balances the activity
   of the actin-severing protein cofilin to maintain globular-actin
   (G-actin) monomer pool for local actin recycling. Our study identifies
   cathD as a key lysosomal molecule that unconventionally contributes to
   actin cytoskeleton remodeling via cytosolic translocation during
   adenosine triphosphate-evoked microglia migration.}},

Abstract = {{An extremely close relationship exists between energy usage and water
   supply with a tremendous amount of energy being consumed to process
   water for drinking and other purposes. The current energy crisis and
   inefficient water management place enormous stress on the sustainability
   of our society and environment. As such, the development of
   high-efficiency, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly materials
   which possess co-existing functionalities for applications ranging from
   energy capture to water treatment in one material, provides an
   opportunity to achieve sustainable development. As multifunctional
   materials, the layer-structured Magneli titanium oxides with
   stoichiometry of TinO2n-1 (n >= 2) have been extensively studied in view
   of their potential for photocatalytic, thermoelectric and photothermal
   applications over the past few years. This group of materials occurs
   naturally as layered structures with planar oxygen defects, however,
   understanding of the correlation between the planar arrangements of the
   oxygen defects and various energy-related properties remains limited.
   Here, we demonstrate how the formation of layer structured TinO2n-1 with
   various planar oxygen defect arrangements correlates with the changes of
   their physical and chemical properties. The experimental results from
   inelastic neutron scattering analysis and electrical characterizations
   provide evidence that the planar oxygen defects are responsible for
   phonon scattering and exert a strong influence on their electrical
   conductivities. Manipulating these planar defects allows interconversion
   between different phases, which changes the interplay between electronic
   and phononic sub-systems. These manipulations potentially enable
   optimization of the corresponding physical properties of these materials
   such that they are rendered suitable for applications that require
   co-operative multifunctionality. More specifically, the experimental
   results demonstrate that the valence band positions and the onset
   potentials in the materials are raised, further enhancing their ability
   for catalysis of electrochemical reactions. This work also demonstrates
   the combinational effects of the thermoelectric and photothermal
   properties of these materials on their photocatalytic and
   electrochemical performance thereby providing a novel means of
   controlling the multi-response functionality of these materials for a
   variety of applications in different environments.}},

Abstract = {{Ginsenoside Rb1 (GsRb1) is the best constituent of ginseng and although
   it shows clinical efficacy as an antineoplastic, antioxidative and
   antirheumatic agent, its oral bioavailability is poor due to its limited
   solubility. In this study, the solubility of GsRb1 was improved by
   encapsulating it in polymeric nanocapsules (encapsulation efficiency:
   99.79\%), therefore, improving the oral bioavailability. The
   encapsulation resulted in stable, homogenous and well-dispersed
   nano-GsRb1, whose mean particle size and zeta potential were 183.9 nm
   and +36.9 mV, respectively. A significant improvement was observed in
   the in vitro release profile of nano-GsRb1 as compared to its free form.
   Our study also indicated a significant repression of the degradation of
   nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells
   inhibitor, alpha (I kappa B alpha), the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa
   B) signaling pathway, NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3
   (NLRP3) inflammasome activation, and the mitochondrial damage, thereby,
   reducing inflammation and gouty arthritis induced by monosodium urate

   inflamed joints for a better treatment effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Ni-rich lithium transition metal oxides have high specific capacity but
   generally have inferior cycling performance compared to their lower Ni
   content counterparts. core-shell structures with a Ni-rich core and a
   Mn-containing shell have been reported to improve the cycling
   performance of Ni-rich materials, but the impact of the shell on the
   performance of core-shell materials needs to be elaborated more. In this
   work, three core-shell precursors having a Ni(OH)(2) core, but different
   shell compositions and thicknesses, were lithiated at various
   temperatures and the resulting materials were examined physically and
   electrochemically. They were compared to the corresponding uniform
   ``shell{''} materials lithiated at the same temperatures. The selection
   of heating temperature is crucial and must be made with care to limit
   the interdiffusion between core and shell compositions while still
   heating to sufficient temperature to prepare crystalline materials with
   little lithium in the transition metal layer. Once these factors are
   understood, core-shell structures with an optimized shell thickness and
   Mn content can be made to simultaneously achieve high specific capacity

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A phytochemical investigation on the stems and leaves of Wikstroemia
   chuii resulted in the isolation of three new daphnane diterpenes,
   wikstroechuins A-C (1-3), together with eight known analogues (4-11).
   The structures of new daphnane diterpenes (1-3) were determined on the
   basis of extensive spectroscopic methods and the known daphnane
   diterpenes (4-11) were identified by comparing their observable
   spectroscopic data with those reported spectral data in the literature.
   The anti-inflammatory effects as well as anti-HIV activities in vitro of
   all isolated daphnane diterpenes 1-11 were assessed. As a consequence,
   daphnane diterpenes 1-11 displayed remarkable inhibitory activities on
   NO (nitric oxide) production induced by lipopolysaccharide in mouse

Abstract = {{Lightning activity and its associations with cloud structures during a
   rainstorm dominated by warm cloud precipitation were studied in
   Guangdong, China on May 7, 2017, using three-dimensional lightning
   location and polarimetric radar data. The overall convection and
   lightning activities of the rainstorm were weak. The rainstorm generally
   showed a typical tripolar charge structure with the main negative charge
   core located between the -15 and - 8 degrees C environmental isotherms
   in the first 4 h. The height of the charge regions clearly decreased
   after this period, with the main negative charge core being below the -8
   degrees C isotherm. Lightning discharges were more concentrated in areas
   featuring relatively weak convection and relatively low precipitation
   intensity. Most of the locations with lightning discharges were
   dominated by dry aggregated snow and weak updrafts and downdrafts. This
   investigation demonstrated that the lightning discharges were spatially
   separated from the area of origin of charging in this rainstorm. It is
   proposed that, with weak convection in the rainstorm, the charging rate
   was lower than the speed of charge transfer from the area of origin,
   causing a relatively low charge density and a low frequency of lightning
   in the area of origin of charging. Meanwhile, the aggregation of small
   charged particles in regions away from the area of origin of charging
   might be conducive to the formation of a relatively high charge density
   and therefore relatively frequent lightning flashes. This situation is
   different from a typical thunderstorm with strong convection.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the heterologous expression of an engineered
   thermostablle glucose oxidase from Aspergillus heteromophus CBS 117.55
   was achieved in P. pastoris. This recombinant GoxAh was thermostable,
   with an optimal temperature range 25 degrees C-65 degrees C, and it was
   capable of retaining greater than 90\% of its initial activity following
   a 10-mM incubation at 75 degrees C. This enzyme had an optimum pH of
   6.0, and it could retain above 80\% of its initial activity following a
   2-h incubation at a broad pH range (2.0-8.0). Moreover, GoxAh displayed
   excellent pepsin and trypsin resistance, and highly resistant to a range
   of tested metal ions and chemical reagents. These good properties make
   GoxAh a promising candidate for feed additive. The K-m and k(cat)/K-m
   values of GoxAh were 187 mM and 1.09/mM/s, which limited its widespread
   application to some degree. However, due to its excellent
   characteristics, GoxAh is still of potential economic value for high
   value-added areas, as well as a good initial enzyme for developing
   applicable feed enzyme by protein engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Bafilomycin A1 (BAF A1) is a macrolide antibiotic that, in addition to
   its antibacterial activity, can induce apoptosis of cancer cells.
   Glycosylation plays an important role in the modification of antibiotics
   as it can improve their bioactivity. However, glycosylation of BAF A1
   has not been previously reported. Bacillus licheniformis
   glycosyltransferase (GTs) Bl-YjiC and Bacillus subtilis GTs Bs-YjiC were
   expressed successfully in a heterologous manner. The glycosylation of
   BAF A1 with UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose or UDP-N-acetylglucosamine was
   catalyzed using the enzymes Bl-YjiC and Bs-YjiC. Our results
   demonstrated that Bl-YjiC can only utilize UDP-glucose as the donor,
   while Bs-YjiC can utilize all three glycosyl donors. The glycosylation
   site was demonstrated by MS/MS to be the hydroxyl group at the C21
   position of BAF A1. The anti-proliferative effects of glucosyl BAF A1
   (BAF-Glc) on HeLa cells indicate that this novel antibiotic is superior
   to BAF A1. The IC50 for BAF-Glc was determined to be 5.47 mu M. Here, we
   report the production of glycosylated BAF A1 for the first time, and we
   show that the produced BAF-Glc exhibited better anticancer activity than
   BAF A1. This work provides theoretical and experimental support for the
   development of novel anticancer bafilomycins.}},

Abstract = {{The accurate classification of plant organs is a key step in monitoring
   the growing status and physiology of plants. A classification method was
   proposed to classify the leaves and stems automatically based on the
   point cloud data of the potted plants. Leaf samples and stem samples
   were selected automatically by using the three-dimensional (3D) convex
   hull algorithm and the two-dimensional (2D) projection grid density
   respectively, and were used to construct the leaf and stem training
   sets. Then, the point cloud data were classified into leaf points and
   stem points by using the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The
   point cloud data of three potted plants were used in the experiment. The
   proposed method was compared with the standard classification, the
   random selection method and the manual selection method. Among these
   methods, the proposed method is automated and time-saving. The results
   show that the proposed method had a good overall performance on accuracy
   and running time. The proposed method is efficient and effective on the
   leaf and stem classification of the plant point cloud data. (C) 2020

   reference datasets: Interrogating the applicability of anthraco-typology
   to assess Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Miller) wood management from
   archaeological charcoal fragments}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Miller) is present in the
   palaeoenvironmental records of Mallorca (Balearic Islands, Western
   Mediterranean) since the Early Holocene. It is also documented in the
   archaeological charcoal analysis (aka anthracology) of early prehistoric
   sites, but it was especially exploited at certain sites during the Late
   Iron Age. However, different woodland exploitation strategies cannot be
   deciphered purely through the taxonomical identification of charcoal
   fragments, so it is difficult to assess if the presence of Aleppo pine
   in archaeological assemblages is due to specific social management
   strategies (branches and/or trunks exploitation). Anthracotypological
   methods, based on the measurement of charcoal-pith distance (allowing
   original wood diameters to be inferred) and ring width, have already
   been proposed for temperate species (Quercus petraea/robur) as a
   methodology to define the woodland exploitation of past societies and
   human impact on forest formations. However, such an approach yet to be
   set up for conifers growing in Mediterranean environments. In this study
   we have adapted the anthraco-typological methodology to conifer wood
   anatomy and evaluated its applicability on the archaeological charcoal
   assemblages of Aleppo pine, through complete dendrological analysis of
   the referential material. Our research is based on the systematic
   measurement of two different dendro-anthracological parameters on
   archaeological charcoal fragments: charcoal-pith distance and ring
   width. The results have been compared with the information on ring width
   and the growing conditions of modern trees in three different forest
   formations in Mallorca, representing the entire environmental
   variability of the Aleppo pine forests on the island. Trunk cores and
   wood discs of different diameter were measured in order to establish
   criteria to distinguish between both tree organs from the archaeological
   charcoal fragments. Analysis of this dataset has proved that
   anthraco-typological methods are applicable to Mediterranean conifers
   and to further interrogate pinewood exploitation in prehistoric
   Mallorca. Additionally, we have been able to question the formation of
   archaeological charcoal assemblages, identify various woodland
   management strategies and the human impact on woodlands during
   prehistory.}},

Title = {{Carbon photochemistry at Mars: Updates with recent data}},
Journal = {{ICARUS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{352}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We provide a comprehensive characterization of the photochemistry behind
   atomic carbon in the Mars atmosphere. Using a one-dimensional
   photochemical model, with an extensive reaction list incorporating new
   high-resolution photodissociation cross-sections (Heays et al., 2017)
   and the recently experimentally confirmed CO2 + h nu -> C+O-2 (Lu et
   al., 2014), we investigate the dominant channels for the production and
   loss of atomic carbon, against a subsolar background atmosphere based on
   MAVEN Deep Dip 2 observations. We confirm the results from previous
   studies that CO photodissociation and CO+ dissociative recombination are
   important contributors to atomic C production, and that reaction with
   O-2 to form CO is the main loss channel. However, we also find
   significant contributions from CO2 + -> h nu -> C + O-2 , HCO+ + e -> C
   + OH and charge exchange of C+ with CO2 . These additional production
   channels give rise to significantly higher C densities than have been
   previously reported, with a peak at 4 x 10(5) cm(-3) at a CO2 density of
   1.7 x 10(10) cm(-3) (similar to 146 km altitude). We find the C
   densities to vary with H2O densities over a Martian year, with the
   wetter perihelion season having 13\% lower C column densities. Contrary
   to Anbar et al.(1993), we find C densities to be relatively insensitive
   to the temperature-dependence of cross-sections for CO2 and CO
   photodissociation. A good understanding of carbon photochemistry in the
   present-day Martian atmosphere provides the essential foundational
   framework for determining the fate of atmospheric carbon in the study of
   Mars' climate evolution.}},

Title = {{Synergy between hot water treatment and high temperature ethylene
   treatment in promoting antioxidants in mature-green tomatoes}},
Journal = {{POSTHARVEST BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{170}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Controlled postharvest stresses were used to induce the synthesis of
   antioxidants in tomato fruit. In this study, a hot-water (HW) treatment
   of 52 degrees C for 5 min promoted higher total oxygen radical
   absorbance capacity (ORAC) compared to fruit immersed in 25 degrees C
   water for 5 min. Whereas, ethylene treatment at high temperature,
   particularly at 35 degrees C for 24, 48 or 72 h, induced higher content
   of total phenolics and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) than
   fruit treated with ethylene at 20 or 30 degrees C. In combination, there
   was synergy between the treatments, and this was most notable by the
   increase of total phenolics in HW-treated tomatoes exposed to ethylene
   at 35 degrees C for 24, 48 or 72 h. There was also a significant
   increase of total ORAC in HW-treated fruit exposed to ethylene at 30
   degrees C for 72 h or 35 degrees C for 24, 48 or 72 h. This increase in
   antioxidant capacity was observed in the hydrophilic fraction of
   HW-treated fruit exposed to ethylene at 30 degrees C for 72 h or 35
   degrees C for 24 or 48 h and in the lipophilic fraction of HW-treated
   tomatoes exposed to ethylene at 35 degrees C for 24, 48 or 72 h.
   Moreover, The HW-treatment especially maintained the level of total
   carotenoids and ascorbic acid when exposed to ethylene at 30 degrees C
   for 72 h or 35 degrees C for 48 or 72 h. Nevertheless, the high
   temperature ethylene treatment reduced the a{*} value of tomato peel
   regardless of the application of HW treatment. In conclusion,
   application of a HW treatment of 52 degrees C for 5 min followed by
   exposure to ethylene at 35 degrees C for 48 h was most effective in
   synergistically improving the antioxidant capacity and composition of
   tomatoes without severely impairing color development.}},

Title = {{Trajectory-dependent electronic excitations by light and heavy ions
   around and below the Bohr velocity}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{We present experiments demonstrating trajectory-dependent electronic
   excitations at low ion velocities, for which ions are expected to
   primarily interact with delocalized valence electrons. The energy loss
   of H+, H-2(+), He+, B+, N+, Ne+, Si-28,29(+), and Ar+ in self-supporting
   silicon membranes was analyzed along channeled and random trajectories
   in a transmission approach. For all ions, we observe a difference in
   electronic stopping dependent on crystal orientation. For heavier ions,
   the energy-loss difference between channeling and random geometry is
   generally found more pronounced, and, in contrast to protons, increases
   for decreasing ion energy. Due to the inefficiency of core-electron
   excitations at employed ion velocities, we explain these results by
   reionization events occurring in close collisions of ions with target
   atoms, which are heavily suppressed for channeled trajectories. These
   processes result in trajectory-dependent mean charge states, which
   strongly affect the energy loss. The strength of the effect seems to
   exhibit a Z(1) oscillation with an observed minimum for Ne. We,
   furthermore, demonstrate that the simplicity of our experimental
   geometry leads to results that can serve as excellent benchmark systems
   for dynamic calculations of the electronic systems of solids using
   time-dependent density functional theory.}},

Abstract = {{With the developing of Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile edge
   computing (MEC), more and more sensing devices are widely deployed in
   the smart city. These sensing devices generate various kinds of tasks,
   which need to be sent to cloud to process. Usually, the sensing devices
   do not equip with wireless modules, because it is neither economical nor
   energy saving. Thus, it is a challenging problem to find a way to
   offload tasks for sensing devices. However, many vehicles are moving
   around the city, which can communicate with sensing devices in an
   effective and low-cost way. In this paper, we propose a computation
   offloading scheme through mobile vehicles in IoT-edge-cloud network. The
   sensing devices generate tasks and transmit the tasks to vehicles, then
   the vehicles decide to compute the tasks in the local vehicle, MEC
   server or cloud center. The computation offloading decision is made
   based on the utility function of the energy consumption and transmission
   delay, and the deep reinforcement learning technique is adopted to make
   decisions. Our proposed method can make full use of the existing
   infrastructures to implement the task offloading of sensing devices, the
   experimental results show that our proposed solution can achieve the
   maximum reward and decrease delay.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, the effect of different kinds of impellers with

   impellers tested. The reactor was equipped with different designs of
   baffles: full, half and surface baffles or no baffles. Single (PBTU or
   RT) and dual (PBTU/PBTU or RT/RT) use of impellers with full (FB), half
   (HB), surface (SB) and no baffle (NB) combinations formed two sets of 16
   experiments. There was estimation of rate of hydrate formation,
   induction time, hydrate productivity, overall power consumption, split
   fraction and separation factor. In both single and dual impellers, the
   results showed that RT experiments are better compared to PBTU in rate
   of hydrate formation. The induction time is almost the same since we are
   deep in the equilibrium line while hydrate productivity values are
   higher in PBTU compared to RT experiments. As general view RT
   experiments consume more energy compared to PBTU experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Picobirnavirus (PBV) is a small two-segmented double-stranded RNA
   (dsRNA) virus that has been identified in diarrheic feces of a large
   range of animal hosts, including humans. For this reason, PBV has been
   recognized as an opportunistic agent of gastrointestinal disease. Even
   under these circumstances, there is a lack of studies regarding this
   pathogen. Not outstanding, in Brazil, the single description of the PBV
   occurrence in pigs was provided in the 1980s. Hence, this study aimed to
   verify the PBV occurrence in Brazilian swine farms and to perform
   molecular characterization of the identified strains. High genetic
   variability was found in the analyzed sequences. Further studies
   comprehending the infection of swine by PBV in Brazilian herds should be
   performed to provide more accurate information on its epidemiology and
   to discuss the role of the virus in gastrointestinal diseases.}},

Title = {{Changes in oxytocin concentrations in saliva of pigs after a transport

Abstract = {{Oxytocin is associated with reproductive physiology but also with
   welfare and positive emotions. In this study, oxytocin was measured in
   saliva samples of 45 pigs that were collected before being transported
   to the slaughterhouse, at the time of arrival and 4 h after arrival to
   the slaughterhouse. Two previously validated assays, one that measures
   free oxytocin and other that measures oxytocin linked to proteins, were
   used. In addition, cortisol, salivary alpha-amylase (sAA), total
   esterase activity (TEA), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and lactate
   dehydrogenase (LDH), which are biomarkers associated with stress and
   pain in pigs, were measured. The results showed a decrease in free and
   protein-linked oxytocin concentrations at 4 h after transport compared
   with the time before transport, while cortisol, sAA, TEA, BChE and LDH
   showed an increase at 4 h after transport compared with the time before
   transport. Based on these results it can be concluded that the transport
   and lairage at slaughterhouse in the conditions of this study produce a
   decrease in oxytocin in the saliva of pigs that could indicate a reduced
   emotional well-being.}},

Title = {{The gendered politics of rural electrification: Education, indigenous
   communities, and impacts for the Venezuelan Guajira}},
Journal = {{ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{70}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Rural electrification has often been promoted to improve women's access
   to education. However, no studies have been conducted to measure the
   actual impact of electrification on equitable access to education,
   qualitatively and quantitatively. This is particularly true when
   studying rural and indigenous communities in developing countries. The
   objective of this study is to comprehensively evaluate the impact of
   electrification on schooling for men and women in La Guajira
   (Venezuela). Their traditional indigenous rural communities were
   recently electrified with Renewable Energy Technologies (RET). The study
   focuses on eight communities that have never had electricity and whose
   location far from urban settlements limits other social relationships.
   During a week of total immersion in the fieldwork, the impact on 285 men
   and 273 women was analyzed through 43 household surveys. The results
   show that access to primary, secondary, and higher education has
   increased significantly thanks to coordinated education and electricity
   policies. School offers similar opportunities for both genders, but a
   higher percentage of indigenous women take advantage of the opportunity
   to study beyond the primary level.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The development of skills, behaviors and attitudes regarding
   patient safety is of utmost importance for promoting safety culture for
   the next generation of health professionals. This study describes our
   experience of implementing a course on patient safety and quality
   improvement for fourth year medical students in Mexico during the
   COVID-19 outbreak. The course comprised essential knowledge based on the
   patient safety curriculum provided by the WHO. We also explored
   perceptions and attitudes of students regarding patient safety. Methods:
   Fourth year medical students completed a questionnaire regarding
   knowledge, skills, and attitudes on patient safety and quality
   improvement in medical care. The questionnaire was voluntarily answered
   online prior to and after the course. Results: In total, 213 students
   completed the questionnaires. Most students were able to understand
   medical error, recognize failure and the nature of causation, perform
   root-cause analysis, and appreciate the role of patient safety
   interventions. Conversely, a disapproving perspective prevailed among
   students concerning the preventability of medical errors, utility of
   reporting systems, just culture and infrastructure (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: We found students had a positive perspective concerning
   learning quality in healthcare and patient safety during our course;
   nevertheless, their perception of the usefulness of reporting systems to
   prevent future adverse events and prevent medical errors is
   uncomplimentary. Medical education should promote error reporting and
   just culture to change the current perception of medical students.}},

Abstract = {{Anxiety affects students' performance in exams. Dispositional
   mindfulness (DM), the ability to be aware of one's own feelings and
   thoughts while not react to them, is associated with better cognitive
   performance under anxiety conditions. However, none study has addressed
   if DM mediates between anxiety and students' performance in test taking.
   The aim was to study DM as a mediator of the effect of anxiety over exam
   performance in a college sample.
   240 students driven from the same course and subject participated. Data
   was gathered before exam started. Measures entailed a sociodemographic
   questionnaire; the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI); the Five-Facets
   Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ); and final marks from the exam.
   Mediational analyses were performed for each STAI dimension, setting
   each FFMQ factor as mediator, and marks from the final exam as outcome.
   Twenty-nine participants were excluded due to prior experience in
   meditation. Direct effect model showed that final exam score was
   significantly predicted by STAI-State (R-2=,145, p<,001, b=-,536, 95\%
   CI {[}-,719, -353]). A significant indirect effect was detected
   (t=-3,937, p<,001) for STAI-State through FFMQ-Non-Reactivity (b=-,06,
   95\% CI {[}-,095, -,032]).
   Data suggest that anxiety negatively affects performance in final exams,
   but this effect is ameliorated by DM.}},

Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{904}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We present (SiO)-Si-29(J = 8-7) nu = 0, SiS (J = 19-18) nu = 0, and
   (SiO)-Si-28 (J = 8-7) nu = 1 molecular line archive observations made
   with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) of the
   molecular outflow associated with Orion Source I. The observations show
   velocity asymmetries about the flow axis that are interpreted as outflow
   rotation. We find that the rotation velocity (similar to 4-8 km s(-1))
   decreases with the vertical distance to the disk. In contrast, the
   cylindrical radius (similar to 100-300 au), the expansion velocity
   (similar to 2-15 km s(-1)), and the axial velocity v(z) (similar to-1-10
   km s(-1)) increase with the vertical distance. The mass estimated of the
   molecular outflow M-outflow similar to 0.66-1.3 M-circle dot. Given a
   kinematic time similar to 130 yr, this implies a mass-loss rate (M)over
   dot(outflow) similar to 5.1 - 10 x 10(-3) M-circle dot yr(-1). This
   massive outflow sets important constraints on disk wind models. We
   compare the observations with a model of a shell produced by the
   interaction between an anisotropic stellar wind and an Ulrich accretion
   flow that corresponds to a rotating molecular envelope in collapse. We
   find that the model cylindrical radii are consistent with the
   (SiO)-Si-29(J = 8-7) nu = 0 data. The expansion velocities and the axial
   velocities of the model are similar to the observed values, except for
   the expansion velocity close to the disk (z similar to +/- 150 au).
   Nevertheless, the rotation velocities of the model are a factor similar
   to 3-10 lower than the observed values. We conclude that the Ulrich flow
   alone cannot explain the rotation observed and other possibilities
   should be explored, like the inclusion of the angular momentum of a disk
   wind.}},

   the initial performance level and the playing position in young
   professional soccer players. In total, 162 soccer players (age = 20.6
   +/- 1.8 years) belonging to the same reserve team of a Spanish La Liga
   club participated in this study. Countermovement jump (CMJ) and 5 and 15
   m sprints were assessed in each season at the start of the preseason
   (July), Test 1 (T1), and the start of the competitive period
   (September), Test 2 (T2), from the 1998 to 2013 seasons. Considering all
   seasons, a trivial change was found in the sprint (5 m, Effect Size
   {[}ES] = -0.01; +/- 0.11, most-likely; and 15 m, ES = 0.05; +/- 0.09,
   most-likely) and countermovement jump (CMJ) performances (ES = -0.03;
   +/- 0.07; most-likely) after the preseason, but this varied across the
   seasons. While the fastest players in 5 m and 15 m tests and the most
   powerful worsened their performances in sprinting capacity (ES =
   0.53-0.65, small very-likely) and in jump ability (ES = -0.54; +/- 0.25,
   small very-likely), respectively, the slowest players and the less
   powerful improved their performance likely/most-likely (ES = -0.33 and
   -0.68, small and moderate) and very-likely (ES = 0.40; +/- 0.20, small)
   after the precompetitive period. The changes in CMJ and sprinting were
   trivial and trivial/small for all tactical positions. The changes in
   neuromuscular performance after the preseason were not stable across the
   seasons and varied depending on the initial performance level.
   Individualization strategies should be considered in the design of
   strength and conditioning programs in order to optimize the training
   process.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine the relative load (\% of one
   repetition maximum {[}1RM]) at which the concentric action becomes
   entirely propulsive in the bench press (BP) exercise and verify whether
   this relative load varies between athletes with different strength
   levels. Twenty-eight professional athletes (Olympic boxers, professional
   mixed martial arts fighters, and elite rugby players) performed a
   progressive loading test up to their 1RM in the BP exercise (BP-1RM).
   Athletes were ordered according to their relative strength values and
   equally divided into 2 different groups: ``low{''} (\#1.34) and
   ``high{''} (\$1.38) strength levels. An independent t-test was used to
   compare the variables between groups. Significance level was set at p <
   0.05. No significant differences were observed between the groups for
   the mean propulsive velocity attained at 1RM and for the maximum load
   that required braking action during the execution of the traditional BP
   exercise (effect size 5 0.27 and 0.15, respectively; p > 0.05). Our
   results revealed that at 80\% 1RM the concentric action can already be
   considered as 100\% propulsive in the BP exercise. Importantly, this
   occurrence was independent of strength level. Therefore, this relative
   strength measure (i.e., 80\% BP-1RM) may be used as a reference for the
   1RM in the BP throw.}},

Abstract = {{Chalcone is a common scaffold found in many biologically active
   compounds. The chalcone scaffold was also frequently utilized to design
   novel anticancer agents with potent biological efficacy. Aiming to
   continue the research of effective chalcone derivatives to treat cancers
   with potent anticancer activity, fourteen amino chalcone derivatives
   were designed and synthesized. The antiproliferative activity of amino
   chalcone derivatives was studied in vitro and 5-Fu as a control group.
   Some of the compounds showed moderate to good activity against three
   human cancer cells (MGC-803, HCT-116 and MCF-7 cells) and compound 13e
   displayed the best antiproliferative activity against MGC-803 cells,
   HCT-116 cells and MCF-7 cells with IC50 values of 1.52 mu M (MGC-803),
   1.83 mu M (HCT-116) and 2.54 mu M (MCF-7), respectively which was more
   potent than the positive control (5-Fu). Further mechanism studies were
   explored. The results of cell colony formatting assay suggested compound
   10e inhibited the colony formation of MGC-803 cells. DAPI fluorescent
   staining and flow cytometry assay showed compound 13e induced MGC-803
   cells apoptosis. Western blotting experiment indicated compound 13e
   induced cell apoptosis via the extrinsic/intrinsic apoptosis pathway in
   MGC-803 cells. Therefore, compound 13e might be a valuable lead compound
   as antiproliferative agents and amino chalcone derivatives worth further
   effort to improve amino chalcone derivatives' potency.}},

Abstract = {{In robotic manufacturing, the machining vibration can easily affect the
   quality of the processed surfaces due to poor stiffness and variable
   stiffness of the robot arm. It is important to monitor the processing
   quality. Therefore, an online process monitor method for robotic
   grinding is proposed in this article. Since the surface quality is
   difficult to be measured directly online, a vibration-surface quality
   map is proposed to show the mapping relationship between the vibration
   signals and the surface images. Based on this map, the grinding states
   are classified to lack, normal, and overgrinding, which formed the
   training set data. Then a convolutional neural network classifier is
   trained to detect the grinding states during robotic machining only with
   the vibration signals. To establish the vibration-surface quality map,
   the symmetrized dot pattern and sparse autoencoder methods are utilized
   to extract the features from the raw vibrations and images data, and a
   gray-level co-occurrence matrix index is further used to build the
   bridge between them. The experimental results in this article have
   proved the effectiveness and potential of our method for online robotic
   grinding quality monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Transfer learning is gaining increasing attention due to its ability to
   leverage previously acquired knowledge to assist in completing a
   prediction task in a related domain. Fuzzy transfer learning, which is
   based on fuzzy systems and particularly fuzzy rule-based models, was
   developed due to its capacity to deal with uncertainty. However, one
   issue with fuzzy transfer learning, even in the area of general transfer
   learning, has not been resolved: how to combine and then use knowledge
   when multiple-source domains are available. This study presents new
   methods for merging fuzzy rules from multiple domains for regression
   tasks. Two different settings are separately explored: homogeneous and
   heterogeneous space. In homogeneous situations, knowledge from the
   source domains is merged in the form of fuzzy rules. In heterogeneous
   situations, knowledge is merged in the form of both data and fuzzy
   rules. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets provide
   insights into the scope of applications suitable for the proposed
   methods and validate their effectiveness through comparisons with other
   state-of-the-art transfer learning methods. An analysis of parameter
   sensitivity is also included.}},

Title = {{Measuring the hydrological longitudinal connectivity and its spatial
   response on urbanization in delta plains}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{119}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The variations of hydrological longitudinal connectivity are influenced
   by natural factors and human activities in the delta plain where many
   sluices are distributed in. Measuring the longitudinal connectivity
   changed by human controls (i.e. sluices) is still an open question.
   Besides, the spatial relationship between the longitudinal connectivity
   and urbanization is not clear. To this end, a reasonable indicator
   (Sluice Longitudinal Connectivity Index, SLCI), composed of sluice
   passage probability, passage efficiency, and cumulative effects of
   sluices, is proposed to detect the changes in the longitudinal
   connectivity in the flood and non-flood seasons. Based on this
   indicator, we took the Wu-Cheng-Xi-Yu region (WCXY) in China as a study
   region and detected the spatial impacts of the urbanization indices on
   the longitudinal connectivity by the geographically weighted regression.
   It is found that the average longitudinal connectivity in the non-flood
   season is 32\% larger than that in the flood season in the WCXY region.
   The spatial distribution of the non-flood SLCI (values 0.6) is 26\%
   larger than that of the flood SLCI. Spatially, the longitudinal
   connectivity is low (SLCI < 0.2) along the river and around the city
   where the sluices are distributed in. The longitudinal connectivity of
   the highly urbanized regions is lower than that of the lowly urbanized
   regions. Meanwhile, the relative effects of urbanization indices on the
   longitudinal connectivity can be sorted as follows: Landscape (69\%) >
   Population (51\%) > Economy (48\%) in the nonflood season, and
   Population (88\%) > Economy (63\%) in the flood season.}},

Abstract = {{Locking effects of error fields on a tearing mode in Tokamak are studied
   numerically using the three-dimensional toroidal code based on a full
   set of magnetohydrodynamic equations. It is found that a threshold of
   the error field for mode locking exists and depends on the plasma
   rotation and the ramp-up time of the error field. The mode locking
   threshold increases with increasing the rotation frequency and the
   ramp-up time of the error field. Moreover, the results from the multiple
   helical error field suggest that the m/n = 3/1 and 4/2 error field along
   with the m/n = 2/1 error field can increase both the m/n = 2/1
   perturbation and its higher-harmonics through the mode coupling due to
   both the toroidal and nonlinear effects, but it becomes more effective
   if the 4/2 error field is imposed directly. The 3/1 error field in-phase
   (anti-phase) with the 2/1 error field leads to a positive (negative)
   contribution to intensification of the 2/1 tearing mode and mode
   locking.}},

Title = {{Selecting traits to improve the yield and water use efficiency of winter
   wheat under limited water supply}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{242}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Using high-yielding cultivars is an important measure to maintain grain
   production, especially in dryland environments. A field study in the
   2016/17 and 2017/18 seasons was conducted at Luancheng station in the
   North China Plain (NCP) to investigate winter wheat cultivars with
   high-yielding characteristics under water deficit conditions. The
   experiment contained two parts, with part one involving 10 cultivars of
   winter wheat grown under I0 (rainfed), I1 (one irrigation) and I2 (two
   irrigations) treatments and part two involving 32 cultivars grown under
   I1 treatment. The three irrigation regimes I0, I1, and I2 provided
   approximately 60 \%, 70 \% and 80 \% of the seasonal potential
   evapotranspiration, respectively. Yield variations were up to 47 \%
   among the 10 cultivars in the two seasons, and several cultivars could
   produce continuously higher yields than those of other cultivars under
   the different treatments. High-yielding cultivars produced higher water
   productivity than that of other cultivars. No single agronomic or
   physiological characteristics, except for biomass, could explain the
   yield differences among cultivars. However, canopy temperature (CT)
   during the grain filling stage had a continuous negative linear
   correlation with grain yield under limited water supply conditions in a
   high-yielding environment. The results indicated that the genetic
   variation in grain yield might be attributed to the ability to withdraw
   soil water, especially the deeper soil water, during the grain filling
   stage, which would result in a cooler canopy. CT as an indicator of
   high-yielding cultivars was further confirmed among the 32 cultivars
   under I1 treatment in the 2016/17. A relative adequate water supply
   during the grain filling stage also prolonged leaf greenness which was
   beneficial to dry matter production and grain yield. Therefore, the
   ability to efficiently utilize soil water and maintain dry matter
   production during the grain filling stage are two important
   characteristics for maintaining the high yield of winter wheat under
   water deficit conditions in the NCP.}},

Title = {{Experimental studies on influencing factors of stress corrosion in
   rectifying column}},
Journal = {{PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION}},

Volume = {{144}},
Pages = {{123-132}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Stress corrosion is the main factor that results in corrosion and
   fractures of rectifying columns in the process industries. Stress
   corrosion of rectifying columns can result in significant economic
   losses to chemical industries, while also having a major impact on the
   quality of products produced, particularly polysilicon. This gives rise
   to the need for research involving stress corrosion of rectifying
   columns. Corrosion coupons, including those with welds and bends, were
   used to simulate various stress conditions of stainless steel. For the
   experiments, a 1.5 wt.\% hydrochloric acid and 2.5 wt.\% sodium chloride
   solution was prepared to simulate realistic working conditions for the
   steel. The experimental methods include static coupon experiment,
   electrochemical experiment, scanning electron microscope and X-ray
   diffraction. The corrosion products of the coupons consisted mostly of
   grey-green materials with loose surface layers and small amounts of
   black matter. The corrosion products were confirmed to be FeCl2 and
   Fe2O3, and the corrosion degree of the bent 20 degrees coupon was found
   to be greater than that of other types of coupons. Under low temperature
   conditions, the corrosion rate of the coupons initially decreased over
   time before increasing and then decreasing again. At high temperatures,
   the corrosion rate began to decrease earlier than at low temperatures.
   The bending tendency of the 20 degrees hanging piece was the greatest
   and that of the 30 degrees hanging piece was the smallest. Higher
   temperatures promoted stress corrosion, with increases in temperature
   resulting in more significant corrosion effects. The results reported
   herein provide a theoretical basis and technical guidance for important
   anticorrosion and safety designs for distillation columns to be used in
   the semiconductor polysilicon rectification process. (C) 2020

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Advanced multiple injection strategies have been suggested for
   compression ignition engines in order to meet the increasingly stringent
   emission regulations. Experiments and simulations were used to study
   effects of the main-injection mode (times), the post-injection
   proportion, and timing on combustion and emissions in a heavy-duty
   diesel engine at high load and constant low speed. The results reveal
   the following. The NOx emissions of 1main+1post, 2main+1post, and
   3main+1post injections are all lower than those of single injection; the
   higher the number of main-injection pluses, the lower the NOx emissions.
   Enough main-post injection interval is needed to ensure post and main
   injections are relatively independent to entrain more fresh air to
   decrease the soot. Over-retarded post-injection timing tends to increase
   the soot due to the lower in-cylinder temperature. The combined effects
   of formation and oxidation determine the final soot. To gain the best
   trade-off of NOx and soot, compared with single injection, for the three
   multiple injections, the lowest soot emissions are gained at
   post-injection proportions of 15\% and post-injection timings of 25
   degrees, 30 degrees, and 35 degrees CA ATDC, with soot reductions of
   26.7\%, -34.5\%, and -112.8\%, and NOx reductions of 5.88\%, 21.2\%, and
   40.3\%, respectively, for 1main+1post, 2main+1post, and 3main+1post

Abstract = {{Introduction:
   Inabah program is psychospiritual rehabilitative approach which
   holistically incorporates Islamic concepts and religious practices in
   its module encompassing of prayers, zikir, and hydrotherapy.
   Objectives:
   This study attempts to (1) determine the impact of Inabah on
   health-related quality of life (HRQoL) profiles and religiousness and
   (2) explore the relationships between HRQoL and religiousness pre-Inabah
   and post-Inabah.
   Methods:
   A prospective preintervention and postintervention study was conducted
   at 3 Inabah centers in Malaysia, recruiting new inmates aged 18 years
   and above who were cognitively stable and have undergone detoxification.
   The Malay WHOQOL-BREF (higher score=better HRQoL) and Psychological
   Measure of Islamic Religiousness (PMIR) (higher score=better profiles)
   were administered before and after Inabah intervention (minimum 2 mo).
   Results:
   One hundred fifteen all-male inmates of 144 eligible participants
   (79.9\%) completed the program (age=30.5 +/- 7.8 y; intervention
   duration <= 2.5 mo=60.9\%; The Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia
   qualification=47.0\%). Significant positive changes in Overall HRQoL,
   General Health, Psychological, and Islamic Obligations and
   Implementation issues were detected after Inabah (P<0.05; effect
   size=0.27 to 0.39). Pre-Inabah, Life Satisfaction (in PMIR) correlated
   significantly with all HRQoL domains (P<0.001) while Islamic Obligations
   and Implementation only significantly correlated with Psychological
   domain (P<0.05). Majority of other PMIR versus HRQoL relationships were
   also significant. Post-Inabah however, dramatic increases were observed
   in Islamic Obligations and Implementation domain which linked
   significantly with all (except 1) HRQoL aspects.
   Conclusions:
   The positive impacts of the noninvasive Inabah program on HRQoL and
   religiousness among substance abusers were evident.}},

   Sensor Network for Unobtrusive Gait Analysis in Everyday Life}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Body sensor networks (BSNs) represent an important research tool for
   exploring novel diagnostic or therapeutic approaches. They allow for
   integrating different measurement techniques into body-worn sensors
   organized in a network structure. In 2011, the first Integrated Posture
   and Activity Network by MedIT Aachen (IPANEMA) was introduced. In this
   work, we present a recently developed platform for a wireless body
   sensor network with customizable applications based on a proprietary
   868MHz communication interface. In particular, we present a sensor setup
   for gait analysis during everyday life monitoring. The arrangement
   consists of three identical inertial measurement sensors attached at the
   wrist, thigh, and chest. We additionally introduce a force-sensitive
   resistor integrated insole for measurement of ground reaction forces
   (GRFs), to enhance the assessment possibilities and generate ground
   truth data for inertial measurement sensors. Since the 868MHz is not
   strongly represented in existing BSN implementations, we validate the
   proposed system concerning an application in gait analysis and use this
   as a representative demonstration of realizability. Hence, there are
   three key aspects of this project. The system is evaluated with respect
   to (I) accurate timing, (II) received signal quality, and (III)
   measurement capabilities of the insole pressure nodes. In addition to
   the demonstration of feasibility, we achieved promising results
   regarding the extractions of gait parameters (stride detection accuracy:
   99.6 +/- 0.8\%, Root-Mean-Square Deviation (RMSE) of mean stride time:
   5ms, RMSE of percentage stance time: 2.3\%). Conclusion: With the
   satisfactory technical performance in laboratory and application
   environment and the convincing accuracy of the gait parameter
   extraction, the presented system offers a solid basis for a gait
   monitoring system in everyday life.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the leader-tracking and the containment control
   problems for heterogeneous high-order Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) sharing
   information through a directed communication topology. To solve both the
   control problems, a fully-distributed Proportional-Integral-Derivative
   (PID) control strategy is proposed, whose stability is analytically
   proven by exploiting the regulator equations and the Static Output
   Feedback (SOF) procedure adapted to the MASs framework. The application
   of SOF allows recasting the PID control design problem into a
   state-feedback control design one and, hence, finding the proper values
   of the proportional, integral and derivative actions via classical
   state-feedback approaches, such as the Linear-Quadratic-Regulator (LQR)
   strategy. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness of the
   proposed approach in guaranteeing that each follower tracks the leader
   behavior in the case of leader-tracking and that each follower converges
   to the convex hull spanned by the multiple leaders in the case of
   containment control. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An example of seven seismogenic regions of the world with different
   conditions of tectonic deformation confirms the reliability of
   confinedness of weak earthquakes to two horizons in the Earth's
   continental crust at depths of 5 and 10 km, regardless of the region.
   The width of extrema at the level of 0.7 from the maximum does not
   exceed 2-3 km in most cases. This markedly pronounced bimodal depth
   distribution of the numbers of weak earthquakes is interpreted from the
   standpoint of increasing strength and decreasing inhomogeneity of the
   material in the Earth's crust with depth (Mogi, 1962; Scholz, 1968; Mori
   and Abercombie, 1997). It is assumed that the concentration of weak
   earthquakes near a depth of 5 km is determined by the fact that, due to
   a relatively high degree of inhomogeneity and low brittle fracture
   strength of the material in the crust, the fracture process stops before
   it develops into a major seismic event because of an obstacle to its
   development in the form of a site with increased strength. At greater
   depths (9-15 km), an initiation of rupture more likely develops into a
   larger event, since the rock material at these depths becomes more
   homogeneous and more durable due to the growth of confining pressure and
   temperature within the brittle-ductile transition zone. This leads to a
   relative increase in the number of larger earthquakes near a depth of 10
   km, providing the second extremum in the depth distribution of the
   number of earthquakes. Such implications also explain the confinedness
   of strong earthquakes observed in seismology to the bottom rather than
   to the roof of the seismogenic layer. At the same time, the almost
   complete absence of relatively strong earthquakes at depths greater than
   15-16 km may indicate a sharp change in elastic properties of the
   material and in the deformation nature in the lower part of the
   brittle-ductile transition zone and deeper. Here, brittle seismogenic
   deformation gives way to a plastic aseismic flow.}},

Title = {{Transition to virtual appointments for interventional neuroradiology due
   to the COVID-19 pandemic: a survey of satisfaction}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROINTERVENTIONAL SURGERY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1153-1156}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background
   The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way medicine is practiced,
   including the implementation of virtual care in many specialties. In the
   field of interventional neuroradiology (INR), virtual clinics are an
   uncommon practice with minimal literature to support its use. Our
   objective was to report prospective, single-centre data regarding
   patient and physician experience with virtual INR clinics for routine
   follow-up appointments.
   Methods
   We surveyed all patients that participated in a virtual INR clinic
   follow-up appointment at our hospital over a 3 month period. Information
   gathered included length of appointment delays (ie, wait times), length
   of appointment times, overall satisfaction, and perceived safety
   metrics. A survey was also sent out to all physicians who participated
   in virtual clinics with similar questions.
   Results
   118/122 patients and 6/6 physicians completed the survey. Wait times
   before previous in-person appointments were perceived to be much longer
   than virtual appointments, whereas in-person appointment times were
   longer. 112/118 (94.9\%) patients and 4/6 (67\%) physicians reported
   general satisfaction with their virtual clinic experience. There were
   8/118 patients who felt their conditions could not be safely assessed
   virtually, compared with 1/6 (17\%) physicians. Lastly, 72.2\% of
   patients reported that they would prefer virtual or telephone visits in
   the future for non-urgent follow-up, and 5/6 (83\%) of physicians
   reported the same.
   Conclusion
   Virtual INR clinics are more efficient and are preferred among patients
   and physicians for non-urgent follow-up appointments. Our study
   demonstrates the feasibility of a virtual platform for INR care, which
   could be sustainable for future practice.}},

Title = {{Improving the in vivo bioavailability and in vitro anti-inflammatory
   activity of tanshinone IIA by alginate solid dispersion}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF DRUG DELIVERY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{60}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Tanshinone IIA (TA) is a major active ingredient of traditional Chinese
   medicine Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Danshen) with poor solubility. The
   strong crystallinity of TA is the main reason for its poor solubility.
   Since sodium alginate (SA) can suppress the drug crystal growth and has
   excellent biocompatibility, we hypothesize that SA may be an ideal
   matrix for preparing solid dispersion (SD) to improve the dissolution
   rate and bioavailability of TA. In this study, a novel TA-SA-SD was
   developed via a rapid one-pot approach for improving the dissolution
   rate, in vivo bioavailability, and pharmacological activity of TA. The
   results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD)
   confirmed the SD process will reduce the crystallinity of TA. The
   crystallinity reduction of TA in TA-SA-SD can obviously improve the
   dissolution rate, oral absorption rate and in vivo bioavailability, the
   relative bioavailability of TA-SA-SD (1:6) and TA-SA-SD (1:8) were 2.08
   and 2.75 folds of TA, respectively. In vitro anti-inflammatory assays
   were performed in RAW264.7 cells by ELISA, fluorescence microscope and
   Western blot analysis. The results revealed that the TA-SA-SD can
   significantly improve the pharmacological activity of TA. This study
   provides a successful method of incorporating hydrophobic drugs into
   hydrophilic bio-macromolecules matrices for improving the dissolution
   rate and bioavailability.}},

Title = {{Characteristics of surface soil pollen of northern Borneo and its
   paleoenvironmental significance}},
Journal = {{MARINE MICROPALEONTOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{161}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies of pollen in northern Borneo lack basic data on surface
   soil pollen as a basis for the quantitative reconstruction of
   paleoclimate and modern palynological comparison. In this study, we
   conducted palynological analysis on 86 surface soil samples from
   northern Borneo, in addition to core NS07-25 from the southern South
   China Sea (SCS). The results reveal that the principal pollen component
   of the modern soil in northern Borneo is ferns (95.19\%) and the second
   one is trees (4.07\%). Fern spores dominate the pollen diagram of
   tropical rainforests in Borneo. In the northeast to southwest transect,
   fern spores and tree pollen represent approximately 94.47\% and 4.41\%
   of the topsoil pollen, respectively. At the highest-altitude site of the
   northwest to southeast transect, tree pollen and Polypodiaceae spores
   had the highest percentages. At low altitudes, the tree pollen content
   was low and Microlepia spores were abundant. Based on the principal
   component analysis of pollen samples, components 1 and 2 are probably
   related to humidity and temperature, respectively, which are crucial
   factors influencing pollen distribution. According to the near analysis
   function from ArcGIS, the pollen and spores in core N507-25 may have
   originated from northern Borneo, during 37.52-26 ka BP, and < 15 ka BP.
   The pollen concentrations in core N507-25 vary widely from 0 to 9000
   grains/g and the pollen characteristics are similar to those of the
   modern fern spore domain in northern Borneo. This study helps to explain
   the relationship between regional pollen data and the paleoenvironment
   in the SCS region.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION}},

Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2757-2776}},

Abstract = {{We present a pioneering investigation into the relation between
   passenger flow distribution and network properties in public transport
   systems. The methodology is designed in a reverse engineering fashion by
   utilizing passively measured passenger flow dynamics over the entire
   network. We quantify the properties of public transport networks using a
   range of centrality indicators in the topological representations of
   public transport networks with both infrastructure and service layers
   considered. All the employed indicators, which originate from complex
   network science, are interpreted in the context of public transport
   systems. Regression models are further developed to capture the
   correlative relation between passenger flow distribution and several
   centrality indicators that are selected based on the correlation
   analysis. The primary finding from the case study on the tram networks
   of The Hague and Amsterdam is that the selected network properties can
   indeed be used to approximate passenger flow distribution in public
   transport systems to a reasonable extent. Notwithstanding, no causality
   is implied, as the correlation may also reflect how well the supply
   allocation caters for the underlying demand distribution. The
   significance and relevance of this study stems from two aspects: (1) the
   unraveled relation provides a parsimonious alternative to existing
   passenger assignment models that require many assumptions on the basis
   of limited data; (2) the resulting model offers efficient quick-scan
   decision support capabilities that can help transport planners in
   tactical planning decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Bimodal nanoporous silver (BNPS) nanoarchitectures with surface area of
   about 17.6 m(2) g(-1) have been facilely fabricated by potentiostatic
   dealloying of dual-phase Ag10Zn90 precursor alloys consisting of both
   eta-Zn and epsilon-AgZn3 phases in alkaline solutions. The bimodal
   porous nanoarchitectures consisting of submicro-sized pores with
   characteristic sizes of about 750 nm and nano-sized nanopores with a
   size of about 9 nm are resulted from the primary selective dissolution
   of eta-Zn phases and subsequent dealloying of epsilon-AgZn3 phases.
   BNPSs exhibit superior electrocatalytic capabilities for the direct
   oxidation of ammonia-borane (AB) with an ultralow onset potential of
   -195 mV vs. RHE, oxidation current densities as high as 17.27 mA cm(-2)
   in 5 mM AB in 0.1 M NaOH and the number of electron transfers of 5.4 at
   0.4 V vs. RHE close to the theoretical value of 6. The excellent
   catalytic activities can be attributed to the bimodal channel
   distributions of BNPS, in which the ultrafine nanopores provide large
   active surface areas for catalytic reactions, and the submicro-sized
   channels ensure fast mass transport for the electrocatalysis and bulk
   solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Endoscopic cervical foraminotomy is increasingly used for cervical
   spondylotic radiculopathy (CSR), but there is great concern about
   radiation exposure because of the heavy dependence of this surgical
   method on fluoroscopy. The objective of this study was to introduce in
   detail an advanced surgical technique of keyhole foraminotomy via a
   percutaneous posterior full-endoscopic approach as a treatment for CSR
   and investigate its clinical outcomes. We retrospectively reviewed 33
   consecutive patients with CSR who underwent keyhole foraminotomy via a
   percutaneous posterior full-endoscopic approach from October 2015 to
   April 2017. The patients' general characteristics, including operative
   time, blood loss, hospital stay, complications, and recurrence, were
   obtained. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the visual analogue
   scale (VAS) for radicular pain, the neck disability index (NDI) for
   functional assessment, and the modified MacNab criteria for patient
   satisfaction. All operations were successfully performed (mean operation
   time, 62 min), with no measurable blood loss or severe related
   complications. The mean follow-up was 25 months. The VAS and NDI scores
   were significantly improved as compared with those in the preoperative
   period (preoperative vs. final follow-up: 7.6 +/- 1.6 vs. 3.83 +/- 7.34
   for VAS, P<0.01; 69.5\%+/- 10.5\% vs. 17.54\%+/- 13.40\% for NDI,
   P<0.01). Of the 33 patients, 32 (97.0\%) had good-to-excellent global
   outcomes and all patients obtained symptomatic improvement. In
   conclusion, keyhole foraminotomy via a percutaneous posterior
   full-endoscopic approach is an efficient, safe, and feasible procedure
   for the treatment of CSR. Its simplified single-step blunt incision for
   localization appears to decrease radiation exposure risks.}},

Abstract = {{Accreting white dwarfs (WDs) constitute a significant fraction of the
   hard X-ray sources detected by the INTEGRAL observatory. Most of them
   are magnetic Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) of the intermediate polar (IP)
   and polar types, but the contribution of the Nova-likes systems and the
   systems with optically thin boundary layers, Dwarf Novae (DNs) and
   Symbiotic Binaries (or Symbiotic Stars, SySs) in quiescence is also not
   negligible. Here we present a short review of the results obtained from
   the observations of cataclysmic variables and symbiotic binaries by
   INTEGRAL. The highlight results include the significant increase of the
   known IP population, determination of the WD mass for a significant
   fraction of IPs, the establishment of the luminosity function of
   magnetic CVs, and uncovering origin of the Galactic ridge X-ray emission
   which appears to largely be associated with hard emission from magnetic
   CVs.}},

   The electrochemical corrosion process was divided into four stages, and
   reactions at the alloy surface and corrosion morphology at each stage
   were analyzed. The passivity mechanism at the stable passivation stage
   and the occurrence of pitting corrosion at the transpassivation state
   were discussed especially. The corrosion parameters including E-corr,
   E-pass, i(pass) and E-pit were compared at different temperatures to
   reveal the relationship between the temperature and the corrosion
   resistance properties. The corrosion products were investigated by the
   aid of X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS).
   By designing different preoxidation procedures, the corrosion mechanism
   of oxide scales was analyzed for the preoxidized samples.}},

Abstract = {{Besides OpenStreetMap (OSM), there are other local sources, such as open
   government data (OGD), that have the potential to enrich the modeling
   process with decision criteria that uniquely reflect some local
   patterns. However, both data are affected by uncertainty issues, which
   limits their usability. This work addresses the imprecisions on
   suitability layers generated from such data. The proposed method is
   founded on fuzzy logic theories. The model integrates OGD, OSM data and
   remote sensing products and generate reliable landfill suitability
   results. A comparison analysis demonstrates that the proposed method
   generates more accurate, representative and reliable suitability results
   than traditional methods. Furthermore, the method has facilitated the
   introduction of open government data for suitability studies, whose
   fusion improved estimations of population distribution and land-use
   mapping than solely relying on free remotely sensed images. The proposed
   method is applicable for preparing decision maps from open datasets that
   have undergone similar generalization procedures as the source of their
   uncertainty. The study provides evidence for the applicability of OGD
   and other related open data initiatives (ODIs) for land-use suitability
   studies, especially in developing countries.}},

Title = {{Substorm onset and development: The crucial role of flow channels}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{211}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we described the basic features and observations bases of
   the scenario for the substorm expansion phase that we have developed
   from our research over the past-10 years. Onset occurs along magnetic
   field lines of the inner proton plasma sheet, and is first seen in the
   aurora as beading along the onset aurora arc, which lies near the
   equatorward boundary of the auroral oval. Growth of these onset waves
   and large amplitude electric field oscillations indicates that an abrupt
   transition from a stable to unstable state leads to onset. The
   transition to instability occurs as a result of an intrusion of a
   low-entropy flow burst/channel (i.e., a plasma bubble) to the inner
   plasma sheet, and such flow bursts are marked in the auroral oval by the
   initiation of a poleward boundary intensification (PBI) that evolves
   into an auroral streamer. Plasma flows associated with these and other
   PBIs are generally associated with enhanced reconnection at the distant
   tail neutral line, the reconnection being triggered by an incoming flow
   channel from the polar cap. It is reasonable that the onset instability
   is triggered by the intruding reduced entropy plasma abruptly changing
   the entropy distribution in the inner plasma sheet, though the specific
   onset instability has not been identified. The onset instability is
   azimuthally aligned and expands azimuthally, these occurring because, as
   a bubble moves earthward, lower energy ions tending to follow the
   electric field drift towards the dawn side while higher energy ions
   magnetic drift towards the duskside. Thus entropy is not conserved along
   center of mass drift trajectories, and the bubble spreads in longitude
   and deepens. The transition to non-linearity of the growing onset waves
   leads to streamers. How this occurs is another major outstanding
   question, but the first streamers could initiate within the plasma
   sheet-20 RE downtail, the region where reconnection has been inferred to
   occur soon after onset. It is likely that streamers and their associated
   reconnection initiate at the distant tail neutral line once the
   expansion phase auroral activity reaches the auroral poleward boundary.
   The substorm current wedge builds up from a sequence of longitudinally
   localized flow burst regions (wedgelets) that are associated with the
   expansion-phase streamers, dipolarize the local magnetic field, and give
   rise to traditional ground onset signatures on the ground, namely
   auroral zone H bays and mid -latitude positive H bays and Pi2
   pulsations.}},

Abstract = {{The two species of the Bokermannohyla claresignata species group (Anura:
   Hylidae) have not been collected for the last four decades. It is the
   only species group of the hyline tribe Cophomantini that has not yet
   been analysed genetically. Its phylogenetic position is thus uncertain,
   and it has a combination of adult and larval character states that make
   this group a crucial missing piece that hinders our understanding of
   Cophomantini phylogenetics and character evolution. We obtained DNA
   sequences from a museum larval specimen of Bok. claresignata, using
   specialized extraction methods and high-throughput DNA sequencing, and
   combined the molecular phylogenetic results with available phenotypic
   information to provide new insights into the taxonomy and phylogenetic
   relationships of its species group. Our phylogenetic results place Bok.
   claresignata as sister to the Boana pulchella group, supporting its
   inclusion in Boana, together with Bokermannohyla clepsydra. In light of
   this new finding, we recognize a newly defined Boana claresignata group
   to accommodate these species, thus resolving both the polyphyly of
   Bokermannohyla and the paraphyly of Boana. Considering the phylogenetic
   relationships of the Boana claresignata group, we also discuss the
   evolution of suctorial tadpoles and mature oocyte/egg pigmentation in
   Cophomantini.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The mental health has become an important public health issue
   in China. This study aimed to use panel data to explore how personal
   relative deprivation affects mental health among older adults in China.
   Methods: The panel data of this study was obtained from the 2011 and
   2014 waves of Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS).
   Furthermore, we used a panel data model to investigate the effect of
   per-sonal relative deprivation on mental health among the older adults.
   Results: Results from the panel data model show that greater feelings of
   relative economic deprivation were associated with lower level of
   cognitive function (coefficient = -0.3706, p < 0.01). Relative economic
   status adversely affected the psychological health (coefficient =
   -0.3636, p < 0.001). Social participation, physical exercise, and
   smoking accounted for 3.13\%, 1.43\%, and 0.19\% of the effect of
   relative economic status on cognitive function, respectively. The most
   important channel involving the effect of relative economic status on
   psychological health is social participation (1.62\%), followed by
   physical exercise (0.80\%) and smoking (0.14\%).
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that personal relative deprivation has
   negative effects on cognitive function and psychological health.
   Furthermore, the regression results also indicate that the negative
   health effect of personal relative deprivation shows significant age,
   gender, and urban-rural disparities. Moreover, there is evidence that
   social participation is an important transmission channel involving the
   effect of personal relative deprivation on mental health. Reducing
   personal relative deprivation can improve the mental health of the older
   adults.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional strategies of stem cell injection in treating myocardial
   infarction (MI) remain a challenge because of low retention rate and
   insufficient secretion of exogenous cytokines for efficiently improving
   the microenvironment in the infarcted myocardium, thus hampering the
   therapeutic effect. Herein, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)
   microparticles modified with human VE-cad-Fc fusion protein are
   fabricated and integrated with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) to
   construct functionalized MSC aggregates (FMAs). This fusion protein can
   effectively promote the paracrine activity of MSCs. The FMA is
   encapsulated with an injectable hyaluronic acid (HA)-based hydrogel,
   which is prepared by Schiff base reaction between oxidized HA (OHA) and
   hydrazided HA (HHA). The OHA@HHA hydrogel loading FMA is injected into
   the infarcted myocardium of rats, thereby efficiently improving the MI
   microenvironment in terms of decreased expressions of inflammatory
   cytokines and upregulated secretion of angiogenic factors compared to
   the plain hydrogel only and hydrogel encapsulating MSCs. The results of
   both echocardiography and histological analyses demonstrate the
   efficient reconstruction of cardiac function and structure and
   revascularization in the infarct myocardium. The delivery of
   functionalized stem cell aggregates with an injectable hydrogel offers a
   promising strategy for treating myocardial infarction and may be
   expanded to other tissue repair and reconstruction.}},

Abstract = {{The mesocotyl, a structure located between the basal part of the seminal
   root and the coleoptile node of seedlings, contributes to pushing the
   shoot tip through the soil surface, a function that is essential for the
   uniform emergence of direct-seeded rice. Its elongation is inhibited by
   light and induced in darkness. This investigation of an indica rice
   (P25) with vigorous mesocotyl elongation was aimed at identifying the
   ``omics{''} basis of its light-induced growth inhibition. A
   transcriptomic comparison between mesocotyl tissues that had developed
   in the dark and then been exposed to light identified many
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially abundant
   microRNAs (miRNAs). Degradome sequencing analysis revealed 27 negative
   miRNA-target pairs. A co-expression regulatory network was constructed
   based on the miRNAs, their corresponding targets, and DEGs with a common
   Gene Ontology term. It suggested that auxin and light, probably
   antagonistically, affect mesocotyl elongation by regulating polyamine
   oxidase activity. (C) 2020 Crop Science Society of China and Institute

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a high order spectral difference-based phase field
   lattice Boltzmann method (SD-PFLBM) is proposed for simulating
   incompressible two-phase flows. The spectral difference method (SDM) is
   used to discretize the convection term and the gradient term of the
   discrete Boltzmann equation for obtaining the flow field. Moreover, the
   SDM is also adopted to discretize the convection term and the high order
   partial derivative term of the Cahn-Hilliard equation for interface
   tracking. The proposed method can overcome the drawback of the standard
   LBM such as tie-up between the time step and the mesh spacing.
   Meanwhile, the present method still holds the locality of the standard
   LBM because each cell only needs its own information to complete the
   discretization. Numerical validations of the proposed method are
   implemented by simulating rigid-body rotation of Zalesak's disk, layered
   Poiseuille flows, bubble deformation in shear flow, Rayleigh-Taylor
   instability, and bubble merging. More satisfactory interface shapes and
   flow properties can be achieved as compared with the published data in
   the literature. In addition, the convergence studies are also given,
   which prove that the current SD-PFLBM can achieve high order accuracy by
   increasing the order of cell local polynomials.}},

Title = {{Jet transport particle filter for attitude estimation of tumbling space
   objects}},
Journal = {{AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{107}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The particle filter (PF) is one of the most potential methods for
   nonlinear state estimation of spacecraft on account of its accuracy and
   stability. However, the heavy computational burden limits its
   application in real-time estimations. In this paper, we propose an
   improvement for the PF based on the Jet Transport (JT) theory, and apply
   it to the real-time attitude estimation of tumbling space objects. The
   main innovation of the Jet Transport Particle Filter (JTPF) is to employ
   the JT technique in the particle evolution process, rather than using
   the numerical integration as the classical PF, so as to reduce the
   computational burden of the algorithm. Furthermore, the proposed JTPF
   uses the multiplicative error quaternion to avoid further errors in the
   normalizing process, and the regularization technique to avoid the
   particle degeneracy. The JTPF is tested in three scenarios with

Abstract = {{Carbon fibers reinforced lithium aluminosilicate matrix composites
   (C-f/LAS) were prepared by slurry infiltration combined with a hot press
   procedure. The friction, wear behavior, and wear mechanisms of C-f/LAS
   composites under dry sliding conditions were investigated. The results
   show that the coefficient of friction (COF) initially increased with the
   increase in carbon fiber content, and reached the maximum value of 0.20
   for the 33\%C-f/LAS composite. The COF increased sharply with increasing
   sample temperature from RT to 300 degrees C. The COF remained stable in
   the temperature range of 300-500 degrees C. The two wear mechanisms of
   LAS glassceramics are fatigue wear and abrasive wear. The C-f/LAS
   composites demonstrate slight spalling and shallow scratches. These
   results show that carbon fibers improve the mechanical properties and
   wear resistance of C-f/LAS composites.}},

Abstract = {{Uveal melanoma (UM) is a currently untreatable form of melanoma with a
   50\% mortality rate. Characterization of the essential signaling
   pathways driving this cancer is critical to develop target therapies.
   Activating mutations in the G alpha q signaling pathway at the level of
   GNAQ, GNA11, or rarely CYSLTR2 or PLC beta 4 are considered alterations
   driving proliferation in UM and several other neoplastic disorders.
   Here, we systematically examined the oncogenic signaling output of
   various mutations recurrently identified in human tumors. We demonstrate
   that CYSLTR2 -> GNAQ/11 -> PLC beta act in a linear signaling cascade
   that, via protein kinase C (PKC), activates in parallel the MAP-kinase
   and FAK/Yes-associated protein pathways. Using genetic ablation and
   pharmacological inhibition, we show that the PKC/RasGRP3/MAPK signaling
   branch is the essential component that drives the proliferation of UM.
   Only inhibition of the MAPK branch but not the FAK branch synergizes
   with inhibition of the proximal cascade, providing a blueprint for
   combination therapy. All oncogenic signaling could be extinguished by
   the novel GNAQ/11 inhibitor YM-254890, in all UM cells with driver
   mutation in the G alpha q subunit or the upstream receptor. Our findings
   highlight the GNAQ/11 -> PLC beta -> PKC -> MAPK pathway as the central
   signaling axis to be suppressed pharmacologically to treat for
   neoplastic disorders with G alpha q pathway mutations.}},

Abstract = {{To address the problem of weakly supervised instance segmentation for
   electrical equipment using only a red, green, and blue (RGB) camera, an
   automatic annotation of masks of samples (AAMS) method based on thermal
   image guidance is proposed in this article. With only image-level label
   supervision, we exploit foreground segmentation results of thermal
   images to guide the instance mask extraction of electrical equipment in
   RGB images through the heterogeneous pixel registration algorithm
   between RGB-thermal (RGB-T) image pairs. It is realized to automatically
   annotate instance masks, which greatly improves efficiency and decreases
   costs. In addition, we further propose a progressively optimized model
   (POM) for instance segmentation, which first utilizes the fully
   connected conditional random field (CRF) and the constrain-to-boundary
   loss to specify fine-detailed boundaries of each object and to solve the
   difficulty of segmenting electrical equipment with complicated
   structures. This model also explores the self-paced learning technology
   to solve the issue of resolution differences between RGB-T image pairs
   for improving the generalization ability. By comparison to the other
   state-of-the-arts, experimental results show that our method can obtain
   by far the better performance on the electrical equipment data set.}},

Title = {{LncRNA Gm16410 regulates PM2.5-induced lung Endothelial-Mesenchymal
   Transition via the TGF-beta 1/Smad3/p-Smad3 pathway}},
Journal = {{ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{205}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Exposure to PM2.5 can cause serious harm to the respiratory system.
   Until now, although many toxicological studies have shown that pulmonary
   fibrosis can be caused by long-term PM2.5 exposure, there is no evidence
   that Endothelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EndMT) can trigger the process
   of pulmonary fibrosis after exposure. LncRNAs are a class of non-coding
   RNAs detected in mammalian cells. Nevertheless, researchers have not
   found whether lncRNAs participate in PM2.5 induced EndMT during
   pathophysiological duration. The Balb/c mouse model was exposed to PM2.5
   for 4 months by dynamic intoxication. The levels of specific endothelial
   and mesenchymal markers were evaluated by molecular biology experiments
   to elucidate the mechanisms of EndMT induced by PM2.5 in lung tissues.
   LncRNA microarray analysis of the established mouse model of PM2.5
   exposure was performed. Based on a bioinformatics analysis and RT-qPCR
   analysis, lncRNA Gm16410 attracted our attention. The change of lncRNA
   Gm16410 in mouse pulmonary vascular endothelial cells (MHCs) exposed to
   PM2.5 was verified, and the mechanism of lncRNA Gm16410 in EndMT was
   discussed. The changes of cell function were evaluated by cell migration
   and proliferation experiments. The molecular biology experiments proved
   that PM2.5 induced EndMT by activating the TGF-beta 1/Smad3/p-Smad3
   pathway in vitro. The relationship of EndMT and lncRNA Gm16410 was
   verified in mouse lung tissues and MHC cells by PM2.5 exposure. The
   involvement of lncRNA Gm16410 in PM2.5-induced EndMT highlights the
   potential of lncRNA to promote pulmonary fibrosis under environmental
   pollution.}},

Journal = {{ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS}},

Volume = {{118}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Extrusion container (EC) is the most expensive piece of press tooling in
   an extrusion machine. This work is dedicated to proposing a method to
   model the damage evolution of EC and assessing its serving lifetime. To
   describe the mechanical properties and deterioration, a constitutive
   model with Armstrong-Fredrick/Ohno-Wang (AF-OW) kinematic hardening rule
   and an improved isotropic hardening rule is built and Lemaitre's damage
   law is employed. Due to high temperature, creep deformation has also
   been taken into consideration and been incorporated in inelastic strain.
   Simulation of EC's lifetime assessment under its real service condition
   has been implemented and the results are convincing and meaningful.
   Therefore, this work can be used to optimize the parameters of EC design
   and extrusion process, and guide EC's maintenance and layer replacement
   in order to enhance its service lifetime and reduce the extrusion cost.}},

   Single honeycomb panels were fabricated through additive manufacturing
   technique, and assembled using slotting technique. The effect of
   boundary factor on the single square honeycomb panels have been studied,
   which refers to none, single-side, double-side boundary conditions. The
   effect of material properties on the crushing response has also
   involved. For the tensile test, it was concluded that the PLA/CF
   specimen offered the higher young modulus with 428.75 MPa than 360.76
   MPa of PLA specimen. For the quasi-static compression test, the
   compressive modulus and strength of the single honeycomb sandwich panel
   showed 489.69 MPa and 18.32 MPa with boundary type 1, which provided the
   highest value compared to other two boundary condition types. Moreover,
   the square honeycomb sandwich panels with PLA/CF material and type 3
   boundary condition offered the better crushing performance on energy
   absorption (EA) with 66.42 kJ and specific energy absorption (SEA) with
   2282.47 kJ/kg. In addition, the crushing behaviour and failure mode were
   also involved and discussed in this study.}},

Title = {{Location of natural gas leakage sources on offshore platform by a
   multi-robot system using particle swarm optimization algorithm}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{The offshore platform serves as the infrastructure for offshore mining.
   In order to guarantee safe operation of the platform and the development
   of the platform in the direction of intelligence, a natural gas leakage
   intelligent detection system with fast response is necessary to prevent
   potential accident when leakage occurs. In this work, a method to locate
   leaked natural gas is proposed based on the particle swarm optimization
   algorithm for the multi-robots to achieve. First, the advection
   diffusion equation is calculated to simulate the leakage gas
   transmission using finite difference method in different scene layouts.
   At the same time,a multi-robot collaborative detection strategy for gas
   detection, gas tracking, and gas source localization is proposed using
   an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm. After that, the
   process of multi robots search for leak sources was simulated. In
   addition, the control algorithm is analyzed, and the results show that
   the strategy has a high detection rate. Further analysis shows that the
   number of robots has increased from 2 to 7, the time it takes for the
   multi-robot system to successfully locate the leak source decreased;
   when the number of robots is constant, the time it takes for the
   multi-robot to successfully locate two leak sources is longer than the
   time to locate a single leak. Finally, search strategies based on
   particle swarm optimization, ant colony algorithm and cuckoo search
   algorithm are used to simulate in a single leak source environment. When
   the number of robots is changed from 3 to 7, compared with the other two
   algorithms, the accuracy of the search strategy search based on particle
   swarm is increased by 2\%-28\%, and the search time is accelerated by
   27s-92s.the particle swarm optimization is superior than two others for
   control of multi-robot system in leakage source location.}},

Abstract = {{The modal vibration of the rotor is the main cause of excessive
   vibration of the aeroengine overall structure. To attenuate the
   vibration of the rotor under different modal shapes from the perspective
   of energy control, the intrinsic physical relationships between rotor
   modal shapes and instantaneous vibrational energy flow transmission
   characteristics is derived from the general equation of motion base on
   the structural intensity method. A dual-rotor-support-casing coupling
   model subjected to the rotor unbalanced forces is established by the
   finite element method in this paper. The transmission, conversion and
   balance relationships of the vibrational energy flow for the rotors in
   the first-order bending modal shape, the conical whirling modal shape
   and the translational modal shape are analyzed, respectively. The
   results show that the vibrational energy flow transmitted to the
   structure can be converted into the strain energy, the kinetic energy
   and the energy dissipated by the damping of the structure. The
   vibrational energy flow transmission characteristics of rotors with
   different modal shapes are quite different. Especially for the
   first-order bending modal shape, the vibrational energy flow and the
   strain energy are transmitted and converted to each other in the middle
   part of the rotor shaft, resulting in large deformation at this part. To
   attenuate this harmful vibration, the influences of grooving on the
   shaft on the first-order bending vibration are studied from the
   perspective of transmission control of vibrational energy flow. This
   study can provide theoretical references and guidance for the vibration
   attenuation of the rotors in different modal shapes from a more
   essential perspective. (C) 2020 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and

   seamlessly integrates LD and MO. We propose a gradient-based approach to
   solve the unified mathematical formulation, as well as a set of discrete
   optimization techniques to avoid being stuck in local optimum. The
   conventional optimization process can be accelerated as some inferior
   decomposition results can be smartly pruned in early stages. The
   experimental results show that the proposed unified framework can
   achieve more than 34x speed-up compared with the conventional two-stage
   flow, meanwhile, it can dramatically reduce EPE violations by more than
   8x, and thus maintain better design quality.}},

Abstract = {{Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is typically mediated by antibiotic
   therapy, which has increased in prevalence in recent years. Previous
   studies have suggested that ginger, a common spice and herbal medicine,
   can modulate the composition of gut microbiota and is beneficial against
   gastrointestinal disease. This study investigates the therapeutic
   effects of fresh ginger extract on AAD in a rat model. Gut microbiota
   and intestinal barrier function were also studied. Ginger was
   administered to rats with AAD. Diarrhea symptoms were assessed, and 16s
   rRNA sequencing analysis of gut microbiota was performed. An AAD model
   was successfully established, and ginger was found to effectively
   ameliorate AAD-related diarrhea symptoms. After the intervention of
   ginger decoction, the diversity (rather than richness) of gut microbiota
   was significantly improved, and the gut microbiota recovery was
   accelerated. At the genus level, Escherichia\_Shigella and Bacteroides
   levels decreased and increased the most, respectively. Additionally,
   these changes were demonstrated to be coincidental with the moderate
   restoration of intestinal barrier function, especially the restoration
   of tight junction protein ZO-1. Our data indicate that ginger could
   restore gut microbiota and intestinal barrier function during
   alleviation of AAD.}},

Abstract = {{A left atrial movable ball thrombus is unusual and may cause fatal
   systemic emboli or left ventricular inflow obstruction. Among movable
   ball thrombi, a spinning ball thrombus is a rare and devastating
   occurrence that results in cardioembolic stroke. Here, we report the
   case of an 88-year-old woman with a large spherical thrombus spinning in
   the left atrium when a catastrophic cardioembolic stroke recurred. She
   had a history of atrial fibrillation but was unable to continue
   anticoagulation therapy due to hemorrhagic complications and developed
   an initial cerebral embolism with a large thrombus attached to the left
   atrium. Twelve days after the initiation of anticoagulation therapy, an
   extensive cerebral embolism throughout the bilateral frontal lobe
   recurred with disturbance of consciousness. Transthoracic
   echocardiography revealed a large detached spherical thrombus spinning
   in the left atrium. She did not recover consciousness and was moved to
   another hospital for palliative care three months later. Movable type
   left atrial thrombi are regarded as a high risk for thromboembolic
   events, but those with spinning movements may have a worse prognosis.}},

   Indonesia: A Model-Based Study}},
Journal = {{VACCINES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the only available vaccine for
   tuberculosis (TB), has been applied for decades. The Indonesian
   government recently introduced a national TB disease control programme
   that includes several action plans, notably enhanced vaccination
   coverage, which can be strengthened through underpinning its favourable
   cost-effectiveness. We designed a Markov model to assess the
   cost-effectiveness of Indonesia's current BCG vaccination programme.
   Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were evaluated from the
   perspectives of both society and healthcare. The robustness of the
   analysis was confirmed through univariate and probabilistic sensitivity
   analysis (PSA). Using epidemiological data compiled for Indonesia, BCG
   vaccination at a price US\$14 was estimated to be a cost-effective
   strategy in controlling TB disease. From societal and healthcare
   perspectives, ICERs were US\$104 and US\$112 per quality-adjusted life
   years (QALYs), respectively. The results were robust for variations of
   most variables in the univariate analysis. Notably, the vaccine's
   effectiveness regarding disease protection, vaccination costs, and case
   detection rates were key drivers for cost-effectiveness. The PSA results
   indicated that vaccination was cost-effective even at US\$175 threshold
   in 95\% of cases, approximating the monthly GDP per capita. Our findings
   suggest that this strategy was highly cost-effective and merits
   prioritization and extension within the national TB programme. Our
   results may be relevant for other high endemic low- and middle-income
   countries.}},

Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{563-593}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Due to its direct relevance to post-disaster operations, meter reading
   and civil refuse collection, the Uncertain Capacitated Arc Routing
   Problem (UCARP) is an important optimisation problem. Stochastic models
   are critical to study as they more accurately represent the real world
   than their deterministic counterparts. Although there have been
   extensive studies in solving routing problems under uncertainty, very
   few have considered UCARP, and none consider collaboration between
   vehicles to handle the negative effects of uncertainty. This article
   proposes a novel Solution Construction Procedure (SCP) that generates
   solutions to UCARP within a collaborative, multi-vehicle framework. It
   consists of two types of collaborative activities: one when a vehicle
   unexpectedly expends capacity (route failure), and the other during the
   refill process. Then, we propose a Genetic Programming Hyper-Heuristic
   (GPHH) algorithm to evolve the routing policy used within the
   collaborative framework. The experimental studies show that the new
   heuristic with vehicle collaboration and GP-evolved routing policy
   significantly outperforms the compared state-of-the-art algorithms on
   commonly studied test problems. This is shown to be especially true on
   instances with larger numbers of tasks and vehicles. This clearly shows
   the advantage of vehicle collaboration in handling the uncertain
   environment, and the effectiveness of the newly proposed algorithm.}},

   Storage System}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Thermal energy storage (TES) technologies are becoming vitally important
   due to intermittency of renewable energy sources in solar applications.
   Since high energy density is an important parameter in TES systems,
   latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) system is a common way to
   store thermal energy. Though there are a great number of experimental
   studies in the field of LHTES systems, utilizing computational codes can
   yield relatively quick analyses with relatively small expense. In this
   study, a numerical investigation of a LHTES system has been studied
   using ANSYS FLUENT. Results are validated with experiments, using
   hydroquinone as a phase-change material (PCM), which is external to
   Therminol VP-1 as a heat transfer fluid (HTF) contained in pipes. Energy
   efficiency and entropy generation are investigated for different
   tube/pipe geometries with a constant PCM volume. HTF inlet temperature
   and flow rate impacts on the thermodynamic efficiencies are examined
   including viscous dissipation effects. Highest efficiency and lowest
   entropy generation cases exist when when flow rates are lowest due to
   low viscous heating effects. A positive relation is found between energy
   efficiency and volume ratio while it differs for entropy generation for
   higher and lower velocities. Both efficiency and entropy generation
   decreased with decreasing HTF inlet temperature. The novelty of this
   study is the analysis of the effect of volume ratio on system
   performance and PCM melting time which ultimately proved to be the most
   dominant factor among those considered herein. However, as PCM
   solidification and melting time is of primary importance to system
   designers, simply minimizing entropy generation by decreasing volume
   ratio in this case does not lead to a practically optimal system, merely
   to decrease heat transfer entropy generation. Therefore, caution should
   be taken when applying entropy analyses to any LHTES storage system as
   entropy minimization methods may not be appropriate for practicality
   purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Achieving high water productivity in single-basin solar stills remains a
   challenge and may require efficient still insulation and downscaling to
   ease experimentation. Here, mini-passive polystyrene (PS) -based
   single-slope solar still is designed for brackish water desalination.
   Supervised machine learning regressions are applied to create trained
   models from experimental results. The proposed method aims to develop
   accurate predictive models via dimensional analysis and datasets
   expansion from in-between randomization. Built models predicted the
   still performance (eta) when replacing PS with another wall -insulating
   material. We correlated the water-glass temperature (T-w-T-g) and
   evaporative coefficients (h(ewg)) to the still outputs using the
   stepwise linear regression (SLR) showing minimum statistical errors (R-2
   approximate to 1) and RMSE<0.016. A good agreement between theoretical,
   numerical, and experimental results is observed; while decreasing feed
   rates boosts evaporation/condensation. The still achieved a maximum eta
   = 18.33\% corresponding to F = 30 mL/day, T-w-T-g = 4.6 degrees C, hewg
   = 21.11 W/m(2)degrees C, and radiative water -glass coefficient (q(rwg))
   = 0.188 W/m(2) at 15:00 time. Hourly-measured still outputs fitted
   against NASA insolation followed similar patterns confirming the
   successful operation. Polyurethane (PU) and Silica are found to be
   promising wall-insulating candidates for maximizing the still output
   owing to their low kins. This work paves the way towards retaining the
   still absorbed radiation via thin-film foil-wrapped low -conductive
   insulators. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We used graph theoretical measures to investigate the hypothesis that
   structural brain connectivity constrains the influence of functional
   connectivity on the relation between age and fluid cognition. Across 143
   healthy, community-dwelling adults 19-79 years of age, we estimated
   structural network properties from diffusion-weighted imaging and
   functional network properties from resting-state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging. We confirmed previous reports of age-related decline
   in the strength and efficiency of structural networks, as well as in the
   connectivity strength within and between structural network modules.
   Functional networks, in contrast, exhibited age-related decline only in
   system segregation, a measure of the distinctiveness among network
   modules. Aging was associated with decline in a composite measure of
   fluid cognition, particularly tests of executive function. Functional
   system segregation was a significant mediator of age-related decline in
   executive function. Structural network properties did not directly
   influence the age-related decline in functional system segregation. The
   raw correlational data underlying the graph theoretical measures
   indicated that structural connectivity exerts a limited constraint on
   age-related decline in functional connectivity. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: Hepatitis C is the most common hepatotropic
   viral infection that affects patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Most
   of the laboratories in India depend on HCV antibody detection by ELISA.
   PCR based studies on detection of HCV RNA among haemodialysis patients
   are very scanty in India. The current study was undertaken to find the
   prevalence of HCV among haemodialysis patients by ELISA and PCR.
   Materials and Methods: This prospective study was conducted from January
   to May 2018 in a total of 100 samples. Patients more than 18 years of
   age, who had undergone at least 15 sessions of dialysis were enrolled in
   the study. All samples were screened for HCV antibody by ELISA and HCV
   RNA by PCR. Data regarding age and gender of the patients, history of
   blood transfusion, duration of hemodialysis, total bilirubin levels were
   collected from medical records.
   Results: Among the 100 samples, only one was positive for HCV antibody
   by ELISA. Eight samples were positive for HCV RNA by PCR. In this study
   62.5\% of the HCV positives had a previous history of blood transfusion.
   Duration of dialysis was more among the HCV positive group but there was
   no statistical significance.
   Conclusion: This is the first study from the southern state of Kerala in
   India showing the prevalence of HCV among hemodialysis patients by PCR.
   Our study showed an overall HCV prevalence of 8\% by PCR. All the PCR
   positive samples were negative by 3rd generation ELISA which is an
   alarming finding and further justifies the need for PCR for detecting
   HCV.}},

Abstract = {{From ancient times, nanoparticles with the diameter in the scope of
   1-20nm become a foremost interdisciplinary area of research. Now a day's
   in technology, II-VI Semiconductors perform a key role. By chemical
   precipitation technique, ZnS and ZnS/CdS core-shell nanoparticles are
   arranged with suitable thickness. Core particles are prepared first and
   then the amalgamation process of shells is performed by selecting
   ethanol as solvent at ordinary temperature. The structural and chemical
   characterizations were performed by utilizing X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   Scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDAX) with energy dispersive,
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier Transforms Infrared
   Spectroscopy (FTIR), Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (UV visible),
   Photo-luminescence (PL) and Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM). Shell
   growth is identified from XRD, SEM with EDAX, TEM. Using UV-Visible
   Spectroscopy optical properties were characterized. Powder XRD pattern
   exhibits peaks correspond to cubic phase of ZnS and ZnS/CdS core-shell
   nano particles and estimated the average particle size from Debye's
   Scherer's method is approximately equals to the individual methods of
   Williamson-Hall methods and are in the order of nm and also hold good
   with theoretical values from UV-Vis. It is practical that the inclusion
   perimeter was sort at 200-260 nm and corresponding energy gaps is 1.22eV
   and 3.02eV respectively, which is red-shifted compared to bulk ZnS
   (345nm) and the excitonic wavelength at 310 nm (3.99 eV). The cubic
   formation of bulk ZnS show the apparent red-shift, then the energy gap
   of the major portion of ZnS is 3.68 eV (345 nm). By stiffness effects,
   the radiant intensity gap is acquired with Brus equality. Luminescence
   is acquired to the recombination during the sulfur vacancy associated
   electron capture donor under the CB and ZnS correlated hole trap
   acceptor beyond the VB as report prior. The calculated coordinates of
   prepared sample and the theoretical values of chromaticity epicentre is
   (X-e, Y-e) are at X-e = 0.3320 and Y-e = 0.1858. The M-H loop of the
   as-synthesized core-shell nanoparticles showed intrinsic ferromagnetic

Journal = {{VASCULAR PHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{135}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aim: Cell therapies are hampered by poor survival and growth of grafts.
   We tested whether forced co-expression of telomerase reverse
   transcriptase (TERT) and myocardin (MYOCD) improves post-infarct
   revascularization and tissue repair by adipose tissue-derived
   mesenchymal stromal cells (AT-MSCs).
   Methods and results: We transplanted AT-MSCs overexpressing MYOCD and
   TERT in a murine model of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We
   characterized paracrine effects of AT-MSCs. When transplanted into
   infarcted hearts of C57BL/6 mice, AT-MSCs overexpressing TERT and MYOCD
   decreased scar tissue and the intra-scar CD3 and B220 lymphocyte
   infiltration; and increased arteriolar density as well as ejection
   fraction compared with saline or mock-transduced AT-MSCs. These effects
   were accompanied by higher persistence of the injected cells in the
   heart, increased numbers of Ki-67+ and CD117+ cells, and the expression
   of cardiac actin and beta-myosin heavy chain. Intramyocardial delivery
   of the secretome and its extracellular vesicle (EV)-enriched fraction
   also decreased scar tissue formation and increased arteriolar density in
   the murine AMI model. Proteomic analysis of AT-MSCs-EV-enriched fraction
   predicted the activation of vascular development and the inhibition of
   immune cell trafficking. Elevated concentrations of miR-320a, miR-150-5p
   and miR-126-3p associated with regulation of apoptosis and
   vasculogenesis were confirmed in the AT-MSCs-EV-enriched fraction.
   Conclusions: AT-MSCs overexpressing TERT and MYOCD promote persistence
   of transplanted aged AT-MSCs and enhance arteriolar density in a murine
   model of AMI. EV-enriched fraction is the component of the paracrine
   secretion by AT-MSCs with pro-angiogenic and anti-fibrotic activities.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the electrical properties and operational stability of
   amorphous indium-tin-zinc-oxide (a-ITZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs).
   We fabricated the a-ITZO TFTs using deposition by radio frequency
   sputtering at room temperature followed by a rapid thermal annealing
   (RTA) process at different temperatures and oxygen pressure (P-O2). This
   is a more practical annealing route compared to a conventional furnace.
   Based on film densification and oxygen vacancy optimization, the a-ITZO
   TFTs exhibited 9.8 cm(2) Vs(-1), 0.82 V/decade and 1.39 V, for
   saturation mobility, sub-threshold swing and threshold voltage,
   respectively. Operation stability tests and hysteresis behavior of
   a-ITZO TFTs suggest that oxygen vacancy concentration of a-ITZO thin
   films gradually decreases under higher P-O2, consequently affecting the
   threshold voltage and the shift seen after a gate bias stress test. This
   observation suggests that gate bias stress and hysteresis stability of
   an a-ITZO device is due to the effect of oxygen-controlled pressure in
   the RTA process. This a-ITZO TFTs electrical characterization
   qualitatively coincides with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analyses
   of oxygen vacancy concentration in a-ITZO thin films. Thus, our
   systematic a-ITZO thin film optimization using the oxygen-ambient RTA
   process is a practical basis for high-performance amorphous oxide
   semiconductor TFT post-annealing methods.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing tree cover in agricultural lands can contribute to achieving
   global and national restoration goals, more so in the drylands where
   trees play a key role in enhancing both ecosystem and livelihood
   resilience of the communities that depend on them. Despite this,
   drylands are characterized by low tree survival especially for tree
   species preferred by local communities. We conducted a study in arid and
   semi-arid areas of Kenya and Ethiopia with 1773 households to assess how
   different tree planting and management practices influence seedling
   survival. Using on-farm planned comparisons, farmers experimented and
   compared tree survival under different planting and management practices
   as well as under varying socioeconomic and biophysical contexts in the
   two countries. Seedling survival was monitored at least six months after
   planting. Results show that watering, manure application, seedling
   protection by fencing and planting in a small hole (30 cm diameter and
   45 cm depth) had a significant effect on tree seedling survival in
   Kenya, while in Ethiopia, mulching, watering and planting niche were
   significant to tree survival. Household socioeconomics and farms'
   biophysical characteristics such as farm size, education level of the
   household head, land tenure, age of the household head had significant
   effects on seedling survival in both Ethiopia and Kenya while presence
   of soil erosion on the farm had a significant effect in Kenya. Soil
   quality ranking was positively correlated with tree survival in
   Ethiopia, regardless of species assessed. Current findings have
   confirmed effects of context specific variables some involving
   intrahousehold socioeconomic status such education level of the
   household head, and farm size that influence survival.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: In modern day surgical practice, patients and their
   relatives garner more knowledge through websites rather than direct
   interaction with the consultant physician. We aimed to assess whether
   Indian endocrine surgery websites matched with their counterparts
   abroad.
   Materials \& methods: We identified 60 endocrine surgery websites
   worldwide and 12 endocrine surgery websites maintained by trained
   endocrine surgeons from India. The website parameters, demographic data
   of the web sites, rank, and other parameters were assessed using a
   professional website (www.Alexa.com). An endocrine surgeon along with a
   technical website advisor rated the content, presentation, and likes
   from a scale of 1-5 (1 minimum score and 5 maximum score).
   Results: A total of 72 individual endocrine surgery websites, out of
   which 60 were from abroad and 12 were from India, were analyzed. A
   majority of foreign websites were ranked (43/60), whereas 2/12 Indian
   websites were ranked (P < 0.0001). Foreign websites had a better
   landscape profile. Except for pancreatic facts, which were significantly
   different (P = 0.006) between Indian and foreign websites, there was no
   significant difference in thyroid facts, parathyroid facts, adrenal
   facts, photographs, videos, postop advice, contact information,
   publications, and complications.
   Conclusion: Most parameters were comparable in both groups.
   Postoperative advice and complications were present in only a few
   websites. A well-designed endocrine surgery website can aid both the
   patient and the treating physician.}},

Abstract = {{Findings of the available studies regarding the roles of branched-chain
   amino acids (BCAAs) and aromatic amino acids (AAAs) in hypertension are
   inconsistent, conflicting and inconclusive. The purpose of this study
   was to explore and clarify the existence of any relationships of
   individual BCAAs and AAAs with hypertension with adjustments for
   potential relevant confounders. A total of 2805 healthy controls and
   2736 hypertensive patients were included in the current analysis. The
   associations between individual amino acids and hypertension were
   explored by logistic regression analyses adjusted for potential
   confounding variables. Among the investigated amino acids, only the
   BCAAs showed consistently significant positive associations with
   hypertension in the adjusted models (p-trend < 0.05 to 0.001). However,
   compared with the corresponding lowest quartile of individual BCAAs, the
   positive association with hypertension remained significant only in the
   highest quartile (p < 0.01 to 0.001). We confirmed in a relatively large
   cohort of subjects that BCAAs, not AAAs, demonstrated consistent
   positive associations with hypertension. The results display the
   promising potential for the use of BCAAs as relevant and accessible
   biomarkers, and provide perspectives on interventions directed towards
   the reduction in plasma BCAA levels in the prevention and management of
   hypertension.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined Hajj pilgrims' knowledge and reported practice of
   hand hygiene. In Hajj 2019, a cross-sectional survey was undertaken in
   Mina, Makkah, Saudi Arabia, of domestic Saudi pilgrims aged >= 18 years
   by using a self-administered Arabic questionnaire that captured data on
   pilgrims' socio-demographics, hand hygiene knowledge, and reported
   practices of hand cleaning following certain actions. A total of 348
   respondents aged 18 to 63 (median 32) years completed the survey, of
   whom 200 (57.5\%) were female. The mean (+/- standard deviation (SD))
   hand hygiene knowledge score was 6.7 (+/- SD 1.9). Two hundred and
   seventy one (77.9\%) and 286 (82.2\%) of respondents correctly
   identified that hand hygiene can prevent respiratory and
   gastrointestinal infections respectively, but 146 (42\%) were not aware
   that it prevents hand-foot-mouth disease. Eighty-eight (25.3\%)
   respondents erroneously reported that hand hygiene prevents HIV. Washing
   hands with water and soap was the most preferred method practiced before
   a meal (67.5\% (235/348)), after a meal (80.2\% (279/348)), after toilet
   action (81.6\% (284/348)), when hands were visibly soiled (86.2\%
   (300/348)), and after waste disposal (61.5\% (214/348)). Hajj pilgrims
   demonstrated a good knowledge and practice of hand hygiene, but there
   are gaps that are vital to control outbreaks such as COVID-19.}},

Abstract = {{The cabbage aphid, Brevicoryne brassicae (L.), is one of the major
   insect pests of cole crops in Iran. In most instances outbreaks are
   normally kept under control by application of insecticides. In this
   study, the sublethal effects (LC30) of three insecticides, acetamiprid,
   buprofezin, and thiamethoxam-lambda cyhalothrin, (TLC) were evaluated on
   the population growth rate of the progeny of insecticide-treated cabbage
   aphid adults. The age-stage, two-sex life table method was used to
   analyze the collected data. The results indicated that the insecticide
   applications affected the duration of the preadult period, their
   survival, reproduction, life span/longevity, and consequently, the
   population growth rate of the F-1 generation. The indicators of the
   greatest sublethal effects were noted in the progeny of the TLC-treated
   adults. These included the lowest net reproductive rate (R-0), intrinsic
   rate of increase (r), finite rate of increase (lambda), and the longest
   mean generation time (T). The highest values of r, lambda, R, and the
   lowest value of T occurred in the control group followed by, in order,
   the acetamiprid and buprofezin groups. These research findings will be
   useful in the development and implementation of future aphid management
   programs.}},

Abstract = {{Optimized and informed design of impinging jets can effectively enhance
   their rate of heat transfer. One practical pathway for such designing is
   to add nanoparticles to a background fluid. Here, we determine the
   effects of nanoparticle chemistry, their size, and their total volume
   fraction in water on the rate of heat transfer. We perform a
   comprehensive optimization using artificial neural network (ANN) and
   genetic algorithm (GA) to systematically study the enhanced heat
   transfer in nanofluids compared to pure water in obtaining a uniform
   cooling on a constantly heated surface in a turbulent flow. Our results
   indicate that increasing the size and concentration of nanoparticles
   enhances the rate of heat transfer. Nanoparticles are found to improve
   the uniformity of Nusselt distribution in the range of Nu = 57.5-72.5,
   however, in the range of Nu = 20-35, air is found to be more uniform.
   Finally, we perform a Thermodynamic analysis to determine the
   contribution of heat transfer and the frictional forces of the system on
   the total entropy generation in the optimal point. Results show that the
   portion of the two sources on entropy generation virtually equal for
   air, but the effects of heat transfer dominates for water and
   Al2O3/water nanofluids.}},

Abstract = {{Aim This study aimed to determine the factors that influence perceived
   social support among older adults in Malaysia.
   Methods We used the 11-item Duke Social Support Index to assess
   perceived social support through a face-to-face interview. Higher scores
   indicate better social support. Linear regression analysis was carried
   out to determine the factors that influence perceived social support by
   adapting the conceptual model of social support determinants and its
   impact on health.
   Results A total of 3959 respondents aged >= 60 years completed the Duke
   Social Support Index. The estimated mean Duke Social Support Index score
   was 27.65 (95\% CI 27.36-27.95). Adjusted for confounders, the factors
   found to be significantly associated with social support among older
   adults were monthly income below RM1000 (-0.8502, 95\% CI -1.3523,
   -0.3481), being single (-0.5360, 95\% CI -0.8430, -0.2290), no
   depression/normal (2.2801, 95\% CI 1.6666-2.8937), absence of activities
   of daily living (0.9854, 95\% CI 0.5599-1.4109) and dependency in
   instrumental activities of daily living (-0.3655, 95\% CI -0.9811,
   -0.3259).
   Conclusion This study found that low income, being single, no
   depression, absence of activities of daily living and dependency in
   instrumental activities of daily living were important factors related
   to perceived social support among Malaysian older adults. Geriatr

Abstract = {{The habitat quality of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), including the
   availability of plant food and nesting species, is important to ensure
   the long-term survival of this endangered species. Botanical composition
   of vegetation is spatially variable and depends on soil characteristics,
   weather, topography, and numerous other biotic and abiotic factors.
   There are few data regarding the availability of chimpanzee plant food
   and nesting species in the Masito-Ugalla Ecosystem (MUE), a vast area
   that lies outside national park boundaries in Tanzania, and how the
   availability of these resources varies with human disturbance. We
   hypothesized that chimpanzee plant food species richness, diversity, and
   abundance decline with increasing human disturbance. Further, we
   predicted that chimpanzee abundance and habitat use is influenced
   negatively by human disturbance. Published literature from Issa Valley,
   Gombe, and Mahale Mountains National Parks, in Tanzania, was used to
   document plant species consumed by chimpanzees, and quantify their
   richness, diversity, and abundance, along 32 transects totaling 63.8 km
   in length across four sites of varying human disturbance in MUE. We
   documented 102 chimpanzee plant food species and found a significant
   differences in their species richness (H = 55.09, P < 0.001) and
   diversity (H = 36.81, P < 0.001) across disturbance levels, with the
   moderately disturbed site exhibiting the highest species richness and
   diversity. Chimpanzees built nests in 17 different tree species. The
   abundance of nesting tree species did not vary across survey sites (H =
   0.279, P > 0.964). The least disturbed site exhibited the highest
   encounter rate of chimpanzee nests/km, with rates declining toward the
   highly disturbed sites. Our results show that severe anthropogenic
   disturbance in MUE is associated with the loss of chimpanzee plant food
   species and negatively influences chimpanzee habitat use, a relationship
   that threatens the future of all chimpanzee populations outside national
   parks.}},

Abstract = {{The processing of ordinally organized information is a characteristic of
   both serial-order working memory and numerical cognition. Serial
   positions of items presented within a list follow an ordinal
   organization when stored in working memory, whereas numbers are based on
   an ordinal structure stored in long-term memory. We tested the
   hypothesis that long-term numerical ordinal representations support the
   coding of temporary serial position information in working memory. In
   Experiment 1, learned word-number associations appeared to have a
   negative instead of a positive impact on immediate serial recall
   performance relative to control conditions. Experiments 2 showed that
   this effect was due to a stronger opportunity for learning associations
   of words to serial positions in the control lists as compared to the
   experimental lists. Experiment 3 showed that when controlling for these
   positional learning effects, there was no reliable effect of learned
   word-number associations on immediate serial recall performance. This
   study indicates that numerical codes do not play a major role in coding
   serial position information in working tasks. At the same time, the
   robust item-position learning effects demonstrate a contribution of
   long-term item-position associations to immediate memory for order.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the effects of Cr2O3 additive on the thermal stability
   and zircon decomposition were investigated. The substitution of Cr at
   zircon lattice and the formation of solid solution were also discussed.
   Cr2O3 was added at up to 4 wt.\% to zircon. The sintering of samples was
   carried out at the temperatures of 1450-1650 degrees C for 3 h. The
   phase composition, physical properties, and microstructural changes for
   the sintered samples were characterized. Results of Rietveld refinement
   analysis showed that 1 wt.\% of chromia retarded the decomposition of
   zircon (nearly 40\%). Further addition of this additive slightly
   improved the thermal stability of zircon. Also, up to 2 wt.\% of chromia
   additive decreased the porosity of zircon and suppressed the grain
   growth. However, 4 wt.\% of chromia increased the porosity contents. XRD
   peaks of zircon shifted to higher angles by the addition of 2 wt.\% of
   Cr2O3 and zircon lattice parameters were decreased, attributed to the
   formation of a solid solution. Energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis
   detected the presence of Cr at zircon grains. However, 4 wt.\% (4.8
   at.\%) of Cr2O3 resulted in the formation of a secondary phase concluded
   that this amount of Cr2O3 is beyond the solubility limit of Cr in
   zircon.}},

Abstract = {{Minimizing of the life-threatening thrombo-emboli formation in pulsatile
   heart assist devices by a new biomimetic heart valve design is presently
   one of the most important problems in medicine. As part of this work, an
   original valve structure was proposed intended for pneumatic,
   extracorporeal ventricular assist devices. The valve design allows for
   direct integration with other parts of the pulsating blood pump.
   Strengthening in the form of the titanium or steel frame has been
   introduced into the polyurethane lagging, which allows for maintaining
   material continuity and eliminating the risk of blood clotting. The
   prototype of the valve was made by the injection molding method assisted
   by numerical simulation of this process. The prototype was introduced
   into a modified pulsating, extracorporeal heart assist pump ReligaHeart
   EXT (developed for tilting disc valves) and examined in-vitro using the
   ``artificial patient{''} model in order to determine hydrodynamic
   properties of the valve in the environment similar to physiological
   conditions. Fundamental blood tests, like hemolysis and thrombogenicity
   have been carried out. Very low backflow through the closed valve was
   observed despite their slight distortion due to pressure. On the basis
   of immunofluorescence tests, only slight activation of platelets was
   found on the inlet valve and slight increased risk of clotting of the
   outlet valve commissures as a result of poor valve leaflets assembling
   in the prototype device. No blood hemolysis was observed. Few of the
   clots formed only in places where the valve surfaces were not smooth
   enough.}},

Title = {{Cross-Border Electricity Trading in Southeast Europe Towards an Internal
   European Market}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The European Commission's Target Model's main objective is to integrate
   European electricity markets, leading to a single internal energy market
   and guaranteeing the instantaneous balance between electricity
   generation and demand. According to the target model for electricity
   trading, proposed by the European Network Transmission System Operators
   for Electricity (ENTSO-E), within each zone, electricity can be traded
   freely without taking into consideration network limitations. In
   contrast, for cross-border trading, the exchanges with other market
   areas are taken into account. Cross-border trade poses a further burden
   on the interconnection lines, resulting in increasing network
   congestion, which in turn restricts electricity trading. Thus,
   calculating the available capacity for trade has a significant
   ramification on the market. Today, the Available Transfer Capacity (ATC)
   mechanism dominates cross-border trading, but this methodology may be
   replaced by the Flow-Based (FB) approach across Europe. This paper
   investigates both approaches regarding the cross-border congestion
   management under the market coupling procedure. In our case study, the
   Southeast Europe (SEE) region is taken into consideration; it consists
   of both the FB and ATC approach in a five country (Greece, North
   Macedonia, Bulgaria, Serbia, and Romania) scenario. The purpose of our
   tests is to perform, compare, and evaluate the effectiveness of each
   method for the SEE region, while the main findings are the maximization
   of social welfare, better cross-border trading opportunities, and price
   convergence via the FB method.}},

Title = {{Cardiac arrhythmias and In-hospital mortality amongst patients with
   takotsubo cardiomyopathy: A retrospective study in an Italian population}},
Journal = {{IJC HEART \& VASCULATURE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{31}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) is an acute non-ischemic
   cardiomyopathy classically associated with an intense emotional or
   physiologic trigger. Data on the relationship between arrhythmias and
   mortality in TTC have been limited by small sample sizes. The aim of
   this study is to assess the impact of ventricular and atrial arrhythmias
   and advanced atrioventricular block on in-hospital mortality in a large
   inpatient population with TTC.
   Methods: Data was obtained from the Italian National Healthcare System
   Databank from 2009 to 2016. Patients with TTC were identified using
   diagnosis codes and clinical characteristics were collected, with a
   primary outcome of mortality. Univariate and multivariate logistic
   regression analyses were used to identify significant predictors for
   mortality, and patients with TTC were further analyzed according to sex
   and age.
   Results: There were 10,861 patients with TTC; 91.7\% were women (9959)
   and the mean age was 70.7 +/- 11.9 years. The mortality rate was 2.2\%;
   while 1.2\% of patients had ventricular arrhythmias, 10.0\% had atrial
   arrhythmias, and 1.3\% had advanced atrioventricular block. Male sex,
   increased age and ventricular arrhythmias were predictors of mortality.
   In a sex-stratified analysis, ventricular arrhythmias and advanced age
   remained independent predictors for mortality in women.
   Conclusion: In this large retrospective analysis, male sex and the
   presence of ventricular arrhythmias are strong predictors of mortality
   in patients hospitalized with TTC. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Lately, the Magnetic Resonance scans have struggled with its own
   inherent limitations, such as spatial resolution as well as long
   examination times. In this paper, a novel, rapid compressively-sensed
   magnetic resonance high resolution image resolution algorithm is
   presented. This technique addresses these two key issues by employing a
   highly-sparse sampling scheme and super-resolution reconstruction (SRR)
   method. Due to highly challenging requirements for the accuracy of
   diagnostic images registration, the presented technique exploits image
   priors, deblurring, parallel imaging, and a discrete dense displacement
   sampling for the deformable human body and motion analysis. The clinical
   trials as well as phantom based studied have been conducted. It has been
   proven that the proposed algorithm is able to enhance image spatial
   resolution, reduce motion artefacts and scan times.}},

Title = {{Can the ``Appropriate{''} Footwear Prevent Injury in Leisure-Time
   Running? Evidence Versus Beliefs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ATHLETIC TRAINING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Leisure-time running is one of the most popular forms of physical
   activity around the world. It can be practiced almost everywhere and
   requires mainly a pair of ``appropriate{''} running shoes. However, the
   term appropriate is ambiguous, and the properties of running footwear
   have always generated hot debates among clinicians, coaches, and
   athletes, whatever the level of practice. As the main interface between
   the runner's foot and the ground, the shoe potentially plays an
   important role in managing repetitive external mechanical loads applied
   to the musculoskeletal system and, thus, in injury prevention.
   Consequently, over the last decades, running shoes have been prescribed
   based on matching shoe features to foot morphology. This strategy aligns
   with the popular belief that footwear is one of the main extrinsic
   factors influencing running-related injury risk. Despite a seemingly
   sound strategy for shoe prescription and constant progress in
   running-footwear technology, the injury rate remains high. Therefore,
   our aim in this narrative literature review is to clarify whether the
   prescription of appropriate footwear to prevent injury in running is
   evidence based, the result of logical fallacy, or just a myth. The
   literature presented in this review is based on a nonsystematic search
   of the MEDLINE database and focuses on work investigating the effect of
   shoe features on injury risk in runners. In addition, key elements for a
   proper understanding of the literature on running footwear and injury
   risk are addressed. In this literature review, we outline (1) the main
   risk factors and the mechanisms underlying the occurrence of
   running-related injury, (2) important methodologic considerations for
   generating high-level evidence, (3) the evidence regarding the influence
   of running-shoe features on injury risk, (4) future directions for
   research, and (5) final general recommendations.}},

Abstract = {{Zero valent Fe/Cu functionalized spent tea adsorbent was prepared for

   batch study experiments. The effect of initial pH, adsorbent dosage,
   contact time and adsorbate concentration was investigated. The obtained
   data well followed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model and
   pseudo-second order rate model with maximum adsorption capacity of
   89.686 mg center dot g(-1). Based on Langmuir separation factor (R),
   having a value of 0.706-0.194, the adsorption process was confirmed to
   be favorable. The adsorbent was used in the form of a column for the
   sorption of Cd(II) from a running solution with satisfactory results.
   The spent material was regenerated and reutilized with reduction of
   adsorption capacity by 1.48\% only. Overall, the current adsorbent can
   be efficiently utilized for the removal of aqueous Cd(II).}},

Abstract = {{1. Spiders are able to arouse strong emotional reactions in humans.
   While spider bites are statistically rare events, our perception is
   skewed towards the potential harm spiders can cause to humans.
   Nevertheless, there is still limited understanding of the role of the
   media in spreading (mis)information about them thereby promoting this
   distorted perception of risk.
   2. We examined the human dimension of spiders through the lens of
   traditional media, by analysing spider-related news published online in
   Italian newspapers between 2010 and 2020 (n = 314). We assessed the
   accuracy, circulation and sensationalistic content of each article, and
   assessed how each of these features drove news' share on social media.
   3. We observed a recent, exponential increase in the frequency of the
   news, particularly those focused on medically important spiders-the
   Mediterranean black widow Latrodectus tredecimguttatus and the
   Mediterranean recluse Loxosceles rufescens. The news quality was
   generally poor: 70\% contained different types of error, 32\% were
   sensationalistic, and in virtually none was an expert consulted.
   4. The risk scenario depicted by the media reports was unnecessarily
   alarmist, especially with regard to L. rufescens. A conservative
   estimate would suggest that less than 10\% of the bites reported in the
   media reports analysed here were delivered by the species described in
   the report. Moreover, two out of three casualties associated with a bite
   of the Mediterranean recluse were fake news, while the third was
   unverifiable.
   5. Overstated news referring to spider bites was shared significantly
   more on social media, thus contributing to frame a distorted perception
   of the risk. This is important given that these negative sentiments may
   ultimately lead to lowering public tolerance towards spiders and
   reducing conservation efforts towards them. We discuss open questions
   and avenues for future research concerning the media coverage of widely
   feared animals, that will help bridge knowledge gaps regarding the role
   of traditional and social media in framing our perception of the natural
   world.}},

   lithium-ion batteries}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{256}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Tin dioxide (SnO2) is a promising anode material candidate for
   lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), yet its practical application is hindered
   by severe volume expansion and inferior conductivity. Here, we proposed
   a facile way for preparing self-assemble SnO2 porous nanotubes by
   electrospinning and subsequent thermal treatments. The nanosized SnO2
   particles anchored on the wall of tube provide abundant reaction sites
   for the electrochemical reaction, and plenty of internal space of hollow
   structure effectively accommodates the volume expansion. Besides, the
   tubular structure is intact after 100 cycles at the current density of
   200 mA g(-1), implying the robust structure can accommodate the volume
   expansion well. Due to the above advantages, SnO2 porous nanotubes as
   the anode of LIBs display excellent reversible capacity, superior rate
   performance and good cycling stability. This self-assemble porous
   tubular structure provides an efficient route to restrain the volume
   expansion of anode materials in electrochemical reactions for advanced
   LIBs.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To study the effect of check width size of the stimuli on the
   amplitude and latency of the P100 component of visual evoked potentials
   recorded in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Methods: Pattern
   reversal visual evoked potentials (PVEPs) were recorded in 16 RP
   patients and 20 visually normal subjects. Pattern reversal stimuli with
   five different check widths and 100\% of contrast were projected in the
   right eye of both patients and control subjects. PVEPs induced by
   stimuli with 78\%, 16\%, and 6\% of contrast were also recorded in 10 of
   the control subjects. Results: In RP patients, the amplitude of P100 was
   smaller than controls in all check sized used and the peak P100
   amplitude was obtained with a larger check width than in controls. P100
   was also delayed in RP patients in all check sizes studied. The P100
   amplitude- and latency-check size functions of RP patients were like
   those found in control subjects with low contrast stimuli of 16\% and
   6\%. Conclusion: The PVEPs spatial functions of RP patients show
   quantitative and qualitative changes, suggesting disease induced
   alteration in the neural processing of stimulus contrast.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: During dental implants placement and bone augmentation
   procedures, it is important to determine the presence and location of
   mandibular canal anatomical variation in order to avoid injuries to
   inferior alveolar bundle. This study aimed to describe the prevalence
   and configuration of mandibular canal branching in the posterior region
   of the mandible using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT).
   METHODS: The interpretation of the images was conducted according to the
   presence, classification and location of the mandibular canal.
   Horizontal and vertical distances from mandibular canal in the ramus
   region to the molar region was recorded. CBCT images of 751 patients,
   486 women (64.7\%) and 265 men (35.3\%), with a mean age of 54.57 (+/-
   13.23; 14-93) years, were interpreted by one calibrated examiner.
   RESULTS: Out of 1502 hemi-mandibles images, mandibular canal variations
   were observed in 130 (8.6\%). Sixty-four (49.2\%) mandibular canal
   variations were identified on the right side and 66 (50.8\%) on the left
   side. The mean distances between superior cortical of the mandibular
   canal and the base of mandible, buccal cortical of mandibular canal and
   buccal cortical bone, and superior cortical of mandibular canal and
   alveolar ridge were 12.16 mm (+/- 2.68), 4.17 mm (+/- 1.30), and 12.97mm
   (+/- 4.01), respectively. Type I mandibular canal variation was the most
   frequent (68; 52.2\%), followed by type III (34; 26.1\%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of mandibular canal variations was 8.6\%, type I
   was the most common and its direction showed proximity with lingual
   surface in the second molar region.}},

Title = {{Effect of integrating the hysteresis component to the equivalent circuit
   model of Lithium-ion battery for dynamic and non-dynamic applications}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{32}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The demand for lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries is on the rise because of
   the increase in usage of electric vehicles (EVs) and other electrified
   applications. The battery management system (BMS) plays an important
   role in ensuring the safe and reliable operation of the battery. In
   order for the BMS to function and manage the battery pack effectively, a
   battery model is needed to monitor and predict the behavior of the
   battery. The equivalent circuit model (ECM) is widely used in online
   battery applications such as EVs, due to its simplicity and accuracy.
   There has been evidence suggesting that the addition of the hysteresis
   effect to the ECM would improve its accuracy. This paper presents an
   investigation into the effect of integrating hysteresis into the ECM,
   for both non dynamic and dynamic applications. Two models are
   introduced, the first-order ECM and the first-order ECM with hysteresis
   (ECMwH). The model parameters are estimated using the
   Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and training datasets. The models are then
   compared in terms of accuracy and computing time, using two driving
   cycles and a characterization cycle. The results show that the addition
   of the hysteresis effect to the first-order ECM improves the accuracy of
   the model in non-dynamic applications more significantly than in dynamic
   applications. The computing time increases, as expected, for the ECMwH,
   suggesting that it might not be beneficial to integrate hysteresis to
   battery models for online applications such as EVs.}},

Abstract = {{Full thickness chondral defects can be debilitating for athletes. Due to
   the low potential for intrinsic healing of articular cartilage, surgical
   intervention is often considered when patients continue to experience

   a 2-stage procedure used to treat chondral lesions with minimal
   subchondral bone involvement. MACI has significant advantages over
   previous generations of autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI),
   including a simplified surgical technique and accelerated postoperative
   rehabilitation protocol. MACI has been shown to result in good clinical
   outcomes, with several studies showing high success rates. Additionally,
   MACI has a low rate of complications specific to the procedure. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{The primary treatment for malignant brain tumors is surgical resection.
   While gross total resection improves the prognosis, a supratotal
   resection may result in neurological deficits. On the other hand,
   accurate intraoperative identification of the tumor boundaries may be
   very difficult, resulting in subtotal resections. Histological
   examination of biopsies can be used repeatedly to help achieve gross
   total resection but this is not practically feasible due to the
   turn-around time of the tissue analysis. Therefore, intraoperative
   techniques to recognize tissue types are investigated to expedite the
   clinical workflow for tumor resection and improve outcome by aiding in
   the identification and removal of the malignant lesion. Hyperspectral
   imaging (HSI) is an optical imaging technique with the power of
   extracting additional information from the imaged tissue. Because HSI
   images cannot be visually assessed by human observers, we instead
   exploit artificial intelligence techniques and leverage a Convolutional
   Neural Network (CNN) to investigate the potential of HSI in twelve in
   vivo specimens. The proposed framework consists of a 3D-2D hybrid
   CNN-based approach to create a joint extraction of spectral and spatial
   information from hyperspectral images. A comparison study was conducted
   exploiting a 2D CNN, a 1D DNN and two conventional classification
   methods (SVM, and the SVM classifier combined with the 3D-2D hybrid CNN)
   to validate the proposed network. An overall accuracy of 80\% was found
   when tumor, healthy tissue and blood vessels were classified, clearly
   outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches. These results can serve
   as a basis for brain tumor classification using HSI, and may open future
   avenues for image-guided neurosurgical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Synthesis cartography is an interesting methodology for understanding
   the landscape and for territorial management purposes. Through this
   methodology, it is possible to integrate aspects of the physical and
   anthropic nature of the landscape for a broader understanding of space.
   Based on this premise, this research focused on the elaboration of a
   synthesis map of the municipality of Espirito Santo do Pinhal, delimited
   by Landscape Units, based on the elaboration of six intermediate maps:
   Geoecological Landscape Map (with synthesized information about each
   Landscape Unit); Landscape Vulnerability Map (with information on
   environmental weaknesses and socioeconomic vulnerabilities); Landscape
   Potential Map (with information on the geobiophysical potential of the
   landscape, on the agricultural areas of the municipality, and the
   potential for socio-economic development); Landscape Use Efficiency Map
   (with information on the adequacy of the potential use and the current
   use); Map of the Geoecological State of the Landscape (with information
   on the tendency to degradation of the landscape, considering efficiency
   and vulnerability) and Map of the Degree of Sustainability of the
   Landscape (considering the potential of socio-economic development and
   the vulnerability of the landscape). The results show that the
   association of all this information through a Synthesis Map can assist
   decision making mainly in the sense of understanding the dynamics of
   local development potentials, considering the physical aspects, and
   considering the needs of society.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of Mechanical Properties of Concrete Reinforced with
   Eucalyptus globulus Bark Fibres}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Concrete is a material with high compressive strength, but predisposed
   to shrinkage cracking, rapid cracks propagation, and brittle failures.
   The incorporation of fibre is an acceptable solution to reduce these
   limitations. However, high cost and energy consumption related to
   man-made fibres have placed natural fibres as an attractive sustainable
   alternative, especially considering that different natural fibres are
   industrial waste (as the Eucalyptus globulus bark fibre). Still, natural
   fibres can produce an important reduction of concrete strength. Hence,
   the objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of Eucalyptus
   globulus bark fibre in traditional concrete mechanical properties as
   compressive and flexural strength. For this, an experimental program was
   developed in such a way that reduces the results uncertainties and
   increases the power of decision regarding the percentage and fibre
   conditions of the samples. The results indicate that, unlike other
   natural fibres, the traditional mechanical properties have a slight
   reduction and acceptable workability. This fact is more evident in the
   samples with 0.50\% fibre with respect to the weight of cement.
   Therefore, reinforcing mortars and concrete with Eucalyptus globulus
   bark fibres emerges as an eco-friendly building alternative to reuse
   this industrial waste.}},

   PPP Projects: The Case of Chile}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Recently, the Chilean government created the Chilean Infrastructure Fund
   (CIF) that will allow taking advantage of the value of existing
   infrastructure assets. The fund will enable the government to finance
   new infrastructure projects with the resources obtained from new
   concessionaires' payments to the government for the value of retendering
   existing public-private partnership (PPP) projects. The purpose of this
   paper is to evaluate the contribution that this new public institution
   will bring to the financial sustainability of infrastructure in Chile,
   the opportunities and challenges for its implementation, and its
   economic value. The research has a qualitative and quantitative
   approach. Based on the understanding of the new concept of asset
   recycling, the application of economic foundations, and financial
   methodologies such as discounted cash flows and real options, the
   research assessed the institutional and economic value of the new
   Chilean Infrastructure Fund. The main findings are that the new Chilean
   Infrastructure Fund will create public value and public wealth since it
   will foster good governance, streamline the concession system,
   accelerate the implementation of sustainable PPP projects, and improve
   planning schemes among others. Other countries could follow this
   experience, promoting infrastructure funds to improve governance and
   accelerate the implementation of sustainable PPP projects.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to develop a (N - k) threshold quantum
   secret sharing (QSS) scheme by using entangled multi-qudit states shared
   between N qudits such that (k <= N - k). We introduce first multi-qudit
   separable states of a Hilbert space associated with a disconnected
   multi-qudit system. The entangled multi-qudit states are obtained from
   disconnected states by means of a unitary interaction operator governing
   the evolution of the multi-qudit system, where the pairwise interaction
   establishes links between qudits. The generated entangled states are
   chosen to be maximally entangled with respect to a specific bi-partition
   (A2 \& Union;A1 with k = |A(2)|<=|A(1)| = (N - k) of the whole system
   such that the von Neumann entropy S(rho A2) is maximal. The maximally
   entanglement property with respect to the splitting (A2 \& Union;A1of
   this N-qudit entangled states will be used by a dealer (D) to share an

Journal = {{CHINESE JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{387-405}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, free, forced and Marangoni convective flows within an
   open enclosure partially filled with a porous medium under impacts of an
   inclined magnetic field are investigated. The forced convection is due
   to the movement of the side walls, the free convection induces from the
   heated part in the bottom wall and the Marangoni convection is a
   responsible on the thermal interaction at the free surface (top wall).
   The flow domain is partially heated from below and partially filled by a
   porous medium. The local thermal non-equilibrium model (LTNEM) is used
   to represent the thermal field in the porous layer (bottom layer) while
   the two-phase model is used to simulated the micropolar nanofluid
   behavior. Two cases based on the direction of the movement of the side
   walls are considered, namely, assisting flow (downward lid motion) and
   opposing flow (upward lid motion). Numerical analysis based on the
   finite volume method is conducted and the obtained are presented in
   terms of the streamlines, isotherms, angular velocity, and the
   cup-mixing temperature theta(cup), the bulk-averaged temperature
   theta(ave) and the average Nusselt numbers. The controlling parameters,
   in this situation, are the Darcy number Da, the Marangoni number Ma, the
   Nield number H, the vortex viscosity Delta, the Biot number Bi and the
   Hartmann number Ha. The results revealed that the increase in the Nield
   number enhances the cup-mixing temperature theta(cup) and bulk-averaged
   temperature theta(ave) regardless the direction of the side walls
   motion. Also, the average Nusselt number is boosted as the Marangoni
   number is grown.}},

Title = {{Dissociable contributions of mediodorsal and anterior thalamic nuclei in
   visual attentional performance: A comparison using nicotinic and
   muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonists}},

Abstract = {{Background:
   Thalamic subregions mediate various cognitive functions, including
   attention, inhibitory response control and decision making. Such
   neuronal activity is modulated by cholinergic thalamic afferents and
   deterioration of such modulatory signaling has been theorised to
   contribute to cognitive decline in neurodegenerative disorders. However,
   the thalamic subnuclei and cholinergic receptors involved in cognitive
   functioning remain largely unknown.
   Aims:
   We investigated whether muscarinic or nicotinic receptors in the
   mediodorsal thalamus and anterior thalamus contribute to rats'
   performance in the five-choice serial reaction time task, which measures
   sustained visual attention and impulsive action.
   Methods:
   Male Long-Evans rats were trained in the five-choice serial reaction
   time task then surgically implanted with guide cannulae targeting either
   the mediodorsal thalamus or anterior thalamus. Reversible inactivation
   of either the mediodorsal thalamus or anterior thalamus were achieved
   with infusions of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic agonists muscimol
   and baclofen prior to behavioural assessment. To investigate cholinergic
   mechanisms, we also assessed the behavioural effects of locally
   administered nicotinic (mecamylamine) and muscarinic (scopolamine)
   receptor antagonists.
   Results:
   Reversible inactivation of the mediodorsal thalamus severely impaired
   discriminative accuracy and response speed and increased omissions.
   Inactivation of the anterior thalamus produced less profound effects,
   with impaired accuracy at the highest dose. In contrast, blocking
   cholinergic transmission in these regions did not significantly affect
   five-choice serial reaction time task performance.
   Conclusions/interpretations:
   These findings show the mediodorsal thalamus plays a key role in
   visuospatial attentional performance that is independent of local
   cholinergic neurotransmission.}},

Abstract = {{Several sector-specific studies on EU data protection and cybersecurity

   the existence of a core of common principles and procedural approaches
   referring to specific cybersecurity and data security technologies.
   Analysis reveals a coordinated regulatory model based on five pillars:
   risk-based approach, by-design approach, reporting obligations,

   The increase of resistance and reduced susceptibility to common

   against the antimicrobial peptides canine cathelicidin (K9CATH) of 21

   for both cathelicidins was obtained against B. abortus, while none of
   the cathelicidins up to 128 mu g/ml inhibited B. melitensis growth.
   Further studies including more clinical isolates of brucella and the use
   of combinations of these peptides with the conventionally prescribed
   anti brucellosis drugs could be useful in ascertaining whether these

Title = {{Ethnobotanical study of plants used by the traditional healers to treat
   malaria in Mogovolas district, northern Mozambique}},
Journal = {{HELIYON}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Malaria is an important parasitic disease that affects
   mostly the African continent. Traditional medicine is very important in
   Mozambique and traditional healers play a key role in the primary health
   care services, particularly in rural areas. We aim to report the results
   of an ethnobotanical survey undertaken in Mogovolas district, northern
   region of Mozambique. We recorded and identified the medicinal plants
   used by traditional healers for treatment of malaria, as well as the
   mode of preparation and administration.
   Methods: The study was conducted in 14 villages from Mogovolas between
   June and August 2015. Sixteen traditional healers were interviewed using
   semi-structured questionnaires. Under their guidance, we collected
   medicinal plants and prepared herbarium specimens that were sent and
   kept at Eduardo Mondlane University Herbarium for scientific
   identification. We searched for information on the in vitro and in vivo
   studies of the cited plants for antiplasmodial activity.
   Results: Traditional healers from Mogovolas district reported the use of
   37 plants to treat malaria, belonging to 22 families. The most used
   species are Ochna kirkii Oliv. (5 citations), Ehretia amoena Klotzsch
   and Pteleopsis myrtifolia (M.A.Lawson) Engl. \& Diels (both with 3
   citations). These plants belong to Ochnaceae, Boraginaceae and
   Combretaceae families, respectively. The herbal remedies are prepared
   using leaves (22/37), roots (18/37), stem barks (16/37) and stems
   (3/37). The administration of the herbal remedies was made essentially
   by oral route and bathing.
   Conclusion: The ethnobotanical data resulted from this study can be the
   starting point for further chemical and pharmacological studies aiming
   to identify medicinal species with antimalarial activity, thus, open the
   insights for the discovery of new antimalarial substances, as well as
   better integration of the traditional medicine into the national health
   systems, particularly in developing countries, as the health system
   coverage is limited.}},

Abstract = {{Background: This study aimed to investigate the effect of
   electroacupuncture (EA) on behavior in a rat model of chronic
   unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and to explore the underlying molecular
   mechanisms.
   Methods: A total of 45 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly
   divided into three groups: the control, CUMS, and CUMS plus EA groups.
   Rats in the CUMS and EA groups were subjected to a 3-week CUMS
   condition, while rats in the EA group received EA at the Baihui (GV 20)
   acupoint (2 Hz, 0.6 mA) for 10 min once daily before being subjected to
   the CUMS condition. The sucrose preference test (SPT) was used as a
   measure to infer activation of the pleasure response to depression-like
   behaviour. After the behavioral test, 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was
   intraperitoneally injected (100 mg/kg) and brain samples were collected
   24 h later for the detection of hippocampal BrdU. Cell proliferation was
   determined according to the proportion of BrdU-positive cells.
   Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression was detected.
   Results: The severity of anhedonia, BDNF+ cells, and BrdU(+) neurons in
   DG significantly decreased in CUMS rats, and was accompanied by a
   reduced BDNF and BrdU(+) expression (P<0.05). After EA, the low levels
   of BDNF+ cells and BrdU(+) expression and the depression-like behavior
   increased markedly (P<0.05).
   Conclusions: EA contributes to neuroprotection against CUMS by enhancing
   BDNF expression and improving hippocampal neurogenesis.}},

   commonality in the form of semiparametric likelihoods. The general
   formula developed allows one to derive information operators with simple

   (IEM) for over 20 years. Although China features 56 different ethnic
   groups, there are no specific data describing the incidence of such
   genetic errors across difference ethnicities. To understand the ethnic
   preference distribution of the incidence and variants of IEM in the
   Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region of China, 189,354 newborns from 2016 to
   2019 were screened by tandem mass spectrometry, including 87,482 from
   the Han ethnic population, 88,229 from the Hui population, 1,103 from
   other ethnicities, and 12,540 infants without ethnic registration.
   Suspected cases then underwent specific genetic profiling by targeted
   next generation sequencing. In total, 160 patients were diagnosed with
   17 types of IEM, with a significant higher incidence in Hui infants
   (1/1,003) than in Han infants (1/1,232). Five diseases (eight patients)
   were specifically detected in Han infants, while three were exclusively
   diagnosed in six Hui infants. For shared diseases, the variants of keys
   genes also showed ethnic preference. Our findings enhance our
   understanding of the genetics underlying IEM, thus promoting the
   development of treatment plans for patients from different areas or
   ethnicities in China.}},

   three-dimensional fiber laser marking machine were studied. The surface
   morphology and friction and wear status of the hydrodynamic journal
   bearing after friction and wear test were analyzed by scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). Results show
   that laser processing can cause surface hardening and the contents of C
   and O elements increase by 31. 1\% and 7. 9\% respectively. The wearing
   capacity and friction coefficient under different textured parameters
   (textured area ratios S-p and texture aspect ratios beta) and working
   conditions (rotational speeds and loads) show a trend of decreasing
   first and then increasing. And surface texture can improve antifriction
   of hydrodynamic journal bearing by more than 23\%. Furthermore, it is
   found that friction and wear mechanism of hydrodynamic journal bearing
   is abrasive wear and adhesive wear, while the mechanism of surface
   texture anti-friction is to improve wear resistance, store abrasive
   particles and forme secondary hydrodynamic lubrication.}},

Abstract = {{Companies are gradually becoming conscious about the necessity of
   reducing their environmental impact and adopting low-carbon strategies
   in order to cope with increasing institutional and social demands.
   However, remaining competitive while reducing the environmental impact
   and improving the corporate image requires adopting sophisticated
   mechanisms boosting eco-efficiency and keeping costs tight. Material
   Flows Cost Accounting (MFCA) is an instrument that allows the monitoring
   of, measurement of, and accounting for physical and monetary processes
   along the production process. If extended to the supply chain, and
   applied to the energy usage and CO2 emissions, it allows one to account
   for the Carbon Footprint (CF) of a company and its products at any given
   stage of the value chain. The current paper presents a case study
   developed under the framework of a three-year project to introduce an
   energy use and carbon emissions monitoring and accounting system in a
   large winery company in Spain, based on the MFCA approach and CF
   accountability. Including the supply chain of the company and the whole
   farming cycle of its main input, the case study presents the method and
   phases adopted to implement the project, its direct and indirect results

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{277}},
Pages = {{410-416}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Currently, there is a growing emphasis on the study of
   intestinal signaling as an influencer in the pathophysiology of
   neuropsychiatric diseases, and the gut-brain axis is recognized as a
   communication route through endocrine, immune, and neural pathways
   (vagus nerve). Studies have shown that diets that modify the microbiota
   can reduce stress-related behavior and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
   axis activation. Investigators have used fecal microbiota
   transplantation (FMT) approaches to demonstrate that stress-related
   microbiota composition plays a causal role in behavioral changes. Aim:
   We hypothesized that FMT may present immunomodulatory, biochemical,
   endocrine, cognitive, and behavioral benefits in stress situations and
   that these changes can be mediated via the vagus nerve.
   Methods: Animals were subjected to a chronic mild stress (CMS) protocol.
   In one experiment, animals were divided into five groups: control,
   control + FMT, control + FMT + CMS, CMS + saline, and CMS + FMT. The
   animals received FMT, and behavioral tests were performed; cytokine and
   carbonyl levels were measured. In a second experiment, animals were
   submitted to vagotomy and divided into two groups: CMS + FMT and CMS +
   vagotomy + FMT.
   Results: Animals submitted to the CMS protocol or that received FMT from
   stressed animals showed behavioral changes and changes in neuroactive
   substances (increased IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels and carbonyl proteins).
   The FMT of healthy donors improved the analyzed parameters. In addition,
   vagotomy influenced beneficial FMT results, confirmed by behavioral
   testing and protein carbonyl in the hippocampus.
   Conclusion: Manipulation of the microbiota reversed the behavioral and
   biochemical changes induced by the CMS protocol, and the vagus nerve
   influenced the gut-brain axis response.}},

Abstract = {{Among vertebrates, placental mammals are particularly variable in the
   covariance between cranial shape and body size (allometry), with rodents
   being a major exception. Australian murid rodents allow an assessment of
   the cause of this anomaly because they radiated on an ecologically
   diverse continent notably lacking other terrestrial placentals. Here, we
   use 3D geometric morphometrics to quantify species-level and
   evolutionary allometries in 38 species (317 crania) from all Australian
   murid genera. We ask whether ecological opportunity resulted in greater
   allometric diversity compared with other rodents or whether conserved
   allometry suggests intrinsic constraints and/or stabilizing selection.
   We also assess whether cranial shape variation follows the proposed rule
   of craniofacial evolutionary allometry (CREA), whereby larger species
   have relatively longer snouts and smaller braincases. To ensure we could
   differentiate parallel versus nonparallel species-level allometric
   slopes, we compared the slopes of rarefied samples across all clades. We
   found exceedingly conserved allometry and CREA-like patterns across the
   10-million-year split betweenMusand Australian murids. This could
   support both intrinsic-constraint and stabilizing-selection hypotheses
   for conserved allometry. Large-bodied frugivores evolved faster than
   other species along the allometric trajectory, which could suggest
   stabilizing selection on the shape of the masticatory apparatus as body
   size changes.}},

Title = {{Biodegradation of sustainable nonwovens used in water absorbing

Journal = {{SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Due to the growing awareness and the need to reduce the environmental
   impact of textiles, there is a pressing rationale to use natural
   materials or fibres in environmental engineering. One solution to
   achieve energy sustainability is to develop sustainable technologies to
   gradually replace non-renewable fossil fuels. One of technology is
   water-absorbing geocomposite (WAG). WAG is an innovative technology that
   supports water management and the vegetation of plants and is used,
   among others, in environmental engineering and agriculture. WAG can be
   produced in biodegradable WAG version, which is also environmentally
   friendly. The paper provides an evaluation of the influence of time of
   installation and biodegradation on the mechanical, hydraulic, and
   chemical properties of used textiles. The biodegradation of geotextiles
   was analyzed in real time, and their parameters were determined after
   one vegetation season. Needle-punched nonwovens made from wool and linen
   or reinforced by jute mesh were biodegraded already after the first
   vegetation season. Significantly better mechanical properties were
   observed in nonwovens produced from the same materials, but reinforced
   by seams. All types of geotextiles were characterised by sufficient
   resistance to biodegradation that allowed maintaining vegetation and
   proper operation of WAG at least for one vegetation season.
   Biodegradable geotextiles installed in soil provide instantaneous
   protection, and their gradual discomposure fosters plant vegetation. (C)

Abstract = {{Background: At the beginning of 2020, a pandemic caused by a new strain
   of coronavirus occurred. On March 9th, the Italian population was forced
   to lockdown to prevent the spread of this new virus. This event forced
   families and cohabitants to spend their entire days and weeks in the
   same physical space, interacting with partners and children with a very
   different degree of intimacy than in the earlier situation. The present
   study investigated the effects of being forced to live together on
   different family patterns, on various dimensions such as stress, coping
   strategies, time perception and quality evaluation of cohabitation.
   Method: A total sample consisting of 1750 individuals was recruited
   through a random sample of probability across the Italian country. Due
   to the lockdown condition, an online questionnaire was set up; several
   validated scales were chosen, and some open-ended items were included
   for the thoughts of the participants. Results: The results showed
   statistically significant differences between the three family patterns
   examined. Conclusion: During the forced period of living together, a
   positive effect could be inferred as given by the presence of children
   and the collaborative coping strategies that have been adopted; the
   results have been discussed according to the literature on the topic.}},

Title = {{Antimicrobial activity of fusidic acid inclusion complexes}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{65-73}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: To synthesize and characterize the inclusion complexes of
   fusidic acid with beta - cyclodextrin, followed by the evaluation of
   their antimicrobial activity against pure strain (Staphylococcus aureus
   ATCC 25,923) and isolated Staphylococcus from clinical cases.
   Methods: The desired compounds were synthesized using molar ratio of
   fusidic acid: beta-cyclodextrin of 1:1. Synthesized compounds were
   analyzed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-Ray
   Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Thermal
   Analysis, and the results confirmed the formation of inclusion compounds
   by fusidic acid with beta-cyclodextrin.
   Results: Physical-chemical characterization confirmed the preparation of
   desired inclusion compounds, and the antimicrobial test confirmed that
   all compounds obtained have antimicrobial activity. Antimicrobial
   activity of freeze-drying complex againstS. aureus is similar with pure
   fusidic acid activity, being better than the cefoxitin one. Similar
   behavior was observed against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and S.
   epidermidis.
   Conclusions: In the present work, three different inclusion complexes of
   fusidic acid were prepared using three different preparation methods.
   All inclusion complexes obtained presented good antimicrobial activity
   against differentS. aureus strains. Antimicrobial activity of these new
   prepared compounds was observed to be better than that of cefoxitin. (C)

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: The present research is aimed to study the
   eco-friendly nature and therapeutic application of the natural dye from
   the seed extract of Bixa orellana for maximizing the benefits of cotton
   fabric. Materials and methods: A natural dye was extracted from Bixa
   orellana seeds by hot water and ethanolic extraction method. This dye
   was examined for its ability with pre-mordanting and post-mordanting of
   cotton fabrics with ferrous sulphate, hydrated double sulphate and
   tamarind seed powder in order to improve the aesthetics and natural
   color shades on cotton fabrics. Furthermore, the dyed cotton fabric was
   used to analyze the antibacterial efficacy of cotton fabric against
   bacterial culture such as Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Proteus
   mirabilis, Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Results: Our
   results suggest that pre-mordanting of cotton fabric with ferrous
   sulphate, alum and tamarind seed shows good dye fixation rate and
   stronger color than post-mordanting. Dyeing of cotton fabric with the
   ethanol extract of Bixa orellana seeds gave excellent and beautiful
   shades than the ones extracted with hot water. Furthermore, cotton
   fabric dyed with ethanol extracted was found significantly active
   against human pathogens compared to cloth dyed with hot water extract.
   The results evidenced that cotton knitted fabrics showed an increase in
   dye uptake with natural mordant and strength with a considerable
   reduction in antimicrobial activity. Conclusion: This research
   adumbrated developing a greener technology to cabalistic use of Bixa
   orellana seed extract applied on cotton cloths for coloring and in
   future find commercial use as a functional finishing agent (for
   newborns, clothing for burns, injured soldiers and hospitals) for health
   protection with semi-durable therapeutic properties.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have demonstrated
   significant overall survival (OS) benefit in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).
   Nevertheless, a remarkable interpatient heterogeneity characterizes
   immunotherapy efficacy, regardless of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)
   expression and tumor mutational burden (TMB). KEAP1 mutations are
   associated with shorter survival in LUAD patients receiving
   chemotherapy. We hypothesized that the pattern of KEAP1 co-mutations and
   mutual exclusivity may identify LUAD patients unresponsive to
   immunotherapy.
   Patients and methods: KEAP1 mutational co-occurrences and somatic
   interactions were studied in the whole MSKCC LUAD dataset. The impact of
   coexisting alterations on survival outcomes in ICI-treated LUAD patients
   was verified in the randomized phase II/III POPLAR/OAK trials
   (blood-based sequencing, bNGS cohort, N = 253). Three tissue-based
   sequencing studies (Rome, MSKCC and DFCI) were used for independent
   validation (tNGS cohort, N = 289). Immunogenomic features were analyzed
   using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) LUAD study.
   Results: On the basis of KEAP1 mutational co-occurrences, we identified
   four genes potentially associated with reduced efficacy of immunotherapy
   (KEAP1, PBRM1, SMARCA4 and STK11). Independent of the nature of
   co-occurring alterations, tumors with coexisting mutations (CoMut) had
   inferior survival as compared with single mutant (SM) and wild-type (WT)
   tumors (bNGS cohort: CoMut versus SM log-rank P = 0.048, CoMut versus WT
   log-rank P < 0.001; tNGS cohort: CoMut versus SM log-rank P = 0.037,
   CoMut versus WT log-rank P = 0.006). The CoMut subset harbored higher
   TMB than the WT disease and the adverse significance of coexisting
   alterations was maintained in LUAD with high TMB. Significant
   immunogenomic differences were observed between the CoMut and WT groups
   in terms of core immune signatures, T-cell receptor repertoire, T helper
   cell signatures and immunomodulatory genes.
   Conclusions: This study indicates that coexisting alterations in a
   limited set of genes characterize a subset of LUAD unresponsive to
   immunotherapy and with high TMB. An immune-cold microenvironment may
   account for the clinical course of the disease.}},

Abstract = {{The efficiency of devices for biomedical applications, including tissue
   engineering and neuronal stimulation, heavily depends on their
   biocompatibility and performance level. Therefore, it is important to
   find adequate materials that meet the necessary requirements such as (i)
   being intrinsically compatible with biological systems, (ii) providing a
   sufficient electronic conductivity that promotes efficient signal
   transduction, (iii) having ``soft{''} mechanical properties comparable
   to biological structures, and (iv) being degradable in physiological
   solution. We have developed organic conducting biocompatible
   single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) composites based on bovine serum
   albumin, carboxymethylcellulose, and acrylic polymer and investigated
   their properties, which are relevant for biomedical applications. This
   includes zeta-potential measurements, conductivity analyses, and SEM
   micrographs, the latter providing a local analysis of SWCNT distribution
   in the base material. We observed the development of the electrical
   conductivity of the SWCNT composites exposed to 1 mM KCl electrolyte for
   40 days, representing a high stability of the samples. The conductivity
   of samples reaches 1300 S/m for 0.45 wt.\% nanotubes. Moreover, we
   demonstrated the biocompatibility of the composites via cultivating
   fibroblast cell culture. Finally, we showed that composite coating
   results in the longer lifespan of cells on the surface. Overall, the
   SWCNT-based conductive composites might be a promising material for
   extended biomedical applications.}},

Title = {{Does Social Capital Matter for Total Factor Productivity? Exploratory
   Evidence from Poland}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Two issues connected with sustainable development are analysed in this
   article: total factor productivity (TFP), which measures the efficiency
   of transforming physical capital and labour into production, and social
   capital, which is increasingly considered as a factor of TFP. TFP is
   sometimes viewed as a measure of sustainability, and its high value
   indicates an effective way of combining and using limited resources.
   Social capital, in turn, is a determining factor in the social,
   economic, and environmental dimensions of development. The subject of
   this analysis is the impact of social capital on TFP. Social capital
   generates synergistic effects and creates added value using the existing
   resources. Therefore, it is legitimate to regard it as one of the
   determinants of TFP. The role of social capital in sustainable
   development is theoretically grounded and confirmed by numerous
   empirical studies. Nevertheless, due to the deep dependence on the
   context, the mechanisms of the impact of this capital on economic
   effects are still not fully understood. In this paper, social capital is
   analysed in the context of the post-transformation economy. This context
   seems to be interesting for two reasons: the relative weakness of social
   capital in post-communist countries and extensive nature of development
   these countries have experienced in recent decades, which together can
   be a barrier to long-term growth in these economies. The purpose of the
   paper is to identify and assess the impact of social capital in Poland
   on TFP in a regional breakdown (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for
   Statistics II - NUTS II). The research period covers the years 2002-2016
   and employs econometric modelling methods. Social capital turns out to
   be a factor in explaining the level of TFP in Polish regions.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives
   Estimations of tumor volume and boundary in pancreatic ductal
   adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are crucial for surgery planning. The aim of the
   study is to evaluate tomoelastography for detection of PDAC and
   quantification of PDAC volume based on tissue stiffness. Materials and
   Methods
   From March 2018 to December 2019, a total of 102 participants (30
   healthy participants and 72 patients with histologically proven PDAC)
   were prospectively enrolled in a multicenter study. Multifrequency
   magnetic resonance elastography was combined with tomoelastography
   postprocessing to generate maps of shear wave speed (SWS) depicting
   highly resolved anatomical details of tissue stiffness. Subregional
   analysis of pancreatic head, body, and tail and reproducibility tests
   were performed in healthy participants, whereas tumorous (PDAC-T) and
   nontumorous (PDAC-NT) pancreatic tissue analysis was conducted in
   patients. In all patients, tumor volumes measured by computed tomography
   (CT) were compared with SWS-derived volumes. In addition, in 32
   patients, tumor sizes were evaluated by macroscopy after resection.
   Results
   Tumor volumes were quantified in 99\% and 87\% of all cases with
   tomoelastography and CT, respectively. Pancreatic SWS was highly
   reproducible (repeatability coefficient = 0.12) and did not vary
   regionally or with patient age, sex, or body mass index (all P > 0.08).
   Shear wave speed was higher in PDAC-T (2.08 +/- 0.38 m/s) than in
   healthy (1.25 +/- 0.09 m/s; P < 0.001) and PDAC-NT (1.28 +/- 0.14 m/s; P
   < 0.001) participants. A threshold of 1.47 m/s separated PDAC-T from
   healthy volunteers (area under the curve = 1.0, sensitivity = 100\%,
   specificity = 100\%), while 1.49 m/s separated PDAC-T from PDAC-NT with
   high accuracy (area under the curve = 0.99, sensitivity = 90\%,
   specificity = 100\%). Tomoelastography-derived tumor volume correlated
   with CT volume (r = 0.91, P < 0.001) and ex vivo tumor volume (r = 0.66,
   P < 0.001). Conclusions
   Tomoelastography provides a quantitative imaging marker for tissue
   stiffness depicting PDAC boundaries and separates PDAC from unaffected
   pancreatic tissue.}},

   Oxidation: Coupling of Ultraviolet and Ultrasound Radiations}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we study the electrochemical oxidation of methyl red, a
   dye present in textile industrial effluents, which is selected as the
   model for the degradation of Contaminants of Emerging Concern. The
   influence of the initial pollutant concentration (1-5 mg dm(-3)),
   applied current density (2-15 mA cm(-2)), and the coupling of
   ultraviolet or ultrasound radiation have been studied using a titanium
   plate as anode. The results show that electrochemical oxidation is able
   to efficiently remove methyl red, and the process efficiency decreases
   with the initial pollutant concentration. At high applied current
   densities, efficiency drastically decreases due to a less effective mass
   transfer of the pollutant on the anodic surface. On one hand, the
   coupling of ultrasound entails an antagonistic effect on the process
   efficiency, which is probably due to a massive formation of oxidant
   radicals followed by a fast recombination process. On the other hand,
   the coupling of ultraviolet radiation increases the process efficiency.
   Concomitantly to the oxidation processes, titanium electrode produces
   rising TiO2-anatase nanoparticles, boosting the mineralization process.
   This new finding sets up a significant improvement over conventional
   photocatalysis treatments using TiO2-anatase as a catalyst due to
   synergistic effects coming from the coupling of the electrochemical
   oxidation and photocatalysis process with Ti anode.}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Candida albicans is one of the most prevalent fungal pathogens involved
   in hospital acquired infections. It binds to glycans at the surface of
   epithelial cells and initiates infection. This process can be blocked by
   synthetic carbohydrates that mimic the structure of cell surface
   glycans. Herein we report the evaluation of a series of divalent
   glycosides featuring aromatic (benzene, squaramide) and bicyclic
   aliphatic (norbornene) scaffolds, with the latter being the first
   examples of their kind as small molecule anti-adhesion glycoconjugates.
   Galactosides 1 and 6, built on an aromatic core, were most efficient
   inhibitors of adhesion of C. albicans to buccal epithelial cells,
   displacing up to 36\% and 48\%, respectively, of yeast already attached
   to epithelial cells at 138 mu M. Remarkably, cis-endo-norbornene 21
   performed comparably to benzene-core derivatives. Conformational
   analysis reveals a preference for compounds 1 and 21 to adopt folded
   conformations. These results highlight the potential of norbornenes as a
   new class of aliphatic scaffolds for the synthesis of anti-adhesion
   compounds.}},

Title = {{Oral Health Behaviors in Very Young Children in Low-Income Urban Areas
   in Chicago, Illinois, 2018-2019}},
Journal = {{PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE}},

Abstract = {{Introduction
   Because most data on oral health do not include infants and toddlers, we
   aimed to describe the oral health behaviors of low-income children
   younger than 3 years and determine factors associated with child tooth
   brushing.
   Methods
   We obtained data from the Coordinated Oral Health Promotion Chicago
   study, which included 420 families with children aged 6 to 36 months and
   their caregivers in Cook County, Illinois. We assessed child frequency
   of brushing from caregiver reports and objectively determined child
   dental plaque scores. Significant factors associated with tooth brushing
   frequency and dental plaque score were identified using the Least
   Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator variable selection.
   Results
   Mean child age was 21.5 (SD, 6.9) months, and only 45\% of caregivers
   brushed their children's teeth twice per day or more. The mean plaque
   score was 1.9 (SD, 0.6), indicating high levels of plaque. Child
   brushing frequency was higher when children were older; used the correct
   toothpaste amount; brushed for a longer duration; and when caregivers
   brushed their own teeth more frequently, had more help with the overall
   care of the child's teeth, and had family to help. Child brushing
   frequency was lower for caregivers with more interference from
   activities of daily life. Children whose caregivers had more adult help
   with child brushing had better plaque scores; worse plaque scores were
   seen in children with higher sugary beverage and food consumption and
   lower household incomes.
   Conclusion
   The tooth brushing behaviors of young children are strongly associated
   with those of their parents and with the level of family support for
   brushing. Interventions to improve brushing in young children should
   focus on the entire family.}},

Abstract = {{This work deals with the carminic acid stabilization in a silica matrix
   and the study of structural properties. Results indicate that silica
   provides exceptional thermal stability to the carminic dye because its
   functional properties remain without significant changes up to 500
   degrees C. The embedded carminic acid changes the crystallization
   behavior of silica. The carminic acid extracted from Mexican cochineal
   was firstly stabilized with sucrose and after embedded in a silica
   matrix using the sol-gel method. The structural behavior was analyzed in
   function of temperature from RT to 900 degrees C. The resulting
   properties were studied using X-ray diffraction and FT-IR spectroscopy.
   Interaction of carminic acid with silica reduces the formation
   temperature of tridymite and cristobalite. Amorphous tridymite was
   detected at 400 degrees C, semicrystalline tridymite at 700 degrees C,
   alpha-cristobalite at 800 degrees C, and beta-cristobalite at 900
   degrees C. The improved stability of carminic acid results from its
   interaction with the silica, which also modifies the silica
   crystallization kinetics.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The implementation of evidence-based practices to reduce
   opioid overdose deaths within communities remains suboptimal. Community
   engagement can improve the uptake and sustainability of evidence-based
   practices. The HEALing Communities Study (HCS) aims to reduce opioid
   overdose deaths through the Communities That HEAL (CTH) intervention, a
   community-engaged, data-driven planning process that will be implemented
   in 67 communities across four states.
   Methods: An iterative process was used in the development of the
   community engagement component of the CTH. The resulting community
   engagement process uses phased planning steeped in the principles of
   community based participatory research. Phases include: 0) Preparation,
   1) Getting Started, 2) Getting Organized, 3) Community Profiles and Data
   Dashboards, 4) Community Action Planning, 5) Implementation and
   Monitoring, and 6) Sustainability Planning.
   Discussion: The CTH protocol provides a common structure across the four
   states for the community-engaged intervention and allows for tailored
   approaches that meet the unique needs or sociocultural context of each
   community. Challenges inherent to community engagement work emerged
   early in the process are discussed.
   Conclusion: HCS will show how community engagement can support the
   implementation of evidence-based practices for addressing the opioid
   crisis in highly impacted communities. Findings from this study have the
   potential to provide communities across the country with an
   evidence-based approach to address their local opioid crisis; advance
   community engaged research; and contribute to the implementation,
   sustainability, and adoption of evidence-based practices.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, there is a need for reliable tests that allow identification
   of individuals that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 even if the
   infection was asymptomatic. To date, the vast majority of the
   serological tests for SARS-CoV-2-specific Abs are based on serum
   detection of Abs to either the viral spike glycoprotein (the major
   target for neutralizing Abs) or the viral nucleocapsid protein that is
   known to be highly immunogenic in other coronaviruses. Conceivably,
   exposure of Ags released from infected cells could stimulate Ab
   responses that might correlate with tissue damage and, hence, they may
   have some value as a prognostic indicator. We addressed whether other
   nonstructural viral proteins, not incorporated into the infectious viral
   particle, specifically the viral cysteine-like protease, might also be
   potent immunogens. Using ELISA tests, coating several SARS-CoV-2
   proteins produced in vitro, we describe that COVID-19 patients make high
   titer IgG, IgM, and IgA Ab responses to the Cys-like protease from
   SARS-CoV-2, also known as 3CLpro or Mpro, and it can be used to identify
   individuals with positive serology against the coronavirus. Higher Ab
   titers in these assays associated with more-severe disease, and no
   cross-reactive Abs against prior betacoronavirus were found. Remarkably,
   IgG Abs specific for Mpro and other SARS-CoV-2 Ags can also be detected
   in saliva. In conclusion, Mpro is a potent Ag in infected patients that
   can be used in serological tests, and its detection in saliva could be
   the basis for a rapid, noninvasive test for COVID-19 seropositivity.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, and
   ageing is its major risk factor. Changes in telomere length have been
   associated with ageing and some degenerative diseases. Our aim was to
   explore some of the molecular changes caused by the progression of AD in
   a transgenic murine model (3xTg-AD; B6; 129-Psen1 Tg (APPSwe, tauP301L)
   1Lfa). Telomere length was assessed by qPCR in both brain tissue and
   peripheral blood cells and compared between three age groups: 5, 9 and
   13 months. In addition, a possible effect of oxidative stress on
   telomere length and AD progression was explored. Shorter telomeres were
   found in blood cells of older transgenic mice compared to younger and
   wild-type mice but no changes in telomere length in the hippocampus. An
   increase in oxidative stress with age was found for all strains, but no
   correlation was found between oxidative stress and shorter telomere
   length for transgenic mice. Telomere length and oxidative stress are
   affected by AD progression in the 3xTg-AD murine model. Changes in blood
   cells are more noticeable than changes in brain tissue, suggesting that
   systemic changes can be detected early in the disease in this murine
   model.}},

Title = {{Management of construction Safety and Health Plans based on automated
   content analysis}},
Journal = {{AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{120}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Safety management in the construction sector continues to be of great
   concern due to the high accident rate. Enormous legislative efforts have
   been made to minimize this problem. In Europe, the Directive 92/57/EEC,
   which establishes a mandatory safety and health requirements, defines
   the Safety and Health Plan. This paper contains a methodology for
   automatically extracting structured relevant information from this
   textual document. Such plans are crucial to provide safety in this
   sector. However, current documents are often enlarged with nonessential
   information, while the most relevant information is missing or difficult
   to locate. The information extracted by our methodology makes it easier
   for Safety and Health Plans to be validated and approved at an early
   stage, as well as facilitating their later use and updating. The main
   steps of this methodology are: i) the definition of the relevant content
   to be extracted as seven items, in collaboration with experts in the
   area; ii) text preprocessing and enrichment using existing software
   resources for the natural language employed; and iii) automated content
   analysis for extracting information, on the basis of a collection of
   previously established rules for identifying the content defined in the
   first step. The output is a detailed and structured report containing
   the percentage of relevant information identified, as well as the
   desired items of information. To illustrate and validate our
   methodology, we have implemented and applied it to 50 real Safety and
   Health Plans. As a result, our system was able to identify most of the
   required information for five of the seven items in all of these plans.
   In addition, we have been able to detect the problems in the textual
   plan that caused the missing information in the other two items, which
   will be corrected in future developments.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEODYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{141}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The thin-skinned Hronic nappe system represents the structurally highest
   tectonic unit in the Late Cretaceous thrust-stack of the Central Western
   Carpathians. It mostly comprises a Permian volcano-sedimentary sequence
   and Triassic carbonate sediments which crop out in different parts of
   the Central Western Carpathians. We carried out a systematic
   paleomagnetic study on 24 Permian and 20 Triassic localities
   geographically distributed over 300 km in W-E direction. Several samples
   from each locality were drilled and oriented in-situ and specimens cut
   from them subjected to standard paleomagnetic and magnetic mineralogy
   experiments. The results were evaluated using principal component
   analysis, statistical evaluation of the characteristic remanences, and
   applying inclination-only and tilt tests. We documented the pre-tilting
   age of remanences for the majority of both the Permian and Triassic age
   groups. However, the latter was interpreted as remagnetized during the
   Cretaceous Normal Super-Chron in the course of nappe stacking between
   90-80 Ma. The Permian group is exhibiting about 70 degrees, the Triassic
   about 34 degrees clockwise vertical axis rotations with respect to the
   present north. There is no indication in our data set for oroclinal
   bending of the Hronic Unit. We interpret the difference in clockwise
   rotations (about 36 degrees) between Permian and 90-80 Ma as a clockwise
   block rotation taking place during major extensional and/or compressive
   events between stable Europe and Africa. Taking into consideration the
   well documented counterclockwise rotation observed for the overstep
   sequences in the Central Western Carpathians and in the Pieniny Klippen
   Belt, the remagnetization of the Triassic sediments was closely followed
   by about 94 degrees clockwise rotation. Research in progress will serve
   to decide if this large clockwise rotation involved the whole Central
   Carpathian nappe stack or part of this was due to the thin-skinned nappe
   emplacement of the Hronic Unit.

Abstract = {{Currently, opioids targeting mu-opioid receptors are the most potent
   drugs for acute and cancer pain. However, opioids produce adverse side
   effects such as constipation, respiratory depression, or addiction
   potential. We recently developed
   (6)-N-(3-fluoro-1-phenethylpiperidine-4-yl)-N-phenyl propionamide
   (NFEPP), a compound that does not evoke central or intestinal side
   effects due to its selective activation of mu-opioid receptors at low pH
   in peripheral injured tissues. Although we demonstrated that NFEPP
   effectively abolishes injury-induced pain, hyperalgesia, and allodynia
   in rodents, the efficacy of NFEPP in nonevoked ongoing pain remains to
   be established. Here, we examined reward, locomotor activity, and
   defecation in rats with complete Freund's adjuvantinduced paw
   inflammation to compare fentanyl's and NFEPP's potentials to induce side
   effects and to inhibit spontaneous pain. We demonstrate that low, but
   not higher, doses of NFEPP produce conditioned place preference but not
   constipation or motor disturbance, in contrast to fentanyl. Using a
   peripherally restricted antagonist, we provide evidence that
   NFEPP-induced place preference is mediated by peripheral opioid
   receptors. Our results indicate that a low dose of NFEPP produces reward
   by abolishing spontaneous inflammatory pain.}},

Abstract = {{From 9 March to 3 May 2020, lockdown was declared in Italy due to the
   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic.
   Our aim was to evaluate how the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and related
   preventive strategies affected pediatric emergency rooms (ERs) during
   this period. We performed a retrospective cohort multicenter study,
   comparing the lockdown period to the corresponding period in 2019. We
   examined 15 Italian pediatric ERs in terms of visit rates, specific
   diagnoses (grouped as air communicable diseases and non-air communicable
   diseases), and triage categories. During the lockdown period, ER
   admissions decreased by 81\% compared to 2019 (52,364 vs. 10,112). All
   ER specific diagnoses decreased in 2020 and this reduction was
   significantly higher for air communicable diseases (25,462 vs. 2934, p <
   0.001). Considering the triage category, red codes remained similar (1\%
   vs. 1\%), yellow codes increased (11.2\% vs. 22.3\%), and green codes
   decreased (80.3\% vs. 69.5\%). We can speculate that social distancing
   and simple hygiene measures drastically reduced the spread of air
   communicable diseases. The increase in yellow codes may have been
   related to a delay in primary care and, consequently, in ER admissions.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid lithium-tin (Li-Sn) alloys are being considered in alternative
   concepts of plasma facing components for nuclear fusion applications.
   Nevertheless, the high Li content and high melting temperature of
   Li-rich inter-metallics may hinder their use due to a possible excessive
   evaporation of Li to the vessel with evident issues in fuel retention.
   Their formation was inhibited in this study in homogeneous alloys with
   Li contents as higher as 5 at.\% via a mechanical alloying route of pure
   Li and Sn sources. A 50 at.\% Li-Sn master powder was initially prepared
   and diluted afterwards with pure Sn to achieve the final compositions.
   The structure, elemental composition and homogeneity of the alloys were
   assessed by scanning electron microscopy, ion beam analysis and X-ray
   diffraction. 5 at.\% Li and 1 at.\% Li alloys composed by phases with
   low melting temperatures, LiSn, Li2Sn5 and beta-Sn, mainly, were
   produced with reduced oxygen and metallic impurity contents.}},

Abstract = {{The banana aphid, Pentalonia nigronervosa Coquerel (Hemiptera:
   Aphididae), is a major pest of cultivated bananas (Musa spp., order
   Zingiberales), primarily due to its role as a vector of Banana bunchy
   top virus (BBTV), the most severe viral disease of banana worldwide.
   Here, we generated a highly complete genome assembly of P. nigronervosa
   using a single PCR-free Illumina sequencing library. Using the same
   sequence data, we also generated complete genome assemblies of the P.
   nigronervosa symbiotic bacteria Buchnera aphidicola and Wolbachia. To
   improve our initial assembly of P. nigronervosa we developed a k-mer
   based deduplication pipeline to remove genomic scaffolds derived from
   the assembly of haplotigs (allelic variants assembled as separate
   scaffolds). To demonstrate the usefulness of this pipeline, we applied
   it to the recently generated assembly of the aphid Myzus cerasi,
   reducing the duplication of conserved BUSCO genes by 25\%. Phylogenomic
   analysis of P. nigronervosa, our improved M. cerasi assembly, and seven
   previously published aphid genomes, spanning three aphid tribes and two
   subfamilies, reveals that P. nigronervosa falls within the tribe
   Macrosiphini, but is an outgroup to other Macrosiphini sequenced so far.
   As such, the genomic resources reported here will be useful for
   understanding both the evolution of Macrosphini and for the study of P.
   nigronervosa. Furthermore, our approach using low cost, high-quality,
   Illumina short-reads to generate complete genome assemblies of
   understudied aphid species will help to fill in genomic black spots in
   the diverse aphid tree of life.}},

Abstract = {{Designing and validation of universal primer combination for matK gene
   in Cucurbitaceae is described. Using the universal primers already

   markers were gel eluted, Sanger sequenced and the sequences along with
   the matK sequences from other Cucurbitaceae genera available at GenBank,
   were aligned to identify the conserved regions in the locus. Primer
   combination was designed for the conserved regions and this primer set
   was found successful for all the Momordica and Luffa accessions.
   Subsequently, the primer combination was shown successful for other
   genera such as Benincasa, Cucumis, Cucurbita, Citrullus, Coccinia,
   Trichosanthes and Lagenaria, suggesting it as a universal system for
   matK gene in Cucurbitaceae family.}},

Journal = {{FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{161}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A tungsten (W) divertor is exposed to pulsed high heat caused by
   disruptions and Type-I Edge Localized Modes (ELMs). Therefore, it is
   important to investigate surface morphology of W during phase change.
   Heretofore, W melting dynamics under disruption-like heat load has been
   researched and tried to modify the optical system of our apparatus for
   knowing more detailed surface behavior. In this paper, the two
   measurement methods are shown; the in-situ observation of the W surface
   modification by a High Speed Video (HSV) camera and 3 -Dimensional (3D)
   measurement of melting W surface by stereoscopic photography technique
   (SPT). In the former, the detailed process of W melting was clarified by
   observing W surface modification and analyzing luminance at the center
   of laser-irradiated spot. It was confirmed that luminescence at the
   center area of heat load fluctuated violently due to the phase change of
   W. In the latter, 3D images of W surface shape during melting was
   obtained using SPT and the results indicated that the W surface
   fluctuated in melting and gathered to the center gradually in
   solidifying. The calibration accuracy was still scope for improvement
   but the 3D measurement of W surface behavior loaded by high heat flux
   was established successfully.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A diamond anvil cell (DAC) has become an effective tool for
   investigating physical phenomena that occur at extremely high pressure,
   such as high-transition temperature superconductivity. Electrical
   transport measurements, which are used to characterize one of the most
   important properties of superconducting materials, are difficult to
   perform using conventional DACs. The available sample space in
   conventional DACs is very small and there is an added risk of electrode
   deformation under extreme operating conditions. To overcome these
   limitations, we herein report the fabrication of a boron-doped diamond
   microelectrode and undoped diamond insulation on a beveled culet surface
   of a diamond anvil. Using the newly developed DAC, we have performed
   in-situ electrical transport measurements on sulfur hydride H2S, which
   is a well-known precursor of the pressure-induced, high-transition
   temperature superconducting sulfur hydride, H3S. These measurements
   conducted under high pressures up to 192 GPa, indicated the presence of
   a multi-step superconducting transition, which we have attributed to
   elemental sulfur and possibly HS2.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the presence of bank risk taking associated with
   unconventional monetary policy in the United States between 2008 and
   2015 using corporate syndicated loan data at the bank-firm level. We
   measure monetary policy using the identification-through-heteroske
   dasticity approach with a VAR model. To identify the risk-taking channel
   we control for time-varying heterogeneity in credit demand and supply.
   Our results indicate that accommodating monetary conditions are
   associated with overall lower loan spreads. However, the spread
   reduction is lower for riskier firms, suggesting that there is no risk
   taking behavior in the syndicated loan market during the UMP period. (C)

Abstract = {{The effect of temperature distribution on a stress-strain state tube
   made of disperse-hardened aluminum alloy subjected to internal pressure
   was investigated. The mathematical model is based on equations of
   physical plasticity theory and principles of mechanics of deformable
   solids. The results of this investigation demonstrate that varying the
   outer wall temperature in the range of 200 K at a fixed temperature of
   the inner wall leads to a significant change in the plastic resistance
   limit (for the considered tube sizes, this change is approximately
   15\%). An increase of the tube wall temperature reduces the resistance
   to plastic deformation. For the same absolute temperature difference
   between the outer and inner walls, the plastic resistance limit is less
   for the higher temperature of the inner wall of the tube. A decrease of
   the distances between the hardening particles at the same volume
   fraction of second phase leads to a significant increase in the pressure
   required to achieve plastic deformation of the tube walls. An increase
   in tube wall temperature reduces the resistance to plastic deformation.

Title = {{The three arenas of new conflicts over inequality. An analysis of the
   relation between social structural positions and attitudes towards
   redistribution, migration and sexual diversity}},

Volume = {{30}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Many Western societies debate the question of redistribution with
   revived interest. However, the debates on identity politics and
   migration brought further social conflicts to the forefront. Academic as
   well as journalistic contributions often assume a two-camp polarisation
   in which groups with higher social status endorse migration and
   diversity against the opposition of groups with lower social status. In
   this view, the constellation of these new conflicts is at odds with
   classic conflicts over redistribution, in which higher social status
   groups typically show a greater tolerance of inequality compared to
   lower social status groups. The paper develops a conceptual framework
   that goes beyond the dominant two-camp polarisation theory and
   systematically distinguishes three dimensions of inequality conflicts
   and attitudes: firstly, classical up-down inequalities referring to
   economic redistribution, secondly, us-them inequalities relating to
   societal recognition of diversity, and thirdly, in-out inequalities
   concerning openness toward immigrants. Based on the SOEP Innovation
   Sample 2017, it is demonstrated that these attitudes constitute
   relatively independent dimensions. Compared to higher social groups,
   lower social status groups are more critical of economic inequality,
   while the two new conflicts indicate a reverse picture. However, only
   attitudes toward migration are substantially polarized, whereas little
   evidence can be found that points toward the formation of the two
   distinct cleavages that are frequently assumed in public discourse.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{125}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) cameras on orbiting spacecraft at Earth and
   Saturn helped greatly to diagnose these complex magnetospheres. Within
   this decade, the European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer will
   make ENA imaging a major thrust in understanding Jupiter's complex
   magnetosphere. The present polar-orbiting Juno mission at Jupiter
   carries no ENA camera. But, the Jupiter Energetic-particle Detector
   Instrument is sensitive to >50 keV ENAs, provided there are no local
   charged particles to mask their presence. Juno offers great service to
   interpreting past serendipitous and future dedicated ENA imaging with
   its orbit providing unique viewing perspectives. Here we report Juno
   observations of ENAs from Jupiter's polar regions. These ENAs likely
   arise from energetic ions that nearly precipitate in the main auroral
   regions and mirror magnetically within, and charge exchange with,
   Jupiter's upper atmosphere. Jupiter proves itself different from Saturn,
   as ENAs generated from precipitating ions were not identified there.
   Plain Language Summary In the space environments (called magnetospheres)
   of magnetized planets, singly charged energetic particles, trapped by
   the planet's magnetic field, can steal electrons from cold gas atoms and
   become neutralized. These now Energetic Neutral Atoms (ENAs), no longer
   confined by the magnetic field, can travel out of the system similar to
   photons leaving a hot oven. ENA cameras on orbiting spacecraft at Earth
   and Saturn have helped greatly to diagnose these complex magnetospheres.
   The present polar-orbiting Juno mission at Jupiter carries no ENA
   camera. But, the Jupiter Energetic-particle Detector Instrument is
   sensitive to ENAs with energies >50 keV, provided there are no charged
   particles in the environment to mask their presence. Here we report on
   Juno observations of ENAs coming from Jupiter's polar regions. These
   ENAs likely arise from energetic ions that nearly precipitate, reaching
   the atmospheric regions of Jupiter's main aurora and mirroring
   magnetically within Jupiter's upper atmosphere.}},

Journal = {{BIOCHIMIE}},

Volume = {{179}},

Abstract = {{The metA (Rv3341) gene from Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv strain
   encodes a homoserineacetyltransferase (HAT) enzyme, also called MetA.
   This enzyme plays a key role in the biosynthetic pathway of methionine
   and is a potential target for the development of antimicrobial drugs.
   Purified MetA showed 40 kDa molecular mass on SDS-PAGE. Manual docking
   was performed with substrates acetyl-CoA, L-homoserine, and
   p-nitrophenylacetate using crystal structure coordinates of MetA (PDB ID
   6PUX) from M. tuberculosis. Multiple sequence alignment indicated that
   catalytic triad residues Ser157, Asp320, His350 were conserved across
   species in acetyltransferases, esterases, and hydrolases. As a conserved
   pentapeptide, GXSMG belongs to alpha/beta hydrolase superfamily and it
   shares similarity with esterases and hydrolases from different sources.
   Hydrolase activity of MetA was tested using (PNPA), Nacetylglycine,
   N-acetylmethionine and Phe-Gly as substrate. LC-MS confirmed that MetA
   possessed HAT activity, but no homoserine-succinyltransferase (HST) and
   serine-acetyltransferase (SAT) activities. Replacing acetyl-CoA with
   PNPA as acetyl group donor showed a drastic reduction in transferase
   activity, arising due to the interaction of R227 of the enzyme with
   PNPA. This could prevent the binding of the second substrate in the
   right orientation and results in the preferential transfer of the acetyl
   group to water, thus exhibiting hydrolase rather than transferase
   activity. In this paper, we report that MetA has both transferase and
   hydrolase activity depending on the correct orientation of the second
   substrate and the availability of the amino acids involved in
   enzyme-substrate interaction. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. and Societe

Abstract = {{Adiponectin has several beneficial properties, namely, on the level of
   glucose metabolism, but paradoxically, its high concentrations were

   high serum adiponectin on mortality and morbidity in patients with
   stable coronary artery heart disease (CAD). A total of 973 patients
   after myocardial infarction and/or coronary revascularization were
   followed in a prospective cohort study. All-cause and cardiovascular
   (CV) death, non-fatal cardiovascular events, and hospitalizations for
   heart failure (HF) were registered as outcomes. High serum adiponectin
   levels (>= 8.58 ng/ml, i.e., above median) were independently associated
   with increased risk of 5-year all-cause, CV mortality or HF {[}with HRR
   1.57 (95\% CI: 1.07-2.30), 1.74 (95\% CI: 1.08-2.81) or 1.94 (95\% CI:
   1.20-3.12), respectively] when adjusted just for conventional risk
   factors. However, its significance disappeared if brain natriuretic
   peptide (BNP) was included in a regression model. In line with this, we
   observed strong collinearity of adiponectin and BNP. Additionally, major
   adverse cardiovascular event (i.e., CV death, non-fatal myocardial
   infarction or stroke, coronary revascularization) incidence risk was not
   associated with high adiponectin. In conclusion, the observed inverse
   association between adiponectin concentrations and mortality risk seems
   to be attributable to concomitantly increased BNP, rather than high
   adiponectin being a causal factor.}},

Abstract = {{The letters of Rabbi Menahem Mendel of Vitebsk and Rabbi Avraham of
   Kalisk provide a robust portrait of the spiritual orientation of the
   Tiberian Hasidic community, capturing a critical moment-or series of
   moments-in the evolution of Hasidic thought as articulated by former
   disciples of Rabbi Dov Ber Friedman, the Maggid of Mezritsh. The present
   essay argues that these epistles yield valuable insights into the
   complex, often stormy relationship between these two Tiberian masters
   and their younger student and colleague Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liady.
   Furthermore, I suggest that both these Tiberian masters and Rabbi Shneur
   Zalman of Liady sought to enumerate mystical systems that led to an
   immediate and intimate experience of the divine. Although a vast chasm
   separates their methods for attaining this goal as well as the
   distinctive vocabularies they use to describe it, both of these
   fundamentally disparate spiritual paths emerged from the teachings of
   the Maggid.}},

   methanol/methylene chloride (1:1) extract, the ethanolic and ethyl
   acetate fractions and the aqueous residue of E. speciosa. E. speciosa
   (0, 8, 32 or 64 mg/kg) were administered for 15 days to 24
   non-PMSG-primed and 24 primed rats with 0.01 IU of PMSG. At the end of
   the treatment period, animal were sacrificed and their body, ovarian,
   uterine weight, ovarian protein or cholesterol level, as well as data on
   puberty onset were recorded. Of the 16 polyphenolic compounds
   quantitatively revealed in the extracts and fractions of E. speciosa
   after HPLC analysis, quercetin, rutin, apigenin and eugenol were the
   most abundant. Non-primed rats showed a significant increase (P < 0.05)
   in the uterine relative weight at the dose of 8 mg/kg when compared with
   the other treatments. The uterine proteins and the ovarian cholesterol
   (P < 0.05), respectively, showed a reduction at doses of 64 mg/kg and 32
   mg/kg in non-primed rats. However in PMSG-primed rats, a significant
   decrease (P < 0.05) was observed in ovarian cholesterol at 64 mg/kg. In
   conclusion, E. speciosa potentializes the PMSG-inducing effect on
   folliculogenesis in PMSG-primed rats.}},

Abstract = {{Public safety personnel (PSP) experience unique occupational stressors
   and suffer from high rates of mental health problems. The COVID-19
   pandemic has impacted virtually all aspects of human life around the
   world and has introduced additional occupational stressors for PSP. The
   objective of this study was to explore how PSP, especially those seeking
   digital mental health services, have been affected by the pandemic. Our
   research unit, PSPNET, provides internet-delivered cognitive behavioral
   therapy to PSP in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. When the
   pandemic spread to Saskatchewan, PSPNET began inquiring about the impact
   of the pandemic on prospective clients during the eligibility screening
   process. We used content analysis to analyze data from telephone
   screening interviews (n = 56) and descriptive statistics to analyze data
   from a questionnaire concerning the impacts of COVID-19 (n = 41). The
   results showed that most PSP reported facing several novel emotional
   challenges (e.g., social isolation, boredom, anger, and fear) and
   logistical challenges (e.g., related to childcare, finances, work, and
   access to mental healthcare). Most participants indicated they felt at
   least somewhat afraid of contracting COVID-19 but felt more afraid of
   their families contracting the virus than themselves. However, few
   participants reported severe challenges of any kind, and many (40\%)
   indicated that they had not been significantly negatively impacted by
   the pandemic. Overall, the results suggest that PSP are not expressing
   significant concern at this time in meeting the novel challenges posed
   by COVID-19. Continued research will be required to monitor how diverse
   PSP populations and treatment outcomes are affected by the pandemic as
   the situation evolves.}},

Abstract = {{Too few smokers who present for outpatient healthcare receive
   evidence-based interventions to stop smoking. Referral to nationally
   available smoking cessation support may enhance tobacco intervention
   reach during healthcare visits. This study evaluated the feasibility of
   outpatient electronic health record (EHR)-enabled, closed-loop referral
   (eReferral) to SmokefreeTXT, a National Cancer Institute text message
   smoking cessation program. SmokefreeTXT eReferral for adult patients who
   smoke was implemented in a family medicine clinic and an allergy and
   asthma clinic in an integrated Midwestern healthcare system.
   Interoperable, HIPAA-compliant eReferral returned referral outcomes to
   the EHR. In Phase 1 of implementation, clinicians were responsible for
   eReferral; in Phase 2 this responsibility shifted to Medical Assistants
   and/or nurses. EHR data were extracted to compute eReferral rates among
   adult smokers and compare demographics among those eReferred versus not
   referred. SmokefreeTXT data were used to compute SmokefreeTXT enrollment
   rates among those eReferred. Descriptive analyses of clinic staff
   surveys assessed implementation context and staff attitudes toward and
   adaptations of eReferral processes. During clinician implementation, 43
   of 299 adult smokers (14.4\%) were eReferred. During medical assistant
   (MA) implementation, 36 of 401 adult smokers (9.0\%) were eReferred.
   Overall, among those eReferred, 25.7\% completed SmokefreeTXT enrollment
   (3.1\% of patients eligible for eReferral). Staff survey responses
   indicated that eReferral was efficient and easy. eReferral rates and
   relevant attitudes varied meaningfully by clinic. Thus, Interoperable
   eReferral via outpatient EHR to SmokefreeTXT is feasible and acceptable
   to clinic staff and enrolls roughly 3.0\% of smokers. Clinic context and
   Implementation approach may influence reach.}},

Abstract = {{Following our presentation to the NZGS (Rogers and McDougall, 2020), a

   it is flawed (Fityus and Burton, 2020). The present paper is offered by
   way of response.
   Fityus and Burton offer interesting ideas related to the role of
   suction, and the variability of soil. However, our data analysis, since
   published in full (Rogers et al., 2020), still raises important concerns
   which have not been satisfactorily addressed. This is especially so with
   respect to the break-down of contributions from each of the shrink and
   swell strain components which readily show that in all cases (including
   Australian datasets) there is not an inverse relationship between the
   swell strain and the initial moisture content, which would be necessary
   for the shrink-swell test to properly remove the initial moisture
   content bias.}},

Abstract = {{Conscientious objection has achieved a particular place in contemporary
   law and culture. Lawyers, political theorists, ethicists, health
   professionals and others have debated how we best negotiate the tensions
   that can exist between professional obligations and private beliefs.
   Conscientious objection to abortion care has been a particular focus of
   these discussions. In this article, we draw on theoretical work on
   `jurisdiction' to provide an account of what is embedded in claims to
   conscience and what the effects of such claims are. We focus
   specifically on refusals of abortion care enabled by section 4 of the
   Abortion Act 1967. We argue that legitimating narratives on conscience
   seek to achieve seemingly contradictory goals: entrenching abortion as
   morally ambiguous while securing it as part of medicine's monopolistic
   practice. While section 4 provides the focus, our concerns extend to the
   wider landscape and impact of claims to conscience. Through our
   jurisdictional analysis, we seek to better understand such claims and
   dramatically reorient thinking by grounding the conscience clause
   squarely in the politics of `task areas', professional domains, market
   control and claims of epistemological authority.}},

Title = {{Domestic dogs and wild canids on the Northwest Coast of North America:
   Animal husbandry in a region without agriculture?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHAEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{60}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) occur in the archaeological record
   throughout North America but few zooarchaeological studies have examined
   the extent of wild and domestic canids using multi-site observations
   across regions. Here, we present a meta-analysis of 172,310 mammal
   specimens identified from 210 archaeological sites along the Northwest
   Coast focusing on canid abundance, distribution, and osteological
   identifications. We show that canids have a ubiquitous geographic
   distribution and a high relative abundance in particular Northwest Coast
   sub-regions and that species-level identifications are overwhelmingly of
   domestic dogs in contrast to similar to 1\% of non-domestic canids
   (wolf, coyote, and fox). Along with geochemical and genetic data, these
   zooarchaeological observations indicate a variety of roles for dogs
   including hunting, companionship, and wool production in a region
   lacking terrestrial agriculture and domestic livestock. We suggest the

Abstract = {{Blood is a non-Newtonian, shear-thinning fluid owing to the physical
   properties and behaviors of red blood cells (RBCs). Under increased
   shear flow, pre-existing clusters of cells disaggregate, orientate with
   flow, and deform. These essential processes enhance fluidity of blood,
   although accumulating evidence suggests that sublethal blood
   trauma-induced by supraphysiological shear exposure-paradoxically
   increases the deformability of RBCs when examined under low-shear
   conditions, despite obvious decrement of cellular deformation at
   moderate-to-higher shear stresses. Some propose that rather than actual
   enhancement of cell mechanics, these observations are
   ``pseudoimprovements{''} and possibly reflect altered flow and/or cell
   orientation, leading to methodological artifacts, although direct
   evidence is lacking. This study thus sought to explore RBC mechanical
   responses in shear flow using purpose-built laser diffractometry in
   tandem with direct optical visualization to address this problem.
   Freshly collected RBCs were exposed to a mechanical stimulus known to
   drastically alter cell deformability (i.e., prior shear exposure (PSE)
   to 100 Pa x 300 s). Samples were subsequently transferred to a
   custom-built slit-flow chamber that combined laser diffractometry with
   direct cell visualization. Cell suspensions were sheared in a stepwise
   manner (between 0.3 and 5.0 Pa), with each step being maintained for 15
   s. Deformability and cell orientation indices were recorded for
   small-scatter Fraunhofer diffraction patterns and also visualized RBCs.
   PSE RBCs had significantly decreased visualized and laser-derived
   deformability at any given shear stress >= 1 Pa. Novel, to our
   knowledge, observations demonstrated that PSE RBCs had increased
   heterogeneity of direct visualized orientation with flow vector at any
   shear, which may be due to greater vorticity and thus instability in
   5-Pa flow compared with unsheared control. These findings indicate that
   shear exposure and stress-strain history can alter subsequent RBC
   behavior in physiologically relevant low-shear flows. These findings may
   yield insight into microvascular disorders in recipients of mechanical
   circulatory support and individuals with hematological diseases that
   alter physical properties of blood.}},

Abstract = {{Open hole wellbores present cost efficient completion solution; however,
   instability of such boreholes in weak formations such as chalk in the
   course of production raises a concern. This paper presents a method for
   predicting the stability of the radial jet drilling laterals in the
   Danish Gorm chalk field. The method is based on four main parts: (1)
   rock mechanics testing in the triaxial cell; (2) the single lateral hole
   testing consisting of loading and fluid flow test; (3) utilizing CT
   imaging for identifying the damaged zone and its extension; and (4)
   numerical simulations, utilizing a chalk model that takes into account
   the post-peak softening and the rate dependency of the pore collapse
   stress. Simulation of bottom hole and reservoir pressure decline over a
   year by 17 MPa and 9 MPa, respectively, showed a small development of
   the plastic strain at the borehole wall. Further simulation up to four
   years with constant stress (creep) resulted in a change in the
   cross-sectional area of the borehole, where shear cracks developed at
   the wall and some distance away from the hole stress concentrations
   associated with pore collapse was observed. By the end of the
   simulation, the borehole was likely to change its geometry by removal of
   the plastified area. The single lateral hole test with flow carried out
   with differential pore pressure, drawdown, of about 2.5 MPa within 5 h
   and 1 h, respectively, provided insignificant permeability change during
   the flow test.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL \& COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Herein, we have designed four small molecular donors (SMDs) with
   Donor-Acceptor-Acceptor (D-A-A) backbone having different acceptor units
   for highly efficient organic solar cells (OSCs). The specific molecular
   modeling has been made by replacing the additional acceptor unit (A) of
   recently synthesized TPA-DAA-MDN molecule (R) by employing different
   highly efficient acceptor units in order to improve the photovoltaic
   performances of the molecules. A theoretical approach (DFT and TD-DFT)
   has been applied to investigate the photophysical, opto-electronic and
   photovoltaic parameters of the designed molecules (DAA1-DAA4) and
   compared with the reference molecule (R). The red-shifting absorption of
   SMDs is the most important factor for highly efficient OSCs. Our all
   formulated molecules showed a red shifted absorption spectrum and also
   exhibit near IR sensitivity. Acceptor unit modification of R molecule
   causes reduction in HOMO-LUMO energy gap; therefore, all designed
   molecules offer better opto-electronic properties as compared to R
   molecule. A variety of certain critical factors essential for efficient
   SMDs like frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), absorption maxima, dipole
   moment, exciton binding energy along with transition density matrix,
   excitation energy, open circuit voltages and charge mobilities of
   (DAA1-DAA4) and R have also been investigated. Generally, low values of
   reorganizational energy (hole and electron) offer high charge mobility
   and our all designed molecules are enriched in this aspect. High open
   circuit voltage values, low excitation energies, large dipole moment
   values indicate that our designed SMDs are suitable candidates for
   high-efficiency OSCs. Furthermore, conceptualized molecules are superior
   and thus are suggested to experimentalist for out-looking future
   progresses of highly efficient OSCs devices.}},

Abstract = {{During times when terrorism is eroding almost all industries of victim
   economies, tourism industry is thought to be much prone to it. This
   paper investigates the long run relationship between terrorism and
   tourism for South Asian and African countries separately, allowing us to

   analyzed via dynamic panel techniques (PMG, MG and DFE) on data for 22
   African and 6 South Asian countries from 1991 to 2013. These panel
   cointegration techniques quantify the long-run relationship between
   terrorism and tourism. Terrorism has been found detrimental for tourism

   differentiated from Canariomyces, its closest relative, by having
   solitary and glabrous ascomata, cells of the perithecial wall forming a
   textura epidermoidea, stalked asci, densely granular ascospores with a
   distinct subapical germ pore, and producing only solitary conidia.
   Parachaetomium is characterized by distinctly ostiolate ascomata and
   equi- or inequilaterally fusiform, typically less than 13-mu m-long
   ascospores with an oblique or subapical germ pore. Achaetomium aegilopis
   is mainly distinguished from A. strumarium, its closest relative, by

Abstract = {{Two mixed-valence Mn(II)Mn(III) complexes, {[}Mn2L1(OAc)(2)(H2O)]BPh4

   prepared and characterized. Both complexes share a
   mu-phenolate-bis(mu-acetate)Mn(II)Mn (III) core and N3O3-coordination
   sphere around the Mn(II) ion, but differ in the donor groups surrounding
   Mn(III) (NO4(solvent) and NO5). In non-protic solvents, these two
   complexes are able to disproportionate at least 3600 equiv. of H2O2
   without significant decomposition, with first-order dependence on
   catalyst and saturation kinetics on {[}H2O2]. Spectroscopic monitoring
   of the reaction mixtures revealed the two complexes disproportionate
   H2O2 employing a different redox cycle, with retention of dinuclearity.
   The higher catalytic efficiency of {[}Mn2L2(OAc)(2)] was rationalized in
   terms of the larger labilizing effect of the heptadentate ligand that
   favors the acetate-shift and the replacement of the non-coordinating
   benzyl arm of L-1 by a carboxylate arm in L-2 which facilitates the
   formation of the catalyst-H2O2 adduct, placing {[}Mn2L2(OAc)(2)] as the
   most efficient among the phenolate-bridged diMn catalysts based on the
   k(cat)/K-M criterion.}},

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Despite extensive research on cryptography, secure and efficient query
   processing over outsourced data remains an open challenge. This article
   continues along with the emerging trend in secure data processing that
   recognizes that the entire dataset may not be sensitive and, hence,
   non-sensitivity of data can be exploited to overcome limitations of
   existing encryption-based approaches. We first provide a new security
   definition, entitled partitioned data security, for guaranteeing that
   the joint processing of non-sensitive data (in cleartext) and sensitive
   data (in encrypted form) does not lead to any leakage. Then, this
   article proposes a new secure approach, entitled query binning (QB),
   that allows secure execution of queries over non-sensitive and sensitive
   parts of the data. QB maps a query to a set of queries over the
   sensitive and non-sensitive data in a way that no leakage will occur due
   to the joint processing over sensitive and non-sensitive data. In
   particular, we propose secure algorithms for selection, range, and join
   queries to be executed over encrypted sensitive and cleartext
   non-sensitive datasets. Interestingly, in addition to improving
   performance, we show that QB actually strengthens the security of the
   underlying cryptographic technique by preventing size, frequency-count,
   and workload-skew attacks.}},

Abstract = {{The development of intelligent packaging based on natural and

   recent years. The aim of this study was to develop and characterize a
   pH-sensitive films based on sago starch and incorporated with
   anthocyanin from torch ginger. The pH-sensitive films were fabricated by
   casting method with incorporation of different torch ginger extract
   (TGE) concentration. The surface morphology, physicochemical, barrier,
   and mechanical properties as well as the pH-sensitivity of films were
   investigated. The film with the highest concentration of TGE showed the
   lowest tensile strength (4.26 N/m(2)), toughness (2.54 MJ/m(3)), Young's
   modulus (73.96 MPa) and water vapour permeability (2.6 x 10(-4)
   g.m/day.kPa.m(2)). However, its elongation at break (85.14\%), moisture
   content (0.27\%) and water solubility (37.92\%) were the highest
   compared to other films. pH sensitivity analysis showed that the films
   containing TGE extract, changes in colour by changing the pH. The colour
   of films changed from pink to slightly green as the pH increased from pH
   4 to 9. Thus, the developed pH-sensitive film with torch ginger extract
   has potential as intelligent packaging for detection of food freshness
   or spoilage to ensure their quality and safe consumption. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION: Endoscopic full-thickness resection (EFTR) is a powerful
   option for resection of colorectal lesions not amenable to conventional
   endoscopic resection. The full-thickness resection device (FTRD) allows
   clip-assisted EFTR with a single-step technique. We report on results of
   a large nationwide FTRD registry. METHODS: The ``German colonic FTRD
   registry{''} was created to further assess efficacy and safety of the
   FTRD System after approval in Europe. Data were analyzed
   retrospectively. RESULTS: Sixty-five centers contributed 1,178
   colorectal FTRD procedures. Indications for EFTR were difficult adenomas
   (67.1\%), early carcinomas (18.4\%), subepithelial tumors (6.8\%), and
   diagnostic EFTR (1.3\%). Mean lesion size was 15 x 15 mm and most
   lesions were pretreated endoscopically (54.1\%). Technical success was
   88.2\% and R0 resection was achieved in 80.0\%. R0 resection was
   significantly higher for subepithelial tumor compared with that for
   other lesions. No difference in R0 resection was found for smaller vs
   larger lesions or for colonic vs rectal procedures. Adverse events
   occurred in 12.1\% (3.1\% major events and 2.0\% required surgical
   treatment). Endoscopic follow-up was available in 58.0\% and showed
   residual/recurrent lesions in 13.5\%, which could be managed
   endoscopically in most cases (77.2\%). DISCUSSION: To date, this is the
   largest study of colorectal EFTR using the FTRD System. The study
   demonstrated favorable efficacy and safety for ``difficult-to-resect{''}
   colorectal lesions and confirms results of previous studies in a large
   ``real-world{''} setting. Further studies are needed to compare EFTR
   with other advanced resection techniques and evaluate long-term outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Agriculture is an activity linked to the environment and has a great
   influence on climate change. As more and more crops are producing in
   less time, agricultural production is intensified and water consumption
   and energy demand is increasing. Since the energy consumed is not
   renewable, greenhouse gases (GHG) are emitted and their concentration in
   the atmosphere increases. The objective of this article is to apply
   various methodologies for the precise quantification of the carbon
   dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) and GHG emissions in the management of
   irrigation water and energy in ten water user's associations (WUAs) in
   the southeast of Spain. All the studied WUAs include irrigation
   facilities. This paper is based on obtained data in different water and
   energy audits during 2017. The concept of ``irrigation water
   management{''} considered in the article covers the process from its

Abstract = {{Drought mitigation and prevention require a broader knowledge of the
   spatio-temporal characteristics and return periods of droughts over
   several years. In this research, drought characteristics (severity,
   duration, frequency and areal extent) have been analysed in northern
   Algeria by using the Standardized Precipitation Index to identify
   drought events from 194 precipitation stations. For frequency analysis,
   three Archimedean copula families were used to find a relationship
   between drought duration and severity. The severity-duration-frequency
   (SDF) and the severity-area-frequency (SAF) curves were obtained. The
   SDF and SAF curves are then used to build three-dimensional surfaces of
   drought severity, drought duration and cumulated percentage of the
   affected area (SDA) for each return period. It has been shown that the
   return periods of maximum drought events severity vary according to
   their durations. To address the issue of long-term droughts, a new
   classification of dry events based on drought severities is proposed.
   The obtained results show that the western part of Algeria is the most
   sensitive to severe/extreme droughts of short durations and high
   probabilities of exceedance. For long-term durations, the study area was
   sensitive to mild droughts with lower probabilities.}},

Title = {{RISKS IN FOREST MANAGEMENT DEPENDING ON HAZARDOUS NATURAL PROCESSES IN
   WINTER PERIOD}},
Journal = {{GEOSFERNYE ISSLEDOVANIYA-GEOSPHERE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{68-83}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, natural hazards have been noted with increased
   frequency throughout Western Siberia, having direct and indirect impacts
   on all types of environmental management, including forest management.
   The main type of forest management activities is timber harvesting,
   which brings a substantial part of income to federal and regional
   budgets. It is usually conducted in hard-to-reach taiga areas and
   involves significant natural risks. Environmental risks can be defined
   as probabilities of hazardous natural events leading to significant
   material losses. Such probabilities are calculated based on the actual
   frequency of hazardous events related to the probability of their
   occurrence. Risk analysis, conducted in this work, includes feasibility
   studies for various types of hazards, their probability calculation, and
   assessment of the resulting possible material damage to the forest
   management activities during winter periods. The purpose of the study is
   to offer a method of risk assessment for the timber harvesting
   activities during winter periods, based on the analysis of
   meteorological data and normalized monetary losses resulting from the
   impact of natural hazards.
   The frequency analysis of natural hazards was done based on the factors
   having the greatest influence on the forestry sector: frost, strong
   winds, windstorms, duration of ice-crossing periods. The approach was
   tested for the Tomsk Oblast, which presents a classic example of a
   region with a high wood-resource potential and intensive timber
   harvesting conducted in severe climatic conditions. Information and
   analytical base for the calculations is comprised of the data collected
   by 18 meteorological stations and 86 ice-road stations located on the
   region's territory. The material damage to forest management from
   hazardous natural events was calculated for the following two factors:
   the damage from the logging equipment downtime and the damage from
   additional costs required for the hauling roads maintenance. The
   possible risks values were calculated based on the probability of
   hazardous events and estimated amount of the resulting damage.
   The study has shown that, as a rule, the risks for forest management are
   increasing during the winter periods. In such conditions, considering
   the present levels of the transportation infrastructure development, the
   amounts of possible material damage can be very large. The main types of
   risks include shortening of the ice-roads operation periods and large
   number of days with frost, snowstorms and strong winds. All of these
   factors can vary significantly from year to year. Territorial
   differences in the amount of risks are also significant and depend not
   only on natural factors, but also on the proximity of wood resources.
   The highest levels of risks are noted in the northern and north-eastern
   parts of the Tomsk Oblast.
   The article outlines the results of risk assessment conducted for the
   areas with the most intensive timber production, which are located in
   the Verkhneketsky, Pervomaysky and Tomsk district territories. According
   to our calculation, the average annual damage from the logging equipment
   downtime as a result of adverse weather conditions during winter period
   is estimated as 5.7 mln, 5.1 mln, and 1.8 mln roubles, respectively.
   Additional annual costs for the hauling roads maintenance vary from 1 to
   4.3 thous. rubles per a kilometer of the road.
   Using the distinguished types of hazardous natural events for
   winter-time forest management, and applying the regional risks
   assessment criteria developed for them, we can predict possible risks
   and make relevant recommendations in order to reduce material losses in
   the forestry sector at the regional and local levels.}},

Abstract = {{A CSM-CERES-Beet pest damage routine was modified to simulate the impact
   of Cercospora leaf spot disease effects on sugar beet yield. Foliar
   disease effects on sugar beet growth and yield were incorporated as
   daily damage to leaf area and photosynthesis, which was linked to daily
   crop growth and biomass accumulation. An experiment was conducted in
   Southwest Germany (2016-2018) with different levels of disease
   infection. Data collected included time-series leaf area index, top
   weight, storage root weight and Cercospora leaf spot disease progress.
   The model was calibrated using statistical and visual fit for one
   treatment and evaluated for eight treatments over three years. Model
   performance of the calibration treatment for all three variables
   resulted in R-2 values higher than 0.82 and d-statistics higher than
   0.94. Evaluation treatments for all three observation groups resulted in
   high R-2 and d-statistics with few exceptions mainly caused by weather
   extremes. Root mean square error values for calibration and evaluation
   treatments were satisfactory. Model statistics indicate that the
   approach can be used as a suitable decision support system to simulate
   the impact of observed Cercospora leaf spot damage on accumulated
   above-ground biomass and storage root yield on a plot/site-specific

Abstract = {{One recurring theme of the immediate post-9/11 environment was that of
   regional political organizations and violent lone-wolf actors pledging
   allegiance to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda group (AQ). Following the
   Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)'s 2014 capture of Mosul, Iraq,
   many of these loose affiliations began shifting to ISIS. This resulted
   in a blurring of distinctions between different types of Sunni jihadi
   organizations, with media commentators and analysts at times referring
   to groups as ``Al Qaeda-like{''} or ``ISIS-affiliated,{''} despite those
   groups' goals and operational scopes being largely disconnected from
   both AQ and ISIS. This article proposes a new typology of Sunni jihadi
   groups according to theater of operation, strategy, and geopolitical
   alignment. This typology offers three categories: global jihad, local
   jihad, and sectarian jihad. In addition, it identifies four types of
   operation types that Sunni jihadi groups adopt: (1) core theater
   attacks, (2) power-projection attacks, (3) local recruitment, and (4)
   foreign recruitment. The main contribution of this article is its
   frameworks for improving the quality of the analysis of Sunni jihadi
   groups.}},

Abstract = {{Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and electron channeling contrast
   imaging (ECCI) are used to extract crystallographic information from

   techniques rely on the backscattered electron signal, which has a large
   distribution in electron energy. Here, the influence of plasmon
   excitations on EBSD patterns and ECCI dislocation images is uncovered by
   multislice simulations including inelastic scattering. It is shown that
   the Kikuchi band contrast in an EBSD pattern for silicon is maximum at
   small energy loss (i.e., few plasmon scattering events following
   backscattering), consistent with previous energy-filtered EBSD
   measurements. On the other hand, plasmon excitation has very little
   effect on the ECCI image of a dislocation. These results are explained
   by examining the role of the characteristic plasmon scattering angle on
   the intrinsic contrast mechanisms in EBSD and ECCI.}},

Abstract = {{In the past, a great deal of research has been conducted to determine
   the fractal properties of river networks, and there are many kinds of
   methods calculating their fractal dimensions. In this paper, we compare
   two most common methods: one is geomorphic fractal dimension obtained
   from the bifurcation ratio and the stream length ratio, and the other is
   box-counting method. Firstly, synthetic fractal trees are used to
   explain the role of the junction angle on the relation between two kinds
   of fractal dimensions. The obtained relationship curves indicate that
   box-counting dimension is decreasing with the increase of the junction
   angle when geomorphic fractal dimension keeps constant. This
   relationship presents continuous and smooth convex curves with junction
   angle from 60 degrees to 120 degrees and concave curves from 30 degrees
   to 45 degrees. Then 70 river networks in China are investigated in terms
   of their two kinds of fractal dimensions. The results confirm the
   fractal structure of river networks. Geomorphic fractal dimensions of
   river networks are larger than box-counting dimensions and there is no
   obvious relationship between these two kinds of fractal dimensions.
   Relatively good non-linear relationships between geomorphic fractal
   dimensions and box-counting dimensions are obtained by considering the
   role of the junction angle.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of the Performance of Different Methods for Estimating
   Evaporation over a Highland Open Freshwater Lake in Mountainous Area}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Lake evaporation is an important link connecting the water cycle and the
   surface energy cycle and remains one of the most uncertain terms in the
   local catchment's water balance. Quantifying lake evaporation and its
   variability is crucial to improve water resource management and
   understand the response of the lake system towards climate change. In
   this study, we evaluated the performances of nine evaporation methods at
   different timescales and calibrated them by using the continuous eddy
   covariance (EC) observation data during 2015-2018 over Erhai Lake, a
   highland open freshwater lake situated in the Dali valley, China. The
   nine evaporation methods could be classified into combination methods
   (Bowen-ratio energy budget, Penman, Priestley-Taylor, DeBruin-Keijman
   and Brutsaert-Stricker), solar radiation-based methods (Jensen-Haise and
   Makkink) and Dalton-based method (mass transfer and Ryan-Harleman) based
   on their parameterization schemes. The Dalton-based Ryan-Harleman method
   is most suitable for estimating evaporation at daily to weekly scales,
   while the combination methods and solar radiation-based method had good
   estimates at monthly timescale. After calibration, the biases of the
   Jensen-Haise and Ryan-Harleman method were slightly reduced, while the
   biases of the Makkink and mass transfer methods were reduced
   substantially. The calibrated Jensen-Haise method with small annual bias
   (-2.2 similar to 2.8\%) and simple input variables was applied to
   estimate the long-term trend of evaporation during 1981-2018. The annual
   total evaporation showed an insignificant increasing trend of 0.30 mm
   year(-1,) mainly caused by the significant rising air temperature. This
   study showed the performance of evaporation methods over water bodies
   had large discrepancies on different time scales, which indicated the
   importance of the choice of evaporation methods and provided instruction
   for water resource management of this region under climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies have extensively investigated the antecedents,
   consequences, and relationships of Organizational Citizenship Behavior
   (OCB) and Emotional Intelligence (EI) in corporate and industrial
   settings, but not in educational contexts particularly in the field of
   English language teaching. To expand the existing literature in OCB and
   EI, this study investigated the levels and relationship of OCB and EI of
   college English teachers in an English language institute in the western
   region of Saudi Arabia. It tried to answer the following research
   questions: 1) What is the level of OCB and EI of the respondents? 2) Is
   there a significant relationship between the respondents' OCB and EI?
   Using descriptive correlational research design with adapted
   organizational citizenship behavior and emotional intelligence scales as
   data gathering instruments, this study found that the respondents had
   very high level of OCB. Specifically, the findings revealed that the
   OCBs under altruism, civic virtue, and compliance dimensions were rated
   as very high while those under sportsmanship and courtesy were assessed
   as high. Findings also indicated that the EFL teachers had high level of
   EI. Lastly, the study proved that there was a significant, positive
   relationship between the respondents' organizational citizenship
   behaviors and emotional intelligence. Based on the findings, the study
   concludes that the respondents have the potential to excel in their job
   and are able to contribute to overall institutional effectiveness. This
   asset should be enriched and sustained by implementing more relevant
   OCB/EI-friendly policies and practices that support conducive school
   climate, transformational leadership, and emotional well-being.}},

Abstract = {{High-dimensional, large, and noisy data with complex structure challenge
   the limits of many clustering algorithms including modern graph
   segmentation methods. SOM-based clustering has been shown capable of
   capturing many clusters of widely varying statistical properties in such
   data. However, to date the best discovery results are produced by
   interactive extraction of clusters from informative SOM visualizations.
   This does not scale for Big Data, large archives, or near-real-time
   analyses. We approach this challenge by infusing SOM knowledge into
   leading automatic graph segmentation algorithms, which produce extremely
   poor results when segmenting the SOM prototypes without this
   information, and which would take a prohibitively long time to segment
   the input data sets. The knowledge translation occurs by casting the SOM
   prototypes as vertices and the CONN similarity measure as edge
   weightings of a graph which is then presented to graph segmentation
   algorithms. The resulting performance closely approximates the precision
   of the interactive SOM segmentation for complicated data and, at the
   same time, is extremely fast and memory-efficient. We demonstrate the
   effectiveness on a simple synthetic data set and on a very realistic
   fully labeled synthetic hyperspectral image. We also examine performance
   dependence on available parametrizations of the graph segmentation
   algorithms, in combination with parametrizations of the CONN similarity
   measure.}},

Title = {{Development of a novel nomogram incorporating platelet-to-lymphocyte

Journal = {{UROLOGIC ONCOLOGY-SEMINARS AND ORIGINAL INVESTIGATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{38}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The available nomograms used to predict lymph node
   involvement (LNI) are not comprehensive. We sought to derive a novel
   nomogram incorporating the platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) to predict
   LNI and compare its performance to validated preoperative risk nomograms
   in a cohort of men undergoing robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy at
   our institution.
   Methods: Our electronic health record was queried for patients who
   underwent robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy with bilateral pelvic
   lymphadenectomy between 2013 and 2019. A bootstrapped multivariate
   logistic regression model was constructed for the predictors of LNI
   while adjusting for other covariates. Then, we used the derived logistic
   regression formula to estimate each patient's risk (\%) for LNI.
   Individualized risks were also calculated using the following verified
   nomograms: Briganti-2012, Cagiannos, Godoy, and Memorial Sloan Kettering
   Cancer Center. Subsequently, we plotted the risks for our nomogram and
   the 4 verified nomograms into receiver operating characteristics curves.
   We reported the area under the curve (AUC) for each of the 5 nomograms
   and the corresponding 95\% confidence interval (CI).
   Results: The cohort included 173 patients, of which 13.9\% demonstrated
   LNI. LNI was associated with higher preoperative prostatespecific
   antigen (PSA) >= 10 {[}odds ratio {[}OR] >= 4.89; 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] (1.42-16.83)], higher grade (WHO group >= 3){[}19.21;
   (2.23-195.25)], and higher percentage of positive biopsy cores (= 60\%)
   {[}3.38, (1.04-11.00)]. With every 30-unit increase in PLR the risk of
   LNI increased by 47\%. The nomogram derived from our data had the
   highest AUC {[}(AUC 0.877; 95\% CI (0.806-0.947)]. The Memorial Sloan
   Kettering Cancer Center and Briganti 2012 displayed almost congruent
   ability {[}0.836; 95\% CI (0.758-0.915)] and {[}0.827; (0.752-0.902)] to
   identify patients with positive nodes in our cohort with perfect
   sensitivity and negative predictive value.
   Conclusion: The nomogram incorporating PLR demonstrated 94.7\%
   sensitivity to predict LNI and avoided pelvic lymphadenectomy in half of
   the patients at a cut-off between 6.5\% and 8.5\%. A prospective study
   with a larger sample is needed to validate our findings. (C) 2020

Journal = {{CASE STUDIES IN CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS}},

Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this work is the reuse of polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
   deriving from waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) used as a
   partial substitute for the mineral aggregate to produce lightened
   mortars. PVC was recovered from copper electrical cables, ground and
   used as replacement of mineral aggregate in 5, 10, 15 and 20 \% vol. in
   mortar. A thermal characterization of the starting material was carried
   out to understand its composition. The mortar samples were mechanically
   tested both using class G cement and ordinary Portland cement. The
   results showed a worsening of the mechanical properties of around 50 \%
   for only 5 \% in volume of sand substituted with PVC waste. A likely
   explanation to this phenomenon was found in the mechanical
   characteristics of the PVC used and to its poor adhesion with the
   matrix, that resulted in the creation of porosity. However, the mortar
   prepared contributes to the conservation of natural resources and
   maintains mechanical properties adequate for the use in non-structural
   applications (e.g. screed or substrate). (C) 2020 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {{Motivation: Cells regulate themselves via dizzyingly complex biochemical
   processes called signaling pathways. These are usually depicted as a
   network, where nodes represent proteins and edges indicate their
   influence on each other. In order to understand diseases and therapies
   at the cellular level, it is crucial to have an accurate understanding
   of the signaling pathways at work. Since signaling pathways can be
   modified by disease, the ability to infer signaling pathways from
   condition- or patient-specific data is highly valuable. A variety of
   techniques exist for inferring signaling pathways. We build on past
   works that formulate signaling pathway inference as a Dynamic Bayesian
   Network structure estimation problem on phosphoproteomic time course
   data. We take a Bayesian approach, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo to
   estimate a posterior distribution over possible Dynamic Bayesian Network
   structures. Our primary contributions are (i) a novel proposal
   distribution that efficiently samples sparse graphs and (ii) the
   relaxation of common restrictive modeling assumptions.
   Results: We implement our method, named Sparse Signaling Pathway
   Sampling, in Julia using the Gen probabilistic programming language.
   Probabilistic programming is a powerful methodology for building
   statistical models. The resulting code is modular, extensible and
   legible. The Gen language, in particular, allows us to customize our
   inference procedure for biological graphs and ensure efficient sampling.
   We evaluate our algorithm on simulated data and the HPN-DREAM pathway
   reconstruction challenge, comparing our performance against a variety of
   baseline methods. Our results demonstrate the vast potential for
   probabilistic programming, and Gen specifically, for biological network
   inference.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the vitamin D levels in patients with
   premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)
   Design: Cross-sectional study
   Setting: Obstetrics and Gynecology outpatient clinics, Acibadem
   Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey
   Subjects: The study population included 125 women aged 18-47 years who
   presented with various complaints and regular menstrual cycle. A control
   group was formed of 159 premenopausal women without premenstrual
   symptoms. Intervention: Serum samples were tested during the luteal
   phase of menstrual cycle
   Main Outcome Measure: Study groups were formed as none/mild PMS;
   moderate to severe PMS; PMDD group by using the premenstrual symptoms
   screening tool, and a control group; biochemical analyses of serum
   25(OH)D-3 (vitamin D) were performed using the electrochemiluminescence
   immunoassay method.
   Results: The mean age of the participants was 30.52 +/- 6.44 years. The
   distributions of diagnoses were 51.2\%, 33.6\% and 15.2\% in the PMS
   none/mild, the PMS moderate/severe, and the PMDD group, respectively.
   Vitamin D levels were found as sufficient (>= 20 ng/dL) in 46.2\%,
   deficient (10-20 ng/dL) in 43\%, and severely deficient (<10 ng/dL) in
   10.7\% of the control group, and in the patient group these rates were
   non-deficient in 13.4\%, deficient in 27.7\%, and severely deficient in
   58.7\%.
   Conclusions: The study showed that vitamin D levels were significantly
   lower in the study patients compared with the control group. Although
   the vitamin D level was lower in the PMS groups than in the PMDD group,
   the difference did not reach statistical significance. Further studies
   are needed to elucidate the exact role of vitamin D in PMS/PMDD.}},

Title = {{Earth as an Exoplanet. I. Time Variable Thermal Emission Using Spatially
   Resolved Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer Data}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{160}},

Abstract = {{Among the more than 4000 exoplanets known today, some terrestrial
   planets have been detected in the so-called habitable zone of their host
   stars and their number is expected to increase in the near future,
   energizing a drive to understand and interpret the eagerly awaited
   wealth of data to identify signs of life beyond our solar system. So
   far, Earth remains the best and only example of a habitable (and
   inhabited) world. Although, it seems extremely unlikely that any other
   exoplanets will be true Earth twins, it is important to explore and
   understand the full range of spectral signatures and variability of
   Earth in order to inform the design of future instruments and missions,
   and understand their diagnostic power as well as potential limitations.
   In this work we use Earth observation data collected by the MODIS
   instrument aboard the Aqua satellite. The complete data set comprises 15
   years of thermal emission observations in the 3.66-14.40 mu m range for
   five different locations on Earth (Amazon Rainforest, Antarctica,
   Arctic, Indian Ocean, and the Sahara Desert). We then determine flux
   levels and variations as a function of wavelength and surface type
   (i.e., climate zone and surface thermal properties) and investigate
   whether periodic signals indicating Earth's tilted rotation axis can be
   detected. Our findings suggest that (1) viewing geometry plays an
   important role when thermal emission data is analyzed as Earth's
   spectrum varies by a factor of three and more depending on the dominant
   surface type underneath; (2) typically strong absorption bands from CO2
   (15 mu m) and O-3 (9.65 mu m) are significantly less pronounced and
   partially absent in data from the polar regions implying that estimating
   correct abundance levels for these molecules might be challenging in
   these cases; and (3) the time-resolved thermal emission spectrum encodes
   information about seasons/planetary obliquity, but the significance
   depends on the viewing geometry and spectral band considered.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES To evaluate the impact of cardiovascular, metabolic and
   smoking related risk factors on recurrence in patients with buccal
   mucosal graft urethroplasty for anterior urethral strictures.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS Retrospective single-center analysis between 2009
   and 2016. Covariates included American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA)
   score, body mass index, and smoking status (never vs ever), coronary
   artery disease, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, change in
   hemoglobin, creatinine, c-reactive protein, and leucocyte count.
   Descriptive and survival analyses evaluated the association with
   stricture recurrence.
   RESULTS Overall, 1039 patients had buccal mucosal graft urethroplasty of
   which 517 remained for final analysis. Patients with stricture
   recurrence (n = 76) were significantly older (P < .001), had a higher
   American Society of Anesthesiology score (P = .006), higher proportion
   coronary artery disease (P = .011), and hypertension (P = .003) compared
   to those patients without stricture recurrence. Patients without
   stricture recurrence had a significantly larger drop in hemoglobin (1.5
   {[}0.9, 2.1] vs 1.2 {[}0.7, 1.8]) mg/dl ( = .005).Overall stricture-free
   recurrence rate was 86\%, with a median follow-up of 32 (95\% confidence
   interval: 26-30) months. In multivariable analysis, a larger drop of
   hemoglobin remained the only independent, statistically significant
   negative predictor of stricture recurrence (Hazard ratio, 95\%
   confidence interval: 0.74, 0.57-0.97, P = .03).
   CONCLUSION A larger drop of hemoglobin is independently associated with
   recurrence free survival. This may be considered as a surrogate marker
   for good microvascular circulation of the corpus spongiosum and
   therefore neovascularization of the graft. Contrary to the existing and
   mostly heterogenous previous studies, our findings suggest that
   stricture recurrence is largely independent of cardiovascular and
   metabolic risk factors. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.}},

Title = {{Stochastic AC optimal power flow: A data-driven approach}},
Journal = {{ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{189}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{There is an emerging need for efficient solutions to stochastic AC
   Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) to ensure optimal and reliable grid
   operations in the presence of increasing demand and generation
   uncertainty. This paper presents a highly scalable data-driven algorithm
   for stochastic AC-OPF that has extremely low sample requirement. The
   novelty behind the algorithm's performance involves an iterative
   scenario design approach that merges information regarding constraint
   violations in the system with data-driven sparse regression. Compared to
   conventional methods with random scenario sampling, our approach is able
   to provide feasible operating points for realistic systems with much
   lower sample requirements. Furthermore, multiple sub-tasks in our
   approach can be easily paralleled and based on historical data to
   enhance its performance and application. We demonstrate the
   computational improvements of our approach through simulations on
   different test cases in the IEEE PES PGLib-OPF benchmark library.}},

Title = {{Effect of spatial distribution of mesoscale heterogeneities on the
   shock-to-detonation transition in liquid nitromethane}},
Journal = {{COMBUSTION AND FLAME}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{222}},
Pages = {{392-410}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The sensitizing effect of cavities in the form of microbubbles on the
   shock initiation of a homogeneous liquid explosive is studied
   computationally. While the presence of voids in an explosive has long
   been known to induce so-called hot spots that greatly accelerate the
   global reaction rate, the ability to computationally resolve the details
   of the interaction of the shock front with heterogeneities existing on
   the scale of the detonation reaction zone has only recently become
   feasible. In this study, the influence of the spatial distribution of
   air-filled cavities has been examined, enabled by the use of graphic
   processing unit (GPU) accelerated computations that can resolve shock
   initiation and detonation propagation through an explosive while fully
   resolving features at the mesoscale. Different spatial distributions of
   cavities are examined in two-dimensional simulations, including regular
   arrays of cavities, slightly perturbed arrays, random arrays (with
   varying minimum spacing being imposed on the cavities), and randomly
   distributed clusters of cavities. Statistical ensembles of simulations
   are performed for the cases with randomly positioned cavities. The
   presence of the cavities is able to reduce the time required to initiate
   detonationfor a given input shock strength-by greater than 50\%, in
   agreement with previous experimental results. Randomly distributing the
   cavities results in a 15-20\% decrease in detonation initiation time in
   comparison to a regular array of cavities. Clustering the cavities-as
   would occur in the case of agglomeration-results in an additional 10\%
   decrease in detonation initiation time in comparison to random arrays.
   The effect of clustering is shown not to be a result of the clusters
   forming an effectively larger cavity, but rather due to interactions
   between clusters upon shock loading occurring on the microscale. The
   implications of these results for modelling and experiments of
   microbubble-sensitized explosives is discussed. (C) 2020 The Combustion

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that impulsive noise can weaken the
   performance of power line communication (PLC). Though DCSK can improve
   the performance in an order of magnitude comparing to the direct
   sequence differential phase shift keying (DS-DPSK), it is still a
   challenge to further improve the BER performance with signal redesign
   without the need of advanced and expensive extra noise suppression
   technologies. The paper introduces the model of asynchronous impulsive
   noise of Middleton class-A noise and corresponding multipath fading
   channels in PLC, and analyzes the bit error rate (BER) performance of
   the M-ary differential chaos shift keying (MDCSK) scheme over different
   channels. Furthermore, a new replica piecewise frame of MDCSK (RP-MDCSK)
   is proposed to resist the impulse noise. In the proposed scheme, one
   piecewise of signals is transmitted first. Then, it replicates pw times,
   which serves as the reference signal transmitted in the first half
   symbol period. The information-bearing signal combines the reference
   signal with its Hilbert transform in the second half. At the receiver,
   one piece of reference signals is extracted and then correlated with its
   corresponding information-bearing part. The BER expressions of the MDCSK
   and the proposed scheme are derived and analyzed over different
   channels, and verified by simulations. Comparing with the corresponding
   schemes, it is found that the BER of the proposed scheme is by 2-3
   orders of magnitude lower.}},

Title = {{Does pre-processing affect the correlation indicator between Twitter
   message volume and stock market trading volume?}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Motivation: More and more authors empirically verify the relationship
   between the volume of tweets and the stock market indicators. The
   patterns explored from Twitter most often take the form of time series
   that represent user's activity on different level of granularity (moods,
   emotions, relevant topic or query-related messages). Sentiment analysis
   is a technique used to transform text data into information on the mood
   and related behavioral categories. Supervised machine learning is the
   most commonly used approach to sentiment analysis. Thus, the results of
   an empirical analysis of the relationship between social media and stock
   depend on the quality of results of classification task. The quality of
   the features used to learn the classifier plays a key role. The feature
   space is modified using various data pre-processing scenarios that aim
   to increase accuracy of classification. The impact of pre-processing
   data on the quality of classification is often discussed in studies.
   Very few authors discuss the impact of pre-processing on the correlation
   indicator between Twitter and stock market.
   Aim: Analysis of the impact of tweets pre-processing on the Pearson
   correlation indicator between the mood of Twitter users and stock market
   trading volume.
   Results: The correlation between the volume of stock market trading and
   the volume of tweets has been empirically confirmed. The effect of
   pre-processing on the correlation index was noted for the variables
   `all\_tweets' and `negative\_tweets'. This is because the training set
   has a significant amount of tweets with negation. However, the results
   are not conclusive. The differences between the Pearson correlation
   index calculated for scenario one and scenario four are not significant.
   However, this indicates that the effect of noise data may reduce the
   quality and precision of conclusions. Especially in the case of frequent
   repetition of a certain category of noise.}},

Abstract = {{Avascular necrosis is the most devastating complication of slipped
   capital femoral epiphysis, leading to collapse of the femoral head,
   increased risk of osteoarthritis and the requirement of early total hip
   arthroplasty. It is believed that intraoperative femoral head perfusion
   assessment may be an accurate predictor of post-operative avascular
   necrosis (radiographic collapse). At our institution, femoral head
   perfusion is assessed intraoperatively during all sub-capital
   realignment procedures. We hypothesize that our method is accurate in
   predicting the risk of developing post-operative avascular necrosis. In
   this retrospective study, we collected data from all patients that had
   intraoperative blood flow measurements during sub-capital realignment
   procedures. We correlated this with long-term radiographs looking for
   radiographic collapse. The intraoperative femoral head perfusion
   assessments during sub-capital realignment procedures for slipped
   capital femoral epiphysis at our institution, between January 2015 and
   March 2020 inclusive were assessed for reliability. In total, 26 of 35
   patients had intraoperative femoral head perfusion present. Only 2 (8\%)
   of these patients developed radiographic collapse. In contrast, 7 (78\%)
   of the 9 patients who did not have femoral head perfusion present
   intraoperatively developed radiographic collapse, indicating that our
   method may be reliable in predicting a patient's post-operative risk of
   developing avascular necrosis.}},

Journal = {{ECONOMIC MODELLING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{510-519}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Whether a balanced budget rule stabilizes or destabilizes an economy
   depends on various factors such as the production function or the
   instrument used to balance the budget. This paper argues that migration,
   which has widely been neglected in the literature, also affects
   equilibrium properties. We study the effect of pro-cyclical labor
   mobility in a neoclassical growth model with public debt and a balanced
   budget requirement. Labor mobility can destabilize the economy due to
   external effects. After a negative shock hits the economy, living abroad
   becomes relatively more attractive, resulting in out-migration. This
   increases per capita public debt as migrants leave behind their implicit
   liabilities. The government increases tax rates to satisfy the balanced
   budget requirement, which further depresses the economy and increases
   out-migration. The destabilizing effect of public debt kicks in at only
   slightly higher debt levels than the ones observed in the Euro area
   after the financial crisis.}},

Journal = {{PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{167}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Perfectionism is considered an important personality trait in the
   development and maintenance of many psychological disorders,
   particularly obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and depression (which
   often co-occur). Different aspects of perfectionism are distinguished.
   Obsessive-compulsive symptoms have especially been associated with
   perfectionistic concerns. Mediating factors of the association between
   OCD and perfectionistic concerns have not been explored. In depression,
   there is tentative evidence that the connection between perfectionistic
   concerns and depressive symptoms is mediated by self-esteem. The aim of
   the present study was to investigate the association between
   perfectionistic concerns and clinical perfectionism, self-esteem, and
   obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Seventy patients with OCD and 35
   nonclinical controls were included in a crosssectional study.
   Obsessive-compulsive symptoms, perfectionistic concerns as well as
   clinical perfectionism, and self-esteem were assessed and included in
   the mediation analyses. Patients with OCD showed higher perfectionism
   than nonclinical controls. Self-esteem mediated the relationship between
   perfectionistic concerns as well as clinical perfectionism and
   obsessive-compulsive symptoms in the patients. However, interpretations
   of the data are limited by the cross-sectional design of the study.}},

Title = {{The Great Heuberg: An Iron Age ritual landscape on the Swabian Jura, SW
   Germany}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{B}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper discusses land use on the Great Heuberg in the southwestern
   part of the Swabian Jura during the Urnfield period and the pre-Roman
   Iron Age. In contrast to adjacent landscapes, this plateau is
   characterized by a small site density that has been interpreted as the
   result of an avoidance of its low-yielding soils and harsh climate.
   However, this interpretation is ineligible because it tacitly transfers
   contemporary perceptions of environmental conditions onto prehistoric
   societies. The present paper reviews the history of archaeological
   research on the Great Heuberg to evaluate the site distribution and
   promotes an alternative interpretation by using the concept of
   liminality. Accordingly, the site distribution on the Great Heuberg may
   have been linked to ritual activities at the so-called Heidentor, a
   natural rock formation in the form of a gate located at the northeastern
   edge of the plateau. Material remains excavated at the site point to
   ritual activities from the Urnfield period onward until the end of the
   middle La rene period. The overall site distribution on the plateau
   indicates that the journey through the landscape may have been an
   integral part of the rituals performed at the Heidentor. This went along
   with the possible construction of a liminal space in the immediate
   vicinity of the rock formation. In addition, the distribution of
   settlements and burial sites from the Hallstatt period allows a
   differentiation between a landscape with settlements and burial mounds
   in the west of the Great Heuberg and a landscape with only burial mounds
   on the eastern half, separated by a river. While this spatial pattern
   ceases to exist in the La rene period, the liminal space is
   archaeologically visible until the ritual use of the Heidentor came to
   an end in the middle La Tene period.}},

Abstract = {{Berlin has had a long, often complex history as a location site and
   centre for production dating to the end of the 19th century. By the
   2010s however, the German city had once more become a central location

   because of changing media policy and shifts in the global media
   industry, as well as related to the mediated imagination of the city.
   The article charts those changes in local production cultures related to
   technology, politics and economics but also to the aesthetic and
   narrative representation of the city which affected audiences and
   producers. The central argument is that local production cultures are
   not homogeneous, but ambivalent and sometimes contradictory.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This study explores the impact of perceived trust, search for
   novelty and perceived usefulness on consumer attitudes towards social
   network advertising, and the impact of those attitudes on buying
   intention, buying and word- of-mouth information spread.
   Design/Methodology/Approach - The research included convenience sample
   of 265 respondents. Online survey distributed through Facebook and
   Instagram was used as a research method. The data was analysed using a
   multiple regression analysis.
   Findings and implications - The results show that positive attitudes
   towards social network advertising depend on perceived trust and
   usefulness. The impact of the search for novelty on consumer attitudes
   towards social network advertising proved to be insignificant.
   Furthermore, buying intention, buying and disseminating information by
   word-of-mouth represent relevant outcomes of consumer attitudes towards
   social network advertising. This research has implications for companies
   in terms of a better understanding of the relevant predictors and
   outcomes of consumer attitudes in online advertising context. Managers
   can also benefit from the findings when creating successful
   communication strategies.
   Limitations - A major research limitation is the use of non-probability
   convenience sample that did not capture the population as a whole.
   Therefore, this may be regarded as a future research direction.
   Originality - This study sheds new light on relevant predictors and
   outcomes of consumer attitudes towards social network advertising, which
   was not previously researched from the proposed framework perspective.}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{The optimization of the dispersed alkaline substrate (DAS) technology
   was investigated to achieve the treatment of highly acidic and polluted
   effluents from a phosphogypsum pile in an orphan site of SW Spain. This
   phosphogypsum disposal area is located on the Tinto river marsh soils,
   where it acts as a source of pollution for the estuarine environment,
   releasing high concentrations of metal(loid)s and radionuclides, which
   degrade the surrounding waters. The methodology consists of flowing the
   leachates through columns loaded with a combination of a fine-grained
   alkaline reagent scattered in a non-reactive matrix to raise the water
   pH while decreasing the solubility of dissolved contaminants. Seven
   columns were built, one for each of the alkaline reagent used:
   limestone, barium carbonate, biomass ash, fly ash, MgO, Mg(OH)(2), and
   Ca(OH)(2). The Ca(OH)(2)-DAS and MgO-DAS treatment systems showed the
   highest effectiveness, reaching near-total removal for PO4, F, Fe, Zn,
   Cu, Al, Cr, and U with initial reagent mass:treated volume ratios of
   36.3 g/L and 7.57 g/L, respectively. Total As removal was only achieved
   in the Ca(OH)(2)-DAS treatment. Phosphate precipitation was the main
   mechanism responsible for pollutants removal. Geochemical modeling using
   PHREEQC code and mineralogical evidence confirmed the precipitation of
   these minerals. This study forms the basis of an effective and
   environmentally sustainable treatment system for phosphogypsum leachates
   to reduce the impact of the fertilizer industry worldwide.}},

Title = {{Increased virulence of Puccinia coronata f. sp.avenae populations
   through allele frequency changes at multiple putative Avr loci}},
Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Pathogen populations are expected to evolve virulence traits in response
   to resistance deployed in agricultural settings. However, few temporal
   datasets have been available to characterize this process at the
   population level. Here, we examined two temporally separated populations
   of Puccinia coronata f. sp. avenae (Pca), which causes crown rust
   disease in oat (Avena sativa) sampled from 1990 to 2015. We show that a
   substantial increase in virulence occurred from 1990 to 2015 and this
   was associated with a genetic differentiation between populations
   detected by genome-wide sequencing. We found strong evidence for genetic
   recombination in these populations, showing the importance of the
   alternate host in generating genotypic variation through sexual
   reproduction. However, asexual expansion of some clonal lineages was
   also observed within years. Genome-wide association analysis identified
   seven Avr loci associated with virulence towards fifteen Pc resistance
   genes in oat and suggests that some groups of Pc genes recognize the
   same pathogen effectors. The temporal shift in virulence patterns in the
   Pca populations between 1990 and 2015 is associated with changes in
   allele frequency in these genomic regions. Nucleotide diversity patterns
   at a single Avr locus corresponding to Pc38, Pc39, Pc55, Pc63, Pc70, and
   Pc71 showed evidence of a selective sweep associated with the shift to
   virulence towards these resistance genes in all 2015 collected isolates.
   Author summary
   The rust fungus Puccinia coronata f. sp. avenae (Pca), which causes
   crown rust disease, decimates oat (Avena sativa) production in many
   countries of the world. While the use of genetic resistance in crop
   breeding programs is the most sustainable disease management strategy to
   control plant disease, the release of oat varieties that display genetic
   resistance to Pca infection is hindered by rapid evolution of this
   pathogen. This study aims to determine demography and determinants of
   adaptive evolution in Pca to minimize the risk of disease outbreaks and
   enhance resistance gene stewardship. We recently published two high
   quality genome references of P. coronata f. sp. avenae. Here, we used
   these resources to direct a population genomics-based study of two
   temporally distant sets of pathogen collections to study genotypic
   changes that may explain the most recent oat crown rust epidemics across
   the continental US. We found that the population of Pca in 1990 is
   significantly different to that collected in 2015 at both genotypic and
   phenotypic levels. Our findings are consistent with the role of sexual
   and asexual reproduction in the Pca population diversity. Importantly,
   our work identifies genomic regions and genes that may be involved in
   local host adaptation which in the future may assist in the development
   of molecular markers and diagnosis of virulence.}},

   change in Aztec and Colonial Mexico}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHAEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{60}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper argues that finance should matter to archaeologists and shows
   how archaeological research enhances our understanding of the history of
   finance. It presents archaeological and ethnohistoric evidence of
   saltmaking, finance, and technological change in the Basin of Mexico
   during the Aztec and Spanish empires. Studies of past technological
   change often leave unasked how people finance their adoption of
   innovations. The means of finance-surplus production, saving, debt, cost
   sharing, etc.-are applied in culturally and historically specific ways
   that have systemic and long-term consequences for adopters. Saltmakers'
   widespread adoption of new technologies in the Late Postclassic (CE
   1350-1521) was enabled by finance at the household scale. In the
   sixteenth century, Indigenous saltmakers adapted existing tools to
   manufacture new products, like saltpeter, for Spanish consumers without
   new financial arrangements. Eighteenth-century innovations in the
   production of saltpeter required equipment that was beyond the financial
   means of most Indigenous saltmakers. Nevertheless, I suggest that some
   saltmakers solved the problem and continued to produce salt and
   saltpeter by expanding their social relations of finance beyond their
   households. These findings show how finance operated in a non-Western,
   preindustrial context and in an economic sphere that was relatively
   independent of the political economies of states and empires.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure to early life adversity (ELA) is associated with increased
   rates of psychopathology and poor physical health. The present study
   builds on foundational work by Megan Gunnar identifying how ELA results
   in poor long-term outcomes through alterations in the stress response
   system, leading to major disruptions in emotional and behavioral
   regulation. Specifically, the present study tested the direct effects of
   ELA against the role of parent socialization to shed light on the
   mechanisms by which ELA leads to emotion regulation deficits. Children
   ages 4-7 years (N = 64) completed interviews about their experiences of
   deprivation and threat, a fear conditioning and extinction paradigm, and
   an IQ test. Parents of the children completed questionnaires regarding
   their own emotion regulation difficulties and psychopathology, their
   children's emotion regulation, and child exposure to adversity. At the
   bivariate level, greater exposure to threat and parental difficulties
   with emotion regulation were associated with poorer emotion regulation
   in children, assessed both via parental report and physiologically. In
   models where parental difficulties with emotion regulation, threat, and
   deprivation were introduced simultaneously, regression results indicated
   that parental difficulties with emotion regulation, but not deprivation
   or threat, continued to predict children's emotion regulation abilities.
   These results suggest that parental socialization of emotion is a robust
   predictor of emotion regulation tendencies in children exposed to early
   adversity.}},

Journal = {{PREVENTIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{141}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Government trust is known to be associated with preventive practices
   during pandemics, but few studies have explored the roles of knowledge
   and negative emotion in conditioning the relationship between trust and
   preventive behaviors. The aim of this study was to explore the roles of
   knowledge and negative emotion in conditioning the relationship between
   trust and preventive measures during the COVID-19 pandemic in China.
   Data from a cross-sectional survey of 3000 Chinese adults {[}mean (SD)
   age 36.93 (12.11) years; 52.4\% male], conducted using quota-sampling
   method (March 2-2020 to March 23-2020), were analyzed. Overall,
   respondents performed recommended preventive measures more frequently
   (3.21 out of 4) than excessive preventive measures (2.11 out of 4).
   Government trust was positively associated with both officially
   recommended (b = 0.12; 95\%CI = 0.18, 0.25) and excessive preventive
   behaviors (b = 0.07; 95\%CI = 0.03, 0.10). The positive relationship
   between trust and excessive preventive behaviors was found to be
   statistically significant only among those with low levels of COVID-19
   knowledge. Officially recommended preventive behavior is most likely to
   happen when there is a combination of high levels of government trust
   and low levels of negative emotion. Therefore, government trust
   increases both official and excessive (sometimes unscientific)
   preventive behaviors. Interventions shall aim to enhance people's
   COVID-19 knowledge and to reduce negative emotions.}},

   Sandblasting for Electronic Display Glass}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Recently, anti-glare (AG) surface treatment technology has been
   considered as a standard process to enhance the visibility of electronic
   display devices. For AG, the hydrofluoric acid (HF)-based chemical etch
   method is the most common approach for the current display glass
   industry. However, in order to overcome the environmental and durability
   degradation problems of the HF-based chemical etch method, this paper
   proposes an eco-friendly physical surface treatment technology using the
   sandblasting method. Based on the preliminary analysis results using the
   central composite design (CCD) method-based response surface modeling
   methodology (RSM), additional experiments and analyses were performed
   for process modeling and optimal process recipe generation. To
   characterize the sandblasting process, the mean value of haze was
   considered as the process output, and the pressure of the nozzle, the
   distance of the nozzle from the surface of glass, the glass feed rate,
   and the grit size of the abrasives were considered as process inputs.
   Based on the process model using the statistical response surface
   regression method and machine learning-based approaches, the proposed
   method can generate optimized process recipes for various haze targets
   of 10\%, 20\%, and 30\%, with an average haze difference of 0.84\%,
   0.02\%, and 0.86\%, and maximum deviations of 1.26\%, 1.14\%, and 1.4\%,
   respectively. Through the successful completion of this work, it is
   expected that the proposed surface treatment method can be applied to
   various products including mobile phones, tablet PCs, and windshields of
   vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Although qualitative studies have been conducted to identify
   barriers and facilitators that influence the pain management of older
   adults with dementia, as far as we know, only a very recent study
   (Andrews et al., 2019) has used participatory action research (PAR) as a
   methodology for studying pain management. It allows nurses to examine
   and improve their practice based on their realities and within their
   context.
   Aim: To reflect on nursing practice and identify facilitators and
   barriers in the management of pain in older adults with dementia and to
   propose actions for improvement.
   Design: We used qualitative participatory action research.
   Participants/Settings: Ten nurses from the geriatric acute care unit of
   a university hospital in Spain were recruited through convenience
   sampling. Methods: Data were generated through a written questionnaire
   and three focus groups.
   Results: One of the main facilitators the participants identified was
   professional experience. The main barriers they identified were lack of
   knowledge and skills and lack of time. The participants proposed two
   main improvements: (1) a training program consisting of three courses
   (pain evaluation and management, dementia and pain, and pharmacology)
   and (2) the creation of a specific register for nurses to record
   patients' pain.
   Conclusions: Involving nurses directly in research on their practices
   can result in precise proposals for improvements based on their needs
   and oriented toward improving the quality of care. Moreover, our results
   confirm previous findings in other countries. (C) 2020 American Society

Abstract = {{Royal jelly (RJ) is known as an important functional foodstuff that
   promotes several health benefits and contains various bioactive
   substances, including major royal jelly proteins (MRJPs). Among the
   MRJPs, MRJP3 possesses both cell proliferation and wound healing
   effects. As the carboxyl domain of MRJP3 contains tandem penta-peptide
   repeat (TPR) sequences unique to MRJP3 among the MRJPs, we purified the
   TPRs as glutathione- S-transferase (GST)-fusion proteins and
   demonstrated their dose-dependent effects on THP-1 and Vero cell
   proliferation. The GST-TPR protein with 19 repeats (GST-TPR19) showed
   cell proliferative activity equivalent to MRJP3 and higher than
   GST-TPR6. GST-TPR19 also exhibited wound healing activity at a level
   similar to MRJP3. Digestion of GST-TPR19 with trypsin had no effect on
   its cell proliferative activity, suggesting that the main digested
   products; i.e., penta-peptides (Q-N-x-N-{[}K/R]), maintain the cell
   proliferative ability of MRJP3. In conclusion, the TPRs of MRJP3 are
   critical to the beneficial effect(s) of RJ.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN PUBLIC LAW}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{679-704}},

Abstract = {{Focusing on the current regulation of conflicts of interest in public
   procurement by Directive 2014/24/EU we try to answer two main questions:
   (1) what is the core content of its regulation and which implications
   does it have in daily public procurement activity; and (2) whether this
   core content and the way it is materialized in Directive 2014/24/EU
   leaves any leeway to Member States law to modify or create new conflict
   of interests provisions. The first part of the article is devoted to the
   analysis of the `conflict of interest' concept under the procurement
   Directive, concluding that it rests on three fundamental pillars: (a) a
   broad and functional subjective application based on the objective
   nature of the phenomenon; (b) a transfer of power (and responsibility)
   to the contracting entities; and (c) the strong relevance of the
   principle of proportionality. This new concept of conflict of interest
   at EU level and the recent CJEU case law in the field suggest a
   reduction of Member States' deference in the transposition of optional
   exclusion grounds. In the present article, the case of Spain is used as
   an example to illustrate how the interpretative implications of the
   current EU framework do not leave virtually any margin to Member States
   to adapt the conflict of interests provisions to national legal
   traditions.}},

Title = {{Analysis of mgrB gene mutations in colistin-resistant Klebsiella
   pneumoniae in Tehran, Iran}},
Journal = {{GENE REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: The emergence of multiple drug resistance (MDR) Klebsiella
   pneumoniae (KP) is a public health concern. Colistin is used as a
   last-resort treatment option for MDR-KP. The emergence of
   colistin-resistant isolates is a major public health challenge. The aim
   of this study was to explore genes and the responsible mechanisms of
   colistin resistance in MDR-KP isolates in Tehran, Iran.
   Methods: 94 KP isolates suspected to be colistin-resistant (by disc
   diffusion) from urine, sputum, blood collected between 2018 and 2019
   were studied. Isolates were tested for antibiotic resistance
   determinants and their colistin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).
   The presence of beta-lactamase and quinolone genes, plasmidencoded
   resistance genes, mcr-1 and mcr-2 genes, and nucleotide sequences of
   mgrB were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
   Results: 20 of 94 isolates were colistin resistance KP (Col-R KP) (21\%)
   with MIC ranged from 4 to 128 mu g/ml. Coproduction of beta-lactamases,
   and quinolones was in 18 (90\%) Col R KP isolates. Four (20\%) isolates
   had mutations in mgrB. mgrB was inactivated by nonsense mutations at
   codons 21 and insertion of IS 903B elements (IS5); and elongation of
   mgrB. 16 (80\%) ColR KP isolates harbored wild type of mgrB. There is
   not any mcr-1, mcr-2 encoding genes on plasmids among all the isolates.
   Conclusion: We detected a high frequency of both qnr and ESBL resistance
   genes among colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae. Also, colistin resistance
   mainly occur with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) modification by different
   mechanisms. Spread of resistance against colistin resulting in treatment
   failure the colistin-included therapy regimen which is used as a last
   line of defense against infection due to MDR Gram-negative pathogens.
   The control of usage of colistin in hospital is necessary to prevent the
   spread of resistance among isolates.}},

Abstract = {{The `16Up' study conducted at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research
   Institute from January 2014 to December 2018 aimed to examine the
   physical and mental health of young Australian twins aged 16-18 years (N
   = 876; 371 twin pairs and 18 triplet sets). Measurements included online
   questionnaires covering physical and mental health as well as
   information and communication technology (ICT) use, actigraphy, sleep
   diaries and hair samples to determine cortisol concentrations. Study
   participants generally rated themselves as being in good physical (79\%)
   and mental (73\%) health and reported lower rates of psychological
   distress and exposure to alcohol, tobacco products or other substances
   than previously reported for this age group in the Australian
   population. Daily or near-daily online activity was almost universal
   among study participants, with no differences noted between males and
   females in terms of frequency or duration of internet access. Patterns
   of ICT use in this sample indicated that the respondents were more
   likely to use online information sources for researching physical health
   issues than for mental health or substance use issues, and that they
   generally reported partial levels of satisfaction with the mental health
   information they found online. This suggests that internet-based mental
   health resources can be readily accessed by adolescent Australians, and
   their computer literacy augurs well for future access to online health
   resources. In combination with other data collected as part of the
   ongoing Brisbane Longitudinal Twin Study, the 16Up project provides a
   valuable resource for the longitudinal investigation of genetic and
   environmental contributions to phenotypic variation in a variety of
   human traits.}},

Abstract = {{Cortico-striatal projections are critical components of forebrain
   circuitry that regulate motivated behaviors. To enable the study of the
   human cortico-striatal pathway and how its dysfunction leads to
   neuropsychiatric disease, we developed a method to convert human
   pluripotent stem cells into region-specific brain organoids that
   resemble the developing human striatum and include electrically active
   medium spiny neurons. We then assembled these organoids with cerebral
   cortical organoids in three-dimensional cultures to form
   cortico-striatal assembloids. Using viral tracing and functional assays
   in intact or sliced assembloids, we show that cortical neurons send
   axonal projections into striatal organoids and form synaptic
   connections. Medium spiny neurons mature electrophysiologically
   following assembly and display calcium activity after optogenetic
   stimulation of cortical neurons. Moreover, we derive cortico-striatal
   assembloids from patients with a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a
   deletion on chromosome 22q13.3 and capture disease-associated defects in
   calcium activity, showing that this approach will allow investigation of
   the development and functional assembly of cortico-striatal connectivity
   using patient-derived cells.
   Organoids representing the human striatum are generated and used to
   build circuits in cortico-striatal assembloids.}},

Title = {{Effect of fine powder particles on quality of binder jetting parts}},
Journal = {{ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{36}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Despite their desired effects on quality metrics of powder metallurgy
   parts, fine powder materials are rarely used in powder-based additive
   manufacturing as powder feedstock materials due to their poor
   flowability and inefficient layer recoating. As such,
   process-structure-property relationships of powder-based AM processes
   have been explored primarily for coarse powder particle sizes (i.e., 25
   mu m-150 mu m in diameter). With the new developments in powder
   recoating systems in modern binder jetting additive manufacturing
   (BJ-AM) printers, it seems now feasible to process fine powder materials
   that have average particle size of similar to 10 mu m (or smaller). In
   the current research, the use of fine copper powders (average particle
   size of 5 mu m) in BJ process and its effects on green and final part
   properties are experimentally investigated. Specially, the authors
   studied the effects of different powder recoating settings on the
   density of printed green parts. The density of the sintered parts was
   also explored for various sintering parameters (i.e., heating rate and
   peak sintering temperature). Linear/volumetric shrinkage, microstructure
   and mechanical characteristics of sintered specimens were explored, and
   the results were compared to those of copper specimens made via coarse
   powder materials. The results indicated that fine copper powder resulted
   in parts with properties (UTS of 179.4 MPa and elongation of 42.2 \%)
   greater than bimodal powder parts, which in turn eliminates extra time
   and work needed for powder mixing ratio optimization and blending
   process.}},

Abstract = {{In pathogenic fungi and oomycetes, interspecific hybridization may lead
   to the formation of new species having a greater impact on natural
   ecosystems than the parental species. From the early 1990s, a severe
   alder (Alnus spp.) decline due to an unknown Phytophthora species was
   observed in several European countries. Genetic analyses revealed that
   the disease was caused by the triploid hybrid P. x alni, which
   originated in Europe from the hybridization of P. uniformis and P. x
   multiformis. Here, we investigated the population structure of P. x alni
   (158 isolates) and P. uniformis (85 isolates) in several European
   countries using microsatellite markers. Our analyses confirmed the
   genetic structure previously observed in other European populations,
   with P. uniformis populations consisting of at most two multilocus
   genotypes (MLGs) and P. x alni populations dominated by MLG Pxa-1. The
   genetic structure of P. x alni populations in the Czech Republic,
   Hungary and Sweden seemed to reflect the physical isolation of river
   systems. Most rare P. x alni MLGs showed a loss of heterozygosity (LOH)
   at one or a few microsatellite loci compared with other MLGs. This LOH
   may allow a stabilization within the P. x alni genome or a rapid
   adaptation to stress situations. Alternatively, alleles may be lost
   because of random genetic drift in small, isolated populations, with no
   effect on fitness of P. x alni. Additional studies would be necessary to
   confirm these patterns of population diversification and to better
   understand the factors driving it.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this research was to evaluate a polymeric system, including
   biopolymers, as a multi-component material coating on paperboard for
   bread. The main aim of the research was to create a humidity-controlling
   packaging material. This means that the packaging material should
   contain filler which will absorb water or water vapour from the bread.
   The ideal packaging should have high barrier qualities against water
   vapour, enabling the possible release of water from the product (to
   maintain proper humidity inside the packaging). The preliminary storage
   tests made of the bread confirmed that the freshness of a product kept
   in a climatic chamber in RH = 70\% was the highest. To summarise, the
   obtained packaging should maintain the required humidity (in the case of
   bread, the optimal humidity is 70\%) within the packaging to keep the
   bread fresh after more than 72 h of storage. A ``sandwich{''} form of
   (multilayer) packaging was indicated as a solution to this problem. The
   main objective of this packaging was to obtain two paper layers and one
   starch layer to increase water absorption from the bread. It was also
   important to obtain a thin, external hydrophobic layer to decrease the
   water vapour transmission rate of the packaging (WVTR). A number of
   `'sandwich{''} packaging types were prepared, consisting of two sheets
   of paper with an external aquaseal coating and an internal starch
   coating (with a NaCl filler). The covered `'sandwich{''} papers were
   then used to create packaging that could be used for the bread storage
   tests. The study results confirmed that the bread stored for 72 h in the
   ``sandwich{''} packaging was found to be fresher than the same product
   stored in commercial paper packaging.}},

Title = {{Using a Stochastic Agent Model to Optimize Performance in Divergent
   Interest Tacit Coordination Games}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In recent years collaborative robots have become major market drivers in
   industry 5.0, which aims to incorporate them alongside humans in a wide
   array of settings ranging from welding to rehabilitation. Improving
   human-machine collaboration entails using computational algorithms that
   will save processing as well as communication cost. In this study we
   have constructed an agent that can choose when to cooperate using an
   optimal strategy. The agent was designed to operate in the context of
   divergent interest tacit coordination games in which communication
   between the players is not possible and the payoff is not symmetric. The
   agent's model was based on a behavioral model that can predict the
   probability of a player converging on prominent solutions with salient
   features (e.g., focal points) based on the player's Social Value
   Orientation (SVO) and the specific game features. The SVO theory
   pertains to the preferences of decision makers when allocating joint
   resources between themselves and another player in the context of
   behavioral game theory. The agent selected stochastically between one of
   two possible policies, a greedy or a cooperative policy, based on the
   probability of a player to converge on a focal point. The distribution
   of the number of points obtained by the autonomous agent incorporating
   the SVO in the model was better than the results obtained by the human
   players who played against each other (i.e., the distribution associated
   with the agent had a higher mean value). Moreover, the distribution of
   points gained by the agent was better than any of the separate
   strategies the agent could choose from, namely, always choosing a greedy
   or a focal point solution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
   first attempt to construct an intelligent agent that maximizes its
   utility by incorporating the belief system of the player in the context
   of tacit bargaining. This reward-maximizing strategy selection process
   based on the SVO can also be potentially applied in other human-machine
   contexts, including multiagent systems.}},

Title = {{A Novel Air Quality Evaluation Paradigm Based on the Fuzzy Comprehensive
   Theory}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Air pollution is a prominent problem all over the world, seriously
   endangering human life. To protect the environment and human health,
   timely and accurate air quality evaluations are imperative. Recently,
   with the increasing focus on air pollution, an evaluation tool that can
   offer intuitive air quality information is especially needed. Though the
   Air Quality Index (AQI) has played this role over the years, its
   intrinsic limitations discussed in this study (sharp boundary, biased
   evaluation, conservative strategy and incomplete criterion) are
   gradually apparent, limiting its air quality evaluation capability.
   Therefore, a novel paradigm, the Air Quality Fuzzy Comprehensive
   Evaluation (AQFCE), is proposed. In the preprocessing module, missing
   and reversal data are handled by a least square piecewise polynomial
   fitting and linear regression. An improved fuzzy comprehensive
   evaluation model is adopted to solve the AQI's above limitations in the
   evaluation module. The early warning module provides a timely alert and
   recommendation. To validate the performance of the AQFCE, Beijing,
   Shanghai and Xi'an in China are selected for case studies, and daily and
   hourly concentration data of six conventional air pollutants from
   September 2018 to August 2019 are employed. For daily reports, the AQFCE
   and AQI have a high consistent rate and correlation coefficient
   regarding chief pollutants and levels, respectively, while examples show
   the level of the AQFCE is more reasonable. For hourly reports, AQI has
   antinomies and cannot reflect actual pollution, but the AQFCE is still
   effective. Current major pollutants, ``weekend and holiday effect{''}
   and ``peak type{''} of pollution are also revealed by the AQFCE.
   Experiment results prove that the AQFCE is accurate under different
   pollution conditions and an important supplement to the AQI.
   Furthermore, the AQFCE can provide health guideline for the public and
   assist the government in making environmental decisions and development
   policies.}},

Title = {{Accuracy and homogeneity of total mixed rations processed through
   trailer mixer or self-propelled mixer, and effects on the yields of
   high-yielding dairy cows}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{270}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Total mixed ration (TMR) quality depends on feed levels and values, and
   appropriate diet formulation, but also on diet preparation practice. We
   examined the accuracy and homogeneity of rations, as affected by the
   machinery used for TMR preparation, and their effects on dairy cow
   performance. Multiparous Israeli-Holstein cows (n = 216) were stratified
   into 2 groups, according to milk yields, days in milk, parity, and body
   weight; they were fed the same formulated TMR, prepared by either a
   trailer mixer (TM) or an self-propelled loading mixer (SPLM). To examine
   the accuracy of diet preparation we have recorded and analyzed 10 times
   the difference between the programmed and the actual loaded content (as
   fed matter) of each feed ingredient. For evaluation of the accuracy and
   homogeneity of the ration contents, the TMRs from 6 spots along the
   feeding trough were sampled at 10 time-points, and the samples were
   analyzed for DM, protein, ADF, aNDF and ash contents; the results were
   compared with the programmed values. On another 7 occasions, samples of
   the TMRs were taken from 3spots along the feeding trough for evaluation
   of the particle sizes distribution using the Penn State Particle
   Separator. The mean difference - in percentage units - between the
   programmed and actual, loaded concentrate feeds was similar (similar to
   5.7 \%) for both TMRs (SEM = 1.5; P = 0.98), but for forage feeds it was
   +17.6 and 0.6 \% (SEM = 3.7; P = 0.001), for TM and SPLM TMR,
   respectively. The mean differences of contents (in percentage units; DM
   basis) between the programmed and prepared diets, were: for protein -
   1.1 and 0.9 \% (SEM = 0.2, P = 0.25), for ADF - 2.7 and 1.3 \% (SEM =
   0.2, P < 0.001), and for aNDF - 6.9 and 5.7 \% (SEM = 0.2; P 0.002), in
   TM and SPLM TMRs, respectively. Except for ash content, the
   chemical-composition homogeneity was greater in the SPLM TMR than in the
   TM TMR. The fraction of particles 19 mm was 2.9 percentage units greater
   (P = 0.04), and that of particles <= 8 mm was 3.3 percentage units less
   (P = 0.04) in the TM than in the SPLM ration. The milk yield was 1.2
   kg/d greater (2.7 \%) in cows fed the SPLM than in those fed the TM TMR
   (P < 0.001), and the milk-fat content was 0.8 g/kg greater in cows fed
   the TM TMR (P = 0.03). In conclusion, the accuracy and homogeneity of
   the SPLM-prepared TMR were greater than those of the TM-prepared TMR,
   which influenced the cows' performance. This study demonstrates the
   importance of the preparation machinery for TMR quality, indicating that
   more attention should be dedicated in practice and research to the
   methods used for TMR preparation.}},

Title = {{An alternative approach for the decontamination of hospital settings}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Background: The increasing emergence and spread of multiresistant
   microorganisms in hospital wards is a serious concern. Traditional
   protocols are often not sufficient to protect patients susceptible to
   serious and life-threatening infections, therefore new strategies for
   decontaminating hospital environments are crucial to reducing microbial
   transmission and the spread the nosocomial infections. The adoption of
   modern technologies is indicated to supplement traditional methods and
   to improve desired levels of surface disinfection.
   Aim: This work aims to report the development, implementation, and
   validation of cleansing and sanitizing procedure for critical clinical
   settings through the innovative use of disposable cloths pre-impregnated
   with solutions containing different active formulations and biocidal
   agents, relating to the areas to be treated (low, moderate, high-risk).
   Methods: The implementation and validation of the sanitizing system were
   conducted in different wards of two healthcare structures. The protocol
   for the study involved a structured selection of representative
   surfaces, such as the floor, bathroom, desk, and beds. Microbiological
   analyses were performed according to ISO 4833-1:2013.
   Findings: The efficiency of the proposed system was measured through the
   estimation of total microbial count values on the different surfaces
   before and after the sanitization operations by traditional methods and
   by the system described here. The results demonstrated a significant
   reduction in the microbial count that always fell below the threshold
   value. For the analyzed surfaces such as shower tray, bathroom floor,
   toilet edge, the traditional system had an effectiveness of less than
   10\%, whereas pre-impregnated cloths succeed to eliminate about 90\% of
   the bacteria present. As an example, on the floor we observed a
   microbial count reduction from >42 to 10 CFU/11 cm(2) with the new
   method (76\% of colonies were destroyed), while with the traditional one
   we have a reduction from >42 to 28 CFU/11 cm(2) (33\% of microbial
   colonies).
   Moreover, the advantages of using this sanitization system are not
   limited to disinfecting surfaces and limiting cross-contamination but
   involve all activities related to the cleaning and disinfection
   operations, including the training and education of the operators and
   traceability of the operations.
   Conclusions: The innovative disinfection and cleaning protocol used in
   the present study proved to be a highly valuable alternative to the
   traditional cleaning procedures in healthcare settings for the
   sanitizing process of all kinds of surfaces. All tools were specifically
   designed to improve disinfection efficiency and to reduce the problems
   associated with traditional methods, such as preventing
   cross-contamination events, limiting the physical efforts of operators,
   and avoiding incorrect practices. Our findings add support to the
   knowledge that an effective sanitization procedure is critical in
   minimizing microorganisms' transmission and cross-contamination. (C)

Title = {{The Influence of Pillar Displacements on Geodetic Measurements}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper deals with the effects that displacements of the measuring
   pillar have on precise geodetic measurements. The changes in the
   position of the control points on the object or its surroundings can
   only be determined with well stabilized and stable reference points.
   These points are usually stabilized with measuring pillars which are not
   always constructed in an optimal manner. If they are placed in a dark
   tube with a high absorption factor, solar heating on one side of the
   pillar can cause the pillar to deflect considerably due to the
   temperature difference on the two sides of the pillar. This paper
   presents the influence of such a displacement, if the pillar is a survey
   point, orientation point, or control point. We show that even small
   displacement of the survey point can have important influence on all
   measurements and that the error in some cases significantly increases,
   e.g., if the standard deviations of the coordinates of the survey point
   are 1 mm and their covariance is assumed to be zero, the standard
   deviation of the distance between measured and exact position of the
   control point exceeds the value of 2.2 mm.}},

Title = {{Zinc phthalocyanine tetrasulfonate-loaded polyelectrolytic PLGA
   nanoparticles for photodynamic therapy applications}},
Journal = {{PHOTODIAGNOSIS AND PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{32}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) is a modality for the treatment
   of neoplastic tissues, which is based on the administration of a
   phototherapeutic agent and light irradiation at an appropriate
   wavelength, aiming to locate and destroy the target cell with the
   formation of reactive oxygen species. Nanoencapsulation technology
   presents itself as a tool for incorporation of bioactive substances
   aiming to improve their solubility in physiological environment, obtain
   a longer circulation time in the organism, administration of lower
   dosages and the minimization of side effects. The present work aimed at
   the development of poly (lactic acid-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles
   coated with polyelectrolyte film layers for encapsulating zinc
   phthalocyanine tetrasulfonated (ZnPcSO4) as a bioactive substance model.
   Methods: PLGA nanoparticles were produced by the double emulsion/solvent
   evaporation technique and poly electrolytic coating was performed using
   polyalkylamine hydrochloride (PAH) as a weak polycation and poly
   (4-styrene sulfonate) (PSS) as a strong polyanion by layer-by-layer
   self-assembly technique (known as layer-bylayer-LbL). The
   nanoparticulate system was studied by scanning electron microscopy,
   steady-state, and their biological activity was evaluated using in vitro
   cancer cell lines by classical MTT assay.
   Results: The polyelectrolytic PLGA nanoparticles had an average diameter
   of 384.7 +/- 138.6 nm, restricted distribution size with a
   polydispersity index. The obvious change in zeta potential indicates
   successful alternation in polycation (PAH) and polyanion (PSS)
   deposition directly in PLGA nanoparticles. Scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM) analysis showed that the formed system had morphology spherical,
   typical of these release systems. The loading efficiency was 82.1 \% +/-
   1.2 \%. The polyelectrolytic nanoparticles loaded with phthalocyanine
   maintained their photophysical behavior after encapsulation. Cell
   viability was determined, obtaining 90 \% cell death.
   Conclusions: Therefore, the presented work depicts ZnPcSO4-loaded
   polyelectrolytic PLGA nanoparticles as a promise drug delivery system
   for phototherapeutic agent, which are thus expected to have superior
   therapeutic efficiency than free drug.}},

Title = {{Comparison of multi-source satellite data for quantifying water quality
   parameters in a mining environment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{591}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Population growth and associated anthropogenic activities such as mining
   are posing a major threat to water resources. Remote sensing provides
   valuable information for assessing and monitoring water quality and
   quantity, and thus supports sustainable water management. Several
   studies have demonstrated the utility of various remote sensing
   techniques for quantifying water quality parameters, however, more needs
   to be done to exploit the growing number of satellite sensors available
   to the public. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the
   performances of individual and combined bands of Landsat 8 OLI,
   Sentinel-2 MSI, ASTER and SPOT 6 data as predictors of water quality
   parameters of open water bodies in a mining area. We applied the
   all-subsets regression approach to explore all possible candidate models
   from which selection was made based on Akaike's Information Criterion
   (AIC), coefficient of determination (adjR2) and Root-Mean-Squared-Error
   (RMSE). Two secondary objectives that make use of the products of the
   all-subsets regression approach were added in the study. This included
   comparison of a parsimonious model containing few predictors with the
   model that was ranked the best but containing more predictors; and
   comparison of models consisting of similar bands across sensors per
   water quality parameter. In general, all sensors yielded promising
   estimation accuracies, particularly for SAR, permanent hardness and
   cations (RMSE < 50\% of observed means). Sentinel-2 bands produced the
   best estimations followed by Landsat 8 bands for most water quality
   parameters, chiefly due to the greater number of bands these sensors
   possess compared to ASTER and SPOT 6 sensors. All sensors provided
   alternative models that used fewer predicting bands than the best-ranked
   models (lowest AIC) and still showed comparable accuracies with the
   lowest AIC models for most variables (Pearson's correlation, r up to
   0.9). Sentinel-2, in particular, had the most accurate, parsimonious
   models compared to the other sensors. Pairwise cross-sensor comparison
   of estimation models using similar bands revealed the best matches when
   a model consisted of blue band only (r > 0.95) for most parameters while
   the similarity decreased as the number of predicting bands increased.
   Furthermore, the best similarities were obtained between Sentinel-2 and
   Landsat 8 sensors compared to the other pairs, indicating the potential
   of replacing one in the absence of the other. The findings of this study
   showed the advantage of commonly used remotely-sensed data for
   estimating, and by extension monitoring, water quality parameters in
   open water bodies. In addition, the results revealed that few, specific
   bands carry information relevant to characterise most of the water
   quality parameters considered in the study. We recommend similar studies
   for different seasons, considering the need to monitor water quality
   throughout the year.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Acinetobacter baumannii, a multidrug-resistant
   Gram-negative opportunist has been known among the cause of nosocomial
   infection. Risk factors of infection related to A. baumannii have been
   reported elsewhere. This study aimed to find the association of A.
   baumannii positive culture and invasive procedures in patients
   hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit and Hospital ward in Jakarta.
   Methodology: This study was a retrospective, 1:1 matched case-control
   study with total sampling method from in-patients in the ICU and the
   Internal Medicine Wards (IMW) of a Private Hospital, North Jakarta in
   2015 - 2018. Data retrieved were positive culture of A. baumannii.
   Positive cultures of multi-sensitive bacteria were included as a control
   group. Antibiotic susceptibility test was carried out as recommended by
   Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.
   Results: A total of 88 in-patients were studied, and A. baumannii
   isolates were identified from 44 patients. Most of A. baumannii showed
   resistant to almost all antibiotics tested, except for colistin.
   Bivariate analysis showed a significant association of A. baumannii
   positive culture and the use of ventilator in the ICU (p = 0,039), and
   with urinary catheters in the IMW (p = 0,022). Multivariate analysis
   showed that length of stay also has a significant association to A.
   baumannii positive culture in the ICU.
   Conclusions: The use of ventilators and urinary catheters showed a
   significant association with Acinetobacter baumannii positive culture in
   patients in the ICU and in the IMW respectively. All of the A. baumannii
   isolates were susceptible to colistin.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, a low-frequency hybrid modulation technique which is
   composed of a phase shift-pulsewidth modulation (PS-PWM) and an
   asymmetric selective harmonic current mitigation-PWM (ASHCM-PWM) are
   proposed for cascaded multilevel converters to meet the harmonic limit
   of IEEE 519 2014. In the proposed technique, the harmonics within the
   concerned frequency range due to PS-PWM are reduced by the ASHCM-PWM so
   that the cascaded H-bridge (CHB) converter can meet IEEE 519 harmonic
   limit. The equation set which helps a grid-tied CHB converter meet both
   harmonic limit and total demand distortion, is developed. The design
   technique for critical parameters, such as the inductance and the
   switching frequency of the proposed hybrid modulation technique, is
   developed. Simulation and experiments are conducted on a single-phase
   3-cell 7-level grid-tied CHB converter to validate the proposed
   technique.}},

Abstract = {{The current study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of dietary
   nucleotides-supplementation on broiler chickens to alleviate the
   intestinal Clostridium perfringens ( C. perfringens) levels and its
   adverse effect on gut and growth performance parameters. In this study,
   a total of 270 one-day-old mixed broiler chicks (Cobb 500) were randomly
   divided into six treatment groups with three replicates of 15 chicks/
   replicate. Treatment 1 (CX), a negative control group was fed
   corn-soybean basal diet without added nucleotides. Treatment 2 (CN 0.05)
   and treatment 3 (CN 0.1), consisted of chicks were fed the basal diet
   with the addition of nucleotides on top at two levels (0.05 and 0.1\%)
   respectively. Treatment 4 (PX), treatment 5 (PN 0.05), and treatment 6
   (PN 0.1) consisted of chicks that were challenged with C. perfringens
   inoculum (similar to 4 x 10(8) CFU/ml) on day 14, 15, 16 and 17of the
   experiment and were fed diets similar to treatments 1, 2, and 3
   respectively. The trial continued for 35 days. At the end of the
   experiment, the intestinal C. perfringens counts, microscopic lesion
   scores, intestinal histomorphology, intestinal barriers (occludin and
   mucin mRNA expression) and growth parameters were determined. The
   results showed that the pathogen challenge significantly (P<0.05)
   increased both C. perfringens levels and intestinal lesion scores. Which
   adversely affects intestinal barriers and intestinal histomorphology
   resulting in a significant decrease (P<0.05) in body weight gain (BWG)
   with an increase in feed conversion ratio (FCR). Whereas,
   nucleotides-supplementation, at 0.1\%, significantly decreased both C.
   perfringens levels and intestinal lesion scores, and significantly
   improved intestinal barriers and intestinal histomorphology which
   consequently resulted in improved growth performance parameters to be
   nearly the same as that of the control un-supplemented group. In
   conclusion, nucleotides markedly ameliorated the negative effects of C.
   perfringens challenge by improving the intestinal barrier function and
   intestinal histomorphology which positively reflected on the growth
   performance of challenged birds.}},

   polybenzoxazine nanocomposites: Synthesis, characterization, and use for
   corrosion protection on mild steel}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{25}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we synthesized and investigated bisbenzylidene
   cyclopentanone and cyclohexanone-functionalized polybenzoxazine
   nanocomposites as anti-corrosion coatings. The chemical structures of
   CP-BZ and CH-BZ were confirmed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
   spectroscopy and H-1 and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
   Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed that the thermal
   polymerization temperature of the uncured CH-BZ (198 degrees C) was
   significantly lower than that of the monomer
   3-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-benzoxazine (263 degrees C). We used DSC and
   FTIR spectroscopy to study the curing behavior of these monomers. The
   degradation temperature of poly(CH-BZ) (326 degrees C) was higher than
   that poly(CP-BZ) (249 degrees C), based on thermogravimetric analysis.
   We used solution dispersion and thermal ring-opening polymerization to
   prepare a new class of bisbenzylidene-based polybenzoxazine (PBZ; CP-BZ
   or CH-BZ) composites with epoxidized soybean oil (E-SBO; 10 or 20 wt\%)
   and E-SBO/bentonite (nanoclay; 3 or 5 wt\%) for use as
   corrosion-protection coatings for mild steel (MS). We employed
   salt-spray and electrochemical measurements to investigate the influence
   of the epoxy and nanoclay contents, respectively, on the
   corrosion-resistance of these coatings. A 20 wt\% epoxy content in the
   PBZ/E-SBO coatings provided corrosion-resistance superior to those of
   pure PBZs. Furthermore, the addition of 20 wt\% E-SBO and 3 wt\% of
   nanoclay decreased the corrosion rate by one order of magnitude (2.653 x
   10(-3) mm year(-1)) when compared with that of pure poly(CH-BZ) (1.292 x
   10(-2) mm year(-1)) and two orders of magnitude when compared with
   blank(MS) (1.094 x 10(-1) mm year(-1)) with protection efficiency (98.16
   \%), revealing markedly increased barrier properties of the composite
   coatings towards corrosive species. Thus, these materials function as
   excellent corrosion-resistance coatings for MS.}},

Abstract = {{High concentration photovoltaic (HCPV) technologies offer several
   advantages over typical PV systems. In this study, a detailed economic
   assessment and sensitivity analysis of deploying HCPV plants in the US
   southwest is performed. To do this, a 20 MWdc HCPV power plant is
   designed using the System Advisor Model (SAM) and is evaluated from both
   technical and financial aspects. The sensitivity analysis shows that
   reducing the installed cost per capacity of the HCPV system can
   significantly improve the economics and reduce the levelized cost of
   electricity (LCOE) and levelized power purchase agreement (LPPA). Also,
   providing proper incentives including both investment tax credits (ITC)
   and production tax credit (PTC), loan debt ratio, and interest rate are
   among the most influential parameters. The analysis shows that with the
   30\% ITC, the LCOE, and LPPA of the designed HCPV projects are between
   \$65.4/MWh and \$69.3/MWh and between \$71.0/MWh and \$75.2/MWh,
   respectively. The estimated LCOE and LPPA values are almost 50\% higher
   than the utility-scale PV projects. If proper funding is provided to
   continue the support of the HCPV system, they would become more
   economical and competitive with PV plants. Federal and state government
   policies must also be established to advocate HCPV systems.}},

   plants}},
Journal = {{VETERINARY AND ANIMAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A study was conducted to assess grazing behavior (GB), dietary value and
   performance of co-grazing sheep, goats, cattle and camels with initial
   body weights (BW) of 20.6 +/- 2.09, 16.6 +/- 0.97, 96.8 +/- 3.43 and
   162.3 +/- 21.28 kg, respectively. Grazing lasted 16 weeks, using 6
   growing animals per animal species. Animals co-grazed 6 ha of range
   containing grass, forb and browse species. GB observations for position
   and activity were made during day light. In weeks 4, 8 and 14
   hand-plucked forages similar to that being selected by animal species
   were sampled for laboratory evaluation. BW was measured initially and at
   28-days interval. Time allotted for feed consumption (grazing plus
   browsing), ruminating and idle was similar among animal species.
   However, camels and goats spent lower time grazing and higher time
   browsing than sheep and cattle. The CP content of handplucked forages
   was highest for camels (16.8\%), intermediate for sheep (9.3\%) and
   goats (10.2\%) and lowest for cattle (4.5\%); while NDF values took
   opposite trend. The IVDMD contents of forages took the trend of CP
   contents and were 55.8, 51.0, 43.6 and 72.8\% for sheep, goats, cattle
   and camels, respectively. Daily BW gain was 34, 31, 94 and 358 g/day and
   BW change as percentage of initial BW was 19, 22, 11 and 26\% for sheep,
   goats, cattle and camels, respectively, the former was higher for camels
   and the latter was lower for cattle. These results indicated reduced
   dietary overlap among animal species and consequently greater animal
   yield through co-grazing than perhaps could have achieved through
   mono-species grazing.}},

Abstract = {{An n-i-p type of organic-inorganic hybrid bifacial solar cells was
   constructed with a ZnO/polyaniline/NiO (x) heterostructure, in which
   vertically aligned ZnO nanorods (ZnONd) were synthesized by a facile
   electrochemical deposition process and act as an electron-transport
   layer. Semitransparent p-type semiconducting NiO (x) films were utilized
   as a hole-transport layer. Devices based on the ZnONd considerably
   outperform those employing ZnO thin films. The contact and electrical
   properties of NiO (x) can be carefully tuned through controlling the
   deposition parameters as well as surface treatments. Intimate contact
   between NiO (x) with PANI, created by in situ electrochemical
   polymerization, greatly improves the charge movement. Furthermore, an
   O-2-plasma treatment of the NiO (x) film has a significant impact on the
   performance of polyaniline/ZnONd hybrid photovoltaic devices, reflected
   by the enhancement in the fill-factor and efficiency. The power
   conversion efficiency of the ZnONd/PANI/NiO (x) device under the
   optimized O-2 plasma condition can reach up to 2.79\% under AM1.5
   illumination.}},

   patients with sacroiliitis at two year follow-up}},
Journal = {{INTERDISCIPLINARY NEUROSURGERY-ADVANCED TECHNIQUES AND CASE MANAGEMENT}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of the present study is to understand the clinical
   outcomes of a novel hydroxyapatite-coated (HA-coated) titanium screw for
   surgical treatment of SI joint dysfunction.
   Background: The mainstay of therapy for disorders of the sacroiliac (SI)
   joint has been non-operative treatment including activity modification,
   non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and physical therapy. SI joint
   injections provide diagnostic information and occasional durable
   therapeutic benefit. When these modalities fail, sacroiliac joint fusion
   may be recommended.
   Objective: The objective of this study is to describe the clinical
   outcomes of a novel HA-coated titanium screw for surgical treatment of
   SI joint dysfunction.
   Methods: This study is a retrospective Institutional Review Board-exempt
   chart review of 45 consecutive patients who underwent minimally invasive
   SI joint fusion with a novel HA-coated screw system. Patients were
   diagnosed based on North American Spine Society guidelines and
   evidence-based criteria. Clinical assessments were collected, evaluated,
   and compared preoperatively and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months
   postoperatively.
   Results: Mean patient age was 68.8 +/- 9.4 years, and 61.7\% of patients
   were female. Of the 44 patients, nine underwent bilateral SI joint
   fusion, while the remaining were unilateral. Screw size ranged from 10 x
   35 mm to 10 x 50 mm. Mean preoperative visual analog scale (VAS) SI pain
   scores decreased significantly by a mean of 6.1 points at 12 months
   postoperatively (P < 0.001). Mean Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores
   significantly improved from 52.3\% at baseline to 11.3\% at 3-month
   follow-up, 11.5\% at 6 months, 10.9\% at 12 months, and 9.5\% at 24
   months, leading to improvements of 41.0, 40.8, 41.4, and 42.8 points,
   respectively.
   Conclusion: The clinical outcomes of SI joint fusion using an HA-coated
   screw system to treat sacroiliitis demonstrated significant decreases in
   VAS SI and ODI scores at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.}},

Title = {{Are the thyroid and adrenal system alterations linked in depression?}},
Journal = {{PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{122}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) and
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axes have been frequently found in
   major depression. Given that glucocorticoids may inhibit thyrotropin
   (TSH) and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) secretion, it has been
   hypothesized that hypercortisolemia could lead to HPT axis
   abnormalities. So far, data on interactions between the HPA and HPT axes
   in depression remain inconclusive.
   Methods: In order to investigate this issue, we examined circadian
   rhythms of serum TSH and cortisol (sampled at 4 -hly intervals
   throughout a 24 -h span), TSH responses to 0800 h and 2300 h protirelin
   (TRH) tests and cortisol response to dexamethasone suppression test
   (DST) in 145 unmedicated inpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for major
   depressive disorder (MDDs) and 25 healthy hospitalized control subjects
   (HCs).
   Results: The secretion of TSH and cortisol exhibited a significant
   circadian rhythm both in HCs and MDDs. However, compared to HCs, MDDs
   showed: 1) reduced TSH mesor and amplitude values; 2) blunted 2300
   h-Delta TSH and Delta Delta TSH values (i.e. differences between 2300 h
   and 0800 h TRH-TSH responses); and 3) increased cortisol mesor and
   post-DST cortisol values. DST nonsuppresssors (n = 40, 27 \%) showed
   higher cortisol mesor than DST suppressors (n = 105, 73 \%). There was
   no difference between DST suppressors and nonsuppressors in their TSH
   circadian parameters and TRH-TSH responses. In addition, cortisol values
   (circadian and post-DST) were not related to TRH test responses.
   Conclusion: Our results do not confirm a key role for hypercortisolemia
   in the HPT axis dysregulation in depression.}},

Title = {{Performance of Satellite-Based Evapotranspiration Models in Temperate
   Pastures of Southern Chile}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Farmers in the temperate zone of southern Chile have started to irrigate
   historically rainfed pastures during recent years to reduce dairy
   productivity losses against increasingly severe summer droughts. The
   lack of information on pasture water requirements (i.e.,
   evapotranspiration), however, hampers the implementation of efficient
   irrigation programs. Here, we use in-situ observations to evaluate the
   skill of four remote sensing Surface Energy Balance (SEB) models and two
   satellite-based global evapotranspiration products (PML\_V2 and GLEAM)
   to estimate actual evapotranspiration (ETa) of pastures in southern
   Chile during 2014-2017. Daily ETa measured at an evaluation site over
   the period ranges between 1.2 mm and 6.2 mm day(-1) during the growing
   season (October-March), with an annual maximum of about 4.8 mm day(-1)
   in January and a minimum 0.6 mm day(-1) in June. Only the Simplified SEB
   (SEBS) model and its operational variant (SSEBop) and the PML\_V2 global
   evapotranspiration product perform well, capturing 63-79\% of the
   variance of in-situ evapotranspiration with an error between 0.75 mm
   day(-1) and 1.1 mm day(-1). The readily available PML\_V2 product can be
   used as a convenient way to determine average water footprint of
   pastures and the two SEBs models can be implemented to monitor
   irrigation requirements in near-real time from field to regional scales.
   These results demonstrated a high potential of satellite observations
   for monitoring evapotranspiration and quantify the water footprint of
   pastures in southern Chile for a sustainable irrigation practice.}},

Journal = {{SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{Institutional fields are not static, they undergo times of fragmentation
   and times of settlement. Neo-institutional research has long explained
   the settlement of fields as either the effect of political manoeuvring
   of actors, or of discursive activity influencing cultural codes,
   narratives and symbols. But can these processes really be considered in
   isolation? In this paper, we propose to adopt a comprehensive view on
   fields' dynamics, one that embraces the interaction of political and
   discursive manoeuvring to explain how fragmented fields manage to
   settle. To do so, we build on the Gramscian concept of hegemonic
   practices as discursive and political processes that integrate cultural
   equivalence among actors with political alliances based on aligned
   interests. Hegemonic practices align actors in a new historical bloc (a
   new settlement). Through this lens, we interpret the case of the Italian
   State steel privatization (1984-1995) and propose a process model
   explaining what yields fields' dynamics from fragmentation to
   settlement. The model highlights the action of diffused agency in field
   dynamics, thus overcoming the obsolete challenger/incumbent view, and
   the need of becoming a historical bloc for alliances to stabilize a
   field.}},

   aquaporin-5(AQP5), and a ductal cell marker known as cytokeratin
   19(CK19). In the present study, we further explored inductive molecules
   in the conditioned media that led to mMSC reprogramming by
   high-throughput liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry and
   systems biology. Our approach identified ten differentially expressed
   proteins based on their putative roles in salivary gland embryogenesis
   and development. Additionally, systems biology analysis revealed six
   candidate proteins, namely insulin-like growth factor binding protein-7
   (IGFBP7), cysteine-rich, angiogenetic inducer, 61(CYR61), agrin(AGRN),
   laminin, beta 2 (LAMB2), follistatin-like 1(FSTL1), and fibronectin
   1(FN1), for their potential contribution to mMSC transdifferentiation
   during co-culture. To our knowledge, our study is the first in the field
   to identify soluble inductive molecules that drive mMSC into salivary
   progenitors, which crosses lineage boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of a synthesized matrix,

   by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass
   spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) in complex samples such as foodstuff and
   bacterial extracts, is demonstrated. Ultraviolet (UV) absorption along
   with laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI-MS) experiments
   were systematically conducted in positive ion mode under standard Nd:YLF
   laser excitation with the aim of characterizing the matrix in terms of
   wavelength absorption and proton affinity. Besides, the results for
   standard proteins revealed that CPPA significantly enhanced the protein
   signals, reduced the spot-to-spot variability and increased the spot
   homogeneity. The CPPA matrix was successful employed to investigate
   intact microorganisms, milk and seed extracts for protein profiling.
   Compared to conventional matrices such as sinapinic acid (SA),
   alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) and
   4-chloro-alpha-cyanocinnamic acid (CClCA), CPPA exhibited better
   signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios and a uniform response for most examined
   proteins occurring in milk, hazelnut and in intact bacterial cells of E.
   coli. These findings not only provide a reactive proton transfer MALDI
   matrix with excellent reproducibility and sensitivity, but also
   contribute to extending the battery of useful matrices for intact
   protein analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The education sector is undergoing significant challenges in the process
   of transforming learning models in order to face the new requirements of
   our hyper-connected society. Teaching students how to adequately
   interact as active and committed citizens in our knowmadic global
   society is the most challenging task facing educators nowadays.
   Moreover, the university must consider a student's knowledge of digital
   technologies to be able to design new educational models that respond to
   their current needs. The aim of our research is to assess that knowledge
   and the use of digital technologies among college students and the
   relationship this has with their prior academic experience. Data
   collection included a validated ad-hoc questionnaire divided into 16
   categories applied to 757 students of both sexes between 20 and 57 years
   of age. The results show that, irrespective of gender and age, those
   students who have used Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)
   in their secondary education have a better knowledge of how to use them
   to their advantage throughout their university learning process. In
   conclusion, students need to undergo a training in digital skills before
   entering university, so as to equip them with a higher level of digital
   competence.}},

Abstract = {{Lewy body dementia is a common cause of dementia leading to the
   progressive deterioration of cognitive function and motor skills,
   behavioral changes, and loss of autonomy, impairing the quality of life
   of patients and their families. Even though it is the second leading
   cause of neurodegenerative dementia, diagnosis is still challenging, due
   to its heterogenous clinical presentation, especially in the early
   stages of the disease. Accordingly, Lewy body dementia is often
   misdiagnosed and clinically mismanaged. The lack of diagnostic accuracy
   has important implications for patients, given their increased
   susceptibility to the adverse effects of certain drugs, such as
   antipsychotics, which may worsen some symptoms associated with Lewy body
   dementia. Therefore, a specialist consensus based on the analysis of the
   most updated and relevant literature, and on clinical experience, is
   useful to all professionals involved in the care of these patients. This
   work aims to inform and provide recommendations about the best
   diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in Lewy body dementia in Portugal.
   Moreover, we suggest some strategies in order to raise the awareness of
   physicians, policy makers, and the society at large regarding this
   disease.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FUNCTIONAL FOODS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Recently, we have reported cardiovascular protective effects of the
   probiotic kefir in a model of primary hypertension. Now, we evaluated
   the beneficial effects of kefir in a model of secondary hypertension
   under hyperactivation of the renin-angiotensin-system by partially
   clipping one kidney artery (2K1C) for 60 days and compared with Sham
   rats. Maximum levels of arterial pressure were reached 7-14 days
   post-clipping in both 2K1C and 2K1C-Kefir, but after that time the
   values were approximately 20\% lower in 2K1C-Kefir rats. Also, kefir
   attenuated the angiotensin converting enzyme activity
   (intrarenal-40\%/plasma-25\%) preventing the increase of angiotensin II
   in both samples. Isolated aortic rings showed an impaired relaxation to
   acetylcholine in 2K1C (-38\%) compared to the Sham group and this
   difference was attenuated in 2K1C-Kefir rats (similar to 15\%).
   Additional analysis revealed that kefir protected kidney and vascular
   endothelium against the synergistic oxidative stress/angiotensin
   II-axis. Thus, kefir is an effective nutraceutical therapy for
   prevention/treatment of hypertension.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional wisdom was that thermal relics from the epoch of
   reionization (EOR) would vanish swiftly. Recently, however, it was shown
   that these relics can survive to lower redshifts (z similar to 2) than
   previously thought, due to gas at mean density being heated to T similar
   to 3 x 10(4) K by reionization, which is inhomogeneous, and shocks.
   Given the high sensitivities of upcoming Ly alpha forest surveys, this
   effect will be a novel broad-band systematic for cosmological
   application. From the astrophysical point of view, however, the imprint
   of inhomogeneous reionization can shed light on the EOR and cosmic dawn.
   We utilize a hybrid method - which includes two different simulation
   codes capable of handling the huge dynamical range - to show the impact
   of patchy reionization on the Ly alpha forest and its dependence on
   different astrophysical scenarios. We found statistically significant
   deviations in the 1D Ly alpha power spectrum at k = 0.14 cMpc(-1) that
   range from similar to 1 per cent at z = 2 up to almost similar to 20 per
   cent at z = 4. The deviations in the 3D Ly alpha power spectrum, at the
   same wavenumber, are large and range from a few per cent at z = 2 up to
   similar to 50 per cent at z = 4, although these deviations ignore the
   effect of He II reionization and active galactic nucleus feedback at z <
   4. By exploiting different k-dependence of power spectrum among various
   astrophysical scenarios, the effect of patchy reionization on the Ly
   alpha forest power spectrum can open a new window into cosmic
   reionization and possibly cosmic dawn.}},

Abstract = {{The voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 regulates proton fluxes across
   membranes, thereby influencing pH-dependent processes. Plasmacytoid
   dendritic cells (pDCs) require a particularly tight regulation of
   endosomal pH to ensure strong type HFN secretion exclusively during
   infection, avoiding autoimmunity. However, whether Hv1 is important for
   pH control in pDCs is presently unknown. In this study, we show that
   mouse pDCs require Hv1 to achieve potent type HFN responses after the
   recognition of foreign DNA by endosomal TLR9. Genetic disruption of
   Hvcn1, which encodes Hv1, impaired mouse pDC activation by CpG
   oligonucleotides in vitro and in vivo, reducing IFN-alpha secretion and
   the induction of IFN-stimulated genes. Mechanistically, Hven1 deficiency
   delayed endosomal acidification and enhanced intracellular reactive
   oxygen species production, consequently limiting protease activity and
   TLR9 signaling. Our study reveals a critical role of Hv1 during innate
   immune responses and places this channel as a key modulator of type HFN
   production, the hallmark function of pDCs, commending Hv1 as an
   attractive target for modulating type HFN-driven autoimmunity.}},

Abstract = {{Warming-induced microbial decomposition of organic matter in permafrost
   soils constitutes a climate-change feedback of uncertain magnitude.
   While physicochemical constraints on soil functioning are relatively
   well understood, the constraints attributable to microbial community
   composition remain unclear. Here we show that biogeochemical processes
   in permafrost can be impaired by missing functions in the microbial
   community-functional limitations-probably due to environmental filtering
   of the microbial community over millennia-long freezing. We inoculated
   Yedoma permafrost with a functionally diverse exogenous microbial
   community to test this mechanism by introducing potentially missing
   microbial functions. This initiated nitrification activity and increased
   CO2 production by 38\% over 161 days. The changes in soil functioning
   were strongly associated with an altered microbial community
   composition, rather than with changes in soil chemistry or microbial
   biomass. The present permafrost microbial community composition thus
   constrains carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical processes, but microbial
   colonization, likely to occur upon permafrost thaw in situ, can
   alleviate such functional limitations. Accounting for functional
   limitations and their alleviation could strongly increase our estimate
   of the vulnerability of permafrost soil organic matter to decomposition
   and the resulting global climate feedback.
   Carbon dioxide emissions from permafrost thaw are substantially enhanced
   by relieving microbial functional limitations, according to incubation
   experiments on Yedoma permafrost.}},

Title = {{Slug is a novel molecular target for head and neck squamous cell
   carcinoma stem-like cells}},
Journal = {{ORAL ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{111}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: The acquisition of stem-like phenotype is partly attributed
   to the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Thus, the
   activation of factors involved in EMT can be linked to cancer stem cell
   genesis. However, the underlying mechanisms in head and neck squamous
   cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remain largely unknown. Herein, we investigate
   whether slug, one of the major effectors of EMT, affects the stemness of
   HNSCC cells.
   Methods: We performed in vitro experiments to determine whether slug
   gene manipulation can influence the stemness phenotypes, including the
   capacity for self-renewal, expression of putative stemness markers,
   chemoresistance, and invasion in HNSCC cells. Further, we identified
   whether Slug knockout attenuates tumorigenicity of HNSCC cells in vivo.
   Finally, we examined whether prognosis of HNSCC patients after curative
   treatment may be affected by the level of slug expression.
   Results: Overexpression of slug promoted self-renewal of HNSCC cells via
   activation of sphere formation, the expression of stem cell markers, and
   induction of chemoresistance to cisplatin. Also, slug overexpression
   increased the migration and invasion of HNSCC cells in vitro and was
   mainly observed during the invasion in HNSCC xenograft mouse model. By
   contrast, slug expression knockdown abrogated their self-renewal
   capacity, stemness-associated gene expression, and cisplatin
   chemoresistance. Furthermore, high levels of slug expression correlated
   with poor prognosis of patients with HNSCC.
   Conclusion: Inhibition of slug expression may represent a novel
   therapeutic strategy targeting HNSCC stem-like cells.}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{A deep understanding of the cause-effect relationship of bridge damages
   provides an opportunity to design, construct, and maintain bridge
   structures more effectively. The damage factors (i.e., bridge element,
   damage, and cause) and their complex relationships can be extracted from
   bridge inspection reports; however, it is not practical to manually read
   a considerable number of inspection documents and extract such valuable
   information. Although existing studies attempted to automatically
   analyze inspection reports, they require a large amount of human effort
   for data labeling and model development. To overcome the limitations,
   the authors propose an efficient information acquisition approach that
   extracts damage factors and causal relationships from bridge inspection
   reports. The named entity recognition (NER) model was developed based on
   a recurrent neural network (RNN) and was trained with the active
   learning method. In the experiments performed with 1,650 sentences
   (i.e., 1,300 for training and 350 for testing), the developed model
   successfully classified categories of text words (i.e., damage factors)
   and captured their causal relationship with 0.927 accuracy and 0.860 F1
   score. Besides, the active learning method could significantly reduce
   the human effort required for data labeling and model development. The
   developed model achieved 0.778 F1 score only using 140 sentences,
   requiring less than an hour for manual labeling. These results meant
   that the model was able to successfully extract major damage factors and
   their cause-effect relationships from a set of text sentences with
   little effort. Consequently, the findings of this study can help field
   engineers to design, construct, and maintain bridge structures.}},

Abstract = {{Offshore wind farms are proliferating around the world, and their
   presence is expected to expand substantially within US waters. Wind farm
   lifetimes involve 40-50-year commitments, including site surveys,
   construction, operation, and eventual decommissioning. Because their
   areas often overlap with essential fisheries habitats, there is a need
   to understand, mitigate, and manage offshore wind farm impacts on
   fisheries and ecosystems. Activities during all phases of wind farm
   lifetimes produce underwater sound, a concern because high noise levels
   and/or persistent anthropogenic noise can impact marine life in many
   ways. Here, we review the current understanding of impacts of wind
   energy activities on fisheries resources, taking into account the varied
   noise conditions that occur from site survey to decommissioning. For
   certain portions of wind farm development, such as construction and
   operation, there is a small amount of available data that allows
   stakeholders to evaluate impacts for at least some taxa. Yet, we are
   data deficient for most species' populations, life stages, and other
   phases as they relate to wind farm development. Thus, it is difficult to
   evaluate impacts with any certainty, underscoring the need for further
   studies to adequately address impacts of offshore wind farms on
   vulnerable and ecologically and economically important taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: During the anhepatic phase of liver transplantation (LT),
   fibrinolytic activity increases, since the liver clears tissue
   plasminogen activator (tPA). We hypothesize that patients who fail to
   reduce fibrinolytic activity following graft reperfusion will have an
   increased rate of early allograft dysfunction (EAD).
   Methods: Assessment of fibrinolysis in liver transplant recipients was
   quantified with thrombelastography (TEG) LY30. Changes in LY30 were
   assessed after graft reperfusion. The 30-min post-reperfusion LY30 was
   subtracted from the anhepatic LY30 quantifying fibrinolytic changes
   (delta-LY30).
   Results: Seventy-three primary LT patients were included in the
   analysis. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis
   identified an inflection point of delta-LY30-5.3\% as a risk factor for
   EAD. EAD occurred in 44\% of these patients compared to 5\% in high
   delta-LY30 (p 1/4 0.002).
   Conclusion: LT recipients that develop hyperfibrinolysis who fail to
   reduce fibrinolytic activity 30 min after graft reperfusion had an EAD
   rate 8-fold higher than patients who had a large reduction in LY30
   following reperfusion. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Early implementation of screening for substance use in rural primary
   care: A rapid analytic qualitative study}},
Journal = {{SUBSTANCE ABUSE}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Few primary care patients are screened for substance use. As part of a
   phased feasibility study examining the implementation of electronic
   health record-integrated screening with the Tobacco, Alcohol, and
   Prescription Medication Screening (TAPS) Tool and clinical decision
   support (CDS) in rural primary care clinics, focus groups were conducted
   to identify early indicators of success and challenges to screening
   implementation. Method: Focus groups (n = 6) were conducted with medical
   assistants (MAs: n = 3: 19 participants) and primary care providers
   (PCPs: n = 3: 13 participants) approximately one month following
   screening implementation in three Federally Qualified Health Centers in
   Maine. Rapid analysis and matrix analysis using Proctor's Taxonomy of
   Implementation Outcomes were used to explore implementation outcomes.
   Results: There was consensus that screening is being used, but use of
   the CDS was lower, in part due to limited positive screens. Fidelity was
   high among MAs, though discomfort with the CDS surfaced among PCPs,
   impacting adoption and fidelity. The TAPS Tool's content, credibility
   and ease of workflow integration were favorably assessed. Challenges
   include screening solely at annual visits and self-administered
   screening for certain patients. Conclusions: Results reveal indicators
   of implementation success and strategies to address challenges to
   screening for substance use in primary care.}},

Title = {{A complex network analysis of the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)
   package ecosystem}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{170}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Free and open source software package ecosystems have existed for a long
   time and are among the most sophisticated human-made systems. One of the
   oldest and most popular software package ecosystems is CRAN, the
   repository of packages of the statistical language R, which is also one
   of the most popular environments for statistical computing nowadays.
   CRAN stores a large number of packages that are updated regularly and
   depend on a number of other packages in a complex graph of relations;
   such graph is empirically studied from the perspective of complex
   network analysis (CNA) in the current article, showing how network
   theory and measures proposed by previous work can help profiling the
   ecosystem and detecting strengths, good practices and potential risks in
   three perspectives: macroscopic properties of the ecosystem (structure
   and complexity of the network), microscopic properties of individual
   packages (represented as nodes), and modular properties (community
   detection). Results show how complex network analysis tools can be used
   to assess a package ecosystem and, in particular, that of CRAN. (C) 2020

Title = {{An investigation into the effects of green space on air quality of an
   urban area using CFD modeling}},
Journal = {{URBAN CLIMATE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{34}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Tehran, the capital of Iran, is one of the most polluted cities in the
   Middle East. However, there is no clear evidence of the effects of
   Tehran green spaces on reducing air pollution because there are still
   challenges to application of vegetation for improving air quality. The
   current study investigates the effects of a large volume of green space
   with 275 ha area in the vicinity of major highways on nearby air
   quality. Similar environments are often seen in many cities around the
   world. A computational fluid dynamics model containing aerodynamics and
   deposition effects of vegetation was used to simulate pollutant
   dispersion for eight wind directions and three different foliage
   densities. Analysis of results showed that the existence of trees in the
   green space reduces averaged concentrations of pollutants, including
   PM10, CO, NOx, and VOC over the studied site at pedestrian level. The
   best improvement of air quality was achieved on PM10 with 9\% and 8\%
   reductions for the scenarios without and with background concentration,
   respectively. In addition, the aerodynamics effect of vegetation was
   dominant for all pollutants in the scenarios without background
   concentration, while the deposition effect of vegetation was more
   important for PM10 and VOC in the scenarios with background
   concentration due to effects of deposition velocities. By increasing
   leaf area density, small variations of aerodynamic effect were observed,
   but deposition effects for PM10 and VOC were significantly intensified.
   Wind directions of 135 degrees and 315 degrees, which air easily flows
   within the domain, maximized the performance of park vegetation. PM10
   deposition on tree leaves during dust storm also reduced its
   concentration by a maximum of 7\%. Furthermore, it was found that
   biogenic VOC emission from trees in the park was not comparable with
   road emissions at city scale since it increased VOC concentration up to
   a maximum of 3\%.}},

   economic development: SAGE (China, Ghana, India, Mexico, and South
   Africa) and COURAGE in Europe (Finland, Poland, and Spain), focusing on
   participants aged 50+ (N = 21,000). Retirement was significantly
   associated with higher experiential wellbeing in both surveys, and time
   use accounted for more than 40\% of the total effect. Retirees were
   higher in experiential wellbeing than working older adults, and
   differences in how individuals spend their day accounted for part of

Abstract = {{Exposure to sunlight is the major source of vitamin D and the main
   environmental cause of non-melanocytic skin cancers. Vitamin D, partly
   mediated through the vitamin D receptor (VDR), has potential therapeutic
   applications in skin cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate
   the association of BsmI and ApaI VDR polymorphisms among patients with
   non-melanoma cancers and controls. An observational case-control study
   was conducted in a sample of 154 subjects. We observed no significant
   effects between these polymorphisms and skin cancer risk. When
   stratified for gender, GG and AG BsmI polymorphisms significantly
   increased the risk of basal cell carcinomas in males. In relation to
   ApaI, all three polymorphisms significantly increased the risk of basal
   cell carcinoma in males. When stratified for age, we found that being 70
   years of age or younger was a protective factor against both skin
   cancers. Being a female and 70 years old or younger was a protective
   factor for basal cell carcinoma. A comparison of the frequencies of the
   VDR genotypes in patients older than 70 years vs. 70 years or younger
   also revealed age-dependent variations in patients with non-melanoma
   skin cancer. Our study suggests a role for VDR polymorphisms in
   non-melanoma skin cancer development.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Reproductive health programs for youth have largely
   overlooked first-time parents (FTPs)-defined as young women younger than
   25 years old who are pregnant or already have 1 child, and their
   partners. To address this gap, we implemented and evaluated a program to
   improve child spacing, modern contraceptive use, and related gender
   outcomes among FTPs in Cross River State (CRS), Nigeria. This paper
   examines the effectiveness of FTP interventions in improving voluntary
   uptake of contraception.
   Methods: We conducted small group sessions and home visits with FTPs
   from May to August 2018 in 2 local government areas of CRS. A
   pretest-posttest study examined the effectiveness of these interventions
   regarding healthy timing and spacing of pregnancy/family planning
   knowledge, attitudes, intentions, communication, decision making, and
   contraceptive use. We performed a bivariate analysis and logistic
   binomial regression to confirm change over time in the primary study
   outcome, current use of a modern method of contraception. We also
   performed analysis of demographic characteristics and secondary outcomes
   (e.g., birth spacing intentions and couple communication).
   Results: We interviewed 338 participating first-time mothers (FTMs) and
   224 participating partners at baseline and endline. Important indicators
   of contraceptive awareness, attitudes, and couples' communication
   increased significantly from baseline to endline. Voluntary current
   modern contraceptive use increased from 26\% to 79\% among nonpregnant
   FTMs (P<.000), and from 44\% to 81\% among partners (P<.000). After
   controlling for significant factors related to family planning use, FTMs
   were 3.3 times more likely (P<.001) and partners 3.7 times more likely
   (P<.000) to be using a modern contraceptive method at endline.
   Conclusion: Program participation was associated with significant
   improvements in voluntary uptake of modem contraceptive methods and
   multiple secondary outcomes. Even within a short timeframe, this
   intensive, multi-intervention effort achieved significant advancements
   across healthy timing and spacing of pregnancy and family planning
   outcomes for this vulnerable youth population.}},

Title = {{Does Regulation Influence Microfinance Institutions to Be More

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STUDIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The regulation of microfinance services is likely to have a wide-ranging
   influence on the microfinance sector, particularly on institutions and
   their clients. This paper reveals the impact of a specific regulatory
   regime, the ``Microcredit Regulatory Authority Act, 2006{''}, enacted by
   the Bangladesh government to monitor and supervise nonprofit
   nongovernment organizations (NGOs). We analyzed survey and interview
   data provided by clients of both nonprofit microfinance institutions
   (MFIs) registered under the Act and nonprofit institutions that are
   unregistered, all lending only to women. Client-level analysis using
   fixed effects for specific MFI membership is applied, focusing on the
   role of regulation by comparing protections as consumers of financial
   intermediations in terms of financial literacy, awareness, and status of
   clients of registered and unregistered MFIs. We found compelling
   evidence of a positive association between the financial status,
   financial literacy, and financial awareness of clients of registered
   MFIs, but not unregistered MFIs. These findings support the need for
   MFIs to implement consumer protection measures and inform their
   consumers about key issues to achieve improved client outcomes.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Two high-temperature FeCrAl and FeNiCrAl alloys were exposed in a
   strongly nitriding environment at 900 degrees C and the morphology of
   nitridation was studied. Quasi-in-situ experiments revealed that
   nitridation started at specific surface sites directly related to the
   alloy microstructure where the alumina scale was permeable to nitrogen.
   FeCrAl alloy grains with (112) orientation formed outward-growing
   alumina scales and were susceptible to nitridation. Outward-growing
   scales and substrate nitridation was also observed at chromium carbide
   precipitates in the FeNiCrAl alloy. Both alloys suffered nitridation at
   reactive element-rich (Y and Zr) inclusions larger than a certain
   critical size. The latter type of attack is caused by cracks and pores
   in the scale. The findings open new avenues of research for developing
   the next generation of high temperature alloys with superior properties.

Abstract = {{One of the most interesting problems in denoising of images includes
   despeckling of multiplicative noise. This paper proposes a novel
   statistical processor in the framework of Non-sub Sampled Shearlet
   Transform (NSST) to reduce the effect of the multiplicative noise on
   images given preserving of structural and visual quality of image.
   First, we indicate that NSST coefficients of logarithmically transformed
   images can be statistically meaningful modeled by t-location scale
   (TLS). For designing our processor, we employ Minimum Mean Squared Error
   (MMSE) estimator to reduce noise distortion. We show by using TLS as the
   prior distribution, non-linear noise suppression behavior is obtained in
   test images. Finally, we compare our method by the state-of-the-art
   algorithms like soft and hard thresholding and also with well-known
   adaptive filters in this area like Wiener, Frost, Lee and one recent
   method in shearlet denoising framework. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{This paper aims to scrutinize in what way peri-urbanization triggers
   climate change vulnerabilities. By using spatial analysis techniques,
   the study undertakes the following tasks. First, the study demarcates
   Dhaka's-the capital of Bangladesh-peri-urban growth pattern that took
   place over the last 24-year period (1992-2016). Afterwards, it
   determines the conformity of ongoing peri-urban practices with Dhaka's
   stipulated planning documents. Then, it identifies Dhaka's specific
   vulnerabilities to climate change impacts-i.e., flood, and groundwater
   table depletion. Lastly, it maps out the socioeconomic profile of the
   climate change victim groups from Dhaka. The findings of the study
   reveal that: (a) Dhaka lacks adequate development planning, monitoring,
   and control mechanisms that lead to an increased and uncontrolled
   peri-urbanization; (b) Dhaka's explicitly undefined peri-urban growth
   boundary is the primary factor in misguiding the growth pockets-that are
   the most vulnerable locations to climate change impacts, and; (c)
   Dhaka's most vulnerable group to the increasing climate change impacts
   are the climate migrants, who have been repeatedly exposed to the
   climate change-triggered natural hazards. These study findings generate
   insights into peri-urbanization-triggered climate change vulnerabilities
   that aid urban policymakers, managers, and planners in their development
   policy, planning, monitoring and control practices.}},

   A study on naturally aged animals}},
Journal = {{ACTA HISTOCHEMICA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{122}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Connexins are membrane-spanning proteins that form membrane channels and
   hemichannels. They are involved in the cellular communication and in the
   maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Recent studies in humans and animals
   have demonstrated that the expression and distribution of Cx43, the most
   studied connexin, can change during aging. However, the research on the
   involvement of the other connexins in cardiac and hepatic aging is, at
   present, still very poor. Hence, the aim of this study is to evaluate
   the expression of Cx43 and Cx26 in the heart as well as Cx26 and Cx32 in
   the liver of a rat model that aged naturally, rather than prematurely
   because of genetic mutations or age-related diseases.
   The results obtained in the present study have demonstrated that these
   connexins decrease in rat cardiomyocytes and in rat hepatocytes as they
   age. This change was revealed only at protein level, as connexinmRNAs
   remained unchanged during aging. Moreover, the aged rats showed an
   increase in body fat, whose subcutaneous layer tended to be higher.
   Finally, how these changes could represent signs of physiological
   adaptation in successful aging was discussed.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{42}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a new parameters estimation method for the single
   diode model and the double diode model of photovoltaic cells. A new
   application of the slime mould algorithm (SMA) stochastic optimization
   method represents one of the main contributions in this paper. The
   employment of the slime mould algorithm provides highly accurate and
   fast determination procedures of photovoltaic cells parameters. The
   slime mould algorithm stochastic optimization provides unique
   mathematical modelling of the optimization problem through using
   adaptive weights. These adaptive weights emulate the process of
   generating positive and negative feedbacks in the propagated wave of the
   slime mould. Moreover, the slime mould algorithm is successful at
   accurately extracting the global optimal values for the solar
   photovoltaic cell parameters. It has the ability to handle the
   non-linearity and multi-modal properties of the photovoltaic cell
   characteristics. The proposed method provides a generalized solution for
   precisely determining the parameters for various photovoltaic cells
   technologies. Comprehensive comparisons of the proposed slime mould
   algorithm with existing photovoltaic cell parameter extraction methods
   are performed in the paper. The results confirm the superior performance
   and accuracy of the proposed slime mould algorithm over the existing
   methods.}},

Title = {{Topology of microfractures in osteonecrotic femoral heads at mu CT and

Journal = {{BONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{141}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aim: To assess the topology of bone and cartilage microfractures in
   osteonecrotic femoral heads.
   Method: Sixteen resected human femoral heads with collapsed
   osteonecrosis (ON, n = 11) or osteoarthritis (OA, n = 5) were imaged at
   mu CT with 12 mu nominal resolution. Forty-seven histological sections
   and mu CT reformats with (n = 30) or without (8 from ON and 9 from OA
   femoral heads) osteonecrotic lesions were obtained and divided in 2 x 2
   mm segments by a superposed grid. A radiologist and a pathologist
   separately assessed the presence of bone and cartilage microfractures in
   each segment on mu CT and histological images, respectively. We
   determined the frequency and distribution of segments with bone
   microfractures according to a zonal distribution. Matrix analysis was
   performed by using Matlab to calculate the connectivity index and
   long/short axis ratios of clustered segments with microfractures.
   Results: Segments with bone microfractures but not with cartilage
   microfractures were found more frequently in ON than in OA femoral
   heads. In the 38 matched mu CT and histological images from ON femoral
   heads, 86\%/82\% of segments with cortical microfracture, 91\%/96\% of
   segments with trabecular microfractures involved ON lesions at mu
   CT/histology. At histology, 83\% of segments with cartilage
   microfractures involved ON lesions. In the 30 paired mu CT and
   histological images containing necrotic lesions, the frequency of
   segments with trabecular microfractures in the superficial layers (55\%
   at mu CT/51\% at histology) was statistically significantly higher than
   in the deep layer (25\% P < 0.0001/35\%; P = 0.0006). Clustered segments
   with cortical/trabecular micro fractures, exclusively found in
   osteonecrotic lesions, had a connectivity index > 2.0/20.0 and mean
   long/short axis ratio > 2.35/2.2, respectively.
   Conclusion: Segments with bone microfractures predominate in necrotic
   lesions. Segments with trabecular microfractures form elongated clusters
   near the femoral head surface.}},

   Building Blocks Analysis Using Reductive Amination Tagging by Sulfanilic
   Acid}},

Abstract = {{Heparins are linear sulfated polysaccharides widely used as
   anticoagulant drugs. Their nonreducing-end (NRE) has been little
   investigated due to challenges in their characterization, but is known
   to be partly generated by enzymatic cleavage with heparanases, resulting
   in N-sulfated glucosamines at the NRE. Uronic NRE (specifically
   glucuronic acids) have been isolated from porcine heparin, with
   GlcA-GlcNS,3S,6S identified as a porcine-specific NRE marker. To further
   characterize NRE in heparinoids, a building block analysis involving
   exhaustive heparinase digestion and subsequent reductive amination with
   sulfanilic acid was performed. This study describes a new method for
   identifying heparin classical building blocks and novel NRE building
   blocks using strong anion exchange chromatography on AS11 columns for
   the assay, and ion-pair liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for
   building block identification. Porcine, ovine, and bovine intestine
   heparins were analyzed. Generally, NRE on these three heparins are
   highly sulfated moieties, particularly with 3-O sulfates, and the
   observed composition of the NRE is highly dependent on heparin origin.
   At the highest level of specificity, the isolated marker was only
   detected in porcine heparin. However, the proportion of glucosamines in
   the NRE and the proportion of glucuronic/iduronic configurations in the
   NRE uronic moieties greatly varied between heparin types.}},

Abstract = {{Game theory, a method of applied mathematics, has been used to study a
   wide range of topics. Literature is also a fertile ground for the
   application of Game theory. If one models literary texts as a series of
   decisions in which each character's decision or choice is dependent on
   the previous ones of others, it looks like a game, according to the
   formal game-theory definition. Thus irrational decisions or actions are
   rational in the context of a game. The current study aims to revisit
   Shakespeare's tragedies, Hamlet, Othello, and Antony and Cleopatra, in
   light of the game theory and model them in trees and matrices. These
   tragedies are nonzero-sum Games and there are no winners at the end.
   Moreover the characters' dominant strategies are associated with Nash

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Compared with term neonates, preterm babies are more
   likely to die from sepsis. However, the combined effects of sepsis and
   prematurity on neonatal postoperative mortality are largely unknown. Our
   objective was to quantify the proportion of neonatal postoperative
   mortality that is attributable to the synergistic effects of
   preoperative sepsis and prematurity.
   Methods: We performed a multicentre, propensity-score-weighted,
   retrospective, cohort study of neonates who underwent inpatient surgery
   across hospitals participating in the United States National Surgical
   Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric (2012-2017). We assessed the
   proportion of the observed hazard ratio of mortality and complications
   that is attributable to the synergistic effect of prematurity and sepsis
   by estimating the attributable proportion (AP) and its 95\% confidence
   interval (CI).
   Results: We identified 19 312 neonates who realised a total of 321 321
   person-days of postsurgical observations, during which 683 died
   (mortality rate: 2.1 per 1000 person-days). The proportion of mortality
   risk that is attributable to the synergistic effect of prematurity and
   sepsis was 50.5\% (AP=50.5\%; 95\% CI, 28.8-72.3\%; P < 0.001). About
   half of mortality events among preterm neonates with sepsis occurred
   within 24 h after surgery. Just over 45\% of postoperative complications
   were attributable to the synergistic effect of prematurity and sepsis
   when both conditions were present (AP=45.8; 95\% CI, 13.4-78.1\%;
   P<0.001).
   Conclusion: Approximately half of postsurgical mortality and
   complications were attributable to the combined effect of sepsis and
   prematurity among neonates with both exposures. These neonates typically
   died within a few days after surgery, indicating a very narrow window of
   opportunity to predict and prevent mortality. Clinical trial number and
   registry: Not applicable.}},

Abstract = {{Objective The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of
   pharmacological neuroenhancement in 4 occupations and to investigate its
   association with psychosocial working conditions and mental health.
   Methods In the study on ``Neuroenhancement Behaviour in the Context of
   Stressful Workload - empirical Studies on Employees{''}, 4166 employed
   physicians, advertising experts, publishers and software developers were
   surveyed with computer-assisted personal interviews. Lifetime, 12 months
   and 4 weeks prevalence rates with corresponding confidence intervals
   were calculated. The association of neuroenhancement with psychosocial
   working conditions and mental health were estimated in Poisson
   regression models.
   Results The lifetime prevalence of pharmacological neuroenhancement was
   8.4 \%, the 12 months prevalence 2.9\% and the 4 weeks prevalence 1.3
   \%. Advertising experts and female software developers showed elevated
   prevalence rates for neuroenhancement. Psychosocial working conditions,
   such as support from colleagues, role clarity, emotional demands and job
   insecurity were associated with neuroenhancement in men. Burnout and
   depressive symptoms were related to an increase in neuroenhancement.
   Conclusions Compared to samples from the general population or the
   overall working population, the estimated prevalence rates among the
   investigated occupations were slightly elevated. Burnout and depressive
   symptoms might operate as potential risk factors or consequences of
   pharmacological neuroenhancement.}},

Abstract = {{Shoulder arthroplasty is indicated for treatment of primary
   osteoarthritis, cuff tear athropathy, complex proximal humerus
   fractures, and posttraumatic situations. The rotator cuff plays an
   important role. In case of an intact rotator cuff, anatomical shoulder
   arthroplasty is preferred. Over the past decades, the number of hemi
   prostheses has declined in favor of total shoulder arthroplasties.
   Reverse shoulder arthroplasty is used for severe and irreparable rotator
   cuff tears, advanced cuff tear athropathy, and increasingly for complex
   proximal humerus fractures. Reverse shoulder arthroplasties account for
   almost 80\% of all shoulder prostheses. Modern implants allow conversion
   from an anatomic to a reverse situation if needed. Improved
   understanding of the pathology, new implant designs, and preoperative 3D
   planning have improved the overall outcome.}},

Abstract = {{The Lufthansa Prevention Study (CUPS) study is a prospective observation
   of a healthy worker cohort to identify early changes in metabolism
   leading to the Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) and to analyze their relation

   sample of 1.962 non-diabetic healthy adults between 25-60 years,
   employed at a flight base of Lufthansa Technik GmbH in Hamburg, Germany.
   Baseline assessments included anthropometric measures, blood and urine
   samples and medical history. Psychosocial variables, dietary habits and
   life-style risk factors were assessed via self-reported questionnaires.
   In this report we describe the study design and present baseline
   parameters including the prevalence of the MetS using different
   classification criteria. The MetS was present in 20\% of male and 12 \%
   of female subjects according to the `Harmonizing the metabolic syndrome'
   definition. The prevalence varies between 2.6\% in male and 2.3 \% in
   female subjects up to 48\% in male and 41 \% in female subjects
   according to different classification criteria of MetS.
   In conclusion, this first cross-sectional view on the LUPS data confirms

   the MetS.}},

   There was, however, no effect on shoot delta C-13 values in either year.
   Compared to the zero-P control, supplying 40 kg.ha(-1) P markedly
   increased shoot biomass by 77\% and 66\% in 2012 and 2013, respectively.
   In both years, groundnut grain yields were much higher at 20 and 30
   kg.ha(-1) P. Phosphorus supply markedly reduced shoot delta N-13 values
   and increased the \%Ndfa and amount of N-fixed, indicating the direct
   involvement of P in promoting N-2 fixation in nodulated groundnut. The
   three genotypes differed significantly in delta N-15, \%Ndfa, N-fixed,
   grain yield, C concentration, and delta C-13. The phosphorus x genotype
   interaction was also significant for shoot DM, N content, N-fixed and
   soil N uptake.}},

Abstract = {{Web spiders rely on vibrations propagated via their web to identify,
   locate and capture entangled prey. Here, we experimentally tested the
   robustness of the orb weaver's predation strategy when webs are severely
   distorted and silk tensions are drastically altered throughout the web,
   a common occurrence in the wild. We assessed prey identification
   efficiency by comparing the spider's initial reaction times towards a
   fruit fly trapped in the web, we measured location efficiency by
   comparing times and number of tugging bouts performed, and we determined
   capture efficiency by comparing capture times. It emerged that spiders
   are capable of identifying, locating and capturing prey in distorted
   webs, albeit taking somewhat longer to do so.}},

Abstract = {{A third order nonlinear optical (NLO) good quality Piperazinium based
   cupric sulfate (PCS) single crystals has been grown successfully from
   homogeneous solution by slow evaporation technique using double
   distilled water at room temperature. The average dimensions of the as
   grown crystals are up to 36 x 30 x 15 mm(3) within a period of 35 days.
   The grown single crystals were subjected to powder X-ray diffraction
   (XRD) to confirm the crystalline quality. Single crystals X-ray
   diffraction represents, the PCS crystal belongs to the monoclinic system
   (P), with unit cell parameters a = 6.87 angstrom, b = 10.20 angstrom, c
   = 11.92 angstrom and V = 834 angstrom(3). Existence of major functional
   groups in PCS single crystal has been identified by FTIR analysis. The
   thermal properties of PCS single crystals were analyzed from TG DTA
   curves and the compound is thermally stable up to 134 degrees C. The
   UV-vis absorption studies indicate the PCS single crystals are optically
   transparent up to 60.88 \% at 496 nm with the cutoff wavelength 258 nm.
   From the Tauc's plot optical band gap is estimated to be (E-g) 5.30
   eV.The extinction coefficient (k) vs. wavelength relation for PCS single
   crystals have minimum absorption of light around 493 nm. The refractive
   index (n(0)) of PCS single crystals has least value for blue and green
   light; it is gradually increased till red light. It is supported by
   reflectance vs. wavelength calculation with high reflectance at same
   wavelength range. The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra for as
   grown crystals represent prominent emission around 440 - 470 nm
   depicting blue emission with 244 nm excitation wavelength. The electric
   field response of PCS single crystals has been studies in terms of
   dielectric constant and dielectric loss as a function of frequency and
   temperature, the results were discussed. The mechanical stability of the
   grown crystals at room temperature has investigated with Vicker's micro
   hardness test and evaluated various mechanical parameters such as H-v,
   K-c, sigma(v) and C-11. Hardness number increased with load.PCS single
   crystals exhibits RISE behavior and belong to soft category. The third
   order nonlinear optical nature of PCS single crystals was studied using
   Z scan technique. The negative nonlinear refractive index (n(2)) of the
   crystals indicates self-defocusing effect. The nonlinear absorption
   coefficient (beta) and third order nonlinear optical susceptibility
   (chi((3))) were also calculated and discussed from the above technique.}},

Title = {{Effect of propofol-based procedural sedation on risk of adverse events
   in a French emergency department: a retrospective analysis}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{436-440}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives:
   Propofol is widely used today outside the operating room to facilitate
   painful procedures. The objective of this retrospective study was to
   evaluate the frequency and type of complications related to a
   propofol-based procedural sedation protocol used in a French emergency
   department.
   Methods:
   This retrospective study reviewed the records over a 6-year period of
   all patients-adults and children-who received propofol for procedural
   sedation according to a pre-established protocol. The frequency and type
   of adverse events related to this sedation were recorded. Adverse events
   were classified according to the World Society of Intra-Veinous
   Anaesthesia International Sedation Task Force as sentinel, moderate,
   minor, or minimal.
   Results:
   During the study period, 602 patients-395 adults (66\%) and 207 (34\%)
   children-received propofol. The main indications for procedural sedation
   were fracture (n = 327) and dislocation (n = 222) reduction, pleural
   drain placement (n = 34), and abscess incision (n = 12). Among the 602
   consecutive cases, we identified 90 adverse events (14.9\%; 95\%
   confidence interval: 12-17.7\%). These 90 events were classified as 1
   sentinel (hypotension episode), 5 moderate (2 airway obstruction and 3
   apnea episodes), 83 minor, and 1 minimal risk-averse events. There were
   no adverse outcomes.
   Conclusion:
   Nearly all of the adverse events in our series were minor. In the French
   medical system, the use of propofol outside the operating room by
   non-anesthesiologist physicians for procedural sedation appears safe.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction:
   The aim of the study was to evaluate the mortality and the outcomes of
   femoral revision in periprosthetic femoral fractures (PFF) using a
   titanium modular fluted tapered stem.
   Methods:
   We retrospectively reviewed femoral revisions performed for PFF with a
   titanium modular fluted tapered stem in 25 patients. The average age was
   74.32 years. In 21 patients the type of fracture was Vancouver B2 and
   type B3 in 4 cases. The mean follow-up was 29.16 (0.83-104.1) months SD
   +/- 29.49.
   Results:
   The 30-day and 1-year mortality were 8\% and 12\% respectively. The mean
   value of the Charlson Comorbidity Index was 4.8 and the mean value of
   ASA score was 2.4. The average time to surgery from admittance was 5.45
   days with 20\% of patients operated on within 48 hours. A significant
   correlation was found between ASA score and mortality. The mean HHS was
   76 points; good-excellent results were recorded in 56\% of patients.
   72\% had no pain and 28\% had slight pain (VAS 1-3). 52\% of patients
   were able to walk without pain, limp or aids. The mean implant
   subsidence was 1.57 mm and superior to 5 mm in 2 cases. As complications
   we recorded 4 implant dislocations (16\%) and 2 infections. Reoperation
   rate was 12\%.
   Conclusions:
   Femoral revision with a modular fluted tapered stem in patients with
   periprosthetic fractures results in good clinical and radiological
   outcomes. However, mortality remains high and, despite the modularity
   design, dislocation is the most frequent complication.}},

Abstract = {{Chilean education has transitioned in the search of quality and
   inclusion of everyone, fulfilling the demands of the context. Through a
   qualitative and local study, experiences from professionals of six
   educational communities belonging to public schools with an Integration
   Program in process of implementation due to the inclusion law are
   analyzed in the three provinces of the Atacama region. The purpose is to
   reveal unseen realities through the analysis of interviews directed to
   eighteen educational members: headmasters, social workers and
   professionals who are part of the Educational Integration Program; the
   main actors of the current educational process. Through the experiences
   and arguments of the ones involved in the study; obstacles,
   enhancements, disagreements, and meaningful elements are made evident.
   Each one of these help in the scaffolding of theoretical and practical
   knowledge which mainly refers to the resistance of traditional
   pedagogical transformation and to the collaborative working developed
   with multidisciplinary teams, the establishment of innovative practices
   through curricular adaptions, the importance of students and families'
   involvement, emotional education and positive behavior, key elements for

Abstract = {{In the field of acute pain medicine research, we believe there is an
   unmet need to incorporate patient related outcome measures that move
   beyond reporting pain scores and opioid consumption. The term ``minimal

   mathematically determined statistically significant difference that may
   not necessarily be clinically significant. The present article reviews
   the concept of MCID in acute postoperative pain research, addresses
   potential pitfalls in MCID determination and questions the clinical
   validity of extrapolating MCID determined from chronic pain and
   non-surgical pain studies to the acute postoperative pain setting. We
   further suggest the concepts of minimal clinically important
   improvement, substantial clinical benefit and patient acceptable symptom
   state should also represent aspirational outcomes for future research in
   acute postoperative pain management.}},

Title = {{The Clicking Elateroidea from Chinese Mesozoic Deposits (Insecta,
   Coleoptera)}},
Journal = {{INSECTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Simple Summary
   Fossil click beetles from the family Elateridae are frequent in Mesozoic
   deposits, especially in Russia and China. In order to understand their
   relationship to extant species, we need to search for evolutionary
   important characters that unite these dinosaur-era beetles with extant
   forms. We show that about one third of the identifiable click-beetles
   described from Mesozoic Chinese deposits are in fact members of other
   related families. Our results strengthen the view that these beetle
   groups are significantly older than often assumed, being present in the
   Early Jurassic. This is an important result as it indicates that
   molecular studies based on modern species do not replace
   paleontology-both are needed, even in the future.
   Recent molecular studies have suggested that the clicking beetle
   families Elateridae, Eucnemidae, Throscidae, and Cerophytidae evolved in
   the Jurassic and diversified in the Cretaceous. These studies paid
   little attention to fossils, using them only as dating tools. The
   identification of Elateridae fossils is challenging, as external
   synapomorphies are not known for this family. Elateridae can be
   identified only as something not belonging to the other related
   families, all of which have diagnostic synapomorphies. Most subfamilies
   and tribes of Elateridae do possess definite diagnostic characters,
   however, making their identification feasible. We checked the 28
   Elateridae described from Chinese Mesozoic deposits. Twelve were
   Elateridae, seven were Eucnemidae, and one was a Throscidae. Three
   species could be Eucnemidae, but showed aberrant characters. Five
   species could not be placed and may not belong to Elateroidea at all. On
   the basis of these results we suggest that all previously described
   Elateridae fossils should be re-checked. They should be searched for
   synapomorphies defining Eucnemidae, Throscidae, and Cerophytidae. If
   such characters are not present, a click beetle type of fossil can be
   placed in Elateroidae incertae sedis. The Mesozoic Chinese Elateridae
   fossils all belong to clades that do not exist today, whereas the
   Mesozoic Eucnemidae subfamilies are extant ones. This may be the source
   of the disagreement between Elateridae fossil age and datings based on
   molecular studies. One new combination was made: Desmatus ponomarenkoi
   (Chang, Kiretjshuk \& Ren, 2009) NEW COMBINATION (= Paradesmatus
   ponomarenkoi Chang, Kirejtshuk \& Ren, 2009).}},

   1985 is examined based on results from field investigations conducted
   after the 2017 event. These rehabilitations were effective in improving
   the performance of these buildings according to observed damages and
   estimated shaking intensities. To allow a more systematic assessment of
   seismic rehabilitations in future earthquakes, an inventory of

Title = {{Revealing multisensory benefit with diffusion modeling}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{99}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Multisensory information can benefit perceptual, memory, and
   decision-making processes. These benefits commonly manifest in superior
   detection and discrimination of multisensory stimuli, as well as
   improved perception and subsequent memory of unisensory representation
   of an object previously encoded in a multisensory context. However, the
   vast majority of studies to date analyze accuracy, sensitivity and/or
   reaction time data independently to compare multisensory and unisensory
   conditions. Considering the well-established speed-accuracy trade-off,
   we asked whether some multisensory benefits go unnoticed when measured
   using traditional methods that do not take both reaction time and
   accuracy into account simultaneously, and whether an approach combining
   them can more reliably characterize and quantify the broad extent of
   multisensory interactions across perception and cognition. While drift
   diffusion models have been previously shown to be effective in
   addressing the speed-accuracy trade-off and providing a reliable and
   accurate measure of multisensory benefits, one impediment of this
   approach is the requirement of a large number of trials to estimate
   model parameters and to characterize effects. This may be prohibitive in
   many experimental paradigms. Several model variants attempt to reduce
   the required number of trials, either by averaging across participants
   or limiting the search space for the parameters. Here, we employed a
   hierarchical drift diffusion model, that utilizes Bayesian priors,
   allowing parameter estimation with smaller sample sizes while still
   making subject-specific parameter estimates. We analyzed data in
   perceptual detection and discrimination tasks across multiple sensory
   combinations, to investigate if the diffusion model would provide a
   sensitive and reliable measure of multisensory benefits. Results
   indicate that across visual, auditory and tactile modality combinations,
   the diffusion model was either as or more sensitive than traditional
   accuracy, sensitivity, or reaction time measures, and was the only
   measure that consistently detected multisensory benefits in a
   statistically significant fashion. We recommend the use of diffusion
   modeling approaches when assessing the outcomes of multisensory
   experiments, especially as they become more computationally efficient.

   namely, 2-thioureidobenzoxazole (BOT), 2-thioureidobenzimidazole (BIT),
   2-thioureidobenzothiazole (BIT) compounds were predicted theoretically
   using quantum chemical calculations on type CS 1084 carbon steel in 2 M
   HCl at 25 degrees C. INT cakulations indicated that BIT showed better
   inhibition compared to BIT and BOT compounds. Theoretical conclusions
   were subsequently validated by experiments carried out using
   Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), Potentiodynamic
   Polarization (PDP) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Adsorption of
   2-thioureidobenzheteroazoles on the steel surface obeyed the Langmuir
   adsorption model. Thermodynamic parameters indicated that, the
   adsorption process is energetically spontaneous, while the calculated
   kinetic parameters corroborated the adsorption phenomenon at the
   metal/solution interface. Furthermore, PDP results showed that, the
   inhibitors behaved as mixed type inhibitors with cathodic dominance. The
   maximum corrosion inhibition efficiency obtained was 96.1\% for BTT at 2
   rnM concentration. The surface morphology investigations using SEM
   technique showed lower corrosion inhibition in presence of these
   inhibitors. Sulphur and nitrogen heteroatoms served as reactive centres
   for the adsorption of inhibitors, based on the quantum chemical
   calculations. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Convolutional neural networks utilize a hierarchy of neural network
   layers. The statistical aspects of information concentration in
   successive layers can bring an insight into the feature abstraction
   process. We analyze the saliency maps of these layers from the
   perspective of semiotics, also known as the study of signs and
   sign-using behavior. In computational semiotics, this aggregation
   operation (known as superization) is accompanied by a decrease of
   spatial entropy: signs are aggregated into supersign. Using spatial
   entropy, we compute the information content of the saliency maps and
   study the superization processes which take place between successive
   layers of the network. In our experiments, we visualize the superization
   process and show how the obtained knowledge can be used to explain the
   neural decision model. In addition, we attempt to optimize the
   architecture of the neural model employing a semiotic greedy technique.
   To the extent of our knowledge, this is the first application of
   computational semiotics in the analysis and interpretation of deep

Abstract = {{Urban planners must ensure that urban public spaces are enjoyable to use
   to create a lively city that expresses their culture and traditions and
   welcomes social diversity. This study aims to develop a theoretical
   index for assessing the livability levels in tourist districts.
   Therefore, a survey-based study accompanied by a literature review is
   used to derive criteria for livability. In addition to using the
   analytic hierarchy process to develop an importance based hierarchy of
   criteria, mathematical analysis is applied to derive the livability
   index. Furthermore, one of Sharjah's well-known public spaces, Al Qasba
   Tourist District, is assessed as a case study. This study discussed the
   main concepts and factors of livability in urban public spaces to
   examine the livable extent of Qasba and the significance of criteria.
   Results show that the current livability level in Al Qasba is less than
   50\%, confirming its urgent need for further urban improvement. This
   study explores the livability assessment criteria and their influencing
   parameters. Using the suggested conceptual livability index enables
   decision makers to assess the livability level, analyze the influencing
   factors, and suggest solutions to improve the overall livability levels
   of open public spaces. (C) 2020 Higher Education Press Limited Company.

Abstract = {{Rhyzopertha dominica (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae) is a primary
   insect pest of stored grains. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   efficacy of 10 different isolates of entomopathogenic fungi as
   biocontrol agents against R. dominica. The chosen isolates were
   Beauveria bassiana CEP 545, CEP 560 and CEP 567, Metarhizium robertsii
   CEP 381 and CEP 401, M. anisopliae sensu lato CEP 615, CEP 616 and CEP
   617 and Cordyceps (=Isaria) fumosorosea CEP 303 and CEP 309. Insects
   were sprayed with a conidial suspension of each fungus and incubated for
   15 days under laboratory conditions. Insect mortality (expressed as
   percentage) and median survival times (MST) were estimated. Beauveria
   bassiana caused the highest mortality (47-65\%), whereas the other
   fungal isolates caused a maximum mortality of 21\%. The B. bassiana CEP
   545 and CEP 567 isolates led to an MST of 8 and 9 days, respectively.
   Among all the isolates tested, B. bassiana CEP 545 was the most
   efficient as a biocontrol agent. The median lethal concentration
   (LC50)of this isolate was calculated with five concentrations on day 15
   after the treatment. The insect mortality increased with the highest
   isolate concentrations and the LC50 was estimated in 9.54x10(9) conidia
   mL(-1).This study confirmed that some B. bassiana isolates, especially
   CEP 545, could be used as biocontrol agents against R. dominica.}},

Abstract = {{The pandemic COVID-19 is the most terrible calamity of the present human
   history also it has led to the worldwide issue of public health as a
   primary health safety problem. It was assumed that the infection of
   COVID-19 has two-phases, the immune protective as well as damaging
   phase. In the immune protective phase, clinicians try to enhance the
   patient immune response, and in the immune damaging phase, clinicians
   try to control the inflammatory immune response. Zinc belongs to the
   d-block or a transition element, it is an indispensable trace metal
   needed for vital cell activities like growth, as well as cell survival.
   It has significant contributions to immune homeostasis and functions;
   zinc inadequacy reduces primary and secondary immune responses equally.
   Studies have shown people who are deficient in zinc are more susceptible
   to infection. An inclusive knowledge of the bioavailability of the
   transition metal zinc will help to be aware of those that are valuable
   and protective for the population's health. This work is concentrated on
   the significance of zinc for the immune function, the presence of it's
   in optimum amounts and how it is beneficial to health in general and in

Title = {{Differences in the Development of Fibrocartilage Layers in the
   Quadriceps Tendon and Patellar Tendon Insertions in Rabbits: A
   Quantitative Study}},
Journal = {{ORTHOPAEDIC JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background:
   Differences in the development of fibrocartilage layers in quadriceps
   tendon (QT) and patellar tendon (PT) insertion sites are unclear.
   Because the mechanical environments for the QT and PT are different, the
   development of the QT and PT insertions may differ.
   Purpose:
   To investigate differences in the development of fibrocartilage layers
   in the QT and PT insertion sites in rabbits through use of quantitative
   morphometric evaluations.
   Study Design:
   Descriptive laboratory study.
   Methods:
   This study included 54 male Japanese White rabbits. Animals were
   euthanized at ages 1 day and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 weeks (n = 6
   for each age). Chondrocyte number, proliferation, apoptosis,
   sex-determining region Y box 9 (Sox9)-positive rates, safranin O-stained
   glycosaminoglycan (GAG) areas, tidemark length, insertion width, and
   patellar length were evaluated and compared with the same parameters at
   age 24 weeks and between QT and PT insertion sites.
   Results:
   Chondrocyte proliferation was low up to age 2 weeks for QT insertion and
   low up to 1 week for PT insertion. Chondrocyte apoptosis was high at 1
   day and Sox9 expression was low up to 1 week for PT insertion. Sox9
   expression was higher in QT than in PT insertion at age 12 weeks. The
   high chondrocyte count continued to age 1 day in PT insertion and up to
   6 weeks in QT insertion. The chondrocyte number was higher in QT than in
   PT insertion at age 2 weeks. The period of thicker GAG lasted from 2 to
   8 weeks in PT insertion and from 1 to 12 weeks in QT insertion. GAG
   thickness in QT insertion was higher than in PT insertion at age 4 and
   12 weeks.
   Conclusion:
   Development of fibrocartilage layers in QT and PT insertion sites was
   completed at age 24 weeks in rabbits. However, the period of high
   chondrocyte count and period of thicker GAG were longer in QT than in PT
   insertion up to 12 weeks.}},

Abstract = {{The unique combination of optical, chemical, and structural properties
   of one-dimensional zinc oxide (1D ZnO) makes it one of the most
   attractive materials in a wide range of research and applications. In
   the present study, 1D ZnO nanomaterials were fabricated using a
   combination of two independent methods: electrospinning and atomic layer
   deposition (ALD). The electrospinning technique was used to produce 1D
   electrospun fibers consisting of four types of polymers: polylactic acid
   (PLLA), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and
   polyamide 6 (PA6). The ALD technology, in turn, was selected as an
   excellent candidate for the synthesis of a ZnO thin layer over polymer
   fibers for the production of 1D ZnO/polymer nanofiber composites
   (PLLA/ZnO, PVDF/ZnO, PVA/ZnO, PA6/ZnO). Structural and optical
   properties of the produced nanofibers were studied by means of scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX),
   X-ray diffraction (XRD), diffuse reflectance, and photoluminescence (PL)
   spectroscopy. It was found that only PVDF/ZnO nanofibers exhibit stable

Abstract = {{Little is known about the clinical features and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2
   infection in Africa. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of
   patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between March 10, 2020 and July 31,
   2020 at seven hospitals in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo
   (DRC). Outcomes included clinical improvement within 30 days (primary)
   and in-hospital mortality (secondary). Of 766 confirmed COVID-19 cases,
   500 (65.6\%) were male, with a median (interquartile range {[}IQR]) age
   of 46 (34-58) years. One hundred ninety-one (25\%) patients had
   severe/critical disease requiring admission in the intensive care unit
   (ICU). Six hundred twenty patients (80.9\%) improved and were discharged
   within 30 days of admission. Overall in-hospital mortality was 13.2\%
   (95\% CI: 10.9-15.8), and almost 50\% among those in the ICU.
   Independent risk factors for death were age <20 years (adjusted hazard
   ratio {[}aHR] = 6.62, 95\% CI: 1.85-23.64), 40-59 years (aHR = 4.45,
   95\% CI: 1.83-10.79), and >= 60 years (aHR = 13.63, 95\% CI: 5.70-32.60)
   compared with those aged 20-39 years, with obesity (aHR = 2.30, 95\% CI:
   1.24-4.27), and with chronic kidney disease (aHR = 5.33, 95\% CI:
   1.85-15.35). In marginal structural model analysis, there was no
   statistically significant difference in odds of clinical improvement
   (adjusted odds ratio {[}aOR] = 1.53, 95\% CI: 0.88-2.67, P = 0.132) nor
   risk of death (aOR = 0.65, 95\% CI: 0.35-1.20) when comparing the use of
   chloroquine/azithromycin versus other treatments. In this DRC study, the
   high mortality among patients aged < 20 years and with severe/critical
   disease is of great concern, and requires further research for
   confirmation and targeted interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Since 2008, the environmental levels of polychlorinated compounds near a
   municipal solid waste incinerator in Mataro (Catalonia, Spain) have been
   periodically monitored. The present study aimed at updating the data
   regarding the temporal changes occurred between 2015 and 2017, when air
   and soil samples were collected again, and the concentrations of the
   same chemical pollutants (i.e., polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and
   dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)) were
   analysed. Furthermore, the health risks associated with their human
   exposure were also evaluated. The levels of all the contaminants in soil
   were far below the threshold established by regional and national
   legislations, also being lower than those observed in previous surveys.
   A similar trend was also noted for PCDD/Fs in air samples, while
   airborne PCBs were the only group of chemicals whose levels
   significantly increased. In any case, the global assessment of the data
   regarding the different pollutants and matrices indicates that there has
   not been a general increase in the environmental pollution around the
   facility. In addition, the environmental exposure to PCDD/Fs and PCBs by
   the population living nearby is still clearly lower than the dietary
   intake of these same chemical pollutants.}},

Title = {{Association between the ACE-I/D polymorphism and nicotine dependence
   amongst patients with lung cancer}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The biologically active peptide angiotensin II is cleaved from
   angiotensinogen by the renin and the angiotensin-converting enzyme
   (ACE), an enzymatic cascade known as the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).
   RAS may be important in the etiology of nicotine dependence by
   influencing dopaminergic signaling. In the present study, the
   association between an insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of ACE and
   nicotine dependence amongst patients with lung cancer was assessed. To
   date, several studies have shown the relevance of this polymorphic
   variant in both nicotine dependence and lung cancer. However, the
   present study is the first to address the potential role of the ACE-I/D
   polymorphism in nicotine dependence among patients with lung cancer.
   Genotyping was performed in 305 patients with lung cancer
   (males/females, 214/91). Significantly more male smokers had the ACE-I
   allele compared with male non-smokers (44.9 vs. 20.0\%; P<0.05). The
   risk of smoking was similar to 5-fold higher for males with the ACE-I
   allele (ACE-II homozygous and ACE-ID heterozygous) vs. ACE-DD homozygous
   (odds ratio, 5.47; 95\% confidence interval, 1.4-21.9; P=0.016). The
   pack-year smoking history in a subgroup of females with squamous cell
   carcinoma carrying the ACE-I allele was significantly lower compared
   with ACE-DD (37.1 +/- 14.1 vs. 57.0 +/- 29.1; F=4.5; P=0.046). The
   ACE-I/D polymorphism accounted for 17.6\% of the smoking severity in
   this patient group (beta, -0.42; multiple R-2 change, 0.176; P=0.046).
   These results suggest that the ACE-I/D polymorphism contributes to the
   risk of nicotine dependence and smoking severity in lung cancer patients
   in a sex-specific manner.}},

Abstract = {{It has been shown that altering nanomaterials through surface defects
   engineering (creation of oxygen vacancies) can be possible route to
   enhance the hydrogen production from agricultural residue of corn
   stover. Surface defects of oxygen vacancies in SnO2 nanoparticles were
   controlled through subsequent annealing in various environments such as
   oxygen (O), air and reducing gas (Ar95\% + H-2 5\%). Scanning electron
   microscope (SEM) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) were performed to analyze
   the morphology and crystalline structure. Diffuse reflectance
   spectroscopy was employed to study the reflectance spectra. Annealing
   atmosphere showed profound effect on band energy where red shift in band
   energy of A = 0.28 eV and A = 0.56 eV were observed after annealing in
   air and reducing gas respectively. In relation to control group,
   nanoparticles annealed in reducing and air environment showed increase
   in hydrogen production rate and accumulated hydrogen production of
   25.64\% (147 mL/h), 23.636\% (345 mL) and 16.24\% (136 mL/h), 11.83\%
   (312 mL) respectively. Reducing environment helped to generate more
   oxygen vacancies which enhances charge transfer mechanism, and
   eventually increases the metabolic rate to enhance the hydrogen
   production. Present work shows the novel pathway to regulate the charge
   flow to enhance the fermentative hydrogen production. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) bars have great potential for the
   strengthening of the existing buildings. They also can be used as a
   suitable replacement for steel bars. Therefore, the structural behavior
   and predicting strength of the constructed elements by this type of
   material is an important issue. However, the existing equations to
   determine the shear capacity of concrete elements reinforced with FRP
   are conservative and usually derived from developing the available
   relationships for steel-reinforced members, especially for beams. In
   study, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model was trained to extract a
   new equation to predict the shear strength of concrete beams reinforced
   with FRP bars. To this end, a large number of experimental data applied
   to the proposed ANN to predict the shear strength. Also, to investigate
   the effective percentage of each independent parameter on the considered
   output, sensitivity analyses were performed and discussed in detail.
   Finally, the accuracy of the proposed equation was investigated in
   comparison with the existing models. It could be approved that the
   provided equation with high accuracy presented better results than the
   other relationships.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{It is apodictic that postmodernism gravitates towards fragmented
   narratives, apparently ``real{''} diegesis and characters in a
   chaos-ridden frame. The postmodern novel is a ``looking glass{''} that
   delineates the vertigo instigated by ``reality,{''} which is an artifice
   that leads to amending interpretations. The paradox of ``fictionalizing
   the reality{''} creates heterogeneous reverberations among individuals.
   There is no preconception, but moments of revelation and realization.
   The theories of language alleviate the transcription of the intense and
   inevitable relationship between the text and the reader. The theoretical
   underpinnings, formulated on the basis of the multiple interpretations
   emanated by readers, foreground the fact that texts are constituents of
   our linguistic community, and are diversified with individual and
   cultural experiences. In this way, the consideration of the text extends
   beyond its stature of being a mere ``object.{''} Joyce Carol Oates'
   Wonderland is a text which abounds in intertextual references in the
   postmodern context. Oates has taken up the issues of destiny and
   identity from Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, as the
   thematic source. The protagonist, Jesse, does not enter a world of
   fantasy; rather, she enters a world that is real, absurd and
   phantasmagorical. The article purports to analyse Wonderland as
   ``hypertext{''} and accentuate how the fragments of discourses in it,
   based on Carroll's work as the hypotext, have acquired a transpositional
   change of meaning.}},

Abstract = {{Robots are leaving factories and entering urban spaces. In this paper, I
   will explore how we can integrate robots of various types into the urban
   landscape. I will distinguish between two perspectives: (1) the
   responsible design and use of urban robots and (2) robots as part of
   responsible urban innovations. The first viewpoint considers issues
   arising from the use of a robot in an urban environment. To develop a
   substantive understanding of Responsible Urban Robotics, we need to
   focus on normative implications of city life as the context in which in
   robots are being used. I will refer to the desirable qualities of city
   life as ``cityness{''} and will argue that we should design for
   cityness. The second approach asks how robots might be used to address
   challenges specific to cities. From the perspective of RRI, this may
   require participatory approaches in which the needs of the stakeholders
   are addressed. But we may also find inspiration in the work undertaken
   in architecture on expanding the concept and field to ensure that
   architects not only provide services to the lucky few but also create
   useful and beautiful spaces for the many. A dialogue with architects,
   urban designers, and urban planners may also be needed to successfully
   address the spatial issues raised by the presence of robots in the city.}},

Title = {{Characterization of vanadium of biological origin for possible
   applications in physics experiments}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{225}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{For the first time, vanadium of biological origin, extracted from
   centrifugal fraction of vanadium-storing blood cells of the Ascidia
   sydneiensis samea species, was characterized as regards its isotopic
   composition and content of natural radioactive elements potassium (K),
   thorium (Th) and uranium (U). The natural abundance of vanadium isotopes
   has been confirmed with high accuracy, thus excluding a possible
   selectivity within bio-chemical reactions of vanadium concentration in
   blood cells from seawater. A large potassium concentration (up to 5500 x
   10(-6) g g(-1)) was found in the blood cell samples. The concentration
   of thorium was determined to be about 30 x 10(-9) g g(-1), while the
   uranium concentration was about 150 x 10(-9) g g(-1). Hence, a highly
   efficient two-stage purification approach with a total vanadium recovery
   of better than 70\% was developed and applied. The final concentrations
   of K < 100 x 10(-6) g g(-1) and of U/Th < 0.5 x 10(-9) g g(-1) in the
   purified vanadium-containing samples were achieved. Vanadium extracted
   from centrifugal fraction of vanadium-storing blood cells after
   two-stage purification approach could be utilized in various
   applications, where a high chemical purity compound is required.
   However, to be used as a source of radiopure vanadium in
   ultra-low-background experiment aimed to search for V-50 beta decay, it
   should be further purified by Electron Beam Melting against residual
   potassium.}},

Abstract = {{Due to water scarcity and water pollution, the importance of water reuse
   is increasing more and more. As part of a German research programme on
   water reuse, the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant in the coastal
   region of northern Germany was used to investigate within the project
   MULTI-ReUse the direct treatment of tertiary effluent for usage in
   different applications in industry or agriculture. A modular constructed
   pilot system has been operated to optimize different treatment chains
   producing different water qualities simultaneously. The technological
   focus was put on membrane technologies, namely ultrafiltration (UF) and
   reverse osmosis (RO), and also biofiltration, adsorption and
   disinfection were part of the piloting. Beside the development of
   monitoring strategies for ensuring biological and chemical safe water
   qualities, the operational stability and the safe transport of water to
   the consumers were examined. The direct treatment of wastewater is a
   demanding task due to the lack of dilution and hydraulic retention time
   in the receiving water (environmental buffer). However, the multiple
   barrier approach guaranteed constant secure water. Fine adjustments of
   individual processes were particularly important. A stable operation of
   the UF could be realized in particular by using more or less
   intermittent inline coagulation as coating. The RO performance could be
   improved significantly by using monochloramine as disinfectant to
   minimize biofouling.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: Recent studies have hypothesized that sterile
   disc infection with the anaerobic Propionibacterium acnes, recently
   renamed Cutibacterium acnes, occurs in people with intervertebral disc
   (IVD) herniation. This study aimed to examine the presence of P. acnes
   in patients who have Low back pain (LBP) with Modic changes observed in
   their Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).
   Materials and Methods: Thirty-seven patients who were candidates for
   surgery due to disc herniation and demonstrated Modic changes in MRI
   were included in the study. Before the surgery, the level of pain in
   patients was assessed using the visual analog score (VAS). All patients
   were asked to fill in the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability
   Questionnaire. Intervertebral disc changes observed in MRI were recorded
   for all patients. Then, during surgery, sterile intervertebral disc
   samples were taken. P. acnes detection was performed using PCR in the
   laboratory. Data analysis with Chi-squared test, independent samples
   t-test, and Mann-Whitney U test in SPSS 18.0.
   Results: The mean age of 37 patients equaled 43.64 years and the mean
   duration of symptoms was 11.05 months. In molecular examination, of the
   37 individuals, the genome of P. acnes was positive in 23 cases (62.2\%)
   and negative in 14 (37.8\%). The relationship between VAS, disability
   score, changes in MRI, and patients' age with the positivity of the
   intervertebral disc sample was also assessed. Of these variables, only
   age was significantly correlated with the positive molecular finding,
   such that with an increase in age, the probability of positive findings
   was increased (p = 0.022).
   Conclusion: Based on the results, lumbar disc infection with P. acnes
   may play a significant role in causing Modic changes and the progression
   of the disease in patients with LBP.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{To help realize stable droplet manipulation, we present a study on the
   physical mechanism of interfacial instability and droplet atomization
   dynamics in acoustic levitation with ultrasonic phased arrays. Acoustic
   levitation is highly applicable in the fields of analytical chemistry
   and biology because container-less processing can prevent undesirable
   wall effects, such as nucleation and contamination resulting from the
   container walls. Although many studies demonstrated the atomization
   behavior in single-axis acoustic levitation, the breakup characteristics
   of levitated droplets in ultrasonic phased array levitation have been
   less studied. Here, we visualized the atomization behavior of ethanol,
   ethanol solution, and silicone oil droplets using a high-speed camera.
   The time evolution of the interfacial velocity of the droplets indicates
   a threshold for the droplet atomization. To elucidate atomization
   dynamics, the critical interfacial velocities of the levitated droplet
   immediately before its atomization are discussed and compared to the
   theoretical prediction based on the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Our
   experimental findings provide deeper physical insights into the
   levitation stability of droplets in ultrasonic phased array levitation
   for futuristic lab-in-a-drop applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose L0 norm optimization in a scrambled sparse
   representation domain and its application to an
   Encryption-then-Compression (EtC) system. We design a random unitary
   transform that conserves L0 norm isometry. The resulting encryption
   method provides a practical orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm
   that allows computation in the encrypted domain. We prove that the
   proposed method theoretically has exactly the same estimation
   performance as the nonencrypted variant of the OMP algorithm. In
   addition, we demonstrate the security strength of the proposed secure
   sparse representation when applied to the EtC system. Even if the
   dictionary information is leaked, the proposed scheme protects the
   privacy information of observed signals.}},

Title = {{Incremental and Approximate Computations for Accelerating Deep CNN
   Inference}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DATABASE SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Deep learning now offers state-of-the-art accuracy for many prediction
   tasks. A form of deep learning called deep convolutional neural networks
   (CNNs) are especially popular on image, video, and time series data. Due
   to its high computational cost, CNN inference is often a bottleneck in
   analytics tasks on such data. Thus, a lot of work in the computer
   architecture, systems, and compilers communities study how to make CNN
   inference faster. In this work, we show that by elevating the
   abstraction level and re-imagining CNN inference as queries, we can
   bring to bear database-style query optimization techniques to improve
   CNN inference efficiency. We focus on tasks that perform CNN inference
   repeatedly on inputs that are only slightly different. We identify two
   popular CNN tasks with this behavior: occlusion-based explanations (OBE)
   and object recognition In videos (ORV). OBE is a popular method for
   ``explaining{''} CNN predictions. It outputs a heatmap over the input to
   show which regions (e.g., image pixels) mattered most for a given
   prediction. It leads to many re-inference requests on locally modified
   inputs. ORV uses CNNs to identify and track objects across video frames.
   It also leads to many re-inference requests. We cast such tasks in a
   unified manner as a novel instance of the incremental view maintenance
   problem and create a comprehensive algebraic framework for incremental
   CNN inference that reduces computational costs. We produce materialized
   views of features produced inside a CNN and connect them with a novel
   multi-query optimization scheme for CNN re-inference. Finally, we also
   devise novel OBE-specific and ORV-specific approximate inference
   optimizations exploiting their semantics. We prototype our ideas in
   Python to create a tool called KRYPTON that supports both CPUs and CPUs.
   Experiments with real data and CNNs show that KRYPTON reduces runtimes
   by up to 5x (respectively, 35x) to produce exact (respectively,
   high-quality approximate) results without raising resource requirements.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-CASE REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Background Indications for transcatheter aortic valve (AV) implantation
   (TAVI) have been extended to patients with challenging anatomical
   features such as a bicuspid AV. However, no case reports of TAVI for
   tricuspid AV with a `calcium bridge' have been published.
   Case summary We report the case of an 87-year-old woman with severe
   symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS). Pre-procedural multi-detector computed
   tomography (MDCT) showed a calcium bridge between the non-coronary and
   left cusps. Although these cusps appeared to be fused together in the
   centre by the calcium bridge, the commissure area between the fused
   cusps appeared to normally open. We cracked apart the calcium bridge
   from the commissure area using balloon aortic valvuloplasty, which was
   guided by transoesophageal echocardiography. Subsequently, we
   successfully implanted a balloon-expandable transcatheter heart valve
   (THV).
   Discussion To our knowledge, this is the first report of TAVI for a
   tricuspid AV with a `calcium bridge' between the noncoronary and left
   cusps. In our patient, the unique structure of cusp fusing in the centre
   seemed to be caused by an acquired atherosclerotic process, as
   documented using a contemporary technique, i.e. MDCT. Cracking the
   calcium bridge with a balloon aortic valvuloplasty ensured that the THV
   adequately expanded. Severe AS caused by a calcium bridge may be treated
   with detailed evaluation of the AV morphology together with a procedural
   strategy planning.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{125}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Peanut allergy (PA) is associated with an economic and
   psychological burden on patients and families. Its diagnosis includes
   tests for peanut specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE), the values of which
   usually are categorized as positive or negative using a predefined
   cutoff (usually 0.35 kU/L). With the use of Bayes' theorem, this
   categorization can be replaced with a continuous interpretation of sIgE,
   which accounts for the prevalence of PA and history of ingestion.
   Objective: To evaluate a method for estimating the likelihood ratio (LR)
   for each value of sIgE by performing a pilot investigation with the
   results of oral food challenges. The LR could be used to estimate the
   probability of PA.
   Methods: The outcomes of oral food challenges and serum IgE values from
   117 children seen in an allergy clinic between January 2017 and November
   2019 were obtained. Polynomial regression of the receiver operation
   characteristics curve was used to determine an LR for each value of
   sIgE. Linear regression was used to estimate an LR for each value of
   sIgE.
   Results: sIgE ranged from less than 0.1 kU/L to 35 kU/L. Bayes' theorem
   and a receiver operation characteristics curve were used to estimate LRs
   for each value of peanut sIgE. The value of IgE associated with an LR of
   1 was 0.22 kU/L, which is comparable to other studies that used a value
   of 0.35 kU/L to separate positive from negative results.
   Conclusion: When combined with estimates of pretest probability, this
   method should permit the development of computerized decision-making
   algorithms to estimate the probability that a patient has PA. (C) 2020

Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1285-1291}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Context: Historically, methods of monitoring training loads in runners
   have used simple and convenient metrics, including the duration or
   distance run. Changes in these values are assessed on a week-to-week
   basis to induce training adaptations and manage injury risk. To date,
   whether different measures of external loads, including biomechanical
   measures, provide better information regarding week-to-week changes in
   external loads experienced by a runner is unclear. In addition, the
   importance of combining internal-load measures, such as session rating
   of perceived exertion (sRPE), with different external-load measures to
   monitor week-to-week changes in training load in runners is unknown.
   Objective: To compare week-to-week changes in the training loads of
   recreational runners using different quantification methods.
   Design: Case series.
   Setting: Community based.
   Patients or Other Participants: Recreational runners in Vancouver,
   British Columbia.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Week-to-week changes in running time, steps,
   and cumulative shock, in addition to product of each of these variables
   and the corresponding sRPE scores for each run.
   Results: Sixty-eight participants were included in the final analysis.
   Differences were present in week-to-week changes for running time
   compared with timeRPE (d= 0.24), stepsRPE (d = 0.24), and shockRPE (d=
   0.31). The differences between weekto-week changes in running time and
   cumulative shock were also significant at the overall group level (d=
   0.10).
   Conclusions: We found that the use of an internal training-load measure
   (sRPE) in combination with external load (training duration) provided a
   more individualized estimate of week-to-week changes in overall training
   stress. A better estimation of training stress has significant
   implications for monitoring training adaptations, resulting performance,
   and possibly injury risk reduction. We therefore recommend the regular
   use of sRPE and training duration to monitor training load in runners.
   The use of cumulative shock as a measure of external load in some
   runners may also be more valid than duration alone.}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies concerning the point electricity price forecasting have
   shown evidence that the hourly German Intraday Continuous Market is
   weak-form efficient. Therefore, we take a novel, advanced approach to
   the problem. A probabilistic forecasting of the hourly intraday
   electricity prices is performed by simulating trajectories in every
   trading window to receive a realistic ensemble to allow for more
   efficient intraday trading and redispatch. A generalized additive model
   is fitted to the price differences with the assumption that they follow
   a zero-inflated distribution, precisely a mixture of the Dirac and the
   Student's t-distributions. Moreover, the mixing term is estimated using
   a high-dimensional logistic regression with lasso penalty. We model the
   expected value and volatility of the series using i.a. autoregressive
   and no-trade effects or load, wind and solar generation forecasts and
   accounting for the non-linearities in e.g. time to maturity. Both the
   in-sample characteristics and forecasting performance are analysed using
   a rolling window forecasting study. Multiple versions of the model are
   compared to several benchmark models and evaluated using probabilistic
   forecasting measures and significance tests. The study aims to forecast
   the price distribution in the German Intraday Continuous Market in the
   last 3 h of trading, but the approach allows for application to other
   continuous markets, especially in Europe. The results prove superiority
   of the mixture model over the benchmarks gaining the most from the
   modelling of the volatility. They also indicate that the introduction of
   XBID reduced the market volatility.}},

Abstract = {{The field of autonomous vehicles is an area of great importance nowadays
   among Intelligent Transport Systems. These autonomous vehicles must meet
   high standards of robustness, safety and protection to make autonomous
   driving safer than human driving, thus improving current accident rates
   and energy efficiency, so its complete implementation in the market is
   expected in the long term. However, there are other areas, such as the
   agricultural and military sectors, where the demand for technologies
   related to autonomous driving is also high but the applicability could
   be faster. In this sense, the unmanned ground military vehicles (UGV)
   are a technology available in international armies for some years, but
   that is still subject to a series of technical, logistical and material
   limitations that reduce its applicability. This paper presents an
   automation kit for transforming military service vehicles into military
   UGVs, developed through the transfer of autonomous vehicle technology
   from the civil sector to the military sector. This kit has been
   installed in a quite common vehicle of the Spanish army, in order to
   provide two functional capabilities: autonomous navigation and
   teleoperation, in off-road environments with minimal or no traffic marks
   or infrastructure aids. The vehicle equipped with this kit is oriented
   to different missions such as circulation in convoys, operation as
   tele-operated probe vehicle and perimeter surveillance. The automation
   kit involves no permanent modifications in the vehicle that can be
   driven manually when desired, allows vehicles to be used both in
   missions in conflict zones and to support operations in emergencies and
   natural catastrophes, and can be easily installed in any kind of
   vehicle.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, on-chip clamp designs for enhancing destructive
   immunity of ICs mounted on systems against residual currents of system
   level immunity tests have been proposed. To cope with a long duration
   pulse (several tens mu s) such as a surge immunity test is one of the
   issues of the system level on-chip clamp. A clamp combined RC-trigger
   and static trigger is one approach to achieve both a low voltage
   clamping against component level ESD events and system level surge
   protection. However, the combined clamp using the conventional static
   trigger is difficult to achieve both a high current capability against
   the long pulse event and a low standby leakage current. This work
   presents a combined clamp that overcome the trade-off between the long
   pulse current capability and the standby leakage current using a
   variable holding voltage technique. The proposed clamp achieves the
   higher current capability against the long pulse event without
   increasing the standby leakage by holding voltage lowering while keeping
   a higher trigger voltage. It can contribute to increase PCB design
   freedom and to protect ICs efficiently from wider time range immunity
   tests.}},

Title = {{Effective hydraulic conductivity of stony soils: General effective
   medium theory}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{146}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Despite a longstanding interest in understanding the effects of rock
   fragments on soil hydraulic properties, physically-based models to
   describe the effective hydraulic conductivity of stony soils are still
   rare. The conductivity of stony soils is mostly described by simple
   scaling approaches, assuming impermeable rock fragments. We present a
   model based on the general effective medium (GEM) theory to calculate
   the effective hydraulic conductivity of stony soils. The model accounts
   for the volumetric content, shape, and orientation of rock fragments in
   the main direction of water flow. Rock fragments can either be permeable
   or impermeable in the model which allows to calculate the effective
   unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curve of stony soils over the full
   range of soil matric potentials. Existing models assume rock fragments
   to be isolated and their application is therefore limited to low to
   moderately stony soils. In GEM model interaction between rock fragments
   is allowed, which makes it applicable in stony soils with high contents
   of rock fragments. The mathematical simplicity of the model makes it
   suitable for practical applications and provides a strong theoretical
   basis for improving predictions of flow and transport in hydrological
   models applied in forested and agricultural watersheds and mountainous
   areas.}},

Title = {{A new multiphase and dynamic asphaltene deposition tool (MAD-ADEPT) to
   predict the deposition of asphaltene particles on tubing wall}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{195}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{As expounded, the precipitation and deposition of asphaltene particles
   in pipelines has been proved to be the most challenging flow assurance
   problem due to its unknown and complex behaviors. In this work, a new
   multicomponent, multiphase and dynamic tool was developed to model the
   aggregation and deposition of asphaltene particles in a bulk medium. The
   multiphase and dynamic asphaltene deposition tool, shortened as
   MAD-ADEPT is, in fact, a modified version of the previously developed
   ADEPT. The new tool was developed to make the asphaltene deposition and
   aggregation concepts in oil production wells more predictable. To tackle
   the complexity of the asphaltene problem, a bespoke algorithm was
   developed to predict asphaltene precipitation, aggregation and
   deposition. The algorithm was made up of three main modules, i.e.,
   thermodynamic, preprocessor and integrated time step adaptive modules.
   In the thermodynamic module, the Peng-Robinson equation of state was
   used and fine-tuned to estimate the fluid properties of multiphase
   hydrocarbon systems, while the PC-SAFT equation of state was used in
   order to obtain the asphaltene precipitation phase envelope (APE). In
   the preprocessor module, the sensitivity of the system to the reduction
   of wellbore inner diameter (ID) was examined. In the main module which
   could dynamically model the asphaltene aggregation and deposition, a
   non-isothermal multiphase mechanistic model, a
   convective-diffusive-reactive model and a non-convective volume of fluid
   model were solved simultaneously with an adaptive time step selection
   method. The new MAD-ADEPT was utilized to simulate a real field case to
   predict the asphaltene deposition in different time and space intervals
   along the production tubing. The results obtained from MAD-ADEPT was
   validated by those scant field data available in the literature. The
   results confirmed that the new tool can predict the asphaltene
   deposition reliably at various operating conditions within a production
   system. Also, the effects of multiphase flow as well as wellbore
   configurational parameters were studied on the amount of asphaltene
   deposition thickness on tubing wall. The accuracy of the results for the
   case studies, fast rate of convergence and less CPU computation time are
   the clearest advantages of the new asphaltene deposition dynamic tool
   over the previously developed ones.}},

Title = {{Small-Signal Modeling of PMSG-Based Wind Turbine for Low Voltage
   Ride-Through and Artificial Intelligent Studies}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, due to the several advantages of permanent magnet
   synchronous generator (PMSG), the number of wind farms utilizing this
   technology has been significantly grown. The determination of the
   failure mechanism in these devices is the major challenge which has been
   addressed in many studies. Particularly, response to grid code
   compliance by wind power in the voltage drop situation needs to be
   comprehensively analyzed. In this paper, a small signal model of a
   PMSG-based wind turbine for low voltage ride-through (LVRT) and suitable
   for stability and artificial intelligent studies is presented.
   Accordingly, the generator side converter controls the dc-link voltage,
   and the maximum power point tracking is performed by the grid side
   converter. Given the proposed model, the speed of the simulation for
   stability analysis studies can be significantly increased by intelligent
   methods. Furthermore, the simplified approach can be achieved for
   calculating the optimal coefficients of the proportionality-integral
   controller by intelligent methods in a short time. By simulating the
   proposed small-signal model and comparing it with the block-based
   simulation in MATLAB/SIMULINK software, the appropriate accuracy and
   efficiency of the proposed model are confirmed.}},

Abstract = {{The T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-3 (TIM-3)/galectin-9 (Gal-9)
   autocrine loop is an indispensable signaling in acute myeloid leukemia
   (AML) cells, which induces their self-renewal through activation of
   nuclear factor-kappa b (NF-kB) and beta-catenin pathways. In this study,
   we evaluated the effects of oridonin and doxorubicin on the TIM-3/Gal-9
   autocrine loop. We also evaluated oridonin anti-inflammatory and
   anti-cancer properties on U937 cells, as an AML cell line in comparison
   to doxorubicin as a common anthracycline drug for AML treatment.
   Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) was applied to evaluate the cytotoxicity of
   oridonin and doxorubicin on U937 cells and also to determine the impact
   of galectin-9 (Gal-9) on their proliferation. The effects of oridonin
   and doxorubicin on Gal-9, TIM-3, and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) gene
   expression were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction
   (RT-PCR). The Gal-9 secretion level was measured by enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and activation of NF-kB pathway was assessed
   by western blotting.
   In a dose-dependent manner, oridonin and doxorubicin were capable to
   eradicate U937 cells while Gal-9 expanded them. Following the treatment
   of U937 cells with oridonin, the expression of Gal-9, TIM-3, and IL-1
   beta genes was down-regulated, and the Gal-9 secretion and NF-kB
   phosphorylation were diminished, whereas doxorubicin increased all of
   these factors.
   Doxorubicin is a common treatment agent in AML, but it may induce
   inflammation and up-regulate the TIM3/Gal-9 autocrine loop, consequently
   can enhance the possibility of disease relapse. Meanwhile, oridonin is
   capable to inhibit the essential signaling pathways in AML cells and
   reduce the inflammation and expansion of tumor cells and postpone AML
   recurrence.}},

Title = {{In vitro screening of probiotic properties of Lactobacillus plantarum
   isolated from fermented milk product}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The screening of traditional fermented products is essential
   for the assessment of safety, security, and further development of
   functional foods for the well-being of human health. The aim of the
   present study was to isolate and identify bacteria from fermented raw
   milk samples that exhibit health benefits upon consumption.
   Methods: In order to confirm the isolates as probiotics, several in
   vitro assays were conducted to assess the probiotic properties of
   isolated bacteria. The initial screening includes tolerance to acid,
   bile, pancreatin, and NaCl. The cell surface properties demonstrate
   their interaction with mucosal epithelium, which includes hydrophobicity
   and auto-aggregation assay. Safety assessment was done by performing
   haemolytic test and antibiotic susceptibility test. The antagonistic
   activity of probiotic strain was further evaluated against some
   pathogenic bacteria.
   Results: Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) isolated from fermented
   raw milk was preliminarily identified by biochemical tests and further
   confirmed using 16S rRNA identification. The isolate designated as L.
   plantarum strain GCC\_19M1 demonstrated significant tolerance to low pH,
   0.3\% bile, 0.5\% pancreatin, and 5\% NaCl. In the presence of simulated
   gastric juice (at pH 3), the isolate exhibited a survival rate of
   93.48-96.97\%. Furthermore, the development of ecological niches in the
   human gut and their successful accumulation have been revealed by
   auto-aggregation and hydrophobicity properties. Absence of haemolytic
   activity ensures the non-virulent nature of the strain. Lactobacillus
   plantarum strain GCC\_19M1 showed susceptibility towards gentamicin,
   tetracycline, kanamycin, meropenem, and ceftriaxone and exhibited an
   antagonistic effect on pathogenic bacteria.
   Conclusion: The obtained results conveyed that L. plantarum strain
   GCC\_19M1 has strong probiotic potential, and its presence in the
   fermented raw milk products may serve as a potent functional probiotic
   food.

Abstract = {{The boron (B) concentration surpasses the plant need in arid and
   semi-arid regions of the world, resulting in phyto-toxicity. Salicylic
   acid (SA) is an endogenous signaling molecule responsible for stress
   tolerance in plants and is a potential candidate for ameliorating B
   toxicity. In this study, the effects of seed priming with SA (0, 50, 100
   and 150 mu M for 12 h) on the growth, pigmentation and mineral
   concentrations of maize (Zea mays L.) grown under B toxicity were
   investigated. One-week old seedlings were subjected to soil spiked with
   B (0, 15 and 30 mg kg(-1) soil) as boric acid. Elevating concentrations
   of B reduced the root and shoot length, but these losses were
   significantly restored in plants raised from seeds primed with 100 mu M
   of SA. The B application decreased the root and shoot fresh/dry
   biomasses significantly at 30 mg kg(-1) soil. The chlorophyll and
   carotenoid contents decreased with increasing levels of B, while the
   contents of anthocyanin, H2O2, ascorbic acid (ASA) and glycinebetaine
   (GB) were enhanced. The root K and Ca contents were significantly
   increased, while a reduction in the shoot K contents was recorded. The
   nitrate concentration was significantly higher in the shoot as compared
   to the root under applied B toxic regimes. However, all of these B
   toxicity effects were diminished with 100 mu M SA applications. The
   current study outcomes suggested that the exogenously applied SA
   modulates the response of plants grown under B toxic conditions, and
   hence could be used as a plant growth regulator to stimulate plant
   growth and enhance mineral nutrient uptake under B-stressed conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The usefulness of Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) scaling in explaining
   extremely heavy precipitations is explored in the present-day climate
   and in pseudo-global-warming (PGW) conditions. This is analyzed by
   conducting regional-scale numerical simulations at 1-km grid resolution
   for two recent extreme rainfall events that occurred in Japan: the case
   in northern Kyushu during 5 - 6 July 2017 and the case in Shikoku Island
   during 5 - 8 July 2018. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model
   was used for the simulation, and the data samples were collected at each
   grid point individually for each hour over the two regions. We found
   that the frequency and intensity of extremely heavy precipitation
   associated with the two events are increased under PGW conditions. The
   extremely heavy precipitations (> 50 mm h(-1)) followed CC scaling for
   the temperatures up to 22 degrees C in the present-day climate, while
   those under the PGW conditions followed CC-scaling up to 24 degrees C.
   The peak intensity of the extremely heavy precipitations in the
   precipitation-temperature relationship is found as similar to 140 mm
   h(-1) at 25 degrees C in the present-day climate, while the same with
   PGW conditions is projected as similar to 160 mm h(-1) at 27 degrees C.
   The increasing rate of the extremely heavy precipitations in the
   present-climate condition is noticed as similar to 3 \% degrees C-1 and
   that under the PGW conditions is anticipated as similar to 3.5 \%
   degrees C-1. The increase in peak precipitation intensity and the rate
   of precipitation increase against temperature in future warming climate
   are attributed to the decrease in temperature lapse rate and increase in
   atmospheric water vapor and convective available potential energy. To
   our knowledge, this is one of the first quantitative investigations of
   CC scaling of extremely heavy precipitations based on case studies.}},

Abstract = {{Boron nitride (BN) supported palladium (Pd) nanostructured catalyst, as

   transmission electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron
   microscopy, energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy methods. The potential and efficiency of the BN supported
   Pd NPs as an active and stable nanostructured catalyst were verified in
   the reduction of nitroaromatics. Excellent yields of the corresponding
   aryl amines in water were obtained and due discussion were included
   about the catalytic activity of the synthesized catalyst. It was also
   indicated that the nanostructured catalyst can be recycled at least for
   six consecutive cycles in the reduction of nitrobenzene, without losing

Abstract = {{Congestion is one of the most important subjects in Data Envelopment
   Analysis (DEA) which helps the Decision Maker (DM) to decide about
   changing the size of units. The estimation of congestion has attractive
   advantages from different perspectives. For example, the total cost of a
   partiular DMU, in which the congestion occurs, can be reduced by the
   decreases in inputs. On the other hand, the output of units can be
   increased by the recognizing and eliminating the congestion of DMUs and
   so, the total profit of decision making units can be increased. Hence,
   the management is eager to know how to recognize and eliminate the
   congestion of units. Most of the existing methods to estimation of the
   congestion in the literature consider only the desirable outputs. This
   study focuses on the evaluation of congestion in the presence of
   undesirable outputs and proposes an approach to recognize the congestion

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In the paper, we consider a multi-server retrial queueing system with
   setup time which is motivated by applications in power-saving data
   centers with the ON-OFF policy, where an idle server is immediately
   turned off and an off server is set up upon arrival of a customer.
   Customers that find all the servers busy join the orbit and retry for
   service after an exponentially distributed time. For this model, we
   derive the stability condition which depends on the setup time and turns
   out to be more strict than that of the corresponding model with an
   infinite buffer which is independent of the setup time. We propose
   asymptotic methods to analyze the system under the condition that the
   delay in the orbit is extremely long. We show that the scaled-number of
   customers in the orbit converges to a diffusion process. Using this
   diffusion limit, we obtain approximations for the steady-state
   probability distribution of the number of busy servers and that of the
   number of customers in the orbit. We verify the accuracy of the
   approximations by simulations and numerical analysis. Numerical results
   show that the retrial system under the limiting condition consumes more
   energy than that with an infinite buffer in front of the servers.}},

Abstract = {{Difflugia australis, first described by Playfair (1918), has a unique
   morphotype. However, in the absence of morphometric data, it has not yet
   been reliably classified within the largest testate amoeba genus
   Difflugia. In this study D. australis collected from a subtropical
   reservoir in southeast China was investigated by means of light and
   scanning electron microscopy. Basing on biometrical data, we provide an
   improved diagnosis of this little known species. Difflugia australis is
   different from other similar congeners (i.e., D. bacillariarum Perty,
   1849 and D. elegans Penard, 1890) mainly by the combination of the
   following features: the shell is broadly ovate, with rounded dome and
   convex sides converging down to a very short distance from the aperture
   and diverging suddenly into a short rim (collar). It is usually more or
   less asymmetrical, with one side being more dilated than the other. The
   shell surface is slightly smooth, composed of flat siliceous plates of
   irregular shape and size, mixed with fine grains; microbial spores of
   comparable forms are spread on the shell surface; particles are often
   interspersed with a network of organic cement with unique mesh pattern;
   one (sometimes two) slanting spine-like posterior end of the shell is
   variable in form; collar is mainly formed by small plates of equal size.
   The dimensions of the shell are: total shell length 88-106 mu m; shell
   width 53-88 mu m; aperture diameter 19-28 mu m; collar height 3-6 mu m;
   spine length 3-23 mu m. The size frequency distributions of both total
   shell length and shell width indicate that it is a size-monomorphic
   species with low variability.}},

Abstract = {{Spirometra tapeworms (Cestoda: Diphyllobothriidae) collected from
   carnivorous mammals in Tanzania were identified by the DNA sequence
   analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) and
   internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), and by morphological
   characteristics. A total of 15 adult worms were collected from stool
   samples and carcasses of Panthera leo, Panthera pardus, and Crocuta
   crocuta in the Serengeti and Selous ecosystems of Tanzania. Three
   Spirometra species: S. theileri, S. ranarum and S. erinaceieuropaei were
   identified based on morphological features. Partial cox1 sequences (400
   bp) of 10 specimens were revealed. Eight specimens showed 99.5\%
   similarity with Spirometra theileri (MK955901), 1 specimen showed 99.5\%
   similarity with the Korean S. erinaceieuropaei and 1 specimen had 99.5\%
   similarity with Myanmar S. ranarum. Sequence homology estimates for the
   ITS1 region of S. theileri were 89.8\% with S. erinaceieuropaei, 82.5\%
   with S. decipiens, and 78.3\% with S. ranarum; and 94.4\% homology was
   observed between S. decipiens and S. ranarum. Phylogenetic analyses were
   performed with 4 species of Spirometra and 2 species of
   Dibothriocephalus (= Diphyllobothrium). By both ML and BI methods, cox1
   and ITS1 gave well supported, congruent trees topology of S.
   erinaceieuropaei and S. theileri with S. decipiens and S. ranarum
   forming a clade. The Dibothriocephalus species were sisters of each
   other and collectively forming successive outgroups. Our findings
   confirmed that 3 Spirometra species (S. theileri, S. ranarum, and S.
   erinaceieuropaei) are distributed in the Serengeti and Selous ecosystems

Abstract = {{Currently, research focuses on the application of newer biocoagulant
   products in wastewater treatment. In this study, the performance of
   cactus juice to clarify Olive Mill Wastewater (OMW) was investigated by
   using Jar-test experimentation and assessed by physicochemical analysis
   of the obtained supernatant: turbidity, total suspended solids (TSS),
   (lambda(465); lambda(395)) absorbance, polyphenols (pp), chemical oxygen
   demand (COD) and Fourier-Transform-Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) on
   lyophilized sludge. A series of experiments were conducted to estimate
   the influence of various experimental parameters, such as the amounts of
   biocoagulants used, time, stirring speed, and pH. The study showed the
   optimal coagulation conditions were as follows: sample pH(10); cactus
   juice dose, 10\% (v/v); rapid mixing time, 30 s at a speed of 150
   rp/min. Under these conditions, the overall removals of 74\% for COD,
   93\% for turbidity and 51\% for polyphenols were achieved. As referring
   to the FTIR analysis, the cactus juice of Opuntia spp. operates
   predominantly through an adsorption interparticle bridging coagulation
   mechanism. These results are encouraging in the context of developing a
   low-cost technology and eco-friendly approach for the effective
   management of OMW.}},

Abstract = {{Rudist-rich carbonates are common in central Tunisia. They constitute
   frequent intercalations in Upper Cretaceous series, particularly within
   the Cenomanian-Campanian interval. They are generally transgressive upon
   shallower deposits, such as Lower Cretaceous siliciclastic sediments, or
   Upper Cretaceous tidal flat deposits. The sequence stratigraphy analysis
   of the study carbonate series reveals discontinuities and unconformities
   that mark the boundaries between the identified sequences. These
   unconformities, which are mainly represented by oxidized hard-grounds
   with several borings and micro-karstification features, are in relation
   with a sea level drop or a tectonic uplift of central Tunisia during the
   Late Cretaceous. Sea-level changes, tectonic movements, and climatic
   events appear acting a lot for the growth but also for the demise of
   Upper Cretaceous rudist and coral communities. Globally, the Upper
   Aptian-Lower Albian shallow-water carbonate deposits are unconformably
   overlain by Upper Albian-Cenomanian transgressive deposits, locally rich
   in organic matter, represented by black-shales. This unconformity, which
   is identified at least in the whole central Tunisia, consists of a
   regional sequence boundary that announces typical greenhouse conditions
   and the beginning of a carbonate-rich sedimentation admitting frequent
   intercalations of rudist-sponge-coral-rich deposits. Above this main
   regional unconformity, the Upper Cretaceous series show additional
   sequence boundaries separating 3rd-order sequences. Overall, six
   transgressive-regressive sequences were identified within the
   Cenomanian-Campanian interval. The identification of these 3rd-order
   sequences including rudist-rich deposits has helped a lot to establish
   correlations at least at regional, north African (Algeria, Egypt), and
   Tethyan scales (Italy, Germany and other areas). In central Tunisia,
   Rudist-coral-rich carbonates appear both during shallowing and at the
   beginning of deepening stages. However, according to our study, they are
   obviously more common and well represented during transgressions. In
   this context, they constitute deepening-upward cycles in transgressive
   systems tracts. For these reasons, they could be considered as markers
   of most Late Cretaceous transgressive events, essentially the
   Cenomanian-Turonian and the Campanian global transgressions. Commonly,
   the Upper CenomanianLower Turonian transgressive event, for example, is
   globally marked by the deposition of black-shales. However, in shallower
   environments, more closed to carbonate platforms and their margins,
   regionally extended rudist-coral-rich carbonates could be used as
   markers of such transgressive event.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The research paper investigates auditors' dysfunctional
   behaviors in relation to performance appraisals. It explores the
   dysfunctional audit behavior (DAB) differences among
   experienced/inexperienced and male/female auditors when expecting
   performance appraisals, how their perception of DAB changes and how
   their reactive-outcomes vary. Design/methodology/approach The survey
   comprises statements pulled from performance appraisal templates used by
   the Big Four audit firms in the UK. The sample has been tested during
   two different periods to highlight variations in the perception of DAB.
   Findings Experienced auditors become more tolerant of DAB compared to
   their perception when they were inexperienced. Inexperienced male
   auditors are generally more accepting of DAB compared to their
   inexperienced female counterparts. Experienced female respondents
   continue to be less accepting of DAB. Originality/value The study
   associates performance appraisal procedures with DAB. The analysis
   examines the perception of dysfunctional behavior according to the level
   of experience auditors (males and females) accumulate over time.}},

Abstract = {{The unprecedented Nazarov cyclization of a model divinyl ketone using
   phosphonium-based Deep Eutectic Solvents as sustainable non-innocent
   reaction media is described. A two-level full factorial Design of
   Experiments was conducted for elucidating the effect of the components
   of the eutectic mixture and optimizing the reaction conditions in terms
   of temperature, time, and substrate concentration. In the presence of
   the Deep Eutectic Solvent (DES) triphenylmethylphosphonium
   bromide/ethylene glycol, it was possible to convert more than 80\% of
   the 2,4-dimethyl-1,5-diphenylpenta-1,4-dien-3-one, with a specific
   conversion, into the cyclopentenone Nazarov derivative of 62\% (16 h, 60
   degrees C). For the reactions conducted in the DES
   triphenylmethylphosphonium bromide/acetic acid, quantitative conversions
   were obtained with percentages of the Nazarov product above 95\% even at
   25 degrees C. Surface Responding Analysis of the optimized data
   furnished a useful tool to determine the best operating conditions
   leading to quantitative conversion of the starting material, with
   complete suppression of undesired side-reactions, high yields and
   selectivity. After optimization, it was possible to convert more than
   90\% of the model substrate into the desired cyclopentenone with cis
   percentages up to 77\%. Experimental validation of the implemented model
   confirmed the robustness and the suitability of the procedure, leading
   to possible further extension to this specific combination of
   experimental designs to other substrates or even to other synthetic
   processes of industrial interest.}},

Abstract = {{The current study evaluated the intergenerational transmission of harsh

   the association with child aggression. The study included 218 Generation
   1 (G1) mothers and fathers, their adolescent (Generation 2; G2) who
   participated from middle adolescence through adulthood, and the
   3rd-generation (G3) child between ages 3-5 years and 6-10 years. G1
   behavior was examined when G2 was 16 and 18 years old; G2 alcohol
   problems and marijuana use were assessed when G2 was 19 and 21 years
   old. G2 emotional distress and harsh parenting were examined when the G3
   child was between 3 and 5 years old. Finally, G3 aggression was assessed
   between 6 and 10 years old. Results showed continuity of G1 behavior
   when G2 was in adolescence to G2 behavior in adulthood. G1 alcohol
   problems and G1 harsh parenting were both associated with G3 aggression
   through G2 alcohol problems, G2 emotional distress, and G2 harsh
   parenting. Results suggest that G1 problem behavior as experienced by G2
   adolescents in the family of origin plays an important role in G2
   alcohol problems in emerging adulthood, which leads to G2 emotional
   distress and G2 harsh parenting in adulthood, which is related to G3
   aggression in the early elementary school years.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of this study was to identify the effect of massage,
   EMLA cream, and the combination of these two methods on changes in
   physiological indices because of pain caused by intravenous line
   insertion in preschool children.
   Design: A four-group randomized nonblinded clinical trial with factorial
   design.
   Methods: In total, 140 eligible 3to 6-year-old children entered the
   study in Tabriz Children's Hospital in 2017 and were randomly allocated
   to four groups (EMLA cream, massage, combination of the two, and
   control). Physiological responses were measured before and immediately
   after interventions in all groups. Data were collected and analyzed
   using SPSS version 19.
   Findings: Comparison of the physiological indices changes caused by pain
   between groups showed that changes in children's heart rate (HR) and
   respiratory rate (RR) in the EMLA group and in the combined method group
   were statistically significant (P < .05). No significant differences
   were found in systolic blood pressure and oxygen saturation (SPo2)
   between the four groups.
   Conclusions: Results indicated that EMLA cream was more effective than
   massage and a combination of EMLA and massage in reducing an increase in
   the HR and RR caused by pain in children. Massage alone was not
   effective in significantly lowering the children's increased
   physiological indices such as the HR and RR, and it seems the
   effectiveness of massage is more noticeable in conjunction with EMLA
   cream. (c) 2020 American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses. Published by

Abstract = {{Compressed air energy storage may be an important asset for large-scale

   Convective heat transfer in liquid piston compressors have not been

   characterize the system's behavior. An experimental analysis of air
   compression using liquid piston is proposed for chambers with big
   dimensions, which leads to the development of several correlations. From
   these assessments, it is possible to describe the presence of two
   different convective heat exchange patterns, as well as the liquid
   piston position in the transition between them. A numerical model is
   developed by employing these correlations. The comparison between
   numerical and experimental results enables the validation of such
   correlations for a specific set of parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Weight on bit (WOB) and differential pressure (DIFP) are two essential
   parameters derived from surface sensors during the drilling process.
   However, there can be significant errors in these measurements due to
   improper zeroing of these traces. Regular zeroing of WOB is important to
   ensure that it is calibrated for additional stands that have been added
   to the drillstring. Similarly, regular zeroing of DIFP is important to
   ensure that added hydrostatic pressure, which increases with depth, is
   taken into account, and to ensure that DIFP has been calibrated to the
   correct pump rate. In this paper, we quantify the errors due to
   forgotten and incorrect zeroing, and discuss an algorithm that was
   developed to automatically zero WOB and DIFP to eliminate these errors.
   This study has two main sections. In the first section, the current
   practice of zeroing WOB (prior to rotary drilling) is analyzed in 40
   onshore wells. It is found for 86\% of all stands that WOB is either
   zeroed incorrectly or not at all. An algorithm is developed to determine
   the appropriate time to perform the zero WOB operation. Using this
   algorithm, it is found that the average WOB error per stand due to
   improper zeroing is 16.8 and 17.6\% in the vertical and lateral wellbore
   sections, respectively. Further, it was found that repeated forgotten
   zeroes could result in large errors, particularly in the vertical where
   8\% of stands have WOB inaccuracies of more than 30\%. In the second
   section, the analysis is repeated for DIFP and it is found that zeroing
   DIFP is forgotten in 51\% of all stands, resulting in errors of 17.5 and
   8.9\% in the vertical and lateral, respectively. In the vertical, 9.9\%
   of stands have DIFP inaccuracies of more than 30\% due to forgotten
   zeroing. Applying these algorithms to historic data can eliminate these
   errors, and improve the effectiveness of data-based drilling
   optimization and analytics. Further, these algorithms could be
   implemented in an electronic drilling recorder (EDR) to improve the
   quality of real-time data at the rig.}},

   radiographic knee OA. All had a delayed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic
   resonance imaging of cartilage (dGEMRIC) 20years after the ACL injury,
   using the T1 transverse relaxation time in the presence of gadolinium
   (T1Gd) which estimates the concentration of glycosaminoglycans in
   hyaline cartilage. Synovial fluid samples were aspirated acutely
   (between 0 and 18days) and during 1 to 5 follow up visits between 0.5
   and 7.5years after injury. We quantified synovial fluid concentrations
   of aggrecan (epitopes 1-F21 and ARGS), cartilage oligomeric matrix
   protein, matrix metalloproteinase-3 and tissue inhibitor of
   metalloproteinase-1 by immunoassays, and sulfated glycosaminoglycans by

   within the chondroitin sulfate 2 region of aggrecan. Linear regression
   analyses (adjusted for age, sex, body mass index and time between injury
   and sampling) showed that acute higher synovial fluid 1-F21-aggrecan
   concentrations were associated with shorter T1Gd values 20years after
   injury, i.e. inferior cartilage quality (standardized effects between
   -0.67 and-1.0). No other statistically significant association was found
   between molecular biomarkers and T1Gd values.ConclusionHigher acute
   synovial fluid 1-F21-aggrecan concentrations in ACL injured patients,
   who managed to cope without ACL reconstruction and were without
   radiographic knee OA, were associated with inferior knee cartilage
   quality assessed by dGEMRIC 20years after injury.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to investigate the factors which impact the possibility
   of Environmental Management Accounting (EMA) implementation in
   automobile companies in Vietnam. A survey was carried out with
   automobile enterprises' managers, getting 198 usable respondents, with
   data and theoretical model analyzed by using SPSS with EFA method.
   Results indicated that in Vietnamese automobile enterprises, the
   possibility of EMA implementation was driven by elements including
   motivation to reduce production costs, reactions to environmental
   issues, compliance to legislation, procedures and processes in the
   working environment which they are in business. The government and
   professional institutions should play a vital role in promoting EMA
   practices by issuing specific guidelines and continuous training.
   Besides, tax authorities should apply the favor policies such as tax
   incentives to stimulate interest enterprises to implement EMA. However,
   this study's results only reflect about 63.7\% of the impact to the
   implementation of EMA in Vietnamese automotive enterprises, so there are
   still some other factors that should be found out in the future
   researches. This is the first attempt to systematically analyze
   enterprises' perception and willingness to apply EMA in Vietnamese
   automobile industry. This study contributes to not only the existing
   empirical literature of EMA but also enterprises' managers in Vietnam
   and other transitional economies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the function of music and sound as important
   elements of documentary film communication. It considers the soundtrack
   to have equal value as the visual track. This is even more appalling
   when sound is viewed as an aesthetic constituent of a film or as
   acoustic signs with equal communicative value as visual signs. Two films
   are used to show the role music and sound play in facilitating
   comprehension in a documentary film. Focusing particularly on
   testimonies, narrative commentary, filmic silence and music, the study
   shows how documentary films provide a unique medium to engage an
   audience in a story of facts and provides a unique vehicle for
   information transmission. The success of these two films among
   mainstream audiences indicates the power of a thoughtful and intentional
   soundtrack which accentuates the subject without dictating it and
   provides examples of a utilization of music to build an emotional
   connection between the audience and the film's subject matter.}},

Abstract = {{This research examines the relation between political corruption and
   mergers and acquisitions (M\&As). We find that local corruption
   increases firm acquisitiveness but decreases firm targetiveness. The
   levels of corruption in acquirer areas relate positively to the bid
   premiums and negatively to the likelihood of deal completion. Corruption
   motivates acquiring firms to use excess cash for payment, which
   mitigates the negative effect of corruption on acquirer shareholder
   value. The evidence indicates that acquisitions help acquiring firms
   convert cash into hard-to-extract assets and relocate assets from the
   high to low corruption areas, thereby shielding their liquid assets from
   expropriation by local officials.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Although mature industrial wireless sensor network applications
   increasingly require low-power operations, deterministic communications,
   and end-to-end reliability, it is very difficult to achieve these goals
   because of link burstiness and interference. In this paper, we propose a
   novel link quality estimation mechanism named the burstiness
   distribution metric, which uses the distribution of burstiness in the
   links to deal with variations in wireless link quality. First, we
   estimated the quality of the link at the receiver node by counting the
   number of consecutive packets lost in each link. Based on that, we
   created a burstiness distribution list and estimated the number of
   transmissions. Our simulation in the Cooja simulator from Contiki-NG
   showed that our proposal can be used in scheduling as an input metric to
   calculate the number of transmissions in order to achieve a reliability
   target in industrial wireless sensor networks.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the production of natural nitrogen-doped carbon
   from expired fresh milk for use in a supercapacitor electrode. The
   material was prepared by hydrothermal carbonization followed by
   sequential KOH-H3PO4 activation. Carbon modified with KOH at a ratio of
   1:1 had the largest Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of 465 m(2)/g.
   Furthermore, the presence of surface functional groups played an
   important role in determining the specific capacitance. The highest
   specific capacitance of 186.3 F/g was obtained from carbon modified with
   C:KOH at 1:1 and 50 wt\% H3PO4. An electrochemical impedance study
   suggested that charge storage resembled a modified Randles circuit.
   Carbon derived from expired milk and exposed to sequential KOH and H3PO4
   modification was shown to be a promising candidate material for use as
   electrodes in electric double-layer supercapacitors, while

Abstract = {{In this study, leachate from Quang Hanh landfill (Quang Ninh) was
   treated by a combination of Fenton and coagulation processes. The
   experiment was conducted with various Fenton (i.e., pH, H2O2/Fe(II)
   ratio and dosage, and reaction time) and coagulation (i.e., dosage,
   aeration time, and flocculant concentration) conditions to determine the
   best condition for treatment of the leachate. Regarding Fenton process,
   under the best condition, the COD removal efficiency of around 80 \%
   with an inlet concentration of 624 +/- 80 mg/L, meeting QCVN
   25:2009/BTNMT (Column B2) while 75 \% of color, 25 \% of ammonia, and 12
   \% of TSS were removed, creating favorable conditions for the next stage
   of treatment by coagulation. In terms of coagulation, CaO and
   polyaluminum chloride (PAC) were sequentially used for treating the
   leachate after Fenton process. After treatment with CaO (6 g/L, 180
   min), PAC (1,500 mg/L), and A101 (2 mg/L), the removal efficiencies

Abstract = {{Numerical simulation of hydrogen-air detonation characteristics in tubes
   equipped with arc obstacles of different chord lengths is carried out by
   using OpenFoam package. The results show the optimal chord length is
   half the diameter, in which the detonation wave propagates at a high
   velocity while maintaining small deflagration-to-detonation transition
   distance. Three different regimes were found in the flame acceleration
   and detonation initiation for different chord length: (1) For the small
   chord length, the flame experienced the transition from fingertip to
   tulip flame, then recovered to fingertip flame again until initiation.
   The detonation is caused by the hot spot formed by the spontaneous
   combustion of unburned premixed gas. (2) For the intermediate chord
   length, the tulip flame quenched by reverse flow will turn into
   fingertip flame under the jet effect of obstacles. Then, the fingertip
   flame is transformed into tulip flame again under the action of flow
   instability. The detonation is initiated by the fusion of two local hot
   spots produced by the coupling of tulip flame and diffraction wave. (3)
   For the large chord length, the flame propagates as a fingertip flame.
   The detonation is initiated by the explosion of the flame surface
   compressed by reflected wave and shock wave.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to compare the volatile organic compound (VOC) profiles
   of cooked meat from different species. Four burgers were prepared and
   cooked from each of 100 meat samples obtained from 100 animals of five
   species/categories (chicken, turkey, pork, veal and beef) sourced from
   five supermarkets and five local butchers. Two burgers were cooked in a
   water bath and two were grilled. Direct proton-transfer-reaction
   time-of-flight mass-spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) analysis of the sample
   headspace yielded 129 mass peaks, 64 of which were tentatively
   identified. The results showed that turkey and chicken had the largest
   and the smallest total concentrations of all VOCs, respectively. Of the
   mammalian meats, veal and beef had greater total VOC concentrations than
   pork. The proportions of the amounts of all the individual VOCs differed
   significantly according to species. Additionally, 14 of 17 independent
   latent explanatory factors (LEFs) identified by multivariate analysis
   exhibited significant differences between meat species/categories, and
   therefore helped to characterize them. PTR-ToF-MS has been used for the
   first time for the rapid and non-invasive profiling of cooked meat of
   different species/categories. Knowledge of specific VOC profiles paves
   new avenues for research aimed at characterizing species through sensory
   description, at authenticating species or at identifying abnormalities

Abstract = {{The interaction of linear waves with periodic structures arises in a
   broad range of scientific and engineering applications. For such
   problems it is often mandatory that numerical simulations be rapid,
   robust, and highly accurate. With such qualities in mind High-Order
   Spectral methods are often utilized, and in this paper we describe and
   test a perturbative method which fits into this class. Here we view the
   inhomogeneous (but laterally periodic) permittivity as a perturbation of
   a constant value and pursue (regular) perturbation theory. We
   demonstrate that not only does this lead to a fast and accurate
   numerical method, but also that the expansion of the field in this
   geometric parameter is valid for large deformations (up to topological
   obstruction). Finally, we show that, if the permittivity deformation is
   spatially analytic, then so is the field scattered by it.}},

Title = {{Modeling of Subsurface Throughflow in Urban Pervious Areas}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Infiltration excess runoff, i.e., runoff as a result of the rainfall
   intensity exceeding the infiltration capacity of the soil surface, has
   traditionally been considered the only contributor to the surface runoff
   from urban pervious areas. However, recent studies show that subsurface
   throughflow also can be a significant contributor to urban stormwater
   runoff. Although rainfall-runoff from urban pervious areas can
   contribute with large quantities of runoff, only little knowledge exists
   on this topic. In this study, experimental field observations of
   subsurface throughflow from the literature are used to assess the
   capability of different models to simulate this type of runoff. It is
   investigated how well three new modeling approaches in urban drainage
   engineering (linear reservoir, regression, and shallow neural network
   models) performs in simulating subsurface throughflow compared to two
   commonly used models (the time-area and kinematic wave model). The
   models are compared with the measured runoff rate and evaluated by the
   root mean square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and
   Bayesian likelihood (L). Generally, a neural network containing 60
   neurons and using up to 180 min of data back in time produces the best
   results (RMSE=0.59 Lmin-1, NSE=0.91, and L=0.92). However, both the
   kinematic wave (RMSE=1.06 L min-1, NSE=0.71, and L=0.76) and linear
   reservoir model (RMSE=0.98 L min-1, NSE=0.75, and L=0.78) generate
   reasonable results despite their significantly simpler modeling
   approaches.}},

Title = {{Effect of decision rules in choice experiments on hunting and bushmeat
   trade}},
Journal = {{CONSERVATION BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1393-1403}},

Abstract = {{Providing insight on decisions to hunt and trade bushmeat can facilitate
   improved management interventions that typically include enforcement,
   alternative employment, and donation of livestock. Conservation
   interventions to regulate bushmeat hunting and trade have hitherto been
   based on assumptions of utility- (i.e., personal benefits) maximizing
   behavior, which influences the types of incentives designed. However, if
   individuals instead strive to minimize regret, interventions may be
   misguided. We tested support for 3 hypotheses regarding decision rules
   through a choice experiment in Tanzania. We estimated models based on
   the assumptions of random utility maximization (RUM) and pure random
   regret maximization (P-RRM) and combinations thereof. One of these
   models had an attribute-specific decision rule and another had a
   class-specific decision rule. The RUM model outperformed the P-RRM
   model, but the attribute-specific model performed better. Allowing
   respondents with different decision rules and preference heterogeneity
   within each decision rule in a class-specific model performed best,
   revealing that 55\% of the sample used a P-RRM decision rule.
   Individuals using a P-RRM decision rule responded less to enforcement,
   salary, and livestock donation than did individuals using the RUM
   decision rule. Hence, 3 common strategies, enforcement, alternative
   income-generating activities, and providing livestock as a substitute
   protein, are likely less effective in changing the behavior of more than
   half of respondents. Only salary elicited a large (i.e. elastic)
   response, and only for one RUM class. Policies to regulate the bushmeat
   trade based solely on the assumption of individuals maximizing utility,
   may fail for a significant proportion of the sample. Despite the
   superior performance of models that allow both RUM and P-RRM decision
   rules there are drawbacks that must be considered before use in the
   Global South, where very little is known about the social-psychology of
   decision making.}},

Title = {{Black holes in the long-range limit of torsion bigravity}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{We continue the study of spherically symmetric black hole solutions in
   torsion bigravity, a class of Einstein-Cartan-type gravity theories
   involving, besides a metric, a massive propagating torsion field. In the
   infinite-range limit, these theories admit asymptotically flat black
   hole solutions related to the presence of attractive fixed points in the
   asymptotic radial evolution of the metric and the torsion. We discuss
   these fixed points and the way they are approached at large radii.
   Several phenomenological aspects of asymptotically flat torsion-hairy
   black holes are discussed: (i) location of the light ring and of the
   shadow; (ii) correction to the redshift of orbiting stars; and (iii)
   modification of the periastron precession of orbiting stars. By
   comparing the observable properties of torsion-hairy black holes to
   existing observational data on supermassive black holes obtained by the
   Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration and by the GRAVITY Collaboration,
   we derive constraints on the theory parameters of torsion bigravity. The
   strongest constraint is found to come from the recent measurement of the
   periastron precession of the star S2 orbiting the Galactic-center
   massive black hole {[}R. Abuter et al., Astron. Astrophys. 636, L5
   (2020) and to be a thousand times more stringent than Solar-System

Abstract = {{Participation and performance trends have been analyzed for different
   ultramarathons for limited time periods. This study examined trends in
   participation and performance in the oldest ultramarathon in the world,
   the `Comrades Marathon' (South Africa), during a century (1921-2019).
   Data from www.ultra-marathon.org on 100000 unique finishers were
   analysed using different general linear models. Women represented 4.2\%
   of the total sample (n=4152), and the first women ran this race in 1978.
   Before the year 1965, the number of participants in the race ranged
   between 5 and 35 athletes, then started to grow exponentially until mid
   90's. An increase in finishers in the 70s mainly due to an increase in
   male athletes in age groups 30-39, 40-49 and 50-59 years was observed
   (p<0.001). A stable running speed for overall women and men but an
   improvement in performance for the annual top five women and men were
   shown (p<0.001). Male runners were faster than female runners for all
   age groups (p<0.001). While overall performance was not improved across
   years, the annual top five women and men were able to improve their
   performance over years.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The rhizome of Cnidium officinale (Umbelliferae) (known as Senkyu in
   Japan; COR) has been used as a crude drug in Japanese Kampo formulas,
   such as Jumihaidokuto (to treat eczema and urticaria) and
   Kakkontokasenkyushin'i (to treat rhinitis). COR contains phthalides,
   which are thought to be potent principal constituents. Few studies have
   been reported about the comparison of anti-inflammatory activity of COR
   constituents. We aimed to identify the constituents in COR and compare
   their anti- inflammatory activity. COR was extracted with methanol and
   fractionated into ethyl acetate (EtOAc)-soluble, n-butanol-soluble, and
   water-soluble fractions. Primary cultured rat hepatocytes were used to
   assess anti-inflammatory activity by monitoring the interleukin (IL)-1
   beta-induced production of nitric oxide (NO), an inflammatory mediator.
   The EtOAc-soluble fraction significantly suppressed NO production
   without showing cytotoxicity in IL-1 beta-treated hepatocytes, whereas
   the n-butanol-soluble fraction showed less potency, and the
   water-soluble fraction did not significantly affect the NO levels. Four
   constituents were isolated from the EtOAc-soluble fraction and
   identified as senkyunolide A, (3S)-butylphthalide, neocnidilide, and
   cnidilide. Among these phthalides and (Z)-ligustilide, senkyunolide A
   and (Z)-ligustilide efficiently suppressed NO production in hepatocytes,
   whereas the others showed less potency in the suppression of NO
   production. Furthermore, senkyunolide A decreased the levels of the
   inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein and mRNA, as well as the
   levels of mRNAs encoding proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis
   factor alpha) and chemokine C-C motif ligand 20. These results suggest
   that senkyunolide A may cause the anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective
   effects of COR by suppressing the genes involved in inflammation.}},

Abstract = {{Very few studies have investigated the dose-response relationship
   between external cadmium (Cd) exposure and mortality. We aim to
   investigate the relationship between lifetime Cd intake (LCd) and
   mortality in the Cd-polluted Kakehashi River basin in Japan. Mortality
   risk ratios for a unit of increase of LCd and urinary Cd were analyzed
   using Cox's proportional model. LCd was estimated based on residency and
   Cd in rice produced in their living areas. In men, mortality for all
   causes was significantly increased for a 10-mu g/g Cr increase in
   urinary Cd, but not for a 1-g increase in LCd. In women, mortality risks
   for all causes and renal diseases, particularly renal failure, were
   significantly increased for a 10-mu g/g Cr increase in urinary Cd.
   Similarly, mortality risks for renal diseases and renal failure were
   significantly increased for a 1-g increase of LCd in women. Comparing
   the contribution of two exposure markers to increased mortality in
   women, LCd was more effective for increasing mortality risks for renal
   diseases and renal failure, while urinary Cd contributed more to
   increased mortality risk for all causes. LCd may show a better
   dose-response relationship with mortality risk for renal diseases in
   women.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND FLUID FLOW}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{86}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The nose-tip bluntness effects on the hypersonic crossflow instability
   were experimentally investigated over a 7 degrees half-angle straight
   cone at 6 degrees angle of attack. The experiments were conducted in a
   Mach 6 wind tunnel at Reynolds number of 7.94 x 10(6) m(-1) using
   temperature-sensitive paint (TSP) and fast-response pressure
   transducers. The wavelet transform was applied to obtain the most
   amplified wavenumber of the stationary crossflow vortices. The
   stationary crossflow vortices with wavenumber of 40-60 and the traveling
   crossflow waves with characteristic frequencies of 9-20 kHz have been
   detected. TSP results indicate that the bluntness has little influence
   on the boundary layer transition location with a small nose-tip radius
   (smaller than 1.5 mm), while the transition front moves backward
   obviously with a larger nose-tip radius (larger than 2.5 mm). The
   developments of two types of crossflow instability, the stationary mode
   and the traveling mode, are both not sensitive to the bluntness when the
   nose-tip radius is below 1.5 mm. And the growth and saturation of the
   two types crossflow mode are both inhibited under larger bluntness.
   Besides, possible explanations for how the bluntness affects the
   transition location and crossflow instability is discussed.}},

   Evidence from stratigraphic relationships and zircon geochronology}},
Journal = {{ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{127}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Ashele volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposit is the largest and
   most representative VMS deposit in the Chinese Altay Metallogenic Belt,
   but its stratigraphic sequence, tectonic framework, and morphology are
   debated. In this paper, on the basis of previous research, field
   investigations, excavation pits, drill-core sampling, and new LA-ICP-MS
   U-Pb analyses of zircons from mafic and felsic volcanic rocks, we show
   that the main structure of the Ashele deposit is an overturned tightly
   closed syncline, and that the primary orebody is controlled by this
   structure. Moreover, we show that the Ashele VMS deposit displays a
   double-layer structure made up of a feeder zone of veinlet-disseminated
   and stockwork orebodies overlain by massive/stratiform orebodies that
   are folded. We revise the stratigraphy of the Ashele Formation into five
   conformable sedimentary subsequences, based on new field investigations
   and the zircon geochronology of each subsequence. From bottom to top, we
   divide the formation into a siliceous tuff layer (405.1 +/- 1.8 Ma), a
   dacitic layer (395.9-403 Ma), a rhyolitic layer (390.9 +/- 0.83 Ma), an
   orebody layer (ca. 387 Ma), and a basalt layer (387-377 Ma). The Early
   to Middle Devonian Ashele Formation unconformably underlies the Late
   Devonian Qiye Formation.}},

   Here we discuss recent breakthroughs in the CNT-based field-effect

Abstract = {{Fertilisation plays a major role in growth and dry matter yield of
   forage. A field experiment was conducted over two planting seasons on
   the same site to determine the effect of different fertilisers on growth
   of corn and soybean and dry matter yield of mixed forage. Six fertiliser
   treatments with three replications were arranged in randomised complete
   block design. The treatments were 100\% chemical fertiliser (NPK), 100\%
   poultry manure (PM), 50\% PM, combined application of 50\% PM with
   biofertiliser, sole biofertilser and untreated (control). The results in
   the first season showed that 100\% NPK produced the highest dry matter
   yield (13.83 t ha(-1)) but in the second season, 100\% PM produced a
   similar dry matter yield (9.91 t ha(-1)) with 100\% NPK (9.84 t ha(-1)).
   Sole biofertiliser produced the same yield as 50\% PM. The results
   indicate that 100\% PM at the rate of 6.3 t ha(-1) significantly
   increased dry matter yield of mixed forage.}},

Title = {{3D seismic fault detection using the Gaussian process regression, a
   study on synthetic and real 3D seismic data}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{195}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Faults are natural tectonic events as planar features along which rock
   units are moved. The patterns of these planes on seismic sections
   include linear or curvilinear features that are called edge in image
   processing, where amplitudes sharply change. In seismic data, these edge
   features made by fault traces are usually detected by seismic
   attributes, which need complex mathematical calculation such as a
   dip-steered cube. In this study, we introduce faults as global anomalies
   which disturb the normal interaction of seismic reflectors. Here, the
   normal interaction means the absence of intensive changes in reflectors
   trend in seismic sections. Fault detection as a global anomaly is done
   by the Gaussian process regression model (GPR), which is a nonparametric
   probabilistic model based on Bayesian statistics supporting noisy
   (Gaussian noise) and sparse features in data. In data mining, anomaly
   detection identifies items or events that do not match an expected
   pattern in a dataset. Global anomalies are sparse and affect a wide
   range of normal trends of data which are also held by fault features in
   seismic data. In this study, the GPR-based anomaly detection algorithm
   was implemented on the 3D seismic data of the Gulf of Mexico containing
   normal growth faults and a salt dome to detect salt boundary and fault
   traces in seismic data. In this respect, the reflections from rock units
   and fault features were taken into account as normal interactions and
   global anomalies, respectively, because faults disrupted the normal
   trend of reflectors in seismic sections. To detect fault locations, the
   location of a voxel in voxel grid where it is a part of fault in seismic
   data, after smoothing the seismic data, a Gaussian process (GP) model
   was trained on seismic data, attempting to describe the seismic
   amplitude data as a multivariate Gaussian model. However, GP regression
   fails to describe the seismic data at fault locations. Thus, the failure
   of the GP in the regression step was analyzed to separate the probable
   fault points, highlighted by calculating the variance of the GPR
   results. Finally, the detected probable fault points were improved and
   separated from background results by implementing a consistent
   reconstruction morphological algorithm. The results were validated using
   a similar structural index method, mean square error, and power signal
   to noise ratio indices in comparison with interpreted faults, implying
   the superiority of the proposed method in comparison with seismic
   attributes. The faults detected by the proposed method have the most
   structural similarity to faults interpreted. This similarity has
   improved by 22\% compared to used attributes.}},

Abstract = {{Non-coaxial rotation system has encountered in various fields such as
   engineering field in designing advanced cooling and heating system, food
   processing and mixer machines. In the present study, the effect of the
   non-coaxial rotation of a vertical disk on the heat and mass transfer of
   Newtonian nanofluids in a porous medium is analytically discussed. The
   influence of the magnetic field and thermal radiation is also taken into
   the consideration. Two different types of nanofluids which are
   single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon
   nanotubes (MWCNTs) with water as the base fluid are analyzed and
   compared. Suitable dimensionless variables are utilized to convert the
   governing partial differential equations associated with the initial and
   boundary conditions into the dimensionless form. Then, the exact
   solutions of the dimensionless governing equations are calculated by
   using the Laplace transform method. A limiting case study of the
   obtained analytical solutions is constructed to compare with the
   previously published results to verify its validity. The distributions
   of the velocity, temperature, and concentration along with the Skin
   friction, Nusselt number, and Sherwood number due to the variation of
   the pertinent parameters are displayed and scrutinized through graphs
   and tables. In the frame of non-coaxial rotation, the nanofluid with the
   SWCNTs nanoparticles have illustrated a higher rate of heat transfer as
   compared to MWCNTs nanofluid. Moreover, the heat transmission in the
   nanofluid has been enhanced by increasing the volume fraction of the
   nanoparticle and also the intensity of the radiation. This suggests that
   heating or cooling in a system such as a nuclear reactor can be improved
   by properly selecting the type of the nanofluid and also the volume
   fraction of the nanoparticle.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{25}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Defects in metallic components can be formed in many manufacturing
   techniques, including casting, additive manufacturing, and powder
   metallurgy. These imperfections can significantly affect the mechanical
   properties, especially fatigue behavior of industrial components.
   Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate these defects and study their
   effect on the final mechanical performance of the components. In this
   study, the effect of defects on fatigue behavior of cast A356-T6
   aluminum alloy, as an illustrative material, was investigated. Fatigue
   tests were conducted under different loading conditions to investigate
   the effects of defects, specimen size, mean stress and stress gradient.
   To achieve this goal, fully-reversed uniaxial fatigue tests were
   conducted on two specimen sizes, as well as tension-tension fatigue
   tests to study mean stress effect. Rotating bending tests were also
   performed to study the effect of stress gradient on fatigue performance
   of materials containing defects. The scatter in fatigue life data was
   evaluated using statistical analysis. Good correlations of the fatigue
   life of the specimens under different stress ratios were obtained using
   a mean stress correction factor. The fatigue life of the specimens under
   different testing conditions were also estimated using the maximum
   defect size observed on fracture surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{The principles of the hip arthroplasty, as we know them today, were

   results without complications. Over the last 20 years, the development
   and establishment of minimally invasive operation techniques has
   contributed to rapid changes. Additionally, perioperative patient
   management was optimized. Improvements in the material and tribology of
   the implants led to promising developments. Nonetheless, analysis of
   possible complications, shows potential for further developments, for
   example in cup geometry. Enhanced training concepts for surgeons,
   operation simulators, simple navigation aids for component positioning
   can surely achieve improvements in surgical safety.}},

Abstract = {{Offshore convection occurred over the Mediterranean sea on 26 October
   2012 and was well documented during the first Special Observation Period
   (SOP1) of the Hydrological cycle in the Mediterranean Experiment
   (HyMeX). This paper analyses the triggering and organizing factors
   involved in this convection case study, and examines how they are
   simulated and represented at hectometric resolutions. For that purpose,
   a large-eddy simulation (LES) of this real case study is carried out
   with a 150 m horizontal resolution over a large domain encompassing the
   convective systems and the low-level flow feeding convection over the
   sea. This LES is then compared to a reference simulation performed with
   a 450 m grid spacing in the heart of the so-called ``grey zone{''} of
   turbulence modelling.
   An increase in horizontal resolution from 450 down to 150 m is unable,
   for this case study, to reduce significantly deficiencies of the
   simulation; this is more related to an issue of initial and lateral
   boundary conditions. Indeed, some of the triggering factors, such as a
   converging low-level flow driven by a surface low-pressure system, are
   simulated quite similarly for both simulations. However, differences for
   other mechanisms still exist since greater surface precipitation amounts
   are simulated at 450 m. It is found that the entrainment process,
   characterized by small eddies at the cloud edges, is strongly
   underestimated at 450 m horizontal resolution, missing the mixing with
   the environmental air. Therefore, too rapid a development of deep
   convection is simulated at this horizontal resolution, associated with
   fast-track microphysical processes and enhanced dynamics By contrast, at
   150 m horizontal resolution, the updraught cores are mainly resolved, as
   are the subsiding shell, while subgrid eddies, produced by dynamical
   processes, are localized at the cloud interior edges, better
   representing the entrainment process.
   Furthermore, this first LES of a real Mediterranean precipitating case
   study highlights a convective organization with very fine-scale features
   within the converging low-level flow, features that are definitively out
   of range of models with kilometric horizontal resolutions.}},

Abstract = {{Brugia malayi is a lymphatic nematode that accounts for approximately
   10\% of lymphatic filariasis cases worldwide. It is endemic in several
   countries in South and Southeast Asia. In Thailand, B. malayi is endemic
   in the southern region. The extralymphatic presentation of B. malayi is
   rare. Here, we report the case of a woman residing in the central region
   of Thailand who presented with an erythematous periorbital nodule at the
   left medial canthal area caused by lymphatic filaria. A viable sexually
   mature filarial adult was removed from the lesion. The nematode species
   was identified as B. malayi by histology staining and DNA sequencing of
   the partial mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. As far as we
   know, this is the first case report of B. malayi presenting with a
   periorbital nodule that has occurred in a disease non-endemic area of
   Thailand with possibly a zoonotic origin.}},

Title = {{Fish Community Responses to Human-Induced Stresses in the Lower Mekong
   Basin}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Mekong River is one of the world's largest rivers and has an annual
   captured fish production of about 2.3 million tonnes, equivalent to
   around 11 billion USD. Although the Mekong provides important ecological
   and socioeconomic benefits to millions of people, it is facing intensive
   change due to anthropogenic stressors. Therefore, it is necessary to
   understand the changes to the spatiotemporal fish communities to inform
   sustainable fisheries management. Here, we aimed to characterize
   patterns of the fish communities and identify the ecological status of
   each fish community using daily catch data from 2007 to 2018 at 25
   monitoring sites in the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB). The collected data
   were classified by a self-organizing map into four main groups. Group 4
   represented the lower Vietnam Mekong Delta (VMD), while groups 1, 2, and
   3 were subdivided into subgroups 1a (upper LMB), 1b (upper and middle
   LMB), 2a (Mekong River below the Khone Falls and Sesan River), 2b
   (Mekong River below the Khone Falls and Sekong, Sesan and Srepok (3S)
   Rivers), 3a (Floodplain-Tonle Sap and Songkhram) and 3b (upper VMD).
   Among the 571 species recorded, 119 were identified as indicator
   species. Based on the abundance and biomass comparison curves, the fish
   community of 2b was in a healthier condition with a positive W-statistic
   value while the rest had a negative W-statistic value. The highest
   species richness and diversity were observed in 3a and 2b, so these
   subgroups deserve high management and conservation priority. Likewise,
   1a should also be considered as a high priority area since it harbors
   several endangered and long-distant migratory fishes. It was also
   noticed that the fish communities of groups 3 and 4, located far from
   the hydropower dams, remained mostly unchanged compared to those of
   groups 1 and 2, close to the mainstream and tributary dams in the upper
   LMB and 3S Rivers.}},

Abstract = {{The high level of exploitation and slow population growth rates of many
   elasmobranch species are causing worldwide concern about their status.
   Genetic methods offer the potential to gather information on the stock
   structure and conservation status of species with implications in the
   delineation of appropriate management units. However, despite several
   calls from the scientific community, they are still largely ignored in
   fisheries management. Here, we use genetic approaches to assess the
   population structure of the cuckoo ray (Leucoraja naevus), a species of
   skate that was recently designated as vulnerable in Irish waters by the
   International Union for Conservation of Nature. By genotyping
   individuals (n = 188) originating from a vast geographic area with nine
   microsatellite markers, we do not find evidence of population
   structuring but cuckoo rays in Irish waters seem to belong to a single
   genetically diverse panmictic population despite the restricted
   movements observed in closely related species. Cuckoo rays should
   therefore continue to be monitored as a single stock in this area.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Youth and young adults frequently use social media and are susceptible
   to tobacco use. This study is the first to provide a systematic overview
   of how leading tobacco product brands use popular social media
   platforms.
   Methods
   We identified 112 leading brands of e-cigarettes, hookah, cigars,
   cigarettes and smokeless tobacco based on sales and self-report user
   data. We searched for each brand on six platforms: Instagram, Facebook,
   Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest and Tumblr. In early 2019, we conducted a
   content analysis of each page, coding: age restrictions, warning
   display, page characteristics and post characteristics.
   Results
   Cigarette brands were generally not present. Most e-cigarettes, hookah
   and cigar brands had pages on at least two platforms. One-third of
   smokeless brands had pages on at least one platform. Few brands had
   pages on Pinterest and Tumblr. Most pages had existed for 3-5 years.
   Overall, brand pages rarely used age gating, did not display health
   warnings, generally posted images of a product alone and often used
   hashtags unrelated to tobacco. Brands commonly used special features
   like ephemeral posts on Instagram and pop-up chat windows on Facebook.
   Many pages displayed images of young people and mentioned flavour.
   Median followers per brand ranged from about 1 000-10 000, and total
   followers summed across brands reached over 5 million on Facebook and
   Instagram alone.
   Conclusions
   Leading brands of most tobacco product types use social media
   extensively. Several findings identify issues related to youth exposure
   to and appeal of tobacco social media marketing. Findings can inform
   tobacco education efforts and regulation.}},

   focus groups used a phenomenological framework to elucidate the
   experiences of 14 RNs. Data analysis revealed two themes grounded in
   time: (a) nurses use time to assess patients' EOL situation and assist
   patients to discern care options; and (b) nurses educate patients about
   EOL care, adjust care plans, and develop trusting relationships. Two
   themes were grounded in clinical experience: (a) nurses become
   persistent advocates and educators to initiate and sustain EOL
   communication; and (b) nurses learn consistency in communication,
   including awareness of patients' nonverbal communication. Nurses shared
   that EOL communication is never ``done{''}; time frames to assess,

Abstract = {{Throughout the 1980s,1990s, and 2000s, journalist and women's health

   Unlike most of her peers, Seaman also left corrective notes, messages to
   future researchers, and critiques of historians' handling of her and her
   friends' pasts. This article examines Barbara Seaman's curated archive
   as a means to discuss feminists' historical consciousness-raising in the
   late twentieth century, and its consequences for researchers. By showing
   how archival collections are both personal and political, this
   discussion advocates for the proper understanding of archives as
   historical acts in themselves. The archive of women's experience has
   changed significantly since the 1970s as individuals have come to
   routinely advocate for themselves as historical subjects worthy of

Abstract = {{Sanitation is a major global challenge that is often addressed at
   national and international levels, while community opinions and beliefs
   are neglected. To promote water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) we
   organized a cross-cultural knowledge exchange workshop to assess
   participatory methods for engaging local stakeholders. The workshop
   included 22 participants from all sectors of society. Practical
   solutions to sanitation challenges were identified and later shared with
   a local community. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were used to
   assess impact and showed participatory methods were highly valued to
   encourage information sharing among widely varied stakeholders, and that
   video was a particularly successful approach when engaging with local
   communities. An 8-month follow-up survey of village members revealed
   excellent information recall, positive behaviour changes and a desire
   for future visits. Our evidence suggests that community-based
   participation helped identify solutions to WASH issues affecting rural
   communities in resource-poor settings. Engaging in a multicultural
   knowledge-share was particularly valuable as it enabled participants to
   recognize they have common challenges and allowed them to share low-cost
   solutions from their different communities. Our use of video was widely
   viewed as an ideal means of circulating findings, as it communicated
   information to people with a wide variety of community roles and to all
   age groups. Its relevance was increased by adopting a culturally
   appropriate context by involving local communities in workshop
   activities. We recommend that research in low- and middle-income
   countries should be mindful of the environmental context in which WASH
   is implemented, and encourage acceptance by engaging with communities
   through the use of varied participatory methods.}},

Abstract = {{Background. We sought to describe the outcomes of patients who underwent
   caval valve implantation (CAVI) for treatment of severe tricuspid
   regurgitation (TR) in the United States. Previous studies on CAVI have
   used a variety of techniques and transcatheter valves. We present our
   findings from CAVI with inferior vena cava (IVC) implant only using a
   single valve. Methods. Patients who were determined to be poor
   candidates for tricuspid valve surgery and underwent CAVI in the United
   States from March 1, 2013 through March 1, 2018 were included in this
   study. Data during hospitalizations and interim outpatient follow-up
   from each individual site were collected and entered into a central
   password-protected database. Results. A total of 24 patients were
   treated. The median age was 79.5 years, 63\% were women, and 96\% were
   white. Twenty-three of 24 patients underwent valve implantation with a
   29 mm Sapien 3 valve (Edwards Lifesciences). There was a 100\% rate of
   successful valve implantation. There were no cases requiring emergency
   surgery. Thirty-day mortality rate was 25\%. The median survival as of
   last follow-up of all patients was 350 days. Pre- and postprocedure New
   York Heart Association (NYHA) class data were available in 11 of 24
   patients; of these 11 patients, 72.7\% improved at least 1 NYHA class
   from baseline. Conclusion. CAVI may be performed safely in a high
   surgical risk population with severe tricuspid regurgitation. Dedicated
   studies with longer-term follow-up are needed.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Neighborhood socioeconomic status has been implicated in
   breast cancer incidence and mortality. However, there are no studies on
   the impact of neighborhood socioeconomic status on clinical outcomes or
   surgical management among patients with phyllodes tumors. The objective
   of this study is to understand the relationship between neighborhood
   socioeconomic status, surgical management and disease specific mortality
   in malignant phyllodes tumor patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology,
   and End Results program.
   Methods: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program was queried
   for malignant phyllodes tumor patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2016.
   Using the National Cancer Institute census tract-level index for
   neighborhood socioeconomic status the data were stratified into low
   neighborhood socioeconomic status, middle neighborhood socioeconomic
   status, and high neighborhood socioeconomic status. Bivariate intergroup
   analysis was conducted. Disease specific mortality was evaluated using a
   Cox proportional hazards model.
   Results: Of the 651 patients with malignant phyllodes tumor in the
   sample, the disease specific mortality was 7.6\% and 7.9\% at 5 and 10
   years, respectively. On bivariate analysis, there were no differences
   between the neighborhood socioeconomic status groups and surgery type (P
   = .794). On multivariable analysis, older age (>= 71 years; hazard ratio
   9.9; 95\% confidence interval, 2.84-34.57; P < .001) and larger tumor
   size (>40 mm; hazard ratio 2.20; 95\% confidence interval, 1.09-4.44; P
   = .027) were associated with a higher disease specific mortality
   compared with younger age (<= 40 years) and smaller tumor size (<40 mm).
   There was no association between neighborhood socioeconomic status and
   disease specific mortality (low neighborhood socioeconomic status-ref,
   middle neighborhood socioeconomic status hazard ratio 0.87 (95\%
   confidence interval, 0.71-1.78; P = .71), high hazard ratio 0.91 (95\%
   confidence interval, 0.44-1.90, P = .81).
   Conclusion: Among malignant phyllodes tumor patients in the
   Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, disease specific
   mortality and surgical management are mostly driven by tumor
   characteristics and not social determinants of health. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Title = {{Seasonal performance assessment of four riverbank filtration sites by
   combined non-target and effect-directed analysis}},
Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{261}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Targeting the most relevant organic micropollutants (OMP) in routine
   analysis appears difficult due to formation of transformation products
   of unknown concentration or toxicity. Performance assessment of water
   purification processes is still based upon limited target data.
   Therefore, we broadened the assessment of the removal efficiencies with
   combined non-target and effect-directed analysis at four riverbank
   filtration (RBF) sites in Germany. To assess micropollutant elimination,
   constancy and formation during different seasons, considering local
   redox conditions, travel distances and total component number in the
   river, non-target analysis features were grouped into categories.
   Furthermore, RBF sites were investigated with four endpoints (baseline
   toxicity, acetylcholinesterase inhibition, antibiotic effects and
   estrogenic effects) for thin-layer chromatography - effect-directed
   analysis for the first time. Results showed elimination or reduction of
   many features and effects, but also constancy and formation of varying
   proportions. Fall river samples showed precipitation-caused dilution in
   both tests. Spring samples showed increased effects only in
   acetylcholinesterase inhibition and estrogenic effects, probably due to
   phytoestrogens or algae bloom during vegetation period. Sites were
   ranked considering the total number of features, group proportions,
   seasonal variations and intensity and number of effects in abstraction
   wells. Oxic conditions and low initial component numbers in the river
   (Ruhr sites) resulted in less effects and fewer formations. Longer
   travel distances were important for a more efficient reduction of
   effects and features. Combination of non-target and effect-directed
   analysis proved to be valuable for a more comprehensive assessment of
   process performance beyond target analysis as also unknown OMP are
   observed with both methods. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The continuous increase of Coccidioidomycosis cases requires reliable
   detection methods of the causal agent, Coccidioides spp., in its natural
   environment. This has proven challenging because of our limited
   knowledge on the distribution of this soil-dwelling fungus. Knowing the
   pathogen's geographic distribution and its relationship with the
   environment is crucial to identify potential areas of risk and to
   prevent disease outbreaks. The maximum entropy (Maxent) algorithm,
   Geographic Information System (GIS) and bioclimatic variables were
   combined to obtain current and future potential distribution models
   (DMs) of Coccidioides and its putative rodent reservoirs for Arizona,
   California and Baja California. We revealed that Coccidioides DMs
   constructed with presence records from one state are not well suited to
   predict distribution in another state, supporting the existence of
   distinct phylogeographic populations of Coccidioides. A great
   correlation between Coccidioides DMs and United States counties with
   high Coccidioidomycosis incidence was found. Remarkably, under future
   scenarios of climate change and high concentration of greenhouse gases,
   the probability of habitat suitability for Coccidioides increased.
   Overlap analysis between the DMs of rodents and Coccidioides, identified
   Neotoma lepida as one of the predominant co-occurring species in all
   three states. Considering rodents DMs would allow to implement better
   surveillance programs to monitor disease spread.}},

Abstract = {{Hip arthroscopy has been increasingly used to treat labral tears and cam
   and pincer lesions found in femoroacetabular impingement. Although the
   classic impingement with cam deformity at the proximal femoral
   anterolateral quadrant is most common, there has been evidence of cam
   impingement extension to the anteromedial and posterior quadrants of the
   proximal femur. Posterior cam decompression carries a theoretical risk
   of vascular insult and subsequent osteonecrosis, which have led
   investigators to approach these posterior lesions through an open
   surgical correction. Recent improvements have led to the development of
   pre-bent burs that allow for bonier resection flexibility. Here, we
   report on an arthroscopic posterior cam decompression using the
   traditional anterior portals and curved hip burs via a figure-of-four

Abstract = {{As extracellular vesicles (EVs) have become a prominent topic in life
   sciences, a growing number of studies are published on a regular basis
   addressing their biological relevance and possible applications.
   Nevertheless, the fundamental question of the true vesicular nature as
   well as possible influences on the EV secretion behavior have often been
   not adequately addressed. Furthermore, research regarding endothelial
   cell-derived EVs (EndoEVs) often focused on the large vesicular
   fractions comprising of microvesicles (MV) and apoptotic bodies. In this
   study we aimed to further extend the current knowledge of the influence
   of pre-isolation conditions, such as cell density and conditioning time,
   on EndoEV release from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).
   We combined fluorescence nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and the
   established fluorescence-triggered flow cytometry (FT-FC) protocol to
   allow vesicle-specific detection and characterization of size and
   surface markers. We found significant effects of cell density and
   conditioning time on both abundance and size distribution of EndoEVs.
   Additionally, we present detailed information regarding the surface
   marker display on EVs from different fractions and size ranges. Our data
   provide crucial relevance for future projects aiming to elucidate EV
   secretion behavior of endothelial cells. Moreover, we show that the
   influence of different conditioning parameters on the nature of EndoEVs
   has to be considered.}},

Abstract = {{This article revisits the link between disaggregated Foreign Direct
   Investment (FDI) inflows and sectorial growth using the panel dataset of
   25 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)

   and Feasible Generalized Least Squares Approach in its analysis. The
   findings show that disaggregated FDI inflows have the potential to
   improve growth in the OECD area with adverse effects on domestic
   investment and inflationary pressure. Additionally, the results further
   indicate that disaggregated FDI inflows have a positive and significant
   relationship on the service and manufacturing sector but with no
   evidence shown on the agricultural industry. Thus, the study concludes
   that efficient reallocation of FDI resource(s) among sectors will not
   only boost output growth but also impact on the real economy. However,
   the necessary policy strategy to regulate this inflow is vital to
   mitigate its negative impact on domestic investment and inflation

Abstract = {{We examine the extent to which shareholders strategically allow a weak
   governance structure in response to increasing competition pressures in
   the product market. We treat acquisitions by rival firms as shocks that
   increase threats in a competitive product market. We find that firms
   adopt greater entrenchment provisions when there are greater competition
   threats. Moreover, firms with high institutional ownership - especially
   by dedicated investors - and board independence within the compensation
   committee are particularly aggressive, which is consistent with our
   theory that aggressive behavior represents a strategic decision by
   shareholders. Finally, we find positive relationship between the
   adoption of entrenchment provisions and firm's future performance, but
   only for the adoption under relatively severe competitive pressures.}},

Title = {{The impact of PM2.5 on acute otitis media in children (aged 0-3): A time
   series study}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Experimental studies have reported that air pollution could
   make the middle ear more susceptible to infections. However, the
   associations between specific air pollutants and AOM were inconsistent
   in previous epidemiologic studies. This study aimed to investigate the
   association between PM2.5 exposure and the AOM events in seven major
   cities in the Republic of Korea.
   Methods: We performed a nationwide time series analysis of children aged
   0-3 years living in seven major Korean cities between 2008 and 2016. We
   used a quasi-Poisson regression to estimate the short-term association
   between incident AOM and the 5-day moving average of particulate matter
   smaller than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) for each city. Then, we conducted a
   meta-analysis to combine the city-specific associations. The exposure
   unit was 10 mu g/ m3, and all models were adjusted for time, daily mean
   apparent temperature and day of the week.
   Results: A higher risk of incident AOM was significantly associated with
   higher 5-day moving PM2.5 averages in five cities, except for Gwangju
   and Ulsan. The combined relative risk (RR) was 1.011 (95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI]: 1.008, 1.014). In the subgroup analysis by season,
   PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with incident AOM in the
   warm season (RR: 1.016, 95\% CI: 1.009, 1.022). In addition, among
   children with a URI history within 4 weeks, children with a more recent
   URI history were more sensitive to the impact of PM2.5 exposure on
   incident AOM (RR for 1st week: 1.017, 95\% CI: 1.011, 1.024; RR for 2nd
   week: 1.013, 95\% CI: 1.008, 1.018; RR for 3rd week: 1.008, 95\% CI:
   1.003, 1.013; RR for 4th week: 1.005, 95\% CI: 1.001, 1.009).
   Conclusion: Higher PM2.5 concentrations are associated with a higher
   risk of incident AOM, particularly in the warm season and children with
   recent URI history. Our findings could have important implications for
   preventing AOM in children.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on ethanol-induced stress and acetaldehyde toxicity are actively
   being conducted, owing to an increase in alcohol consumption in modern
   society. In this study, ent-peniciherqueinone (EPQ) isolated from a
   Hawaiian volcanic soil-associated fungus Penicillium herquei FT729 was
   found to reduce the acetaldehyde-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative
   stress in PC12 cells. EPQ increased cell viability in the presence of
   acetaldehyde-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells. In addition, EPQ
   reduced cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and restored
   acetaldehyde-mediated disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential.
   Western blot analyses revealed that EPQ treatment increased protein
   levels of ROS-scavenging heme oxygenase-1 and superoxide dismutase, as
   well as the levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 1, ALDH2, and ALDH3,
   under acetaldehyde-induced cellular stress. Finally, EPQ reduced
   acetaldehyde-induced phosphorylation of p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase,
   which are associated with ROS-induced oxidative stress. Therefore, our
   results demonstrated that EPQ prevents cellular oxidative stress caused
   by acetaldehyde and functions as a potent agent to suppress hangover
   symptoms and alcohol-related stress.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Dentists are at a higher risk of suffering from
   musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) than the general population. However,
   the latest study investigating MSD in the dental profession in Germany
   was published about 20 years ago. Therefore, the aim of this study was
   to reveal the current prevalence of MSD in dentists and dental students
   in Germany. Methods: The final study size contained 450 (287 f/163 m)
   subjects of different areas of specialization. The age of the
   participants ranged from 23 to 75 years. The questionnaire consisted of
   a modified version of the Nordic Questionnaire, work-related questions
   from the latest questionnaire of German dentists, typical medical
   conditions and self-developed questions. Results: The overall prevalence
   showed that dentists suffered frequently from MSD (seven days: 65.6\%,
   twelve months: 92\%, lifetime: 95.8\%). The most affected body regions
   included the neck (42.7\%-70.9\%-78.4\%), shoulders
   (29.8\%-55.6\%-66.2\%) and lower back (22.9\%-45.8\%-58.7\%). Overall,
   female participants stated that they suffered from pain significantly
   more frequently, especially in the neck, shoulders and upper back.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of MSD among dentists, especially in the
   neck, shoulder and back area, was significantly higher than in the
   general population. In addition, women suffered more frequently from MSD
   than men in almost all body regions.}},

Title = {{Different Long-Term Duration of Seroprotection against Neisseria

Abstract = {{Neisseria meningitidis is often asymptomatically carried in the
   nasopharynx but may cause invasive meningococcal disease, leading to
   morbidity and mortality. Meningococcal conjugate vaccinations induce
   functional protective antibodies against capsular antigens, but
   seroprotection wanes over time. We measured functional antibody titers
   five years after administration of a single dose of the meningococcal
   ACWY-polysaccharide-specific tetanus toxoid-conjugated (MenACWY-TT)
   vaccine in adolescents and middle-aged adults in the Netherlands, using
   the serum bactericidal antibody with baby rabbit complement (rSBA)
   assay. Protection was defined as rSBA titer >= 8. The meningococcal
   ACWY-specific serum IgG concentrations were measured with a multiplex
   immunoassay. Duration of protection was estimated by a bi-exponential
   decay model. Sufficient protection for MenC, MenW, and MenY was achieved
   in 94-96\% of the adolescents five years postvaccination, but, in
   middle-aged adults, only in 32\% for MenC, 65\% for MenW and 71\% for
   MenY. Median duration of protection for MenCWY was 4, 14, and 21 years,
   respectively, in middle-aged adults, while, in adolescents, it was 32,
   98, and 33 years. Our findings suggest that adolescents, primed in early
   childhood with MenC conjugate vaccination, remain sufficiently protected
   after a single dose of MenACWY-TT vaccine. Middle-aged adults without
   priming vaccination show fast waning of antibodies, particularly MenC,
   for which protection is lost after four years.}},

Title = {{Continuous monitoring of chemical warfare agents in vapor using a

Journal = {{FORENSIC CHEMISTRY}},

Abstract = {{Identification and quantification method for chemical warfare agents
   (CWAs) was developed using a continuous and standalone type hazardous
   gas detection instrument (MKS AIRGARD (R) Air Analyzer), Fourier
   transform infra-red (FT-IR) spectroscopy system which uses a multi pass
   gas cell, a Stirling-cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector, and
   advanced data processing including an exponentially weighted moving
   background and chemical identification algorithm. Although FT-IR
   spectrum of sarin vapor prepared in ambient air included absorbance
   bands of carbon dioxide and water remaining due to incomplete background
   correction, characteristic absorbance bands were clearly observed in the
   fingerprint region (700-1400 cm(-1)) and around 2950 cm(-1). n-Hexane
   was used not only as dissolving solvent for volatile CWAs but also as an
   interfering field matrix compound. The instrument provided a ``GB{''}
   alarm against n-hexane (1320 mg/m(3)) vapor containing dilute sarin
   (more than 0.44 mg/m(3)). The height of the band peak at 1021 cm(-1)
   increased proportionally with the concentration. Vapors of soman, tabun,
   cyclohexylsarin, VX and RVX, which were prepared in ambient air,
   provided correct alarms, and showed FT-IR spectra similar to that of
   sarin. The vapors of sulfur mustard, nitrogen mustard 3, Lewisite 1,
   cyanogen chloride and phosgene provided correct alarms with
   characteristic FT-IR features, which are different from those of nerve
   agents. The vapors of volatile CWAs except for VX and RVX provided
   correct alarm even in the presence of high level of n-hexane. The vapors
   of unregistered CWAs and mixture vapor of nerve agents were also
   examined.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Anaemia in pregnancy is a global health problem with
   associated morbidity and mortality.
   Methods: A secondary analysis of prospective, population-based study
   from 2009 to 2016 to generate maternal haemoglobin normative centiles in
   uncomplicated pregnancies in women receiving optimal antenatal care.
   Pregnant women were enrolled <14 weeks' gestation in the Fetal Growth
   Longitudinal Study (FGLS) of the INTERGROWTH-21st Project which involved
   eight geographically diverse urban areas in Brazil, China, India, Italy,
   Kenya, Oman, United Kingdom and United States. At each 5 +/- 1 weekly
   visit until delivery, information was collected about the pregnancy, as
   well as the results of blood tests taken as part of routine antenatal
   care that complemented the study's requirements, including haemoglobin
   values.
   Findings: A total of 3502 (81\%) of 4321 women who delivered a live,
   singleton newborn with no visible congenital anomalies, contributed at
   least one haemoglobin value. Median haemoglobin concentrations ranged
   from 114.6 to 121.4 g/L, 94 to 103 g/L at the 3rd centile, and from 135
   to 141 g/L at the 97th centile. The lowest values were seen between 31
   and 32 weeks' gestation, representing a mean drop of 6.8 g/L compared to
   14 weeks' gestation. The percentage variation in maternal haemoglobin
   within-site was 47\% of the total variance compared to 13\% between
   sites.
   Interpretation: We have generated International, gestational
   age-specific, smoothed centiles for maternal haemoglobin concentration
   compatible with better pregnancy outcomes, as well as adequate neonatal
   and early childhood morbidity, growth and development up to 2 years of
   age. Funding: Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation Grant number 49038. (c)

Abstract = {{Purpose: Anastomotic leakage (AL) is the most dreaded complication in
   rectal surgery. It has a great impact on postoperative morbidity and
   mortality. This animal model, in which we have studied postoperative
   metabolic and inflammatory changes, is designed to imitate an AL.
   Methods: Twelve pigs were randomized into 2 groups. In the experimental
   group, an iatrogenic rectal perforation was performed, with the control
   group having a sham operation. The 2 groups were followed for 10 hours
   after operation with regard to vital parameters, arterial lactate, and
   cytokines interleukin (IL) 1, IL6, and IL10 in the blood and
   intraperitoneally. Intraperitoneal microdialysis analyses of glucose,
   lactate, glycerol, and pyruvate were performed and the lactate/pyruvate
   ratio was calculated.
   Results: Glucose levels were lower in the experimental group after 4
   hours. After 7 hours, lactate and lactate/pyruvate ratio was higher in
   the experimental group. At the same time intraperitoneal cytokines IL6
   and IL10 were higher in the experimental group. Blood samples showed
   higher IL6 after 7 hours in the experimental group.
   Conclusion: In this study, several significant differences between the
   groups in metabolic and inflammatory values were detected. Further
   clinical studies are recommended to evaluate the importance of
   intraperitoneal metabolic and inflammatory analyses as a diagnostic tool
   for early identification of an AL.}},

Title = {{On defining storm intervals: Extreme wave analysis using extremal index
   inferencing of the run length parameter}},
Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{217}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Extreme wave analysis is essential for the design and deployment of
   marine structures. Since extremes in natural phenomena tend to occur in
   clusters, it is necessary to de-cluster them in order to form a dataset
   of independent samples. There are several algorithms used to identify
   independent storms (clusters of significant wave height extremes), most
   of which have the disadvantage of relying on an arbitrarily selected
   de-clustering parameter. In this paper, an existing statistical method
   for systematic cluster size inferencing is used with runs de-clustering,
   and applied for the first time to extreme wave analysis. The Generalised
   Pareto Distribution (GPD) is fitted to an extreme wave dataset, and the
   return periods of significant wave height extremes are calculated using
   the resulting model function. The methodology proposed in this paper is
   illustrated using hindcast data for the winter months of two locations:
   one that is exposed to the long Atlantic swell off the west coast of
   France, and another in the North Sea that is characterised by short
   fetch. This work demonstrates how extremal index estimation may be used
   in conjunction with the well-known runs de-clustering algorithm to
   predict the return periods of significant wave height extremes.}},

Journal = {{EQUILIBRIUM-QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND ECONOMIC POLICY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Research background: At the background, there are issues related to
   policy credibility and policy targets. For these issues, long-term
   forecasts can provide important information. Of course, long-term
   forecasts are needed also e.g. for evaluation of real returns.
   Purpose of the article: This paper tries to find out how informative the
   ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters data on long-term inflation
   prospects are from the point of view of the overall quality of the
   survey and on the other hand from the point of view of monetary policy
   credibility. Methods: The analysis makes use of individual forecaster
   level quarterly panel data for the period 1999Q1-2018Q4. Conventional
   panel econometrics tools are used to find out whether forecasts are
   sensitive to changes in actual inflation and other relevant variables.
   Findings \& Value added: We find some weaknesses considering the size of
   the survey, the selection of the sample (more precisely the
   participation to the survey) and the inertial responses of forecasters
   which suggest that the survey values are not actively updated. Moreover,
   we find that towards the end of the sample period, the survey values are
   related to actual inflation and to short-term expectations, which is not
   consistent with the credibility of the official inflation target.}},

Abstract = {{A noninvasive image-derived input function (IDIF) method using PET/MRI
   was applied to quantitative measurements of {[}C-11] Pittsburgh
   compound-B (PiB) distribution volume (DV) and compared with other
   metrics. Fifty-three patients suspected of early dementia (71 +/- 11 y)
   underwent 70 min {[}C-11]PiB PET/MRI. Nineteen of them (68 +/- 11 y)
   without head motion during the scan were enrolled in this study and
   compared with 16 age-matched healthy controls (CTL: 68 +/- 11 y). The
   dynamic frames reconstructed from listmode PET data were used for DV
   calculation. IDIF with metabolite correction was applied to the Logan
   plot method, and DV was normalized into DV ratio (DVR) images using the
   cerebellar reference (DVRL). DVR and standardized uptake value ratio
   (SUVR) images were also calculated using the reference tissue graphical
   method (DVRr) and the 50-70 min static data with cerebellar reference,
   respectively. Cortical values were compared using the 3D-T1WI MRI
   segmentation. All patients were assigned to the early Alzheimer's
   disease (eAD) group because of positive {[}C-11]PiB accumulation. The
   correlations of regional values were better for DVRL vs. DVRr (r(2) =
   0.97) than for SUVR vs. DVRr (r(2) = 0.88). However, all metrics clearly
   differentiated eAD from CTL with appropriate thresholds. Noninvasive
   quantitative {[}C-11]PiB PET/MRI measurement provided equivalent DVRs
   with the two methods. SUVR images showed acceptable results despite
   inferior variability and image quality to DVR images.}},

Title = {{Profiling the public health risk of canine rabies transmission in Kogi
   state, Nigeria}},
Journal = {{ONE HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Recently reports have emerged of rabies outbreaks in townships close to
   the city of Lokoja, the capital city of Kogi State in Nigeria. Areas in
   Lokoja are known to have high rates of dog bites and dogs are frequently
   butchered for human consumption, both of which may constitute risk
   factors for rabies transmission. However, data on the relative
   importance of these factors on canine rabies exposure in the densely
   populated capital of Kogi State is scarce.
   To understand the risk for public health two separate observational
   cross-sectional studies were conducted in Lokoja. Firstly, a
   retrospective study was performed to investigate the human profile of
   dog bite injuries and quantify the vaccination coverage of offending
   dogs. Information on dog bite cases and vaccination records covering of
   11 years (2003-2013) were obtained from the largest public veterinary
   clinic (i.e. State Veterinary Clinic) and a private veterinary clinic in
   Lokoja. Then, an investigation of the presence of rabies antigen in the
   brain tissues of dogs slaughtered for human consumption in Lokoja was
   performed. A total of 208 canine brain samples from five slaughter
   points within the army barracks (the main venue in Lokoja where dogs are
   slaughtered for human consumption) were examined by fluorescent antibody
   technique.
   Out of 95 human dog bite cases, 46 (48.4\%) were in persons between 10
   and 19 years of age and 57 (60\%) were males. There was a statistically
   significant association between gender of victims and their age, with a
   greater proportion of bites in males < 10 years of age compared to other
   age groups (P <.001). Our results indicated a higher frequency of dog
   bites on the legs (51\%) than other parts of the body; vaccination rates
   of offending dogs were lower compared to the general population of dogs
   presenting to clinics in Lokoja (25\% vs 31\%, respectively). Rabies
   antigen was detected in 11/203 (5.3\%) brain samples from dogs
   slaughtered for human consumption.
   Paediatric dog bites and dog slaughtering practices represent a
   significant public health risk to residents of Lokoja in the context of
   rabies exposure. In order to minimize the risk of rabies outbreaks in
   children and people butchering, handling and consuming dog meat, dog
   vaccination and health promotion and education should be prioritized to
   these high risk groups.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, polylactic acid-based composites reinforced with 5\% of
   polyethylene, iron, and magnesium powders were prepared by extrusion and
   compressed under the pressure of about 10 MPa and characterized. These
   composites were mechanically, thermally, and morphologically evaluated.
   It was found, compared to the pure polylactic acid (PLA), an improvement
   in tensile strength (both sigma and YS0.2) was obtained for the
   composite with the iron powder addition, while the magnesium powder
   slightly improved the ductility of the composite material (from 2.0 to
   2.5\%). Degradation studies of these composites in the 0.9\% saline
   solution over a period of 180 days revealed changes in the pH of the
   solution from acidic to alkaline, in all samples. The most varied mass
   loss was observed in the case of the PLA-5\%Mg sample, where initially
   the sample mass increased (first 30 days) then decreased, and after 120
   days, the mass increased again. In the context of degradation phenomenon
   of the tested materials, it turns out that the most stable is the PLA
   composite with the Fe addition (PLA-5\%Fe), with highest tensile
   strength and hardness.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has shown that perceivers spontaneously form trait
   inferences from others' behaviors received at a single point in time.
   The present work examined the persistence of spontaneous trait
   inferences (STIs) in the presence of trait-inconsistent information
   about others. We hypothesized that STIs should be resistant to change
   over time and in the presence of new trait-inconsistent information due
   to perceivers forming and storing multiple STIs independently in memory.
   Consistently, Experiments 1a and 1b showed that initial STIs were not
   affected by new trait-inconsistent information. Experiments 2 and 3
   revealed that STIs were persistent over 48 hours. Two experiments also
   tested memory reconsolidation as a possible mechanism of updating first
   impressions. While STIs were not substantially affected, spontaneous
   goal inferences (SGIs) were elevated among those with a better explicit
   memory of behaviors after learning trait-inconsistent information
   following a memory reactivation procedure. Implications of these
   findings on impression formation and updating processes are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{During the COVID-19 pandemic, a social lockdown should be put in place

   lockdown. A total of 1980 participants in Japan completed a survey for
   this study from 9 to 11 May 2020, when the state of emergency covered
   all prefectures in the country. Self-reported behavior in terms of
   staying at home, the perceived severity of the pandemic, vulnerability
   to the pandemic, response efficacy, and self-efficacy based on
   protection motivation theory were assessed. Multiple regression analysis
   showed that perceived severity (standardized beta = 0.11, p < 0.001) and
   self-efficacy (standardized beta = 0.32, p < 0.001) significantly
   predicted greater levels of staying at home, after controlling for
   socio-demographics. However, perceived vulnerability and response
   efficacy did not. To encourage people to stay at home during the

Abstract = {{This study aimed to examine the mediating role of life satisfaction in
   the relationship between basic psychological needs of adolescents and
   problematic internet use. The model established on this mediating role
   was tested using the self-determination theory. The sample of the study
   included 1318 adolescents, of whom 796 were female and 522 were male
   students. The age range of the individuals participating in the study
   varied between 14 and 17 years, and the average age was 15.38 (Standard
   Deviation= 4.77). The study obtained data through the Problematic
   Internet Use Scale-Adolescent Form, Psychological Needs Scale-High
   School Form, Life Satisfaction Scale, and Personal Information Form. The
   data were analyzed using conditional process analysis. The results
   revealed that basic psychological needs significantly negatively
   predicted problematic internet use (r(2)=0.15; p <= 0.01) and positively
   predicted life satisfaction (r(2)=0.28; p <= 0.01); whereas life
   satisfaction significantly negatively predicted problematic internet use
   (r(2)=0.08; p <= 0.01). Using the Self-determination Theory, the study
   determined that life satisfaction has a partial mediating role in the
   relationship between basic psychological needs and problematic internet
   use among high school students (c'=0.06; p <= 0.01). The study findings
   confirmed the established model. The obtained results are discussed and
   interpreted against relevant literature. Some suggestions have been
   offered to families, school counselors, and researchers.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, it was aimed to investigate the synthesis,
   characterization and drug release behaviors of organohydrogels
   containing pH-sensitive Agar (A), Glycerol (G), Thyme Oil (TO). The
   novel organo-hydrogels containing TO were prepared in an emulsion media
   by the free-radical polymerization and crosslinking reactions among Agar
   (A), Glycerol (G), TO, N, N, methylenebisacrylamide (MBA) or
   glutaraldehyde (GA) reagent. Swelling ability (ethanol, acetone,
   ethanol/ID water (1:1), acetone/ID water (1:1) and gasoline environments
   and different pH), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)
   analysis and 5-Fluorouracil (5-Flu) drug release of the organo-hydrogels
   were profoundly determined and some structural parameters for
   organohydrogels such as blood clotting, hemolysis analysis, antioxidant
   analysis were also evaluated in this study. The FTIR spectra confirmed
   that the TO was bonded onto the organo-hydrogel structure, and the A, G
   and TO macromolecular chains interpenetrated through the MBA or GA
   reagent. When swelling analyzes were examined, it was determined that
   organo-hydrogels, which added thyme oil to the structure, swelled not
   only in pure water and tap water but also in organic solvents such as
   ethanol, acetone, ethanol/ID water (1:1), acetone/ID water (1:1) and
   gasoline. All of the organo-hydrogels synthesized in the light of blood
   clotting, hemolysis analysis, antioxidant analysis were hemocompatible
   and could be used within the body. The release results indicated that
   the organo-hydrogel p(AG-m-TO)(3) and p(AG-g-TO)(3) had the highest
   84.3\% and 73.3\% release capacity. In addition, it was reported that
   the release capacities of organo-hydrogels were inversely proportional
   to the increased amount of TO. When 5-Flu drug release was examined in
   terms of kinetic models, it was observed that the release adapted to the
   Korsmeyer-Peppas (KPKM) model. And it was also determined that
   organo-hydrogels based on p(AG-m-TO) comply with the non-Fick law and
   organo-hydrogels based on p(AG-g-TO) comply with the Case II transport.
   In the light of the results obtained, their easy formability, their
   appropriate mechanical and physical properties make Organo-hydrogels
   suitable candidates for drug delivery systems.}},

Abstract = {{This study was aimed at identifying new efficient antioxidant juniper
   species and their metabolites, which are responsible for this activity.
   About 30 juniper representatives were assayed for antioxidant activity
   (DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (2,2
   `-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) radical scavenging)
   and total polyphenol content (TPC). The most active species were
   identified, and their most abundant polyphenols were quantified by the
   LC-electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS/MS-multiple reaction monitoring
   (MRM) method. In the group of studied species, J. ashei (mountain cedar)
   leaf extract was outlined as the best antioxidant with the highest TPC.
   Catechin was revealed as the most abundant polyphenol in the J. ashei
   extract, contributing to its superior antioxidant properties. An
   in-depth analysis of antioxidant capacity was also performed. The higher
   metal-chelating activity was observed in the case of J. sibirica (0.83
   mg DE/mL), whereas the lowest was observed for J. communis (3.2 mg dry
   extract (DE)/mL) extracts. All efficient antioxidant extracts were also
   able to inhibit lipoxygenase. EC50 values ranged from 1.77 to 2.44 mg
   DE/mL. The most effective inhibitors were J. ashei and J. formozana
   extracts, which acted as uncompetitive lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitors.
   The presented results have potential application in the pharmacy and
   cosmetics for the generation of antioxidant compositions based on
   naturally derived lead compounds for the prevention of oxidative-stress
   associated organ-degenerative diseases, cancer, or other free
   radical-induced disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The main aim of the fetal surgery of myelomeningocele
   (MMC) is the improvement in prognosis for children with this defect and
   at the same time high safety of the procedure for mother and fetus.
   Objective: The aim of the study was to determine the effectiveness of
   alternative hysterotomy technique for fetal surgery of MMC in prevention
   of essential perinatal complications. Methods: Forty-nine pregnant women
   diagnosed with fetal MMC (fMMC) who underwent classic hysterotomy
   without the use of stapler formed the study cohort. Two cases of
   intrauterine fetal death or neonatal death in the immediate
   perioperative period in the study group (SG) were excluded from further
   analyses. In the historical control group (46 patients) from our center
   hysterotomy was performed according to Management of Myelomeningocele
   Study (MOMS) protocol. The study cohort's outcomes were compared with
   the historical controls and with post-MOMS results in Children's
   Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and Vanderbilt University Medical Center
   (VUMC). Results: In the SG we did not observe delivery before 30 weeks
   of gestation (0/47; 0\%) and the incidence of chorionamniotic membrane
   separation (CMS, 3/47; 6\%) and preterm premature rupture of membranes
   (PPROM, 7/47; 15\%) was lower compared to the other groups. Preterm
   delivery as a result of uterine contractions occurred significantly less
   frequently in the SG (8/47; 17\%). Fetal surgery with classic
   hysterotomy resulted in rare use of magnesium sulfate (3/47; 6\%).
   Conclusions: The alternative hysterotomy technique for fetal surgery of
   MMC results in low occurrences of CMS, PPROM, preterm delivery, and the
   rare use of tocolytics.}},

Abstract = {{Recidivism is an indicator of the imperfection of the system of
   punishments, the practice of their execution, as well as the stability
   of anti-social attitudes of those who commit crimes.
   The purpose of this study is to conduct a criminological analysis of
   recidivism in the Russian Federation (to determine the level, structure
   and dynamics) in the period from 2006 to 2018 and on this basis to
   establish trends in its development.
   Criminological characteristic of recidivism includes quantitative and
   qualitative analysis of the totality of crimes committed by persons who
   have previously committed crimes, after the application of criminal law
   measures to them for previous crimes, as well as the totality of these
   persons themselves.
   The study led to conclusions about an increase in both the absolute and
   relative indices of recidivism: the number of crimes committed by
   persons who had previously committed offences increased by 18.4 per cent
   in the period under study, and the recidivism rate increased by 15.3 per
   cent. The recidivism rate doubled from 13.9\% in 2006 to 31.6\% in 2018.
   There has been an increase in the number of persons who had previously
   committed crimes, while the criminal activity of persons who were
   exempted from criminal liability for previously committed crimes on
   non-rehabilitation grounds has also increased among the detected
   offenders.
   Minor offences accounted for the largest proportion of recidivism: 54.8
   per cent. Offences of medium gravity accounted for 26.2 per cent,
   serious offences for 15 per cent and especially serious offences for 4
   per cent.
   Recidivism was mainly represented by crimes against property: their
   share was 42.7\%; crimes against persons 16.6\%, and against public
   health 11.9\%. The highest proportion of those previously convicted of
   robbery was observed (52.1\%). High recidivism rate was also observed
   among drug offenders - 28-30\%, and, as a rule, it was special
   recidivism, i.e. recidivism by those who had previously committed
   homogeneous (identical) crimes.
   Criminal record statistics during the reviewed period showed a decrease
   in the absolute number of convicts, while at the same time an increase
   in the proportion of those with an unexpunged and unexpunged criminal
   record. In 2018, the number of convicts with an unexpunged and
   unexpunged criminal record at the time of the offence was 231583, or
   35.2\% of all convicts
   Among those convicted, the proportion of those who have been sentenced
   to imprisonment for the third time or more has increased. Whereas in
   2007 their share was 20.2\%, in 2018 it was 36.1\%. - At the same time,
   the share of first-time offenders decreased from 53.7\% to 45.8\%.}},

Abstract = {{In many large-scale surveys, estimates are produced for numerous small
   domains defined by cross-classifications of demographic, geographic and
   other variables. Even though the overall sample size of such surveys
   might be very large, samples sizes for domains are sometimes too small
   for reliable estimation. We propose an improved estimation approach that
   is applicable when ``natural{''} or qualitative relationships (such as
   orderings or other inequality constraints) can be formulated for the
   domain means at the population level. We stay within a design-based
   inferential framework but impose constraints representing these
   relationships on the sample-based estimates. The resulting constrained
   domain estimator is shown to be design consistent and asymptotically
   normally distributed as long as the constraints are asymptotically
   satisfied at the population level. The estimator and its associated
   variance estimator are readily implemented in practice. The
   applicability of the method is illustrated on data from the 2015 U.S.
   National Survey of College Graduates.}},

Title = {{Are fingernail lead levels a reliable biomarker of lead internal dose?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRACE ELEMENTS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{62}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Potentially toxic elements, such as lead, can bioaccumulate
   and alter human physiology. Human biomonitoring is an essential tool to
   evaluate chemical exposures in different biological matrices (blood,
   urine, saliva, nails, and hair). Of these biological matrices, nails are
   favorable for their ease of sampling, transport and storage. The aim of
   this study was to investigate possible correlations between blood lead
   levels (BLL) and washed and non-washed fingernail lead levels (FLL) in
   55 adults living in a lead-contaminated area.
   Method: Venous blood and fingernail (thumbs and forefingers) samples
   were collected. Nails from the left hand were washed with Triton X-100
   (0.5 \% m/v) and HNO3 solution, while nails from the right hand were not
   submitted to the pre-analytical procedures. Samples were analyzed by
   graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry, and pairwise
   correlations were used to correlate lead concentrations between BLL and
   FLL; nails from fingers of the same hand and between washed and unwashed
   fingernails. Principal component analysis was performed and scatter
   diagrams were plotted to investigate correlations.
   Results: A non-significant positive correlation was found between BLL
   and washed forefinger nails lead (r = 0.219, p = 0.112) and between BLL
   and thumbnail lead levels (r = 0.182, p = 0.191). Comparison of
   fingernails from the same hand (thumb and forefinger), showed that lead
   concentrations of non-washed nails varied widely, even on analyses of
   transversal fragments from the same nail. Lead levels in non-washed
   forefinger nails were not correlated with non-washed thumbnails (r =
   0.169, p = 0.219). Conversely, washed thumb and forefinger nails were
   found to be correlated (r = 0.39, p = 0.003). Washed and non-washed
   nails were also found to be correlated (p < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: In conclusion, the results showed that non-washed nails are
   not a reliable biomarker for lead exposure. Although washing nails
   before analysis may reduce external contamination, the correlation of
   lead concentrations between fingers is poor for fingernail lead levels
   to serve as an internal dose biomarker to lead exposure. In addition,
   levels in washed nails were not significantly correlated with blood lead
   levels. Fingernail lead levels seem to serve as an indicator of lead
   exposure sources in contact with the individual, but not as a reliable
   biomarker of internal dose.}},

Title = {{Gap junction with MLO-A5 osteoblast-like cell line induces ALP and BSP

   retaining adipogenic differentiation ability}},
Journal = {{BONE}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{In bone tissues, gap junctions form direct links between the cytoplasm
   of an osteocyte and another adjacent osteocyte or osteoblast, which
   underlie both bone formation and bone resorption. We have previously
   demonstrated that alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bone sialoprotein
   (BSP), which are osteoblast markers, were induced in mesenchymal stem
   cells (MSCs) co-cultured with osteoblast-like cell line. However, the
   molecular mechanism of this process has not been fully addressed.
   Furthermore, few advances have been made toward elucidating the
   communication networks that link the status of committed cells such as
   (pre-) adipocytes that differentiated from MSCs as well as osteoblasts.
   Therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate the
   mechanism underlying the communication network between pre-adipocytes
   and osteoblasts. We evaluated the effect of co-culture with osteoblast
   on the cell status of pre-adipocytes using murine osteoblast-like cell
   line, MLO-A5, and pre-adipocyte-like cell line, 3T3-L1, respectively.
   The results presented here demonstrated that osteoblasts and
   pre-adipocytes communicate via gap junctions, and the ensuing drastic
   increase in ALP and BSP transcription in co-cultured pre-adipocytes was
   induced, at least partly, via heat shock protein family B member 1
   (Hspb1). In addition, terminal differentiation into adipocytes was
   suppressed in pre-adipocytes during co culture with osteoblast without
   loss of adipogenic differentiation ability. Interestingly, after
   co-culture with osteoblasts, isolated co-cultured pre-adipocytes were
   able to differentiate to adipocytes as well as original preadipocytes.
   These results suggest that gap junctional communication with osteoblasts
   suppressed adipogenic differentiation of pre-adipocytes without loss of
   adipogenic differentiation ability.}},

   considering five bond length (100, 200, 250, 330, and 450 mm), and the
   composite strip's age 14th, 21st, and 28th day after the bonding. Test
   results in the form of peak load, failure modes and, bond-slip diagrams

Abstract = {{Employing the media representation theory, this article uses the
   historical-analytic, key informant interview (KII) and observation
   methods to interrogate the issue of politics of succession in Nigeria as
   portrayed in Saworoide (1999, dir. Tunde Kelani) and Ikoka (2004, dir.
   Peddie Okao). Apart from highlighting the kind of challenges which
   politics evokes in the country and the possible ways of remediating them
   in a contemporary context, the study argues that Nollywood filmmakers
   have good reasons for shying away from politics, as interesting as it
   may be; it creates discomfort for governments as well as for the
   filmmakers. The former on account of their allergy to the truth and the
   latter on the likelihood of their works being confiscated, banned or
   even risk to life. The conclusion reached is that filmmakers who engage
   politics in their creative works deserve encouragement because growing
   societies such as Nigeria, are in dire need of spokesmen and women, who
   as change agents, can engender positive and developmental agendas in
   their ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{We examined fragmentary human skeletal remains from Escalon Cave near
   Surigao City, northeastern Mindanao, the Philippines, with respect to
   the morphology of bones and teeth, radiocarbon dating, and mitochondrial
   DNA (mtDNA) haplogroup. These remains contained parts of the left
   temporal bone, the right humerus, the right femur, the upper right first
   and second premolars, and the first molar. They are presumed to belong
   to an early-middle adult male, whom we named the Escalon Man. Using the
   femur sample, we estimated the C-14 date of the individual at 2692 +/-
   39 years BP (uncalibrated). His stature, estimated from the maximum
   femur length, was about 170 cm this makes him much taller than the Aeta
   and the Mamanwa, who are indigenous negrito hunter-gatherers of the
   Philippines. The femur is sturdy and shows well-developed muscle
   markings. Numerous narrow grooves on the humerus were found in close
   proximity to each other, but we could not prove whether these are
   artificial cut marks made by humans with sharp-edged tools or scratches
   from some non-human entity. The mesiodistal crown diameters of the molar
   and premolars are large and resemble those of native Oceanians. Analysis
   of mtDNA haplogroup was carried out using a DNA sample extracted from a
   molar. A next-generation sequencer was used to determine the nucleotide
   sequences of the mtDNA genome. The results indicated that the Escalon
   Man belongs to the haplogroup Elal a, which is known to be the marker of
   Austronesian-speaking agriculturist populations that originated in
   Taiwan and spread southwards through the Philippines to the Western
   Pacific, since about 4000 BR. Thus, the Escalon Man was likely a member
   of the late Neolithic or early Metal Age agriculturist peoples who
   settled in northeastern Mindanao and who may be the ancestors of the
   territory's present-day occupants, such as the Manobo.}},

Abstract = {{Background and AimRetrospective analysis of the utility of adjuvant
   radiation (RT) or chemoradiation (CRT) and identify prognostic features
   for patients with high-risk head and neck salivary gland cancers.
   MethodsFrom 1/1997 to 12/2017, 108 patients underwent surgery, and RT (n
   = 50) or CRT (n = 58) for positive lymph node(s), extracapsular
   extension, perineural invasion, lymphovascular space invasion,
   positive/close margin, and/or grade 3 disease. Outcomes were estimated
   with the Kaplan-Meier method. Significant predictors identified through
   regression analyses were incorporated into multivariable regression
   (MVA). Toxicities were compared using chi-square.
   ResultsThe median follow-up was 52months (range: 3-226). The number of
   risk factors (RFs) between RT and CRT groups were: 0 to 1 (44\% vs 7\%),
   2 to 3 (48\% vs 41\%), or 4 to 6 (8\% vs 52\%), respectively (P<.01). On
   MVA, stage 3 or 4 disease predicted worse outcomes including overall
   survival (HR 4.55, P = .01). Increasing number of RFs predicted worse
   disease-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, and overall
   survival (2-3 RFs: HR 3.38, P = .03; 4-6 RFs: HR 5.78, P<.01), but not
   locoregional control (P = .54). So, adjuvant CRT may have provided
   comparable locoregional control for patients with more adverse features,
   but the CRT did not translate into improved distant control. There was
   no difference in acute or late grade 3+ toxicities, or parenteral
   nutrition (P = .98, P = .85, and P = .83), respectively.
   ConclusionsAdjuvant CRT provides adequate locoregional control in
   patients with more adverse RFs. The absolute number of RFs serves
   prognostic significance and should be considered in future prospective
   trials.}},

   These are synthesized in two steps using inexpensive pyrrole

   architectures (ALPHY) show multi-color (cyan, yellow, and orange)
   photoluminescence in solution and in the solid-state, which depends on
   the substituents of the ligands. The photoluminescence quantum yields of
   helicates were up to 54 \%. The right-handed (P) and left-handed (M)
   helicates are so stable that they do not undergo racemization in some
   solvents and are mirror images according to circular dichroism and
   circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with an absolute luminescence
   dissymmetry factor (g(lum)) of up to the 10(-3) order. Mixing the

Abstract = {{Calves may experience increased oxidative stress at birth through
   activation of metabolic and respiratory processes. Reducing oxidative
   stress may enhance calf viability in early life. Our objective was to
   determine the dose response to fish and flaxseed oil when supplemented
   in colostrum on concentrations of plasma fatty acid (FA), FA
   metabolites, and index of oxidative stress during the critical first
   week of life in calves to understand how supplementing n-3 FA may
   decrease oxidative stress. We hypothesized that n-3 FA supplemented in
   colostrum in a linear dose-dependent fashion would associate with
   increased plasma n-3 FA concentrations and decreased oxidative stress.
   Twenty-four male and female Iiolstein calves were randomly assigned to
   receive 0, 30, 60, or 120 mL of a 1:1 fish to flaxseed oil supplement in
   colostrum. All calves received 2.8 L of previously frozen colostrum (>=
   22\% Brix) with their respective treatment within 6 h after birth. Blood
   was sampled before first feeding after birth and on d 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14
   d of age to assess oxidant status and plasma free PUFA, phospholipid FA,
   and oxylipid concentrations. Health indicators were observed daily.
   Indicators of general health and growth were unaffected by treatment.
   Supplemented calves exhibited greater concentrations of n-3 FA in plasma
   as free and phospholipid FA and some n-3 and n-6 FA-derived oxylipids in
   the first week of life in a linear fashion with increasing supplemental
   close. Fish and flaxseed oil treatments did not alter oxidant status but
   overall decreased isoprostane concentrations in plasma, indicating
   oxidative stress was decreased. Together, these responses indicate that
   the fish and flaxseed oil supplement was antiinflarnmatory. In
   conclusion, supplementing colostrum with 30, 60, and 120 mL of a 1:1
   mixture of fish and flaxseed oil linearly increased plasma
   concentrations of n-3 FA and metabolites and decreased biomarkers of
   oxidative stress, but did not alter oxidant status or affect health or
   growth. Our findings suggest neonatal calves may benefit from n-3 FA
   supplementation in colostrum to encourage a greater antiinflammatory
   state.}},

Title = {{Gold leaching from oxide ores in alkaline glycine solutions in the
   presence of permanganate}},
Journal = {{HYDROMETALLURGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{198}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the effect of using strong oxidants with alkaline glycine
   solutions on the leach rate and recovery of gold was studied in the
   absence of cyanide. Prior research indicated that when using only
   alkaline glycine and air at ambient temperature in the absence of
   catalysts, leaching times would be too long for conventional agitated
   tank leaching of ores. The ores used in this study were from oxidised
   geological domains, which would not be expected to excessively consume
   oxidant. Ores with reactive sulfides or other reducing minerals would be
   expected to rapidly consume an oxidant, making the process ineffective.
   The influence of the oxidants such as potassium permanganate, hydrogen
   peroxide, sodium chlorate, potassium iodide, and potassium ferricyanide
   were initially evaluated in a screening test. The highest gold
   extractions were observed with potassium permanganate, where a recovery
   of 85.1\% was achieved at 1.5 kg/t glycine and 3 kg/t permanganate at
   30\% solids, pH 10.5 and ambient temperature using a bottle roll
   process. This compared to a 87.4\% recovery against a conventional
   cyanidation benchmark with 30\% solids, pH 10.5 and ambient temperature
   using the bottle roll. Other oxidants only achieved a recovery of 11\%
   at best, so permanganate was the focus of the optimisation work. The
   solution pH had very little effect on gold recovery between 9.5 and
   11.5. The ratio of glycine to permanganate concentration is significant,
   if potassium permanganate is in a molar excess, the recovery is greatly
   reduced due to oxidation of the glycine. The main products of this
   reaction, when lime was used as pH modifier, were determined to be
   calcium carbonate, calcium oxalate, trace amounts of ammonia and
   manganese dioxide. Gold is recoverable from leach solutions by
   conventional adsorption onto activated carbon.}},

   the US, we found positive impacts of perceived brand relationship
   quality and brand experiences on brand satisfaction and loyalty. Our
   paper emphasizes the influence of perceived brand identity notion in
   digital experiences. By designing a blueprint for marketing experiences,
   companies can develop innovative processes to deliver more excellent
   experiential marketing to consumers on top of the existing features of
   their brand offers.}},

Abstract = {{Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are key regulators of the link
   between inflammation and cancer, and the interplay between TAM and tumor
   cells represents a promising target of future therapeutic approaches. We
   investigated the effect of gallic acid (GA) and caffeic acid (CA) as
   strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents on tumor growth,
   angiogenesis, macrophage polarization, and oxidative stress on the
   angiogenic model caused by the intraperitoneal (ip) inoculation of
   Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) cells (2.5 x 10(6)) in Swiss albino mouse.
   Treatment with GA or CA at a dose of 40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg ip was
   started in exponential tumor growth phase on days 5, 7, 9, and 11. On
   day 13, the ascites volume and the total number and differential count
   of the cells present in the peritoneal cavity, the functional activity
   of macrophages, and the antioxidant and anti-angiogenic parameters were
   determined. The results show that phenolic acids inhibit the processes
   of angiogenesis and tumor growth, leading to the increased survival of
   EAT-bearing mice, through the protection of the tumoricidal efficacy of
   M1 macrophages and inhibition of proangiogenic factors, particularly
   VEGF, metalloproteinases -2 and -9, and cyclooxygenase-2 activity.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Unintentional injuries in children under the age of 5 years commonly
   occur in the home and disproportionately affect those living in
   disadvantaged circumstances. Targeted home safety promotion should be
   offered to families most at risk but there is a paucity of standardised
   evidence-based resources available for use across family-support
   practitioners.
   Objective
   To assess the effectiveness, implementation and cost-effectiveness of a
   2-year home safety programme (Stay One Step Ahead) developed by parents,
   practitioners and researchers, and delivered by a range of family
   support providers in inner-city localities, compared with usual care in
   matched control localities.
   Methods
   Parents of children aged 0 to 7 months will be recruited to a controlled
   before and after observational study. The primary outcome is home safety
   assessed by the proportion of families with a fitted and working smoke
   alarm, safety gate on stairs (where applicable) and poisons stored out
   of reach, assessed using parent-administered questionnaires at baseline,
   12 and 24 months.
   Secondary outcomes include: the impact on other parent-reported safety
   behaviours, medically-attended injuries, self-efficacy for home safety
   and knowledge of child development and injury risk using questionnaires
   and emergency department attendance data; implementation (reach,
   acceptability, barriers, facilitators) of home safety promotion assessed
   through interviews and observations; and cost-effectiveness using
   medically-attended injury costs ascertained from healthcare records.
   Conclusion
   If shown to be effective and cost-effective this study will provide a
   practical resource to underpin national guidance. The study could inform
   public health prevention strategies to reduce home injury in children
   most at risk, while delivering cost savings to health and care services.}},

Title = {{Benchmarking national action plans on antimicrobial resistance in eight
   selected LMICs: Focus on the veterinary sector strategies}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background The WHO Global Action Plan on antimicrobial resistance (GAP)
   provides a global strategy for combating antimicrobial resistance.
   Context-specific national action plans (NAP) translate GAP to reflect
   local priorities. However, the process by which countries translate GAP
   into NAPs, and the resultant concordance, is not well-known. The aim of
   the paper is to evaluate the NAPs of eight selected low- and
   lower-middle income countries (LMICs) against GAP and each other to
   identify best practices with a focus on the veterinary sector.
   Methods Using the WHO GAP, and the WHO Manual for designing NAPs, we
   performed a policy content evaluation for: Afghanistan, Bangladesh,
   Ethiopia, Ghana, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan and Uganda. NAPs were assessed
   as concordant with GAP if they contained >= 80\% of the recommendations.
   Operational and monitoring and evaluation (M\&E) plans were assessed as:
   Specific, Measurable, Assignable, and Time-bound (or SMAT). Financing,
   targets and legislation for antimicrobial use reduction, and medicine
   quality assurance mechanisms were assessed using a constructed
   framework. Countries were then ranked using a scoring system to identify
   best practices.
   Results All NAPs contained >= 80\% of GAP's recommendations. Whereas
   Nepal's NAP was strategic, the rest were operational and uniformly SMAT;
   except Afghanistan's. The M\&E plans were not all SMAT. Detailed costing
   and funding sources were included for only Ghana and Uganda.
   Quantitative target for antimicrobial use reduction was found only in
   Nepal's NAP and legislation only for Bangladesh. Ghana's and Uganda's
   medicine quality assurance mechanisms were the most robust.
   Conclusions All NAPs were concordant with GAP However, gaps exist in
   relation to M\&E, diminishing the countries' capacity to be accountable
   and implement corrective action if necessary Most lacked financing plans
   and targets for antimicrobial use reduction. The antimicrobial quality
   assurances strategies are limited in most of the NAPs assessed. A
   mechanism by which countries can benchmark their NAP would allow
   identification of specific limitations and areas of best practice.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Diabetic retinopathy (DRP) is the formation of edema and small
   vessels in the retina due to high blood glucose levels. Asprosin is a
   hormone that stimulates the release of glucose from the liver into the
   circulation. Considering the relationship between oxidative stress and
   DRP, our study aimed to determine the levels of the oxidative stress
   markers 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine
   (8-OHdG), as well as asprosin, in the blood and aqueous humor (Aq) of
   patients with and without DRP.
   Methods: Thirty patients with single-eye DRP and cataract (DRP + C), 30
   patients with diabetes mellitus and cataract without DRP (DM + C), and
   30 healthy control (CON) participants were enrolled into this
   retrospective study. Except for healthy controls, Aq and blood samples
   were taken from these patients during their cataract operation.
   Asprosin, 4-HNE, and 8-OHdG concentrations were analyzed using
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.
   Results: In patients with DRP, the levels of asprosin, 4-HNE, and 8-OHdG
   were significantly higher in both Aq and blood samples compared with the
   group of patients without DRP.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that the measurement of asprosin,
   4-HNE, and 8-OHdG levels may support clinicians in determining the risk
   of DRP development.}},

Title = {{Gamma ray log generation from drilling parameters using deep learning}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{195}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Lithology identification plays a vital role in defining the petroleum
   reservoir. Although well logging represents the traditional means of
   obtaining petrophysical data for lithology identification, there could
   be cases where logging while drilling instruments may fail during
   drilling. This paper presents an approach that utilizes drilling
   parameters obtained from mud logging and measurement while drilling
   (MWD) for real-time prediction of gamma ray log which is used as a
   lithology identifier. In this work, several machine learning
   methodologies, such as simple recurrent neural network (RNN), long
   short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN), temporal
   convolution network (TCN), gated recurrent unit (GRU) network, nonlinear
   autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) and simple
   artificial neural network (ANN) were tested for their ability to capture
   the relationship between hydro-mechanical specific energy (computed from
   drilling parameters) and gamma ray log. A recently drilled exploration
   gas well in the tertiary deltaic system of the Niger delta basin was
   used as the case study. Based on the field data, the results show the
   TCN and simple RNN performed best. The receptive field of the TCN played
   a significant role in its performance, and therefore, the LSTM-RNN can
   be made to perform comparable to that of TCN/simple RNN if the LSTM-RNN
   is manually made to work with an optimal window of input data points for
   each output data point. The size and nature of the data (volume,
   velocity, variety, and veracity) is likely a significant factor in the
   performance of the machine learning methodologies. Thus, it is
   recommended to focus on obtaining the best receptive field of the data
   during the machine learning development phase.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is used during pregnancy
   in women diagnosed with thrombophilia for prevention of thromboembolic
   events and prevention of recurrent pregnancy loss. Prophylactic dosing
   does not always achieve target anti-FXa levels of 0.2-0.6 IU/ml. We
   aimed to determine if anti-FXa levels, measured in the first trimester,
   have an influence on pregnancy outcome.
   Material and Methods Eighty-one first-trimester women with a history of
   adverse pregnancy outcomes under LMWH therapy during pregnancy were
   enrolled in this study. Anti-FXa levels were measured in the first
   trimester, and fetal and maternal outcomes were recorded.
   Results The mean age of women was 28 +/- 4 (19-40) and mean anti-FXa
   level 0.44 +/- 0.93 IU/ml. No bleeding or clotting complications were
   associated with LMWH administration. Anti-FXa levels did not have a
   relationship with gestational age at birth, fetal weight, type of
   delivery, cesarean indications, postpartum bleeding, APGAR scores, or
   admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (p > 0.005). Anti-FXa
   levels were not correlated with live birth rates.
   Conclusion Anti-FXa levels did not have an influence on pregnancy and
   fetal outcomes. The effect of LMWH on pregnancy outcomes may not be due
   to anticoagulant activity but other mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Body-biased micro-electro-mechanical (MEM) relays previously have been
   demonstrated to be a promising alternative to transistors for ultra-low
   voltage digital logic applications. A basic requirement for reliable
   relay-based circuit operation is suitably low and stable relay ON-state
   resistance (R-ON). In this work, the effect of body biasing on R-ON is
   investigated for relays of different contact designs. It is found that a
   single direct contact design not only provides for the smallest
   hysteresis voltage but also the smallest R-ON, making it the most
   suitable for low voltage applications. Body-biased operation is found to
   degrade R-ON stability over many ON/OFF switching cycles, however, due
   to a reduction in contact velocity. {[}2020-0297]}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The ability of Xylaria species obtained from tropical wood and leaf
   litter to cause a mass loss of lignin and carbohydrates in wood was
   examined in vitro with pure culture decomposition tests. The mass loss
   of wood of four tree species caused by nine Xylaria isolates ranged from
   4.5\% to 28.4\% of the original wood mass. These Xylaria isolates have a
   potential ability to decompose lignin and other recalcitrant compounds,
   collectively registered as acid unhydrolyzable residues or Klason lignin
   in wood. The origin of isolates (i.e., isolates from wood versus leaf
   litter) did not affect the mass loss of acid unhydrolyzable residue in
   wood. The Xylaria isolates tested generally caused a selective
   decomposition of polymer carbohydrates in wood in preference to acid
   unhydrolyzable residue. The mass loss of acid unhydrolyzable residue
   caused by Xylaria isolates varied with the tree species of the wood and
   was negatively related to the initial content of acid unhydrolyzable
   residue in wood, implying the limiting effect of lignin and recalcitrant
   compounds on wood decomposition by Xylaria isolates.}},

Abstract = {{This article deals with installations with complex and nonstandard
   executive instrument movement. Having analyzed the technical
   implementation and operational features of cold-rolling pipe mills, the
   research team formulated the problem of synthesizing electric drives of
   auxiliary mechanisms. It is shown that the conditions for choosing a
   mechanical converter are associated with the oscillation of the
   processes of the electric drive system. The finite element method and
   the gradient descent method are used for structural analysis of solids
   and electromagnetic calculations. The data of the specific cost of
   semiconductor converters were analyzed using a linear least-squares
   regression technique. The advantages of a synchronous reluctance motor
   of independent excitation for the electric drives of auxiliary
   mechanisms are given and substantiated. The optimization of the
   geometrical parameters of the electromechanical converter was carried
   out according to the maximum developed electromagnetic torque. Modern
   semiconductor technology in the design of special-purpose electric
   drives leads to a revision of the principles for determining the optimal
   number of phases and the structure of the motor power supply. The
   rationale for the use of multilevel frequency converters is given.
   Taking into account an in-depth preliminary analysis and an integrated
   approach, these tasks were successfully completed, which was confirmed
   experimentally at the implementation of the developed system.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The Embedded Healthcare Research Conference aimed to promote
   and enhance research-operations partnerships in diverse health care
   settings. Within this conference, the Priorities and Methods Workgroup
   set out to define a vision of embedded research that leverages diverse
   methods to address clearly articulated research questions of importance
   to health systems.
   Methods: The Workgroup session involved a combination of small and large
   group discussions around three broadly focused topics: the integration
   of embedded research within the existing quality improvement (QI)
   ecosystem; the identification, prioritization and formulation of
   embedded research questions; the creation of an embedded research ``tool
   kit.{''}
   Results: Workgroup participants envisioned a future for embedded
   research that is characterized by authentic engagement between
   researchers and health system leaders; seamless integration between
   research, QI and clinical operations; clear and explicit articulation of
   research questions; an appropriate balance between rigor and relevance
   in applied methodology; alignment between study design, available
   resources and the importance of the knowledge to be gained; efficient
   processes; and bi-directional communication. Important barriers to
   achieving this vision include limited access to executive leaders, silos
   that discourage integration of research and QI, generally low tolerance
   for disruption in high-risk clinical settings, limited access to data,
   and limited availability of researchers with requisite skills and
   training.
   Conclusions: Embedded research holds potential to enhance the relevance,
   value and use of research, while also creating generalizable knowledge.
   Key recommendations include building authentic relationships,
   discouraging silos, encouraging innovation and experimentation, and
   expanding opportunities for funding research in delivery systems.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare immediate and
   short-term effects of combining dray needling (DN) + patient education
   vs ischemic compression (IC) + patient education for treating myofascial
   trigger points (MTP) in office workers with neck pain.
   Methods: This was a single-blinded, randomized trial. Thirty-two
   participants were randomly assigned to either DN + patient education or
   IC + patient education group. Both groups received 2 treatment sessions
   with a 48-hour time interval. Pain intensity, cervical range of motion,
   Neck Disability Index, and satisfaction were measured.
   Results: Pain intensity and neck disability level decreased, whereas the
   cervical range of motion (side-bending and rotation) increased in both
   groups. Analysis of variance revealed a significant interaction of group
   pound treatment only for pain intensity, indicating a greater reduction
   in the IC group. Satisfaction generally increased in the follow-up
   assessment in both groups.
   Conclusion: Both intervention groups had some positive immediate and

Abstract = {{Introduction: Antibody tests for detecting varicella-zoster virus
   include the fluorescent-antibody-to-membrane-antigen (FAMA) assay,
   immune adherence hemagglutination assay (IAHA), enzyme immunoassay
   (EIA), and the glycoprotein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (gpELISA). Although FAMA and gpELISA are highly sensitive, FAMA is not
   available commercially. Therefore, this study was performed to compare
   potential high-sensitivity tests with commercially available tests.
   Methods: Four antibody tests, FAMA, gpELISA, EIA, and IAHA, were
   performed using sera collected from 32 children aged 7 months-10 years.
   Using FAMA as a reference, the sensitivity and specificity of gpELISA,
   EIA, and IAHA were assessed. Subsequently, using gpELISA as a reference,
   the positive agreement rate of EIA and IAHA was assessed.
   Results: On a reference scale with FAMA set at 100\%, the sensitivity
   and specificity of the antibody tests were as follows: gpELISA, 67\% and
   100\%; EIA, 67\% and 100\%; and IAHA, 47\% and 100\%, respectively. The
   positive agreement rates of EIA and IAHA relative to gpELISA were 86\%
   and 64\%, respectively.
   Conclusions: gpELISA had a lower positive rate than did FAMA, and showed
   comparable sensitivity to that of EIA. (C) 2020 Japanese Society of

Abstract = {{Crop management and soil properties affect greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions from cropping systems. Irrigation is one of the agronomical
   management practices that deeply affects soil nitrous oxide (N2O)
   emissions. Careful management of irrigation, also concerning to soil
   type, might mitigate the emissions of this powerful GHG from
   agricultural soils. In the Mediterranean area, despite the relevance of
   the agricultural sector to the overall economy and sustainable
   development, the topic of N2O emissions does not have the same
   importance as N2O fluxes in temperate agricultural areas. Only some
   research has discussed N2O emissions from Mediterranean cropping
   systems. Therefore, in this study, N2O emissions from different soil
   types (sandy-loam and clay soils) were analyzed in relation to the
   irrigation of a maize crop grown in two contrasting seasons (2009-2010).
   The irrigation was done using a center pivot irrigation system about
   twice a week. The N2O emissions were monitored throughout the two-years
   of maize crop growth. The emissions were measured with the accumulation
   technique using eight static chambers (four chambers per site). Nitrogen
   fertilizer was applied in the form of ammonium sulphate and urea with
   3,4 dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) nitrification inhibitors. In 2009,
   the N2O emissions and crop biomass measured in both soil types were
   lower than those measured in 2010. This situation was a lower amount of
   water and nitrogen (N) available to the crop. In 2010, the N2O fluxes
   were higher in the clay site than those in the sandy-loam site after the
   first fertilization, whereas an opposite trend was found after the
   second fertilization. The soil temperature, N content, and soil humidity
   were the main drivers for N2O emission during 2009, whereas during 2010,
   only the N content and soil humidity affected the nitrous oxide
   emissions. The research has demonstrated that crop water management
   deeply affects soil N2O emissions, acting differently for
   denitrification and nitrification. The soil properties affect N2O
   emission by influencing the microclimate conditions in the root zone,
   conditioning the N2O production.}},

Abstract = {{Background Few fetuses survive childbirth when the mother is positive
   for Ebola virus, with almost all being miscarried or stillborn, or dying
   shortly after birth. Before 2019, only two infants had been reported
   surviving past 28 days, of whom one tested positive for Ebola virus and
   subsequently received experimental therapies. Little is understood
   regarding the care of surviving neonates born to Ebola virus-positive
   mothers in the postnatal period and how novel anti-Ebola virus therapies
   might affect neonatal outcomes.
   Methods In this case series, we report on two neonates liveborn during
   the 2018-20 North Kivu Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the
   Congo who, along with their Ebola virus-positive mothers, received
   investigational monoclonal antibody treatment (mAB114 or REGN-EB3) as
   part of a randomised controlled trial (NCT03719586).
   Findings Both infants were born Ebola-negative and progressed well while
   in the Ebola Treatment Centre. Neither neonate developed evidence of
   Ebola virus disease during the course of the admission, and both were
   Ebola-negative at 21 days and remained healthy at discharge.
   Interpretation To our knowledge these neonates are the first documented
   as Ebola virus-negative at birth after being born to Ebola
   virus-positive mothers, and only the third and fourth neonates ever
   documented to have survived into infancy. Although no conclusions can be
   drawn from this small case series, and further research is required to
   investigate the neonatal effects of antibody therapies, these cases
   warrant review regarding whether post-delivery antibody therapy should
   be considered for all liveborn neonates of Ebola virus-positive mothers.
   In the context of a low resource setting, where survival of
   low-birthweight infants is poor, these cases also highlight the
   importance of adequate neonatal care. Copyright (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The present study deals with the treatment of an artificial
   pharmaceutical waste which contained amoxicillin (AMX) by using
   successively an electrocoagulation (EC) with Ca(NO3)(2) as an
   electrolyte and a nanofiltration (NF) with a Nanomax-50 membrane. The
   effect of the current intensity and of the operating pressure was
   investigated for separately EC and NF, respectively. The AMX removal as
   a function of pH and initial AMX concentration was also investigated for
   the separately conducted EC and NF processes. The best percentage
   removal of AMX by EC and NF was recorded to be 52.7 \% and 99.0 \%,
   respectively. In the case of the sequential processes EC followed by NF,
   the removal of AMX was 98.2 \% and 97.5 \% at pH 2.5 and 10,
   respectively. The contribution of both EC and NF towards the AMX removal
   efficiency in the case of the sequential process was very much
   significant. It is remarkable that the EC pre-treated feed into NF was
   explored with several benefits such as high removal efficiency, calcium
   involved in EC process, prolonged membrane life and reduced power
   consumption. The electrogenerated solids (the sediment and the cathode
   deposit) were characterized using Fourier Transform Infra-red
   spectroscopy (FTIR), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) coupled to
   Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
   (XPS) and Thermo Gravimetry Analysis (TGA). It appeared that calcium was
   involved in the electrogenerated solids. It gave a cathode deposit of
   Ca(OH)(2) in which some AMX was embedded.}},

Abstract = {{The results from a temporal linear stability analysis of a subsonic
   boundary layer over a flat plate with a straight and wavy leading edge
   are presented in this paper for a swept and un-swept plate. For the wavy
   leading-edge case, an extensive study on the effects of the amplitude
   and wavelength of the waviness was performed. Our results show that the
   wavy leading edge increases the critical Reynolds number for both swept
   and un-swept plates. For the un-swept plate, increasing the leading-edge
   amplitude increased the critical Reynolds number, while changing the
   leading-edge wavelength had no effect on the mean flow and hence the
   flow stability. For the swept plate, a local analysis at the
   leading-edge peak showed that increasing the leading-edge amplitude
   increased the critical Reynolds number asymptotically, while the
   leading-edge wavelength required optimization. A global analysis was
   subsequently performed across the span of the swept plate, where smaller
   leading-edge wavelengths produced relatively constant critical Reynolds
   number profiles that were larger than those of the straight leading
   edge, while larger leading-edge wavelengths produced oscillating
   critical Reynolds number profiles. It was also found that the most
   amplified wavenumber was not affected by the wavy leading-edge geometry
   and hence independent of the waviness.}},

Abstract = {{The prevalence of global warming and climate change are associated with
   carbon dioxide (CO2) emitting from fossil fuel combustion and Portland
   cement (PC) production. However, in a bid to minimize over-reliance on
   PC, this study recycled a supplementary cementitious material (SCM),
   anacardium occidentale nutshell ash (AONSA), for the production of green
   concrete. AONSA was used as a replacement for Portland limestone cement
   (PLC) at 0, 5,10, 15, and 20 \% using the mix design proportions (MDPs)
   of grades 25 (M 25), 30 (M 30), and 40 (M 40) concrete. The chemical
   compositions of both AONSA and PLC were analyzed. Moreover, the chemical
   moduli of each and mixed binder were determined and evaluated, hence
   quantifying the reactivity indexes (RIs). Consequently, RIs and MDPs
   were applied to predict the splitting tensile strength. Compared with
   the experimental results, the predictive splitting tensile strength
   relative to the RIs and the MDPs yielded a high precision with 95 \% R-2
   at 28 days curing. Therefore, the model equations proposed by this study
   can be applied to the concrete mix design procedure for the splitting
   tensile strength of green concrete incorporating SCMs provided the
   chemical compositions of each and mixed material are established. (C)

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION: Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the
   pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a rare congenital cardiac anomaly that can
   be cured with surgical treatment. It accounts for 0.25 to 0.5\% of all
   congenital heart diseases. ALCAPA is generally asymptomatic in the
   neonatal period. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and mitral valve
   insufficiency (MVI) are detected in patients with symptoms of heart
   failure. ALCAPA, which is a rare cause of DCM, early surgical treatment
   provides quite good prognosis in the first year of life. However,
   mortality is high in patients who do not receive surgical treatment.
   MATERIALS and METHODS: Six patients diagnosed with DCM at our clinic
   between January, 2005 and December, 2017 and detected with ALCAPA
   syndrome in their etiological assessment we re-evaluated retrospectively
   RESULTS: Of the 6 patients, 5 were female and 1 was male. The average
   age of diagnosis was 4,75 months. All patients had the signs and
   symptoms of heart failure at admission. All cases had the signs of
   ischemia in the chest leads, D1 and aVL in the electrocardiograms
   (ECGs). In allcases, echocardiography (ECHO) showed mitral insufficiency
   and the dilation of the left ventricle and the mean ejection fraction
   was 29,3\% (18-39\%), and the mean shortening fraction was 12,6\%
   (8-19\%) in the ECHOs. Diagnostic catheter angiography was performed for
   all patients and the diagnosis of ALCAPA was confirmed. All patients
   under went correction surgery with there implantation method. Four of
   the patients completely recovered after surgery. One patient died 5 days
   after the surgery. One patient is being followed up with medical
   treatment since there was no improvement in her cardiac functions after
   surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: The ALCAPA syndrome should definitely be considered in the
   etiology of cases diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy and it should be
   kept in mind that ALCAPA is completely treatable disease with early
   diagnosis and treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Olives can be used both for table consumption or oil production. For
   table consumption, curing olives is an ancient process that turns the
   naturally bitter raw fruit into a deliciously salty, tart snack. This
   study is aimed to investigate table olive characteristics of raw and
   processed olives from six cultivar candidates. Cultivar candidates were
   developed by cross breeding between Gemlik and Edinciksu cultivars.
   Olive from Gemlik cultivar, genitor and widespread produced table olive
   cultivar in Turkey, was used for comparison. Fruit and seed size with
   weight, water content, titratable acidity, pH, hardness, color along
   with oleuropein absorbance (K-345) value, salt, total phenolic content,
   antioxidant activity and sensory analysis were studied on both raw and
   processed olives. Results showed that the average fruit weight,
   titratable acidity, oleuropein absorbance value, total phenolic content
   and antioxidant activity of raw and processed olives of genotypes were
   found between 4.3-6.5 and 3.9-6.0 g, 0.27-0.38\% and 0.33-0.59\%,

   respectively. Statistically significant difference was observed between
   raw and processed olive for salt, total phenolic content, antioxidant
   activity, oleuropein absorbance and hardness. It might be caused by
   genetic factors, which affect skin and tissue permeability of olives
   during processing. Result of this study showed that there were
   differences on physical and chemical characteristics og genotypes and
   GE379 had highest total phenol content, GE397 had highest fruit weight

Abstract = {{In this study, a new hybrid electrochemical drilling (ECD) method is
   proposed. The method makes use of a tubular tool capable of rotating and
   an electrolyte flushing through the inner hole at the same time. The
   designed and manufactured small size ECD machine's most important
   features are the regulation of the tool feed rate via current feedback
   control and the use of a rotating tubular tool with internal electrolyte
   flushing. The powder metal (PM) FLN2 4405 steel was drilled by using a
   brass tubular tool with various combinations of machining parameters
   such as machining voltage, electrolyte concentration and flushing
   pressure, and tool rotation speed. The machining performance outputs,
   namely, material removal rate (MRR), average radial overcut (RADOC),
   conicity (CO) and hole geometries were calculated and compared in
   different machining conditions. The results have shown that the
   aforementioned variables had a direct impact on the machining
   performance outputs in ECD. In all experiments, MRR increased with an in
   increase in machining voltage, tool rotational speed, electrolyte
   concentration and flushing pressure. RADOC values decreased with the
   rotational speed of the tool. The present study shows that deep holes
   with precise geometries and dimensions can be drilled successfully by
   employing the proposed hybrid ECD method. The method is economical and
   environmentally friendly since it requires low machining current values
   (0.1 to 0.7A) and a small amount of non-hazardous halide salt solutions
   instead of acidic solutions throughout the drilling process.}},

   are not developed sufficiently in many countries. In this context, the
   factors affecting the development of capital markets in 21 out of 57

   analyzed using data for 1981-2018 period by applying panel data
   analysis. In this study, capital market development variable is
   represented by the stock market capitalization ratio. Hausman test was
   used to choose between fixed effects and random effects. Hausman test
   results indicate the best estimator for the model is random effect. In
   addition, there was no autocorrelation problem. Due to the existence of
   a heteroscedastic problem, a robust test was performed to solve it.
   Robust test findings show that, fixed capital formation, market
   liquidity, exports, and corruption control rate variables positively
   affect the capital market development. However, capital market

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Spinal cord dose limits are critically important for the
   safe practice of spine stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). However,
   the effect of inherent spinal cord motion on cord dose in SBRT is
   unknown.
   OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of cord motion on spinal cord dose in
   SBRT.
   METHODS: Dynamic balanced fast field echo (BFFE) magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) was obtained in 21 spine metastasis patients treated with
   SBRT. Planning computed tomography (CT), conventional static T2-weighted
   MRI, BFFE MRI, and dose planning data were coregistered. Spinal cord
   from the dynamic BFFE images (cord(dyn)) was compared with the
   T2-weighted MRI (cord(stat)) to analyze motion of cord(dyn) beyond the
   cord(stat) (Dice coefficient, Jaccard index), and beyond cord(stat) with
   added planning organ at risk volume (PRV) margins. Cord dose was
   compared between cord(stat), and cord(dyn) (Wilcoxon signed-rank test).
   RESULTS: Dice coefficient (0.70-0.95, median 0.87) and Jaccard index
   (0.54-0.90, median 0.77) demonstrated motion of cord(dyn) beyond
   cord(stat). In 62\% of the patients (13/21), the dose to cord(dyn)
   exceeded that of cord(stat) by 0.6\% to 13.8\% (median 4.3\%). The
   cord(dyn) spatially excursed outside the 1-mm PRV margin of cord(stat)
   in 9 patients (43\%); among these dose to cord(dyn) exceeded dose to
   cord(stat) + 1-mm PRV margin in 78\% of the patients (7/9). Cord(dyn)
   did not excurse outside the 1.5-mm or 2-mm PRV cord cord(stat) margin.
   CONCLUSION: Spinal cord motion may contribute to increases in radiation
   dose to the cord from SBRT for spine metastasis. A PRV margin of at
   least 1.5 to 2 mm surrounding the cord should be strongly considered to
   account for inherent spinal cord motion.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global problem with
   personal, social and economic impacts. Approximately 85\% of patients
   infected with HCV cannot achieve virus clearance. Cirrhosis,
   hepatocellular carcinoma and death may develop in patients with chronic
   infection.Until recently, treatments for chronic hepatitis C were
   difficult to use with many side effects, low treatment responses, and
   relapses. Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) prevent HCV replication, and
   thir effectiveness is over 90\%. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the
   achievement of these treatments.
   Methods: Fifty patients who would receive a DAA treatment regimen, i.e.
   sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) +/- ribavirin (RBV) or
   paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir/dasabuvir (PrOD) +/- RBV were included
   in the study. Laboratory values and HCV RNA results of all patients were
   evaluated before, at the 12th week and 24th week of treatment (at the
   36th week for those who received 24 weeks of treatment), and aspartate
   aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio index (APRI), Fibrosis-4
   (FIB-4), model for endstage liver disease (MELD) scores were calculated.
   Results: In 47 of 50 patients included in the study, who sustained viral
   response (SVR-12) could be evaluated at week 12, and HCV RNA was found
   negative in all patients evaluated. None of the patients had any side
   effects requiring discontinuation, and the most common side effect was
   weight gain.There was a significant decrease in AST and alanin
   aminotransferase (ALT) compared to their initial values.The calculated
   FIB-4 and APRI scores of the patients decreased significantly at the end
   of the treatment and in the SVR-12 period.
   Conclusions: DAAs used in the treatment of HCV infection provide a high
   rate of SVR without any significant side effects.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. - The optimal management of locally recurrent prostate cancer
   after curative radiotherapy is still unknown. In this study, we
   evaluated the preliminary results of reirradiation using stereotactic
   body radiotherapy for locally recurrent prostate cancer after initial
   definitive local radiotherapy.
   Materials and methods. - Between April 2016 and February 2019, 11
   patients with recurrent disease at the previously irradiated prostate
   were treated. Local recurrence was detected by radiological with or
   without functional imaging modalities including prostate
   multiparametric/pelvic MRI or positron-emission tomography-computerised
   tomography with (Ga-68)-labelled prostate-specific membrane antigen
   performed after rising prostate specific antigen serum level during
   follow-up. All patients received stereotactic body radiotherapy to the
   recurrent nodule to a total dose of 30 Gy in five fractions. Hyaluronic
   acid spacer was injected between prostate and rectum in seven patients
   to decrease the rectal dose. Acute toxicity was evaluated by using
   Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0, and late
   toxicity was evaluated by using Radiation Therapy Oncology
   Group/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer late
   radiation morbidity scoring schema.
   Results. - At the diagnosis, the median age was 64 years, and the mean
   prostate specific antigen serum concentration was 17.7 ng/mL. The median
   interval time between local recurrence and initial definitive
   radiotherapy was 63 months. Mean prostate specific antigen concentration
   nadir value during follow-up was 0.43 ng/mL. With a median follow up of
   19 months, three patients developed either local or distant relapse. One
   patient had grade 3 acute rectal toxicity, and one patient had grade 2
   late urinary toxicity. We did not observe any acute or late toxicity due
   to hyaluronic acid spacer injection.
   Conclusion. - Reirradiation after local recurrence following initial
   definitive radiotherapy together with hyaluronic acid spacer use seems
   to be effective and safe. (C) 2020 Societe francaise de radiotherapie

Abstract = {{After decades of being neglected, broad tapeworms now attract growing
   attention thanks to the increasing number of reports from humans but
   also thanks to many advancements achieved by application of molecular
   methods in diagnosis and epidemiological studies. Regarding sparganosis,
   unfortunately general uniformity of most species, their high
   intraspecific variability and lack of agreement among researchers has
   led to confusion about the classification of Spirometra/Sparganum
   species. For the first time we determined adult, eggs and plerocercoid
   life cycle stages and the molecular phylogeny of Sparganum proliferum
   obtained from endangered wild felids (Panthera onca, Leopardus pardalis,
   Leopardus guttulus and Herpailurus yagoauroundi) in one of the largest
   continuous remnants of worldwide biodiversity, the Atlantic Forest from
   South America. Our results showed that at least 57\% of total species of
   wild felids in this natural area could act as definitive hosts of
   Sparganum proliferum. We conclude that the availability of more
   morphological characteristics are needed in order to secure reliable
   characterization and diagnosis of sparganosis. The integration of these
   data with molecular analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences will be
   useful for species discrimination.}},

Abstract = {{The functional and pathological implications of the enormous genetic
   diversity of the human genome are mostly unknown, primarily due to our
   unability to predict pathogenicity in a high-throughput manner. In this
   work, we characterized the phenotypic consequences of eight
   naturally-occurring missense variants on the multifunctional and
   disease-associated NQO1 protein using biophysical and structural
   analyses on several protein traits. Mutations found in both
   exome-sequencing initiatives and in cancer cell lines cause mild to
   catastrophic effects on NQO1 stability and function. Importantly, some
   mutations perturb functional features located structurally far from the
   mutated site. These effects are well rationalized by considering the
   nature of the mutation, its location in protein structure and the local
   stability of its environment. Using a set of 22 experimentally
   characterized mutations in NQO1, we generated experimental scores for
   pathogenicity that correlate reasonably well with bioinformatic scores
   derived from a set of commonly used algorithms, although the latter fail
   to semiquantitatively predict the phenotypic alterations caused by a
   significant fraction of mutations individually. These results provide
   insight into the propagation of mutational effects on multifunctional
   proteins, the implementation of in silico approaches for establishing
   genotype-phenotype correlations and the molecular determinants
   underlying loss-of-function in genetic diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Nursing students learn under the responsibility of clinical instructors
   during their related learning experience (RLE). Generally, nursing
   students regard their clinical instructors as pivotal sources of
   foundational knowledge, skills, and values to develop themselves into
   competent and compassionate nurses. It is usual for them to leverage
   their expectations of their clinical instructors. The study aimed to
   uncover and learn from the nursing students' expectations of their
   clinical instructors in terms of inductive codes such as teaching
   strategies, assessment of student learning outcomes, monitoring and
   evaluating learning progress, recognizing student efforts, professional
   mastery, and descriptions of ideal clinical instructors. This
   descriptive qualitative study employed thematic analysis to structured
   interview transcripts from conveniently sampled nursing students in a
   private university in the Philippines. During their RLE, the nursing
   students viewed that i.) clinical instructors utilize various teaching
   strategies; ii.) variety of assessment techniques are used revealing
   innate teacher values and some students' undesirable feelings towards
   their clinical instructors; iii.) limited techniques in monitoring and
   evaluating students' progress are employed; iv.) students have feelings
   of being denied of recognition; v.) teacher-student likeness, and some
   unwanted perceptions on professional mastery are essential; and vi.)
   caring attributes, cognitive, and clinical competence make up the ideal
   clinical instructors. The quality of nursing students is as good as the
   quality of their clinical instructors. Their clinical instructors
   primarily influence their level of confidence during the RLE. Findings
   suggest that clinical instructors need to rethink about their practices
   in ensuring quality instruction and supervision during RLE.}},

   languages}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{The origins of linguistic diversity remain controversial. Studies
   disagree on whether group features such as population size or social
   structure accelerate or decelerate linguistic differentiation. While
   some analyses of between-group factors highlight the role of
   geographical isolation and reduced linguistic exchange in
   differentiation, others suggest that linguistic divergence is driven
   primarily by warfare among neighbouring groups and the use of language
   as marker of group identity. Here we provide the first integrated test
   of the effects of five historical sociodemographic and geographic
   variables on three measures of linguistic diversification among 50
   Austronesian languages: rates of word gain, loss and overall lexical
   turnover. We control for their shared evolutionary histories through a
   time-calibrated phylogenetic sister-pairs approach. Results show that
   languages spoken in larger communities create new words at a faster
   pace. Within-group conflict promotes linguistic differentiation by
   increasing word loss, while warfare hinders linguistic differentiation
   by decreasing both rates of word gain and loss. Finally, we show that
   geographical isolation is a strong driver of lexical evolution mainly
   due to a considerable drift-driven acceleration in rates of word loss.
   We conclude that the motor of extreme linguistic diversity in
   Austronesia may have been the dispersal of populations across relatively
   isolated islands, favouring strong cultural ties amongst societies
   instead of warfare and cultural group marking.}},

Abstract = {{The human intestinal micmbiome plays an important role in health due to
   the large number of beneficial effects related to the bacterial profile
   and the metabolites generated in the intestine. Arabinoxylans are
   compounds present in different cereals such as wheat and they can
   modulate the profile and functioning of some beneficial bacteria from
   human intestinal microbiota. In the present work, a colonic in vitro
   fermentation with human faecal inoculum was done using arabinoxylans
   extracted from Argentinian hard and soft wheat as substrates. Molecular
   size alteration of arabinoxylans were studied during fermentation and
   Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium abundance as well as short chain fatty
   acids concentrations were determined. The arabinoxylans fermentation was
   proved to induce the growth of Bifidobacterium and the release of
   short-chain fatty acids. The speed and efficiency of fermentation were
   different for each of the arabinoxylan extracted from both wheat
   genotypes, perhaps because of differences in their chemical and physical
   structures. The consumption of water-extractable arabinoxylans (WE-AX)
   (either supplemented or enriched) to maintain the balance or modulate in
   a favorable way the profile of Bifidobacterium can be an important
   contribution to the human health.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Continuing the validation process of the five
   psychopathological dimensions that we have considered specific to
   Substance Use Disorders (SUD), we tested the possible correlations
   between them and the severity of alcohol craving, as well as their
   ability to differentiate problematic from non-problematic recreational
   drinkers, all of whom were recruited during a private meeting at the
   Leningrad Cafe, in Pisa, Italy. Methods: To evaluate alcohol craving we
   used the ACS (Alcohol Craving Scale). Problematic use of alcohol was
   investigated by means of AUDIT, and symptoms of psychopathology were
   assessed by using the SCL-90 Self-Report Symptom Inventory. Gender and
   age were recorded for every single case. Results: Alcohol craving was
   positively correlated with the severity of all psychopathological
   dimensions except for Panic Anxiety (PA). Recreational drinkers showed
   significantly lower severity of psychopathological symptoms in
   Worthlessness/Being Trapped (W/BT), Somatic Symptoms (SS),
   Sensitivity/Psychoticism (S/P), and Violence/Suicide (V/S) dimensions.
   No differences were observed with PA symptomatology. Conversely,
   problematic recreational drinkers obtained a statistically higher
   severity regarding W/BT and S/P dimensions and comparable severity in
   the other psychopathological dimensions. Alcohol cravings were more
   severe in problematic recreational drinkers. W/BT and V/S dimensions
   took a more severe form in problematic recreational drinkers and clear
   differentiation between the groups was possible in these cases.
   Psychopathological typologies were not discriminating. Conclusions: The
   psychopathology specific to SUD is correlated with alcohol craving in
   recreational drinkers, and is able to differentiate problematic from
   non-problematic recreational drinkers, so providing further evidence of
   its specificity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the work hardening behavior of a low carbon low
   alloy steel under various ferrite-martensite dual-phase (DP)
   microstructures. For this purpose, several DP microstructures containing
   23-87\% martensite volume fraction (MVF) were developed by application
   of inter-critical annealing heat treatment processes. The Hollomon
   analysis was employed in conjunction with mechanical testing and
   electron microscopy observation to describe the work hardening behavior
   of DP samples. The experimental results indicated that the DP specimens
   containing lower than 36\% MVF were associated with a `single stage' of
   work hardening behavior while those of higher than 36 \% of martensitic
   microconstituents were related to a `double stage' of work hardening
   pattern. With increasing the MVF from 23 to 87 \%, the strain hardening
   exponent for the first stage of work hardening showed a peak value of
   0.111 at MVF = 73 \%, while those for the second stage of strain
   hardening exponents were continuously increased from 0.162 to 0.197.
   This abnormal trend of strain hardening exponents with MVF was
   correlated with the variable hardening responses of ferrite and
   martensite microconstituents.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Following the miniaturization of integrated circuitry and
   other computer hardware over the past several decades, DNA sequencing is
   on a similar path. Leading this trend is the Oxford Nanopore sequencing
   platform, which currently offers the hand-held MinION instrument and
   even smaller instruments on the horizon. This technology has been used
   in several important applications, including the analysis of genomes of
   major pathogens in remote stations around the world. However, despite
   the simplicity of the sequencer, an equally simple and portable analysis
   platform is not yet available. Results. iGenomics is the first
   comprehensive mobile genome analysis application, with capabilities to
   align reads, call variants, and visualize the results entirely on an iOS
   device. Implemented in Objective-C using the FM-index, banded dynamic
   programming, and other high-performance bioinformatics techniques,
   iGenomics is optimized to run in a mobile environment. We benchmark
   iGenomics using a variety of real and simulated Nanopore sequencing
   datasets of viral and bacterial genomes and show that iGenomics has
   performance comparable to the popular BWA-MEM/SAMtools/IGV suite,
   without necessitating a laptop or server cluster. Conclusions. iGenomics
   is available open source (https://github.com/stuckinaboot/iGenomics) and
   for free on Apple's App Store (https://apple.co/2HCplzr).}},

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals still have to meet
   external regulations while delivering compassionate patient care. This
   reflections article provides a solution for certified stroke programs to
   continue to meet stroke certification requirements. One area of focus,
   in this article, is stroke education. Because of ``shelter-in-place
   orders,{''} there were no visitors permitted at the bedside, yet we know
   that high-quality poststroke education is important to improve outcomes.
   The purpose of this reflections article is to share what has worked at
   my institution. INNOVATIONS: We found that calling family members to
   engage them in stroke education was a great option. They seemed engaged,
   took notes, and asked questions. Nurses document details from these
   phone encounters in the patient's medical record. Many people placed the
   call on speaker so other family members could listen to the education
   session. While family members were at home, telehealth nursing has its
   own set of challenges. Although telehealth is not a perfect solution, it
   was one we found most reasonable and found it to work well through this
   unprecedented time. SUMMARY: These strategies are being shared to
   promote dissemination of innovative nursing interventions that will help
   to continue providing loved ones with the information and education they
   deserve to receive even during the COVID-19 pandemic.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Several strategies are used in the management of
   delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), but there is not always evidence
   to justify its use. Photobiomodulation (PBM) is a noninvasive means,
   with promising previous results of its use in this outcome.
   Objective: This study aimed to identify the effects of PBM in the
   femoral quadriceps region to reduce DOMS in men undergoing a fatigue
   protocol.
   Methods: This is a double-blind, randomized controlled study. The sample
   consisted of 35 physically active men. The volunteers were divided into
   two groups: pre-fatigue PBM {[}Group 1 (G1)] and post-fatigue PMB
   {[}Group 2 (G2)]. The fatigue test was conducted at the same time of
   day. Given this was a crossover study of volunteers, we used at least a
   1-week washout to avoid any residual interference from the previous
   intervention. PBM (active/placebo) was performed 5 min before the start
   of the fatigue protocol in G1 and immediately after the fatigue protocol
   in G2. PBM was applied at six points on the femoral quadriceps muscle
   (cluster laser/light emitting diodes 13, 415 mW, 30.2 J per point, 73
   sec per application, and total dose of 181.2 J). In the data analysis,
   the primary endpoint was DOMS measured using a Numerical Pain Scale, and
   the secondary outcome was examined on the effects of PMB muscle damage,
   muscle contraction, and isometric horizontal jump.
   Results: There were significant differences to PBM compared with the
   placebo group for DOMS, with no differences between the times of
   application. For muscle damage, there was significant difference (p >
   0.05) when PBM was applied in pre-fatigue. G1 led to an increase of
   14.9\% in the creatine kinase level when active since the application of
   placebo PBM increased by 65\% (p = 0.04).
   Conclusions: The PBM applied before eccentric fatigue protocol showed no
   significant results on DOMS, although there was a positive effect to
   control muscle damage. Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials

Abstract = {{Introduction/Background: Healthcare programs have proven the benefits of
   standardized patients in educational activities, but limited scholarship
   exists on the involvement of cancer survivors in radiation therapy
   education. This innovative approach to simulation-based education in
   radiation therapy is the first to integrate cancer survivors as
   standardized patients in a high-fidelity environment. This research aims
   to examine the impact of cancer survivors on the students' learning
   during their simulation course.
   Methods: This qualitative research used a phenomenological approach to
   gather data and analyze the students' view of their interactions with
   cancer survivors in the simulation course. The researchers conducted
   three focus group discussions with five of the eight radiation therapy
   students using a set of preformulated questions.
   Results: The collected data were comparatively analyzed, and the
   research team identified four main themes: experience,
   teaching/coaching, patient-centeredness and gratitude. These represented
   the students' perspective on their experiences and the unique learning
   opportunities provided by the cancer survivors. Findings/Discussion: The
   simulation activities with the cancer survivors provided a safe and
   realistic experience for the students. This research highlighted the
   influence of the cancer survivors' oncology journey on the skills
   development of the radiation therapy students.
   Conclusion: The students benefited from the authentic patient
   perspective of the cancer survivors which helped build their confidence
   and develop their skills prior to clinical placement. This research
   demonstrated that incorporating cancer survivors as standardized
   patients in radiation therapy simulation education has added significant
   value to the students' learning.}},

   of 1,548 patients from a tertiary cancer centre}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RADIOTHERAPY IN PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine the frequency, factors and reasons of patient
   non-adherence to radiotherapy (RT) in a tertiary cancer centre.
   Background: Inadvertent treatment interruptions often lead to
   prolongation of planned treatment time. In the case of RT with a
   curative intent, prolongation of planned treatment has been associated
   with inferior clinical outcomes. Delay or prolongation of treatment is
   associated with a relative risk of local recurrence by up to 2\% per day
   for specific malignancies. Thus, it is critical to understand key
   factors that influence non-adherence to RT.
   Methods and Materials: A retrospective observation audit was conducted
   comprising patients treated with radical, adjuvant or palliative RT at
   our centre from January 2018 to December 2018. Non-adherence was defined
   as premature permanent termination of planned treatment by the patient
   without recommendation or consultation from the treating clinician. All
   data were collected and analysed (retrospectively) with the help of
   Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.
   Results: A total of 1,548 patients were included in the study of which
   105 (6.7\%) were non-adherent to planned RT. Of the total 105 patients,
   44 (42\%) were elderly (60 years and above). Treatment non-adherence was
   predominant in males (male:female = 1.85:1). More than 90\% of
   non-adherent patients had stage III and IV cancer. A total of 77
   patients (74\%) out of 105 were more than 50 km away from our centre. A
   total of 66 (63\%) out of 105 patients had completed more than 2 weeks
   of radiation (40\% of planned RT) and then defaulted for radiation due
   to acute toxicities.
   Conclusion: Treatment adherence is a major factor in determining
   successful outcomes among cancer patients treated with RT. This study
   reveals several factors that contribute to non-adherence to treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Accumulating evidence suggests that chemokines may play an important
   role in the formation and mediating of the immune microenvironment of
   hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The purpose of this meta-analysis was to
   explore the differences in blood or tissues chemokines concentrations
   between HCC patients and controls. Online databases, namely PubMed, Web
   of Science, Embase and Cochrane Library, were systematically searched
   for relevant articles published on or before 15 January 2020.
   Standardized mean differences (SMDs) with corresponding 95\% confidence
   intervals of the chemokines concentrations were calculated as group
   differences between the HCC patients and the controls. Sixty-five
   studies met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. Altogether
   they consisted of 26 different chemokines compared between 5828 HCC
   patients and 4909 controls; and 12 different chemokines receptors
   compared between 2053 patients and 2285 controls. The results of
   meta-analysis indicated that concentrations of CCL20, CXCL8 and CXCR4 in
   the HCC patients were significantly higher than those in the controls
   (SMD of 6.18, 1.81 and 1.04, respectively). Therefore, higher
   concentration levels of CCL20, CXCL8 and CXCR4 may indicate the
   occurrence of HCC Future research should explore the putative mechanisms
   underlying this linkage. Meanwhile, attempts can be made to replicate
   the existing findings in prospective cohort populations and explore the
   cause-and-effect relationships pertaining to this linkage in order to
   develop new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for HCC.}},

Abstract = {{Large amounts of refractory organic matter are present in mature
   leachate after treatment with a semi-aerobic aged refuse biofilter
   (SAARB). This study applied a sequential ozonation and Fenton process to
   the treatment of the refractory organic matter in SAARB leachate. The
   effects of the operating parameters of the ozonation and Fenton
   processes were investigated. Under an O-3 flow-rate of 43.68 mg/L,
   initial pH of 9, and reaction time of 30 min, the ozonation process
   achieved 66.16\% removal of absorbance at a wavelength of 254 nm (UV254)
   and 91.39\% color number (CN) removal, and a three-dimensional
   excitation and emission matrix (3D-EEM) analysis indicated that the
   ozonation process could effectively degrade refractory humic substances
   in SAARB leachate. The removal efficiencies of fulvic-like substances in
   the ultraviolet and visible light regions were 79.12\% and 70.32\%. The
   total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiency in the ozonation process
   was only 5.88\%, and small amounts of organic acids were accumulated
   after ozonation. The Fenton process was therefore applied after
   ozonation to achieve a better treatment efficiency of the SAARB
   leachate. The UV254 and CN removal efficiencies increased to 78.38\% and
   99.71\% under conditions with an initial pH of 3, hydrogen peroxide
   (H2O2) dosage of 10 mL/L, Fe2+ dosage of 11 mmol/L, and reaction time of
   120 min. The removal efficiencies of fulvic-like substances in the
   ultraviolet and visible light regions were 87.38\% and 81.16\%. Some
   refractory organic matter was degraded and transformed into
   tyrosine-like and tryptophan-like substances. In addition, the
   sequential ozonation and Fenton process exhibited a better
   mineralization capacity (TOC removal of 33.76\%). In conclusion, the
   sequential ozonation and Fenton process could effectively degrade
   refractory organic matter in SAARB leachate and resulted in a strong
   mineralization of organic matter.}},

Title = {{Emerging paradigm against global antimicrobial resistance via
   bioprospecting of mushroom into novel nanotherapeutics development}},
Journal = {{TRENDS IN FOOD SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Background: Globally, mushroom constitutes one of the major resources
   for nutraceuticals, which can be used as an effective weapon against
   malnutrition and various diseases and disorders. Most countries use this
   indigenous food as a nutraceutical or its isolated compounds as drug
   molecules. Such alternative drugs have to date been lacking in quality
   specifications and standards for proper use and supply.
   Scope and approach: This paper implies on a comprehensive understanding
   of mushroom-based nutraceuticals to treat global antimicrobial
   resistance (AMR). The 21st century marks the juncture of a
   ``post-antibiotic era{''} and pre-nanotherapeutics era where only
   limited options are available for the control of antibiotic-resistant
   microbial strains. We discuss here the detailed mechanisms of
   antimicrobial potentials of mushroom.
   Key findings and conclusion: The major findings suggested in this paper
   refers to antibiotic resistance. Predictions by the European Union (EU)
   estimate 10 million deaths a year by 2050 correlated to this effect.
   Therefore, the motivation to develop potential alternative treatment
   methods for serious pandemic infections is rising. This, in turn,
   inspired the development of novel mycopharmaceuticals with minimal side
   effects based on fungi and mushroom bioprospection. Additionally, this
   novel field of research discovers food with more nutritional value.
   Thus, concluding the manuscript with the healing and nutritive benefits
   of mushroom, which have further contributed a great deal in developing
   these compounds as alternative pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals in the
   healthcare system. The giant strides made by analytical and synthetic
   chemistry and science in general, have immensely contributed to the
   development of the interdisciplinary science or biomedicine that has
   achieved phenomenal success in clinical practice.}},

Title = {{Decadal behaviors of tropical storm tracks in the North West Pacific
   Ocean}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{246}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Quantitative analysis on the shape of 959 tropical storm (TS) tracks in
   the North West Pacific (NWP) basin was carried out over the period from
   1977 to 2016 by using International Best Track Archive for Climate
   Stewardship (IBTrACS) provided by National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration (NOAA) based on an established track sinuosity metric.
   Track sinuosity is a measure of deviation of a storm track from its
   straight-line path between the cyclogenesis and cyclolysis locations.
   More sinuosity in the storms' tracks makes it rather challenging for the
   atmospheric models to accurately assess the storms' respective locations
   on the map and potentially causes higher damages due to lack of precise
   information about their movement. Statistical analysis was carried out
   on spatial and temporal trends (monthly to decadal) of the TS track
   shape and the obtained results were mapped based on sinuosity categories
   within a GIS environment. The sinuosity distribution results are
   normalized using a cube-root transformation function to reduce skewness
   and obtain sinuosity index (SI). Distinct enhancement of TS sinuosity
   was noticed from the months July to October (JASO). It is also detected
   that early months of TS season like June-August have dominance of more
   predictable straighter storm tracks over sinuous kind of tracks, and
   vice-versa in the case of late months of season like September-October.
   It is also evident that there is a one-to three-year cyclic pattern of
   changing sinuosity over the NWP basin. The 1987-1996 decade had the
   maximum dominance of sinuous tracks in comparison to the other three
   decades. Significant longitudinal eastward shift (from 110 degrees-140
   degrees E to 130 degrees-160 degrees E) in majority of cyclogenesis
   locations is observed as sinuosity in storm track increases from
   straight to sinuous patterns. Similar shift for latitudinal track was
   not found. Finally, we investigate the sinuosity based on the warm/cold
   phase of the ENSO. Warm phase of ENSO is found to be associated with a
   greater number of TS with higher SI values in the NWP basin. These TS
   during warm phase mostly originate in the eastern part of the basin
   where a vast open area of warm sea surface temperature encourages their
   formation and intensification. Lastly, the study found a moderate
   positive relationship between SI and TS' longevity and distance
   coverage, which are crucial information for disaster risk assessment,
   mitigation and preparedness.}},

   composition, a plate of tubular ortstein with a diameter of 1.2 cm
   selected from the Cg horizon has been made. It has been established that
   ortsteins in the profile-differentiated soils have been formed as a
   result of alternation of redox conditions and gley-eluvial, segregation
   processes of soil formation. The small ortsteins in the overiluvial part
   of the profile are the result of modern soil formation, and the large
   ones within the transition to the rock horizon are relict and connected

Title = {{Are insurance and self-insurance substitutes? An experimental approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR \& ORGANIZATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{180}},
Pages = {{797-811}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Our theory-driven laboratory experiment tests a broadened Ehrlich and
   Becker substitutability property between insurance and self-insurance.
   The data show that an increase in insurance prices does lead to a
   substitution effect between insurance and self-insurance. Disentangling
   the two components of the coverage (whether and how much to invest)
   suggests that the substitution effect is multilayered: a rise in the
   unit price is likely to crowd the subjects out of the insurance market
   while fostering the likelihood of investing in selfinsurance. Also, the
   demand for insurance of those who remain in the market decreases,
   whereas their demand for self-insurance increases. However, the
   substitutability effect is mitigated by insufficient sensitivity of the
   subjects to the price. Therefore, a price subsidy policy is far from
   being as damaging to self-insurance as theory suggests. Conversely, a
   high-priced insurance policy does not encourage investment in loss
   reduction activities as much as it should. Policy issues notably for
   public health as well as for insurers' policy are discussed as this
   research suggests possible ways of steering the pricing policy for
   insurance. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Critical Shear Rate of Polymer-Enhanced Hydraulic Fluids}},
Journal = {{LUBRICANTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Many application-relevant fluids exhibit shear thinning, where viscosity
   decreases with shear rate above some critical shear rate. For hydraulic
   fluids formulated with polymeric additives, the critical shear rate is a
   function of the molecular weight and concentration of the polymers. Here
   we present a model for predicting the critical shear rate and Newtonian
   viscosity of fluids, with the goal of identifying a fluid that shear
   thins in a specific range relevant to hydraulic pumps. The model is
   applied to predict the properties of fluids comprising polyisobutene
   polymer and polyalphaolefin base oil. The theoretical predictions are
   validated by comparison to viscosities obtained from experimental
   measurements and molecular dynamics simulations across many decades of
   shear rates. Results demonstrate that the molecular weight of the
   polymer plays a key role in determining the critical shear rate, whereas
   the concentration of polymer primarily affects the Newtonian viscosity.
   The simulations are further used to show the molecular origins of shear
   thinning and critical shear rate. The atomistic simulations and simple
   model developed in this work can ultimately be used to formulate
   polymer-enhanced fluids with ideal shear thinning profiles that maximize
   the efficiency of hydraulic systems.}},

Abstract = {{Solid phase micro extraction-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry
   (SPME-GC/MS) analysis was performed in exhaled breath samples of 48
   healthy volunteers: 20 non-smokers, 10 smokers and 18 e-cigarette (EC,
   vape) users. Each volunteer provided 1 L of exhaled breath in a
   pre-cleaned Tedlar bag, in which an SPME fiber was exposed to absorb the
   emitted breath volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The acquired data were
   processed using multivariate data analysis (MDA) methods in order to
   identify the characteristic chemicals of the three groups. The results
   revealed that the breath of non-smokers demonstrated inverse correlation
   with a variety of molecules related to the breath from smokers including
   furan, toluene, 2-butanone and other organic substances. Vapers were
   distinguished from smokers by the chemical speciation of the e-liquids,
   such as that of esters (e.g. ethyl acetate), terpenes (e.g.
   alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, d-limonene, p-cymene, etc.) and oxygenated
   compounds (e.g. 3hexen-1-ol, benzaldehyde, hexanal, decanal, etc). Two
   classification models were developed (a) using principal component
   analysis (PCA) with hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and (b) using
   partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Both models were
   validated using 8 new samples (4 vapers and 4 smokers), collected in
   addition to the 48 samples of the calibration set. The combination of
   GC/MS breath analysis and MDA contributed successfully in classifying
   the volunteers into their respective groups and highlighted the relevant
   characteristic VOCs. The respective dynamic combination (SPME-GC/MS and
   MDA) provides a means for long term non-invasive monitoring of the
   population's health status for early detection purposes.}},

Abstract = {{In present study, fungi isolated from metal rich site were explored for
   metal tolerance capacity and potential of multifarious synthesis of
   metal nanoparticles (NPs). Total 9 different fungi were isolated from
   rhizospeheric soils and molecularly characterized. Penicillium
   janthinellum DJP06 showed maximum metal tolerance capacity and
   synthesized gold and silver NPs. Detailed characterization confirmed the
   synthesis of protein capped, crystalline natured, spherical shaped gold
   and silver NPs. Mechanistic studies suggested involvement of fungal
   secretome proteins in the NPs synthesis. To find out the active
   protein(s) responsible for multifarious synthesis of NPs, the dialyzed
   proteins were fractionated by chromatography technique. Individual
   protein fractions were separately checked for their ability to
   synthesize NPs. Results suggested involvement of multiple proteins in an
   interactive manner for NPs synthesis. Testing the ability of these
   proteins for multifarious synthesis of other commercially important NPs
   will be an exciting future possibility.}},

Abstract = {{Few studies have compared the three suicidality groups-suicidal ideators
   (SIs), single suicide attempters (SSAs), and multiple suicide attempters
   (MSAs)-in relation to the suicidal process. This cross-sectional study
   investi-gated trends and differences in suicide risk factors across
   suicidality groups. Using the baseline data of the Korean Cohort for the
   Model Predicting a Suicide and Suicide-related Behavior, we analyzed
   trends (Jonckheere-Terpstra or Mantel-Haenszel chi(2) test) and
   differences (analysis of covariance or logistic regression) in
   sociodemographic and clinical factors, psychiatric diagnoses, as well as
   clinical rating scores on psychopathology (suicidal ideation, depressive
   symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and problem drinking), trait impulsiveness,
   and stress across suicidality groups. Across suicidality groups
   comprising 193 SIs, 207 SSAs, and 376 MSAs, we observed a decreasing
   trend in age and increasing trends in history of early trauma, familial
   histories of suicide attempts and suicide, most diagnoses and
   psychopathologies (suicidal ideation, anxiety symptoms, and problem
   drinking), trait impulsiveness, and stress-with MSAs more likely to have
   histories of early trauma and familial suicide, almost uniformly higher
   proportions of diagnoses, and higher psychopathology rating scores.
   Overall, increasing trends in suicide risk factors were found across all
   suicidality groups. Notably, MSAs presented greater proportions of most
   psychiatric diagnoses and higher degrees of most psychopathologies,
   motor impulsiveness, and stress, indicating they were at more severe
   clinical states and were closer to suicide. Mental health professionals
   should ascertain the number of suicide attempts to identify MSAs,
   implement more thorough evaluations, and employ additional measures for
   reducing motor impulsiveness.}},

Abstract = {{We invented a wearable device that can measure voiding time and
   frequency by checking a habitual series of characteristic motions among
   men. This study collected and analyzed urination time data collected
   smart bands worn by patients to resolve the clinical issues posed by
   using voiding charts. By developing a smart band-based algorithm for
   assessing urination time in patients, this study aimed to explore the
   feasibility of urination management systems. This study aimed to assess
   urination time based on a patient's posture and changes in posture.
   Motion data were obtained from a smart band on the arm. An algorithm
   that identifies the three stages of urination (forward movement,
   urination, backward movement) was developed based on data collected from
   a 3-axis accelerometer and tilt angle data. Therefore, we analyze hidden
   Markov model (HMM)-based sequential data to determine urination time.
   Real-time data were acquired from the smart band. For data corresponding
   to a specific duration, the value of the signals was calculated and then
   compared with the set analysis model to calculate the time of urination.
   The final accuracy of the algorithm was calculated based on clinical
   guidelines for urologists. The experiment showed a high average accuracy
   of 92.5\%, proving the robustness of the proposed algorithm. The
   proposed urination time recognition technology draws on acceleration
   data and tilt angle data collected via a smart band; these data were
   then analyzed using a classifier after applying the HMM method.}},

Abstract = {{As the world is facing an infectious disease pandemic caused by
   coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), medical institutions are
   experiencing significant financial losses. we attempted to estimate such
   financial losses through a survey of clinics that reported temporary
   closure due to COVID-19 to the Korean Medical Association. As a result,
   the data of 56 clinics were obtained. The average closure period was 6.7
   days, and the overall number of related health insurance claims and loss
   of sales reached 13,408,000 Korean won (KRW) and 20,911,000 KRW,
   respectively, while daily losses reached 1,343,000 and 2,202,000 KRW,
   respectively. In addition, the monthly average health insurance claims
   and sales were compared to those of the same month of the previous year.
   In January, they slightly increased by 4.4\% and 7.8\%, respectively,
   whereas in February, they slightly decreased by 10.2\% and 12.4\%,
   respectively. In March, they significantly decreased by 46.8\% and
   49.8\%, respectively, as COVID-19 was at its peak. Considering the
   financial losses of clinics that played a pivotal role in quarantine at
   the forefront of infectious diseases, the government should prepare a
   reasonable compensation plan for such losses.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Increased dietary fructose consumption is closely associated
   with lipid and glucose metabolic disorders. Sasa quelpaertensis Nakai
   possesses various health-promoting properties, but there has been no
   research on its protective effect against fructose-induced metabolic
   dysfunction. In this study, we investigated the effects of S.
   quelpaertensis leaf extract (SQE) on metabolic dysfunction in
   high-fructose-diet-fed rats. Methods: Animals were fed a 46\%
   carbohydrate diet, a 60\% high-fructose diet, or a 60\% high-fructose
   diet with SQE (500 mg/kg of body weight (BW)/day) in drinking water for
   16 weeks. Serum biochemical parameters were measured and the effects of
   SQE on hepatic histology, protein expression, and transcriptome profiles
   were investigated. Results: SQE improved dyslipidemia and insulin
   resistance induced in high-fructose-diet-fed rats. SQE ameliorated the
   lipid accumulation and inflammatory response in liver tissues by
   modulating the expressions of key proteins related to lipid metabolism
   and antioxidant response. SQE significantly enriched the genes related
   to the metabolic pathway, namely, the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
   signaling pathway and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Conclusions: SQE
   could effectively prevent dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic
   lipid accumulation by regulation of metabolism-related gene expressions,
   suggesting its role as a functional ingredient to prevent
   lifestyle-related metabolic disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Gray leaf spot (GLS) disease, caused by the Stemphylium (Sm) fungus,
   affects a wide range of horticultural crops including tomato. In this
   study, the South Korean Sm isolate (PNU-SM01) was identified, and the
   applicability of Sm-resistance gene (Sm)-linked DNA markers in
   marker-assisted selection was validated. ITS/gpd sequencing and
   morphological observation identified the isolate as S. lycopersici. A
   GLS disease assay was conducted on 80 tomato varieties, including
   commercial F-1 hybrids and elite inbred lines. The reference line
   `Motelle' was highly resistant (R, DSI = 4.0), whereas the `Moneymaker'
   line was susceptible (S) and showed severe disease symptoms (DSI =
   79.3). Among 30 commercial F-1 hybrids, five were scored as S by DSI;
   whereas the rest, including all 17 hybrids claimed as Sm-resistant by
   the supplier, were R or moderately resistant (MR). Among 48 inbred
   lines, four were scored as S and 44, including five Lycopersicon
   accessions reported as R, were R or MR. Three known Sm-linked DNA
   markers (CT55, D5, and Sm-InDel) were genotyped in all 80 cultivars; the
   highest match (92.5\%) to the GLS disease assay was observed for
   Sm-InDel. We converted the recessive marker CT55 into a codominant
   marker (CT55-Co) and developed dCAPS (Sm-SNP) and KASP (Sm-KASP) markers
   from a previously identified Sm-linked SNP. Sm-SNP and Sm-KASP showed a
   similar level of phenotype to marker genotype association as Sm-InDel,
   whereas CT55-Co displayed a high level of mismatch. To screen for the
   source of Sm resistance, 138 tomato accessions were genotyped with
   Sm-InDel and Sm-SNP: 15 were homozygous for the resistance allele of
   both markers. In this study, resistance to the Korean isolate of S.
   lycopersici in commercial F-1 hybrids and breeding sources was
   characterized to reveal which DNA markers can be effectively applied for
   marker-assisted selection of Sm-resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study aims to investigate the effect of
   gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) on the growth hormone
   (GH)-insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) axis and to evaluate whether
   -202 A/C IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) promoter polymorphism affects
   growth velocity in females with central precocious puberty (CPP) during
   treatment.
   Methods: Data was collected from 97 females younger than 9 years,
   diagnosed with precocious puberty and treated with GnRHa for at least 1
   year at Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital from 2014 to 2015. Their body
   height, weight, change in height standard deviation score (Delta SDS),
   serum IGF-1, serum IGFBP-3, bone age, and -202 A/C IGFBP-3 promoter
   polymorphism were measured before and after GnRHa treatment. The
   interrelationships between the variables were calculated.
   Results: During treatment, height SDS, IGF-1 SDS, IGFBP-3 SDS, and
   IGF-1/IGFBP-3 ratio significantly decreased. A significant correlation
   was observed between Delta IGF-1 SDS and Delta height SDS (r=0.405,
   P<0.001). The presence of the C allele was significantly correlated with
   IGF-1 SDS after treatment (P=0.049) and with IGFBP-3 SDS before and
   after treatment (P= 0.012 and P=0.001), but not with Delta IGF-1 SDS,
   Delta IGFBP-3 SDS, Delta IGF-1/IGFBP-3 ratio, or Delta height SDS.
   Conclusion: Growth velocity during GnRHa treatment is related to Delta
   IGF-1 SDS, indicating the apparent impact of GnRHa on the GH-IGF-1 axis.
   The -202 A/C IGFBP-3 promoter polymorphism does not affect the growth
   velocity of GnRHa in CPP girls.}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between dietary
   pattern and genetic risk score (GRS) for dyslipidemia risk among Korean
   adults. Hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia defined as total
   cholesterol >= 240 mg/dL and triglyceride >= 200 mg/dL or use
   dyslipidemia medication. The GRS was calculated by summing the risk
   alleles of the selected seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms related to
   dyslipidemia. Dietary patterns were identified by principal component
   analysis based on the frequency of 36 food groups, ``whole grain and
   soybean products{''} pattern, ``meat, fish and vegetables{''} pattern,
   and ``bread and noodle{''} pattern were identified. Hazard ratios (HRs)
   and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using the
   multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model. High intake of a
   ``whole grain and soybean products{''} pattern decreased risks of
   hypercholesterolemia (HR: 0.82, 95\% CI: 0.72-0.93, p for trend =
   0.0006) and hypertriglyceridemia (HR: 0.85, 95\% CI: 0.75-0.97, p for
   trend = 0.0344). In the highest tertile of GRS, the ``whole grain and
   soybean products{''} pattern was inversely related to
   hypercholesterolemia risk. Therefore, for people with genotypes that can
   cause hypercholesterolemia, eating whole grains and soybean products may
   have a meaningful response, these results could be utilized for
   genome-based nutrition management.}},

   analyzing the Korea Emergency Department-Based Injury In-depth

   patients into four age groups: group 1 (0-4 years), group 2 (5-9 years),
   group 3 (10-14 years), and group 4 (15-19 years). The most common mode
   of injury in younger age groups 1 and 2 was a fall or slip. Most
   injuries in older age groups 3 and 4 were unintentional and intentional
   collisions combined. Traumatic brain injuries (2.1\%), intensive care
   unit admissions (1.8\%), and overall death (0.4\%) were the highest in
   group 4. The proportions of severe and critical injury (EMR-ISS >= 25)

Abstract = {{In this study, we coupled a computation fluid dynamics (CFD) model to
   the local data assimilation and prediction system (LDAPS), a current
   operational numerical weather prediction model of the Korea
   Meteorological Administration. We investigated the characteristics of
   fine particulate matter (PM2.5) distributions in a building-congested
   district. To analyze the effects of road emission on the PM2.5
   concentrations, we calculated road emissions based on the monthly,
   daily, and hourly emission factors and the total amount of PM2.5
   emissions established from the Clean Air Policy Support System (CAPSS)
   of the Ministry of Environment. We validated the simulated PM2.5
   concentrations against those measured at the PKNU-AQ Sensor stations. In
   the cases of no road emission, the LDAPS-CFD model underestimated the
   PM2.5 concentrations measured at the PKNU-AQ Sensor stations. The
   LDAPS-CFD model improved the PM2.5 concentration predictions by
   considering road emission. At 07 and 19 LST on 22 June 2020, the
   southerly wind was dominant at the target area. The PM2.5 distribution
   at 07 LST were similar to that at 19 LST. The simulated PM2.5
   concentrations were significantly affected by the road emissions at the
   roadside but not significantly at the building roof. In the
   road-emission case, the PM2.5 concentration was high at the north (wind
   speeds were weak) and west roads (a long street canyon). The PM2.5
   concentration was low in the east road where the building density was
   relatively low.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new intuitive metric for evaluating the tension between two
   experiments, and apply it to several data sets. While our metric is
   non-optimal, if evidence of tension is detected, this evidence is robust
   and easy to interpret. Assuming a flat Lambda cold dark matter (Lambda
   CDM) cosmological model, we find that there is a modest 2.2 sigma
   tension between the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 1 results and the
   Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background. This tension is
   driven by the difference between the amount of structure observed in the
   late-time Universe and that predicted from fitting the Planck data, and
   appears to be unrelated to the tension between Planck and local
   estimates of the Hubble rate. In particular, combining DES, baryon
   acoustic oscillations, big bang nucleosynthesis, and supernovae
   measurements recover a Hubble constant and sound horizon consistent with
   Planck, and in tension with local distance-ladder measurements. If the
   tension between these various data sets persists, it is likely that
   reconciling all current data will require breaking the flat Lambda CDM
   model in at least two different ways: one involving new physics in the
   early Universe, and one involving new late-time Universe physics.}},

Abstract = {{In this research article, authors Hillary Parkhouse, Virginia Massaro,
   Melissa Cuba, and Carolyn Waters examine teachers' perceptions of their
   responsibilities to support undocumented students and the barriers they
   encounter in fulfilling them. Since the 1982 Plyler v. Doe decision
   guaranteed public K-12 education to undocumented students, there has
   been little policy guidance on how schools can support these students,
   particularly within the increasingly contentious political climate.
   Focusing on one new destination area in Virginia, the authors
   interviewed eighteen teachers who expressed their support for
   undocumented students. Of various subjects, grade levels, and years'
   experience, these teachers represent a critical case in that they were
   likely to be more attentive to the experiences of these students than
   would the general teacher population. They took a variety of actions to
   enhance students' feelings of security and normalcy through curricular
   decisions, emotional and material support, and adaptive advocacy at the
   school and district levels. However, the lack of clear policy led to
   varied interpretations of their responsibilities and a fear that their
   actions violated school or district guidelines.}},

Abstract = {{Haptenation of model nucleophiles, representing the key MIE in skin
   sensitisation, is routinely measured in chemico to provide data for skin
   allergy risk assessment. Better understanding of the dynamics of
   haptenation in human skin could provide the metrics required to improve
   determination of sensitiser potency for risk assessment of chemicals. We
   have previously demonstrated the applicability and sensitivity of the
   dual stable isotope labelling approach to detect low level haptenation
   in complex mixtures of proteins. In the present study, we investigated
   haptenation in a relevant living cell model over time at a subtoxic
   concentration. DNCB, an extremely potent sensitiser, caused minimal
   changes in overall protein differential expression in HaCaT cells and
   haptenated approximately 0.25 \% of all available nucleophiles when
   applied at a subtoxic concentration (10 mu M) for 4 h. The data shows
   that the maximum level of haptenation occurs at 2 h and that DNCB,
   whilst being a promiscuous hapten, shows a preference for Cys residues,
   despite the considerably higher concentration of amine-based
   nucleophiles. Although a proportion of highly abundant proteins were
   haptenated, numerous haptenated sites were also detected on low abundant
   proteins. Certain proteins were modified at residues buried deep inside
   the protein structure which are less accessible to haptenation compared
   with surface exposed nucleophiles. The microenvironment of the buried
   residues may be a result of several factors influencing the reactivity
   of both the target nucleophile and the hapten.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the nutritional status and
   clinical outcomes of elderly malnourished cancer patients receiving oral
   or enteral nutrition with various protein content. Methods: This
   retrospective study included 19 cancer patients receiving the
   beta-hydroxy-beta-methyl butyrate (HMB) + glutamine (GLN) + arginine
   (ARG) (1st group) combination, 48 receiving only GLN content (2nd group)
   and 19 receiving standard enteral supplementation (3rd group). The
   nutritional status of the patients was analyzed by nutritional risk
   screening (NRS-2002). Anthropometric measurement was taken and the
   biochemical parameters were analyzed. All measurements were recorded
   twice, before and after nutrition therapy. Results: The hospital
   mortality rate was 7\% (n=6) among all patients, and our two-year
   follow-up mortality rate was 36\% (n=31). We observed no differences
   between the groups in the length of hospital stay, nutrition therapy
   duration and mortality (p>0.05). The mean NRS-2002 score was found to be
   statistically significantly different between the control and glutamine
   groups after nutrition therapy with lower scores in the glutamine group
   (p=0.001). Post-nutrition serum albumin levels were also higher in the
   glutamine group than in the control group (p=0.001). Conclusion: We
   observed that patients who received standard enteral nutrition had
   higher NRS-2002 scores and lower serum albumin levels compared to
   patients who receiving only GLN or HMB combination. We were unable to
   find a factor that could be a good predictor of survival. Other randomly
   controlled studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of HMB or
   only GLN use in cancer patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Paediatric scoliosis is a common condition seen by general
   practitioners. Structural scoliosis is characterised by axial rotation
   at the apex. Several new operative treatments have recently been
   developed.
   Objective
   The aim of this article is to give an overview of scoliosis diagnosis,
   assessment and management.
   Discussion
   Scoliosis assessment should identify structural curves, underlying
   causes, severity and growth potential. Atypical curves and red flags
   must be excluded. Observation is appropriate for curves <20 degrees in
   patients with high growth potential (Risser 0-2) and curves <40 degrees
   in patients with minimal growth potential (Risser 3-5). Bracing is
   appropriate for patients with a curve of 20-40 degrees with high growth
   potential. Indications for surgery vary depending on patient and curve
   factors; however, surgery can be indicated when the curve is >40
   degrees. Surgery can be divided into three groups: growth modulation,
   instrumentation without fusion and instrumentation with fusion. Early
   diagnosis and referral to a paediatric spine service can improve
   outcomes.}},

   Using Digital Up-Conversion}},

Abstract = {{Analog distortion compensation based on digital signal processing
   methods are widely applied for transmitter or receiver impairments in
   various digital communication systems. Recently, several neural network
   methods were developed for distortion compensation. However, while
   digital communication systems are typically complex-valued, neural
   networks are mostly designed to work with real-valued inputs. Thus,
   adaptations of the network architecture or input data should be applied.
   In this article a method for using a single-input real-valued neural
   network for digital communication-based complex-valued signals without
   any modifications to the neural network is proposed. The method
   transforms the complex-valued signal to a real-valued one by taking the
   real component of a complex frequency offset applied through digital
   up-conversion, without affecting the distortion, therefore allowing
   standard neural network-based functionality with significant reduction
   in size. The method is tested with a multi-layer perceptron and gated
   recurrent unit architectures applied over a generic Wiener-Hammerstein
   model for the case of equalization of a coherent optical system. A
   reduction of about 7\% and 26\% in network size is shown for the gated
   recurrent unit-based and multi-layer perceptron-based architectures
   respectively, without any significant change in performance. This size
   reduction capability shows the high potential in applying the proposed
   method in neural network-based equalization and pre-distortion
   operations.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple groups have described strategies for clinical implementation of
   pharmacogenetics (PGx) that often include internal laboratory tests that
   are specifically developed for their implementation needs. However, many
   institutions are not able to follow this practice and instead must
   utilize external laboratories to obtain PGx testing results. As each
   external laboratory might have different ordering and reporting
   workflows, consistent reporting and storing of PGx results within the
   medical record can be a challenge. This might result in patient safety
   concerns as important PGx information might not be easily identifiable
   at the point of current or future prescribing. Herein, we describe
   initial PGx clinical implementation efforts at a large academic medical
   center, focusing on optimizing three different test ordering workflows
   and two distinct result reporting strategies. From this, we identified
   common issues such as variable reporting location and structure of PGx
   results, as well as duplicate PGx testing. We identified several
   opportunities to optimize our current processes, including-(1) PGx
   laboratory stewardship, (2) increasing visibility of PGx tests, and (3)
   clinician and patient education. Key to the success was the importance
   of engaging clinician, informatics, and pathology stakeholders, as we
   developed interventions to improve our PGX implementation processes.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Uranium ore concentrates (UOCs), the product of uranium mining and
   milling, are primarily comprised of uranium oxide (U3O8 and UO2) or
   peroxide (UO4 center dot 4H(2)O and UO4 center dot 2H(2)O) compounds.
   Following production, UOCs are typically placed in storage until they
   are converted to uranium hexafluoride (UF6) at a uranium conversion
   facility. In this study, the chemical changes responsible for an
   interesting hardening phenomenon observed in UOCs stored for prolonged
   periods was investigated to understand underlying causes. Powder X-ray
   diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis were used to characterize
   freeflowing and hardened UOC samples and revealed the hardened material
   had undergone hydration and oxidation as indicated by increased moisture
   content and the presence of metaschoepite {[}(UO2)(4)O(OH)(6)](H2O)(5)
   and/or schoepite {[}(UO2)(4)O(OH)(6)](H2O)(6). Additionally, an aging
   study found metaschoepite in UOCs after 3 months exposure to a high
   relative humidity environment. The same study found agglomerated, but
   not fully hardened, material in nearly all aged UOCs samples. These
   results suggest metaschoepite and schoepite are indicative of UOCs
   exposed to elevated levels of H2O during storage. Lastly, a
   drying/calcining study of hardened U3O8 material demonstrated a means of
   remediation and identified an intermediate compound of potential
   interest, dehydrated schoepite. Dehydrated schoepite results from
   heating metaschoepite or schoepite between 100 and 300 degrees C and
   indicates partial reversal of hardened U3O8 to its original condition.}},

Abstract = {{Meeting the transport needs of a growing world population makes it
   imperative to develop renewable and sustainable routes to production of
   liquid fuels. With a market-driven economic structure and pressing
   environmental issues, it is essential that these new routes provide
   environmental benefits while being economically viable. Conversion of
   second-generation lignocellulosic biomass resources to fuels via
   pyrolysis represents an important technological route. In this article,
   we report comparative assessment of the economic and lifecycle
   environmental aspects for catalytic and thermal pyrolysis. The goal of
   this assessment is two-fold: one is to understand the potential of this
   conversion route via the catalytic and thermal processes and second is
   to provide feedback for further development of catalysts for various
   stages of this conversion. The complete assessment is interdisciplinary
   in nature and connects the laboratory experiments with contextual
   sustainability assessment. Three catalytic and one thermal pyrolysis
   processes are analyzed using this assessment approach. Subject to the
   model choices and data inputs, the results, which consider quality of
   the oil product, show that biofuels produced using catalytic and thermal
   routes are rather expensive compared to gasoline. But at the same time,
   they provide significant greenhouse gas emission savings and can lead to
   lower CO2 abatement costs compared to the first-generation ethanol that
   is used currently. With one of the product scenarios of hydrotreated
   (HT) oil, the abatements costs are estimated to be 51\% of those
   associated with first-generation ethanol. Additional product scenarios
   with developments in catalysts show potential to further reduce
   abatement costs significantly to below 100 EUR per metric tonne of CO2
   equivalents. Using scenario analysis, the results help us to understand
   specific areas for development of novel catalysts. At the same time, the
   results demonstrate the trade-offs associated with the variety and
   complexity of technical factors associated with the pyrolysis routes.
   The study highlights the challenges and the promises of catalytic and
   thermal pyrolysis for production of high-quality biofuels produced via a
   sustainable production route.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The world's one-third of children with severe acute
   malnutrition continue to live in India. This study focuses on the
   function and implementation of the `Kuposhan Mukt Gujarat Maha-Abhiyan'
   (KMGA) program aimed at treating children with severe acute malnutrition
   (SAM) in Vadodara district.
   Method: The present study aims to explore the healthcare provider's and
   beneficiary's opinions and perceptions about the execution of the
   program by adopting a cross-sectional study design with the help of the
   qualitative interview guide. The research was conducted from January to
   June 2019, in Vadodara district. In-depth, face to face interviews was
   performed for acquiring relevant information. Data analysis was done by
   using qualitative analysis software ATLAS.ti version 8.
   Results: The results suggest programs' in-general acceptability,
   sustainability, and economical durability. The study results revealed
   several facilitators such as community involvement, appropriately given
   incentives, a child's proper response, doorstep services, and some
   challenges like cultural practices, limited awareness, and low income of
   the family. The study results also indicated the positive approach for
   hospital-based management, where primary importance is given to the
   empowering mothers, which can further lead to gradual behavioral change
   in the community.
   Conclusion: The research highlights the importance of healthcare
   providers to work responsibly and unitedly and of more participation,
   acceptance, and contribution of the beneficiaries for the program's
   success.}},

Abstract = {{The present study was aimed to develop and characterize novel linezolid
   (LNZ) loaded mannosylated gelatin nanoparticles (Mn-GNPs) using the
   Quality by Design (QbD) approach. The quality target product profile
   (QTPP) of the nanoparticulate formulation was defined and critical
   quality attributes (CQAs) were identified. The risk assessment and
   factor screening was done by Taguchi orthogonal array design to find out
   the most impacted factors affecting CQAs. A 3(3) Box-Behnken Design
   (BBD) was employed to further optimize the identified variables. The
   optimized LNZ loaded gelatin nanoparticles (GNPs) were then
   surface-functionalized with mannose (Mn-GNPs) for selective targeting to
   alveolar macrophages. The particle size of the GNPs and Mn-GNPs were
   found to be 235.3 +/- 11.3 nm with 0.127 +/- 0.02 polydispersity index
   (PDI) and 379 +/- 21.7 nm with 0.148 +/- 0.03 PDI, while the percent
   entrapment efficiency (\%EE) was 56.8 +/- 2.1\% and 51.3 +/- 3.6\%,
   respectively. Moreover, an in-vitro drug release study was performed and
   has shown the sustained drug release from both the formulations. This
   was further confirmed by kinetic studies. The formulations were also
   screened for ex-vivo haemolytic toxicity study to ensure the in-vivo
   safety. Thus, these studies revealed the importance and applicability of
   the QbD approach for the systemic development of nanoparticulate
   formulations.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{60}},

Abstract = {{Longleaf pine is a keystone species of the southeastern US that is
   undergoing restoration due to centuries of deforestation, fire
   suppression, and land-use changes. One important feature of longleaf
   pine is its episodic nature of cone production that is required for
   successful regeneration. To learn more about individual-tree dynamics of
   longleaf pine cone production, this study investigates the concept of
   ``super producers{''} - a small number of individuals that produce a
   disproportionally large volume of annual seed crop compared to standard
   producers. I examined a 29-year cone-production dataset provided by the
   U.S. Forest Service that contained 234 longleaf pine trees from 18 sites
   throughout the Southeast. I found super-producing individuals at each
   site and these trees comprised 16.4 percent of all trees that were able
   to produce 31.6 percent of all cones in the dataset. Super producers
   were largely indistinguishable from standard producers based on trunk
   diameter, yet they were able to produce large cone crops when standard
   producers could not. The results of this study reveal a new
   understanding of the substantial variability of cone production at the
   individual-tree level that should be considered when managing
   regeneration efforts.}},

Title = {{Role of the substrates in the ribbon orientation of Sb2Se3 films grown
   by Low-Temperature Pulsed Electron Deposition}},
Journal = {{SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{218}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) is a p-type semiconductor, considered as an
   excellent photovoltaic absorber for its high absorption coefficient in
   the visible region and a nearly optimal band-gap for singlejunction
   solar cells. The simple binary composition, together with non-toxic and
   earth-abundant constituents make this material very promising toward
   industrial production of low-cost thin-film solar cells. Theoretical
   calculations and experimental data have confirmed that Sb2Se3 exhibits
   strong anisotropic optoelectronic properties, due to the presence of
   infinite covalent (Sb4Se6)(n) ribbons along the (001) direction, whereas
   weak van der Waals interactions occur between ribbons. In such
   anisotropic materials, electronic transport is strongly affected by
   crystal structure: when ribbons are aligned perpendicularly to the solar
   cell surface, a better collection of photogenerated current occurs,
   leading to larger photovoltaic conversion efficiencies.
   In order to understand the alignment mechanisms of ribbons, Sb2Se3 thin
   films were grown by LowTemperature Pulsed Electron Deposition (LT-PED)
   technique at different temperatures (from 200 degrees C to 400 degrees
   C) on a variety of substrates, such as glass, molybdenum, CdS,
   Fluorine-doped Tin Oxide (FTO) and nano structured ZnO. The structural
   and morphological characterization of the Sb2Se3 films, performed by
   out-of-plane and in-plane X-Ray Diffraction and micro-Raman
   spectroscopy, demonstrated that ribbon alignment along the surface
   normal is strongly dependent on the used substrate. The comparison
   between solar cells grown in substrate configuration on Mo and FTO,
   clearly demonstrates the influence of ribbon orientation on
   short-circuit current.}},

Abstract = {{Modern analog placement techniques require consideration of current path
   and symmetry constraints. The symmetry pairs can be efficiently packed
   using the symmetry island configurations, but not all these
   configurations result in minimum gate interconnection, which can impact
   the overall circuit routing and performance. This article proposes the
   first work that reformulates this problem considering all of them
   together in the form of parallel current path (PCP) constraints. PCP
   constraints, in addition to monotonic current paths, also consider
   partial-monotonic current paths to generate a more compact placement. We
   use a novel two-step approach to detect symmetry-feasible sequence-pairs
   (SFSPs) without doing placement construction by using representative
   sequence-pair (RSP). Then a placement algorithm satisfying these
   constraints is formulated to reduce a vast search space via efficient
   sequence pair manipulation. The experimental results show that this
   formulation and algorithm can generate multiple placement solutions that
   satisfy all the constraints in a more tightly packed configuration,
   resulting in smaller wirelength, reduced parasitics, and thus better
   post-layout performance.}},

Title = {{Precursor- induced bioaccumulation of secondary metabolites and
   antioxidant activity in suspension cultures of Dendrobium fimbriatum, an
   orchid of therapeutic importance}},
Journal = {{SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{135}},

Abstract = {{Orchids are important sources of various bioactive molecules of
   medicinal importance. Dendrobium fimbriatum figures prominently among
   the various medicinal orchids used on a global scale in herbal
   preparations. It is an important constituent of the ``Herba
   Dendrobii{''} and is widely used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).
   Being a highly valued herb facing the risk of extinction, use of
   precursors in cell suspension cultures offers valuable alternative to
   cater to its large-scale demand. The present research focuses on a wide
   scale application of various precursor molecules to upscale the
   production of secondary metabolites under controlled in vitro conditions
   so as to minimize the pressures exerted on its natural populations for
   collection. The cultures of D. fimbriatum inoculated with caffeic acid
   (CA) in the medium exhibited the highest amount of total phenolic
   content (50.73 mg GAE/gm DW at 0.5 mM CA) and flavonoid content (5.73 mg
   QE/gm DW at 1.0 mM CA). However, highest amount of tannin content (14.77
   mg TAE/gm DW) was recorded in the cultures treated with p-coumaric acid
   at 4.0 mM in the medium. Also, cultures treated with ferulic acid at 2.0
   mM in the medium resulted in the accumulation of a higher content of
   total alkaloids (317.82 mg ATP/ gm DW). Simultaneously, the antioxidant
   activity of the precursor - treated cultures of D. fimbriatum measured
   by DPPH and FRAP assay revealed that the antioxidant activity was
   highest in the cultures treated with 0.5 mM caffeic acid which could be
   attributed to the increased production of total phenolic contents. The
   present research is significant as it reveals baseline information which
   if exploited scientifically can cater to an enhanced regular supply of
   secondary metabolites throughout the year by the use of precursors in
   the cultures without affecting the natural orchid populations, wherein
   Dendrobium fimbriatum is used as a model plant taxon. (c) 2020 SAAB.

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The present work describes the deposition and investigation of
   structural and optical characteristics of bare and doped TiO2 thin
   films. The TiO2 products are obtained through simple and cost effective
   spray pyrolysis technique (SPT) using titanium (IV) butoxide as Ti
   precursor. The impact of Zn doping on the crystal structure and phase
   formation is studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The formation
   of anatase phase relative to pure TiO2 along with preferred orientation
   along the {[}101] direction is confirmed with the help of XRD analysis.
   Zn doping into TiO2 lattice network leads to an identical diffraction
   pattern. A deterioration of crystallinity is obtained in crystallite
   size employing the numerous methods such as Scherrer method,
   Williamson-Hall, Halder-Wagner and Wagner-Agua analysis in accordance
   with Zn. In addition, absorbance results obtained from UV-vis
   spectroscopy has been exerted to examine the optical characteristics. It
   is noted that the dopant introduction has an impact on the optical
   properties and the direct band gap value obtained from Tauc relation
   exhibits a red shift with Zn content. The influence of the Zn doping
   elements on the optical constants of TiO2 product has been investigated.
   The dielectric constants, dispersion parameters, loss factor and
   distribution of volume and surface energy loss of the TiO2 products have
   been computed as well. The as-prepared nanostructured Zn-doped TiO2 thin
   films can be used as potential candidates for different optoelectronic
   devices}},

Title = {{Data entry quality of double data entry vs automated form processing
   technologies: A cohort study validation of optical mark recognition and
   intelligent character recognition in a clinical setting}},
Journal = {{HEALTH SCIENCE REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{3}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background and AimsPatient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are
   increasingly used in health services. Paper forms are still often used
   to register such data. Manual double data entry (DDE) has been defined
   as the gold standard for transferring data to an electronic format but
   is laborious and costly. Automated form processing (AFP) is an
   alternative, but validation in a clinical context is warranted. The
   study objective was to examine and validate a local hospital AFP setup.
   MethodsPatients over 18years of age who were scheduled for knee or hip
   replacement at Stavanger University Hospital from 2014 to 2017 who
   answered PROMs were included in the study and contributed PROM data. All
   paper PROMs were scanned using the AFP techniques of optical mark
   recognition (OMR) and intelligent character recognition (ICR) and were
   processed by DDE by health secretaries using a data entry program. OMR
   and ICR were used to capture different types of data. The main outcome
   was the proportion of correctly entered numbers, defined as the same
   response recorded in AFP and DDE or by consulting the original paper
   questionnaire at the data field, item, and PROM level.
   ResultsA total of 448 questionnaires from 255 patients were analyzed.
   There was no statistically significant difference in error proportions
   per 10000 data fields between OMR and DDE for data from check boxes
   (3.52 95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.17 to 5.72 and 4.18 (95\% CI
   2.68-6.53), respectively P =.61). The error proportion for ICR (nine
   errors) was statistically significantly higher than that for DDE (two
   errors), that is, 3.53 (95\% CI 1.87-6.57) vs 0.78 (95\% CI 0.22-2.81)
   per 100 data fields/items/questionnaires; P =.033. OMR (0.04\% errors)
   outperformed ICR (3.51\% errors; P <.001), Fisher's exact test.
   ConclusionsOMR can produce an error rate that is comparable to that of
   DDE. In our setup, ICR is still problematic and is highly dependent on
   manual validation. When AFP is used, data quality should be tested and
   documented.}},

   249(1.7\%) mammographic exam reports, we observed a wrong MD
   interpretation.
   Conclusion: Diagnostic errors during mammographic examination occur
   because the radiologists lack theoretical knowledge about MD. This lack,
   in turn, results in a decrease in the quality of medical care provided
   for female patients and an increase in the number of diagnostic

Abstract = {{Polybutylene adipate-co-terephthalate (PBAT) is a biodegradable polymer
   with good features for packaging applications. However, the mechanical
   performance and high prices of PBAT limit its current usage at the
   commercial level. To improve the properties and reduce the cost of PBAT,
   pine resin derivatives, gum rosin (GR) and pentaerythritol ester of GR
   (UT), were proposed as sustainable additives. For this purpose, PBAT was
   blended with 5, 10, and 15 wt.\% of additives by melt-extrusion followed
   by injection moulding. The overall performance of the formulations was
   assessed by tensile test, microstructural, thermal, and dynamic
   mechanical thermal analysis. The results showed that although good
   miscibility of both resins with PBAT matrix was achieved, GR in 10 wt.\%
   showed better interfacial adhesion with the PBAT matrix than UT. The
   thermal characterization suggested that GR and UT reduce PBAT melting
   enthalpy and enhance its thermal stability, improving PBAT
   processability. A 10 wt.\% of GR significantly increased the tensile
   properties of PBAT, while a 15 wt.\% of UT maintained PBAT tensile
   performance. The obtained materials showed higher hydrophobicity than
   neat PBAT. Thus, GR and UT demonstrated that they are advantageous
   additives for PBAT-resin compounding for rigid food packaging which are
   easy to process and adequate for industrial scalability. At the same
   time, they enhance its mechanical and hydrophobic performance.}},

Abstract = {{Jet Propellant-8 (JP-8) is used as a fuel for a standard Compression
   Ignition (CI) engine instead of diesel oil, especially in the military
   applications. The properties of a kerosene-type fuel, which is JP-8,
   encourage us to test different strategies of mixture creation and
   combustion, which could be more effective for this fuel than these
   elaborated for diesel oil. The experiment aimed to show whether it is
   possible to realise an effective Low Temperature Combustion (LTC)
   strategy in a CI engine with a low compression ratio for JP-8 fuel. The
   tests were focused on the combustion of a lean homogeneous JP-8/air
   mixture close to the knock limit. Additionally, the combustion process
   of the homogeneous mixtures diluted with EGR was examined. The AVL
   research engine with a common rail system and low compression ratio (CR
   = 12) was adapted for the tests. In order to create a homogeneous
   mixture early, multi injection of JP-8 under high pressure (90 MPa) was
   applied. The results of the HCCI operation were compared to the
   Partially Premixed Combustion (PPC) mode without EGR, tested on the same
   engine with a low CR. The experiment showed that it is possible to
   realise the LTC process for the HCCI engine fueled with JP-8, though the
   knock limited the engine load. The application of EGR allowed
   controlling the phase and rate of the heat release. The higher share of
   EGR made the HCCI engine cycles less repetitive. Generally, for the HCCI
   engine operation, the CO and total hydrocarbons (THC) emissions were on
   a high level. The PM emission was also relatively high, whereas NOx was
   maintained on a low level for all of the examined points.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of the effects of implementing a diode transmission device

Abstract = {{Purpose: This work investigated effects of implementing the Delta(4)
   Discover diode transmission detector into the clinical workflow.
   Methods: PDD and profile scans were completed with and without the
   Discover for a number of photon beam energies. Transmission factors were
   determined for all beam energies and included in Eclipse TPS to account
   for the attenuation of the Discover. A variety of IMRT plans were
   delivered to a Delta(4) Phantom+ with and without the Discover to
   evaluate the Discover's effects on IMRT QA. An imaging QA phantom was
   used to assess the detector's effects on MV image quality. OSLDs placed
   on the Phantom+ were used to determine the detector's effects on
   superficial dose.
   Results: The largest effect on PDDs after d(max) was 0.5\%. The largest
   change in beam profile symmetry and flatness was 0.2\% and 0.1\%,
   respectively. An average difference in gamma passing rates (2\%/2 mm) of
   0.2\% was observed between plans that did not include the Discover in
   the measurement and calculation to plans that did include the Discover
   in the measurement and calculation. The Discover did not significantly
   change the MV image quality, and the largest observed increase in the
   relative superficial dose when the Discover was present was 1\%.
   Conclusions: The effects the Discover has on the linac beam were found
   to be minimal. The device can be implemented into the clinic without the
   need to alter the TPS beam modeling, other than accounting for the
   device's attenuation. However, a careful workflow review to implement
   the Discover should be completed.}},

   processes (OUP) in colored noise. The effects of thermal reservoir and
   intramolecular coupling generate an effective transversal relaxation

   can be solved algebraically, unlike colored noise cases that requires

Abstract = {{Information on biological status is essential for designing,
   implementing, and evaluating management strategies and recovery plans
   for threatened or exploited species. However, the data required to
   quantify status are often limited, and it is important to understand how
   assessments of status may be biased by assumptions in data analysis. For
   Pacific salmon, biological status assessments based on spawner
   abundances and spawner-recruitment (SR) analyses often involve ``run
   reconstructions{''} that impute missing spawner data, expand observed
   spawner abundance to account for unmonitored streams, assign catch to
   individual stocks, and quantify age-at-return. Using a stochastic
   simulation approach, we quantified how common assumptions in run
   reconstructions biased assessments of biological status based on spawner
   abundance. We found that status assessments were robust to most common
   assumptions in run reconstructions, even in the face of declining
   monitoring coverage, but that overestimating catch tended to increase
   rates of status misclassification. Our results lend confidence to
   biological status assessments based on spawner abundances and SR
   analyses, even in the face of incomplete data.}},

Abstract = {{The past decade has seen a shift of rhetoric, where religious actors are
   presented not just as aberrations in the secular and democratic order,
   but also as significant players in the development of peaceful and
   diversified societies. However, experiences of extremist religious
   groups raise questions about the legitimacy of involving religious
   actors in these kinds of processes, in particular in relation to
   security, which according to a classical perspective is a matter of
   national and international security agencies. This paper analyzes the
   challenges relating to the inclusion of religious actors in security
   situations in East Africa, particularly those involving confrontations
   between religious actors, in which the concept of the ``religious
   other{''} has a specific reference. The main finding is that religious
   actors have a contribution to make in relation to security and conflict
   involving religion and faith, given that security is understood in a
   broader sense than the classical.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Coffee beans are a rich source of bioactive phytochemicals such as
   chlorogenic acids (CGA). During the roasting process, the CGA content
   changes dramatically. An effective HPTLC method was developed which
   allows a fast characterization of the eight main CGA present in green
   and roasted coffee beans and their distribution during roasting trials.
   The method was optimized with regard to three caffeoylquinic acids
   (CQA), two feruloylquinic acids (FQA) and three dicaffeoylquinic acids
   (di-CQA).
   The best separation for a fingerprint consisting of eight phenolic
   compounds as markers was achieved on silica gel 60 F-254 HPTLC plates
   with a solvent mixture of diethyl ether, formic acid, acetic acid,
   water, acetophenone and heptane (30:3:9:50:30:10) (nu/nu/nu/nu/nu/nu).
   Staining with natural product reagent A enabled visualization and
   quantitative evaluation. Principal component analysis can help to
   visualize the evolution of the chlorogenic acids throughout the process
   also with the aim of controlling the roasting degree.}},

Title = {{Spiders mimic the acoustic signalling of mutillid wasps to avoid
   predation: startle signalling or Batesian mimicry?}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{170}},
Pages = {{157-166}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The importance of vision-reliant defensive traits (e.g. warning colours)
   in mimicry studies is well established, but their effectiveness is
   limited by visibility. In low light conditions, for instance, acoustic
   or tactile channels may be more effective. The juvenile and adult stages
   of the nocturnal hunting Palpimanus spiders audibly stridulate when
   harassed. Given this we hypothesized that the sound produced by
   Palpimanus has a defensive role against interspecific predators.
   Palpimanus though are poorly defended especially against something as
   large as a gecko. Hence we hypothesized that the stridulation is
   effective because the spider mimics co-occurring mutillid wasps. We
   staged predator feeding experiments in which mutillid wasps,
   sham-operated Palpimanus, silenced Palpimanus and a nonstridulating
   spider were offered to Eusparassus spiders and geckoes. Stridulating
   spiders had significantly greater survival against both predators than
   the nonstridulating treatments and comparable survival to the mutillid
   wasps. This result represents the first confirmed case of a spider using
   stridulation against an interspecific predator. Stridulation deterred
   Eusparasus spiders, while in geckoes stridulation acted postcapture as
   they dropped the prey instead of attempting to swallow them. For
   mutillid wasps this dropping response was typically more rapid than with
   Palpimanus but attempts to swallow silenced individuals were more
   frequent than sham-operated individuals, which were more likely to be
   dropped before any attempt to swallow. Analyses of stridulation
   characteristics of Palpimanus showed they were similar to acoustic
   signals of four of the co-occurring mutillid wasps and far more so than
   distress signals of control insects. Our study overall supports the
   notion that Palpimanus spiders are Batesian mimics of sympatrically
   occurring mutillids through the use of an aposematic acoustic signal and
   not just an example of a startle response. (C) 2020 The Association for

Abstract = {{Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a major cause of infantile
   diarrhea worldwide. EPEC and the closely related murine model of EPEC
   infection, Citrobacter rodentium, utilize a type III secretion system
   (T3SS) to propagate the infection. Since the T3SS is not essential for
   the bacteria to survive or propagate, inhibiting the virulence factor
   with a therapeutic would treat the infection without causing harm to
   commensal bacteria. Studying inhibitors of the T3SS usually requires a
   BSL-2 laboratory designation and eukaryotic host cells while not
   indicating the mechanism of inhibition. We have designed a BSL-1 assay
   using the murine model C. rodentium that does not require mammalian cell
   culture. This CPG2-reporter assay allows for more rapid analysis of
   secretion efficiency than Western blotting and is sensitive enough to
   differentiate between partial and total inhibition of the T3SS. Here we
   present our method and the results of a small collection of compounds we
   have screened, including known T3SS inhibitors EGCG, regacin, and
   aurodox and related quorum sensing inhibitors tannic acid and ellagic
   acid. We have further characterized EGCG as a T3SS inhibitor and
   established its IC50 of 1.8 +/- 0.4 mu M. We also establish tannic acid
   as a potent inhibitor of the T3SS with an IC50 of 0.65 +/- 0.09 mu M.}},

Abstract = {{The sunspot area is a critical physical quantity for assessing the solar
   activity level; forecasts of the sunspot area are of great importance
   for studies of the solar activity and space weather. We developed an
   innovative hybrid model prediction method by integrating the
   complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) and extreme
   learning machine (ELM). The time series is first decomposed into
   intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with different frequencies by CEEMD;
   these IMFs can be divided into three groups, a high-frequency group, a
   low-frequency group, and a trend group. The ELM forecasting models are
   established to forecast the three groups separately. The final forecast
   results are obtained by summing up the forecast values of each group.
   The proposed hybrid model is applied to the smoothed monthly mean
   sunspot area archived at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). We
   find a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and a root mean square
   error (RMSE) of 1.80\% and 9.75, respectively, which indicates that: (1)
   for the CEEMD-ELM model, the predicted sunspot area is in good agreement
   with the observed one; (2) the proposed model outperforms previous
   approaches in terms of prediction accuracy and operational efficiency.}},

   The final focusing quadrupole QD0, which is 2.2 m away from the

   coil type is the best selection, where the coil can be wound directly on
   the coil former in a fixed inclination angle. For QD0, the
   superconducting quadrupole coils for the two apertures are nearly in
   contact; high-order harmonics will be produced by magnetic field
   crosstalk and should be canceled out at the design stage. This article
   will present the design study for a pair of 400 mm long QD0 prototype,

   southeastern margin of the South China Sea}},
Journal = {{MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{122}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Late Cenozoic continental rifting and breakup separated the southern
   margin of the South China Sea (SCS) from the northern margin. It remains
   unknown whether the high-density/velocity zones (HVZs) in the lower
   crust extend southwards from the northeastern margin of the SCS to the
   conjugate southern margin. We integrated two newly acquired and
   processed multichannel seismic reflection profiles with gravity and
   magnetic data across the Liyue (Reed) Bank and north Palawan basin to
   clarify the characteristics of crustal structure and their relationship
   to post-rift magmatism. Our results show an asymmetric distribution of
   the HVZs in the conjugate margins. The lower crust anomalous reflections
   are isolated and mostly restricted in the areas of the oceancontinent
   transition (OCT) and the distal sag. In gravity modeling, the crustal
   thickness decreases from similar to 20 km in the proximal sag to a
   minimum of similar to 6 km in the distal sag, and these anomalous
   reflections spatially correspond to high-density zones no more than 4 km
   in thickness. The magmatic features are presented by igneous intrusions
   at the top of the basement that deform post-rift strata in the Early
   Miocene. These HVZs, above which the crustal stretching factor is
   3.3-5.8, support that an anomalously hot asthenospheric mantle persisted
   during lithospheric thinning, resulting in magmatic underplating and
   density drop in the uppermost mantle during early breakup.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{89}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we propose a sampling method for calculating ship exhaust
   emission inventories, which reduces the uncertainties induced by missing
   ship static data in traditional methods. The stratified random sampling
   method is utilized to take sample ships based on the ship density, ship
   type, and main engine power. The exhaust emissions from sample ship are
   calculated using an activity-based method with 1 s temporal resolution
   AIS (Automatic Identification System) data. Then the regional ship
   exhaust emissions are estimated based on the sampling relationship.
   Sensitivity experiments show that the relative error of the proposed
   method decreases quickly with the sampling ratio (the ratio between the
   number of sampled ships and total ships) and it is less than 3.5\% when
   the sampling ratio is higher than 10\%. The method is used to estimate
   the inventories of ship exhaust emissions in the Yangtze river, which
   can improve the computational accuracy of ship emissions.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: Accurate estimation of false discovery rate (FDR) of
   spectral identification is a central problem in mass spectrometry-based
   proteomics. Over the past two decades, target-decoy approaches (TDAs)
   and decoy-free approaches (DFAs) have been widely used to estimate FDR.
   TDAs use a database of decoy species to faithfully model score
   distributions of incorrect peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs). DFAs, on the
   other hand, fit two-component mixture models to learn the parameters of
   correct and incorrect PSM score distributions. While conceptually
   straightforward, both approaches lead to problems in practice,
   particularly in experiments that push instrumentation to the limit and
   generate low fragmentation-efficiency and low signal-to-noise-ratio
   spectra.
   Results: We introduce a new decoy-free framework for FDR estimation that
   generalizes present DFAs while exploiting more search data in a manner
   similar to TDAs. Our approach relies on multi-component mixtures, in
   which score distributions corresponding to the correct PSMs, best
   incorrect PSMs and second-best incorrect PSMs are modeled by the skew
   normal family. We derive EM algorithms to estimate parameters of these
   distributions from the scores of best and second-best PSMs associated
   with each experimental spectrum. We evaluate our models on multiple
   proteomics datasets and a HeLa cell digest case study consisting of more
   than a million spectra in total. We provide evidence of improved
   performance over existing DFAs and improved stability and speed over
   TDAs without any performance degradation. We propose that the new

   drug product performance testing conditions}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To measure the pH, buffer capacity, lipid content, bile acid
   content, and viscosity in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) lumen after a
   standard high-calorie, high-fat meal as well as the osmolality, lipid
   content and bile acid content in the aqueous phase of the gastric
   contents and the micellar phase of contents of the upper small
   intestine. To evaluate the implications of these findings for the
   composition of biorelevant media employed in vitro oral drug product
   performance testing representing the upper GI conditions after ingestion
   of the standard meal.
   Methods: Eight healthy male adult volunteers participated in a
   two-phase, crossover study in which a homogenized standard meal was
   administered to the antrum via the gastric port of a
   naso-gastro-intestinal tube. A glass of tap water and single paracetamol
   and danazol doses were administered to the antrum of the stomach 30 min
   after the initiation of meal administration (Pentafragka et al., 2020).
   Samples were aspirated from the antrum and the upper small intestine
   over the next four hours. The pH and the buffer capacity of the samples
   were measured immediately upon aspiration, while viscosity, osmolality,
   and presence of solubilizing agents were measured after storage at -70
   degrees C.
   Results: The composition of gastric contents over time fluctuated less
   after the homogenized standard meal than after liquid meals with similar
   composition. Intra-subject variability of pH and buffer capacity in the
   stomach and in the upper small intestine was low. Mean viscosity values
   in the stomach at 100 s(-1) were 80-800 times higher than in the fasted
   state for more than 3 h after the standard meal. In the upper small
   intestine, mean viscosity values at 100 s(-1) were at least 100 times
   higher than in the fasted state for 4 h after the standard meal.
   Conclusions: Based on data collected in this study, Level I and Level II
   biorelevant media simulating the intragastric conditions after ingestion
   of a standard meal could be simplified whereas FeSSIF-V2 composition was
   confirmed to be representative of the composition of contents in the
   upper small intestine. Representative values of viscosity in the stomach
   and the upper small intestine and Level II composition of the aqueous
   phase of gastric contents, after the standard meal, are proposed for
   first time.}},

   steel grades by means of the electrochemical hydrogen permeation
   technique}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen diffusion kinetics, which is influenced by the hydrogen
   trapping and de-trapping phenomena within the steel microstructure,
   plays an important role on the behaviour of steel components under
   hydrogen environments. Hence, the complex interaction between hydrogen
   atoms and steel microstructure must be analyzed in order to discuss the
   impact of hydrogen on the structural damage.
   Quenched and tempered low-alloy ferritic steels from the Cr-Mo family,
   with and without vanadium, have been subjected to different plastic
   deformation ratios by cold rolling. Dislocation densities have been
   determined by the analysis of the peak broadening on X-Ray
   diffractograms. Hydrogen diffusion kinetics was characterized by means
   of hydrogen permeation transients. In addition, binding energies between
   hydrogen atoms and microstructure were also determined using thermal
   desorption analysis (TDA). The analysis of the results highlights the
   influence of dislocations density and vanadium carbides on the hydrogen
   diffusion kinetics. In the 2.25Cr1Mo steel grade, hydrogen apparent
   diffusion coefficient decreased after the cold-work due to the increase
   in the density of traps (mainly related to dislocation core, Delta E-TL
   = 55-60 kJ/mol). Nevertheless, after 10\% of plastic deformation,
   apparent diffusion coefficient `saturates' according to the `plateau'
   determined in the dislocation density evolution at higher deformation
   levels. Due to the vanadium addition (+0.31\%), hydrogen apparent
   diffusion coefficient was notably reduced (compared to that obtained in
   the V-free steel grade). Hydrogen trapping and diffusion are the result
   of the interplay between vanadium carbides (Delta E-TL = 35 kJ/mol) and
   dislocation core.}},

Abstract = {{The paper shows the novel techniques introduction in the region of Latin
   America and the Caribbean in order to strengthen the surveillance and
   monitoring of the sedimentation phenomenon in the surface water
   reservoirs. The integrated use of the nuclear techniques allows a more

   development of a regional project, supported by the International Agency
   of Atomic Energy, Cuba participates as technical leader for 15
   countries, to encourage and implement the integrated application of 3
   nuclear techniques (Fallout Radionuclides (Cs-137, Be-7, Pb-210),
   Compound Specific Stable Isotopes (fatty acids of the partial derivative
   13C) and the Isotopic Hydrology (O-18, H-2, H-3). The methodology used
   in the last studies referred to RLA 5076 Project is to apply the
   integration of these three techniques allows evaluating, in the
   hydraulic facilities and surface water reservoirs, the negative
   sedimentation impacts in natural and anthropic process as environmental
   and social risk. These techniques evaluate the sedimentation process and
   its synergy, obtaining since the soil quantification in the landscape,
   definition the soil origin deposited until the dynamic characterization
   of the water body as soil receptor. The integrated application of these
   nuclear techniques in the Project RLA-5076 confirms it as a useful tool
   to support the decisions makers in the definition of the national
   strategies and programs related to the land and the water resources
   sustainability. With the support of the IAEA projects in the Latin

   The Beveridgian financing case}},
Journal = {{SOCIO-ECONOMIC PLANNING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{72}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Health is one of the most fundamental human rights. In that sense, the
   creation of health systems attempted to provide the population with
   organisations, institutions, and resources to meet their needs. However,
   health inequalities are prevalent in all countries. Thus, evaluating
   health systems is vital to understand this issue. Accordingly, the aim
   of this work is to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA)
   approach to innovatively rank nine of the European health systems with
   Beveridgian financing that would help determine the shortcomings of the
   Portuguese National Health Service and discern the operating ``best
   practices{''}, in a close interaction with the Portuguese Ministry of
   Health. First, the panel of decision-making actors was guided through
   the design of a cognitive map to promote their learning process and help
   them identify eleven fundamental points of view. Second, their
   operationalisation was facilitated by selecting acceptable descriptors
   of performance. Finally, an MCDA approach was proposed to evaluate the
   chosen health systems using an additive model, which included a
   sensitivity and a robustness analysis. In the end, the model was
   perceived by the panel as being trustworthy and reliable. This framework
   can be used for further MCDA modelling in similar applications based on

Abstract = {{Background: Breast cancer (BC) is a complex disease in which
   susceptibility and clinical course depend on multiple factors. Evidence
   suggests that a mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-homolog may be present
   in human BCs; however, little is known about its clinical implications.
   Methods: MMTV-like env nucleotide-sequence was searched in tumor and
   tumor-adjacent tissues from 217 Brazilian BC patients through nested-PCR
   and confirmed through PCR-sequencing. Blood samples were also tested for
   patients with MMTV-like env gene-positive tumors. Correlations with
   clinicopathological parameters were evaluated. Results: MMTV-like env
   sequence was detected in tumor and tumor-adjacent tissue samples from
   41/217 and 30/196 patients, respectively. In blood, MMTV-like was
   detected in 17/32 patients. In Luminal-B tumors, MMTV-like in tumor
   tissue was negatively correlated with tumor size and disease stage,
   whereas in HER2 tumors it anti-correlated with lymph node metastasis
   (LNM) and disease stage. Considering blood, MMTV-like env gene
   positivity negatively correlated with age in general BC, while in
   Luminal-A tumors it positively correlated with Ki67 but negatively
   correlated with age and LNM. The associations with decreased LNM

   MMTV-like env positivity is associated with better prognostic parameters
   in BC subtypes, which might be explainable by its anti-metastatic
   potential and by putative activation of immune milieu.}},

Abstract = {{Utilisation of water harvesting systems of ancient origin for
   present-day requirements can be seen in many regions of the world. The
   adoption of ancient tank cascades as the smallest hydrological unit of
   river basin development in Sri Lanka is such a practice. However, these
   systems are associated with unsuccessful experiences in agricultural
   performance while being vulnerable to both floods and droughts.
   Therefore, the identification of principles behind the development of
   cascades is vital. This study reviewed historical evidence, definitions,
   terminologies and studies on the development and operation of these
   systems. A hypothesis was then developed and tested for a specimen tank
   cascade using a HEC-HMS model. The routing mechanism showed that the
   existence of a series of bunds increases the robustness of the tank
   systems for flood inflows. Accordingly, the development of tank cascades
   is a technique used to regulate experienced peak inflows with limited
   technologies. This principle and the new cascade definition developed
   should be prime considerations along with the focus on storage when
   restoring the tanks in cascades. The findings provide insights into the
   crucial need for identifying development principles behind the ancient
   hydrological systems in any region of the world to adapt them
   sustainably.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we operationalized a sustainability framing based on
   the Sustainable Rural Livelihood Resources Framework (SLF), which
   consists of five capitals-human, physical, social, financial, and
   natural. We proposed a sustainability index (SI) for two landscapes
   dominated by two agricultural systems: cattle ranching and small-scale
   family agriculture. Farm variables within each capital were analyzed
   using confirmatory factor analysis. Key variables were identified and
   index values were calculated for each capital. These were combined
   through a set of simultaneous equations to estimate farm-specific
   capitals and SI from the observed farm variables. Principal component
   and cluster analyses were used to group the farms according to their
   index scores and to further compare their characteristics. Furthermore,
   with the purpose of comparing the index scoring with an independent
   metric, a landscape indicator, which comes from a continuous forest, was
   calculated. From the results, the capitals that contributed to a higher
   SI score the most were financial and physical. As cattle ranching was
   associated with higher economic returns and infrastructure investments,
   this livelihood was identified as the most sustainable. Yet, cattle
   ranching has been a deforestation driver in the region. These results
   are attributed to the current conceptual framework design, which gives
   greater weight to material and economic variables; therefore, it
   generates a weak sustainability measure. Although the framework allowed
   us to identify land-use alternatives that could improve SI scores (i.e.,
   silvopastoral systems), corrections to the proposed framework and
   methodological approach will need to include additional environmental
   benefits currently unaccounted for. Farmers that use their farms for
   conservation purposes should be recognized and compensated. An improved
   environmentally focused SI operational framework could help to endorse
   and promote sustainable livelihoods and to generate a strong
   sustainability measure.}},

   the risk of falls in older patients}},
Journal = {{PHARMAZIE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{75}},

Pages = {{666-670}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{For patients at the age of 65 years or older an increased risk of falls
   in association with the intake of first-generation antihistamines with
   sedative effect is discussed. Currently, there are no valid data that
   can either confirm or disprove this risk. In this retrospective
   non-interventional safety study, the primary objective was to
   investigate a possible causal relationship between falls in patients >=
   65 years of age and the intake of first-generation antihistamines.
   Secondary objectives were to investigate a possible causal relationship
   of falls after taking first-generation antihistamines for the subgroups
   < 65 years, 65-84 years and >= 85 years; to determine the fall rate of
   patients >= 65 years of age and of the subgroups < 65 years, 65-84 years
   and 85 years; and to identify causes of falls in patients >= 65 years.
   Out of the 13,866 physicians who were invited to participate in the
   study, 524 (3.8\%) opened the link to the survey. The evaluation
   included verified data sets of 169 physicians who were either general
   practitioners or resident neurologists who had in total treated 313,046
   patients within the previous six months. 9,922 patients had fallen at
   least once (total fall rate 3.2\%). The rate of falls increased with age
   (< 65 years 1.1\%; 65-84 years 3.9\%; >= 85 years 9.9\%). The fall rate
   of patients aged 65 years and older was 5.4\%. Only a small proportion
   (2.9\%, 8,942 patients) of the altogether 313,046 patients recorded had
   taken a first-generation antihistamine at any time within the previous
   six months. In the records of 9.5\% (940 patients) of the 9,922 patients
   who had fallen the intake of first-generation antihistamines was
   documented. Detailed information was available for 379 of these patients
   with a total of 505 falls. The analysis of these cases indicates that in
   almost three quarters of falls (72.5\%, 366 falls) there is no causal
   link between the intake of first-generation antihistamines and the fall.
   In almost 95\% of the remaining 123 falls, the physicians suggested
   between one and seven possible alternative causes of falls (mainly
   underlying and concomitant diseases). This suggests that
   first-generation antihistamines do not play a relevant role in the fall
   incidents.}},

Abstract = {{Erythropoietin (EPO) is an essential hormone for erythropoiesis,
   protecting differentiating erythroblasts against apoptosis. EPO has been
   largely studied in stress or pathological conditions but its regulatory
   role in steady state erythropoiesis has been less documented. Herein, we
   report production of EPO by bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) in
   vitro, and its further enhancement in BMDM conditioned with media from
   apoptotic cells. Confocal microscopy confirmed EPO production in
   erythroblastic island (EBI)-associated macrophages, and analysis of mice
   depleted of EBI macrophages by clodronate liposomes revealed drops in
   EPO levels in bone marrow (BM) cell lysates, and decreased percentages
   of EPO-responsive erythroblasts in the BM. We hypothesize that EBI
   macrophages are an in-situ source of EPO and sustain basal
   erythropoiesis in part through its secretion. To study this hypothesis,
   mice were injected with clodronate liposomes and were supplied with
   exogenous EPO (1-10 IU/mouse) to evaluate potential rescue of the
   deficiency in erythroid cells. Our results show that at doses of 5 and
   10 IU, EPO significantly rescues BM steady state erythropoiesis in mice
   deficient of macrophages. We propose existence of a mechanism by which
   EBI macrophages secrete EPO in response to apoptotic erythroblasts,
   which is in turn controlled by the numbers of erythroid precursors
   generated.}},

Title = {{An Evidence-Based Walking Program in Oregon Communities: Step It Up!
   Survivors}},
Journal = {{PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Physical activity can help mitigate the long-term symptoms and side
   effects of cancer and its treatment, but most cancer survivors are not
   active enough to achieve these benefits. An evidence-based strategy to
   promote physical activity among adults is a community group-based
   walking program. However, many evidence-based programs do not achieve
   intended population health outcomes because of the challenges of
   real-world implementation. We used the Interactive Systems Framework for
   Dissemination and Implementation to conceptualize implementation of a
   capacity-building intervention to support delivery of a community
   group-based walking program. We adapted an evidence-based guide for
   community group-based walking programs for cancer survivors and their
   support network. We provided a capacity-building intervention (technical
   assistance and small-grant funding) and evaluated this implementation
   intervention. We assessed effectiveness of the intervention by measuring
   adoption, acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity,
   implementation costs, and penetration through monthly progress reports,
   site visit observations, interviews, and a final report. Eight
   organizations received a small grant and technical assistance and
   implemented Step It Up! Survivors (SIUS). SIUS helped cancer survivors
   increase their physical activity, establish social connections, and be
   part of a supportive environment. Despite receiving monthly technical
   assistance, some grantees experienced challenges in recruiting
   participants, developing community partnerships, and adhering to the
   prescribed implementation plan. Implementation facilitators included
   community partners and specific components (eg, incentives for
   participants, webinars). Organizations needed different amounts and
   types of assistance with adaptation and implementation. Overall fidelity
   to SIUS ranged from 64\% to 88\%. Some integrated SIUS within existing
   organizational programming for sustainability. The provision of funding
   and technical assistance was a successful implementation intervention.
   Our results suggest a need to better tailor technical assistance while
   organizations are in the process of adapting, implementing, and
   sustaining an evidence-based program in their local communities.}},

   mainland clouded leopards (Neofelis nebulosa)}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{To mitigate the ongoing biodiversity crisis in Tropical Asia, caused by
   extensive deforestation and wildlife poaching, we will need to take more
   strategic approaches towards identifying and prioritizing meaningful
   conservation interventions. This, however, can prove difficult for
   data-limited species. Focusing on the little-studied mainland clouded
   leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), a potential umbrella species in the region,
   we demonstrate an accessible, flexible, and scalable approach applicable
   to any species. First, we model the species' range-wide local
   extirpation threat using a Bayesian Belief Network, taking into account
   the distribution of remaining suitable habitat and major anthropogenic
   threats (habitat loss and poaching). We then identify remaining habitat
   strongholds (defined as large contiguous areas of high quality habitat
   where the species could survive over the mid-to-long term) and grouped
   them into stronghold complexes, which we categorized based on local
   extirpation threat and recent camera-trap survey status. Our results
   show a 34\% decline in the range-wide area categorized as a stronghold
   due to forest cover changes between 2000 and 2018, with 80\% of
   remaining strongholds identified as having a high or very high average
   threat of local extirpation. Based on published records, only 60\% of
   remaining strongholds had at least one site surveyed by camera-traps in
   the last 10 years, highlighting an important knowledge gap concerning
   the species' current distribution and population status. Combined, the
   results of our survey review and threat analysis suggest the species is
   likely extirpated from all of Vietnam, most of China, and large parts of
   Cambodia and Laos. Finally, we synthesize our findings, highlight
   tangible conservation needs, and propose actions for each stronghold
   complex based on the area's specific threats, protection level, and
   survey status, paving the way for the detailed local investigations
   needed to implement meaningful interventions on the ground. (C) 2020 The

Abstract = {{The 2020 quarantine demonstrated that online food purchase has become
   one of the main protagonists of the pandemic. The present study valued
   the Internet as a mediator between producers and consumers with the
   power to create new demand for Romanian traditional food during the
   COVID-19 crisis. Authors aimed at carrying out an exploratory research
   about the online purchase of traditional foods (TFs). Within this
   context, the study, firstly, outlines the meaning of traditional foods
   in the Romanian consumers' minds and, secondly, it identifies the
   variables that can predict the preference for the online purchase of TFs
   during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey was carried out to
   investigate the Romanian consumers' perceptions (n = 223) of TFs and
   online purchase of TFs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Binary logistic
   regression tested the relationship between the preference for the online
   purchase of TFS (vs. in-store) and seven perceived characteristics of
   TFs. Results show that the preference for the online purchase of TFs
   during the COVID-19 pandemic can be predicted by five variables-{''}TFs
   taste{''}; ``Effect of TFs consumption on health during the COVID-19
   pandemic{''}; ``Effect of online TFs purchase on health during the
   COVID-19 pandemic{''}; ``How cheap/expensive is to buy TFS online during
   the COVID-19 pandemic{''}; and ``Easiness to purchase TFS online during
   the COVID-19 pandemic{''}. It was concluded that TFs have to claim their
   place within this digitized landscape by finding the balance between old
   and new, between preferences for foods taste passed through generations
   and new life lifestyles at 5G speed.}},

   cytotoxicity. Quinoline derivatives 3f and 3g were identified as potent
   hDHODH inhibitors while 3k and 3l demonstrated high cytotoxic activity
   against MCF-7 and A375 cells and good selectivity. In addition, the
   logD(7.)4 values obtained by the experimental method were found to be in
   the range from -1.15 to 1.69. The chemical structures of all compounds
   were confirmed by IR, NMR and elemental analysis. The compounds

   supported beams. Unlike those, this is a study of continuous beams made
   of SCC aimed to analyze their flexural performance as well as to confirm
   the possibility of using nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) in the
   design of such structural elements. An experimental study of three
   two-span continuous beams of a total length of 3400 mm, with the span
   between supports of 1600 mm, with 150/200 mm cross section made of SCC
   exposed to short-term loading, was carried out. The parameter that
   varied is the percentage of tensile reinforcement, with values of 0.65,
   0.86 and 0.94 being selected. As all analyzed beams have shown a
   satisfactory load-bearing capacity and stiffness, the research confirmed
   the possibility of using SCC in continuous beams in civil engineering
   practice. Using Abaqus/Standard software, a nonlinear numerical model is
   proposed, which is validated and verified against experimental research,
   as there is only a 5\% difference in the numerically calculated ultimate
   load compared to the experimentally measured values.}},

Title = {{Strongly Lensed Supernovae in Well-Studied Galaxy Clusters with the Vera

Journal = {{SYMMETRY-BASEL}},

Abstract = {{Strong lensing by galaxy clusters can be used to significantly expand
   the survey reach, thus allowing observation of magnified high-redshift
   supernovae that otherwise would remain undetected. Strong lensing can
   also provide multiple images of the galaxies that lie behind the
   clusters. Detection of strongly lensed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is
   especially useful because of their standardizable brightness, as they
   can be used to improve either cluster lensing models or independent
   measurements of cosmological parameters. The cosmological parameter, the
   Hubble constant, is of particular interest given the discrepancy
   regarding its value from measurements with different approaches. Here,
   we explore the feasibility of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy
   Survey of Space and Time (LSST) of detecting strongly lensed SNe in the
   field of five galaxy clusters (Abell 1689 and Hubble Frontier Fields
   clusters) that have well-studied lensing models. Considering the 88
   systems composed of 268 individual multiple images in the five cluster
   fields, we find that the LSST will be sensitive to SNe Ia (SNe IIP)
   exploding in 41 (23) galaxy images. The range of redshift of these
   galaxies is between 1.01<z<3.05. During its 10 years of operation, LSST
   is expected to detect 0.2 +/- 0.1 SN Ia and 0.9 +/- 0.3 core collapse
   SNe. However, as LSST will observe many more massive galaxy clusters, it
   is likely that the expectations are higher. We stress the importance of
   having an additional observing program for photometric and spectroscopic
   follow-up of the strongly lensed SNe detected by LSST.}},

Abstract = {{This article is focused on testing the mechanical properties of polymer
   concrete testing samples. After a thorough literature search, the basic
   conditions of the research were determined and under the standards,
   three types of samples of special new concrete mixtures were created as
   a building element for special CNC machines. The samples were subjected
   to the research of the influence of used fillers, binders and additives
   on their properties. Testing was carried out in a certified laboratory
   and included checking the dimensions of the test bodies, weighing on the
   calibrated weight, determining the volumetric weight, determining the
   maximum load of the testing samples using special devices and then
   determining the compressive strength, or flexural tensile strength
   according to the relevant formulas. The final part of the testing also
   examined the morphology and mapping of the chemical composition with a
   focus on carbon, oxygen and aluminum using an electron microscope. The
   obtained results clearly show an increase in tensile and compressive
   strength using dispersed carbon fibre reinforcement of approximately 4
   MPa. The conclusion of the article provides an overall summary of the
   results obtained and a summary of the features. (C) 2020 CPE, University

Abstract = {{Public transport service has been promoted to reduce the problems of
   traffic congestion and environmental impacts due to car dependency.
   Several public transportation modes are available in Bangkok
   Metropolitan Region (BMR) such as buses, heavy rails, vans, boats,
   taxis, and trains while in some areas have fewer modes of public
   transport available. The disparity of public transport service
   negatively impacts social equity. This study aims to identify the gaps
   between public transport supply and demand and to demonstrate introduced
   indicators to assess the public transport performance incorporating
   transport capacity and equilibrium access aspects. Supply index was used
   to evaluate the level of service, and the demand index was applied to
   estimate travel needs. Furthermore, the Lorenz curves and the Gini
   coefficients were used to measure the equity of public transport. The
   results highlight that more than half of the BMR population is living in
   low-supply high-demand areas for public transportation. Moreover, the
   equitable access analysis has identified that the high-income population
   has better access to public transport than the low-income population.
   The results suggest that public transport gaps and equity indicate the
   inclusiveness of public transportation, as well as to the areas where to
   improve the public transport service. Thus, the methodology used in this
   study can be applied to another city or region similar to BMR.}},

Title = {{Mutations of Brca1 gene in a tumor tissue and effectiveness of
   preoperative taxotere therapy in patients with luminal B breast cancer}},
Journal = {{GENE REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Our previous studies have shown that BRCA1 gene deficiency caused by
   changes in the tumor such as low expression, deletion, loss of
   heterozygosity, etc., can be associated with the effectiveness of
   chemotherapy and the disease prognosis. However, even in the absence of
   these factors, the effectiveness of taxotere therapy was variable. This
   may be due to the availability of another BRCA1 gene somatic changes in
   the tumor tissue and their determination will help to define the
   personalize treatment strategy for each breast cancer patient. Here we
   investigated the entire spectrum germline and somatic mutation of coding
   region of the BRCA1 gene in tumor tissue. We obtained that absence of
   BRCA1 somatic mutation was associated with objective response on
   taxotere in the preoperative period. Germline mutations BRCA1: c.4837A >
   G (p.Ser1613Gly), c.999T > C (p.Ser333=), c.3548A > G (p.Lys1183Arg),
   c.3113A > G (p.Glu1038Gly), c.2612C > T (p.Pro871Leu), c.2311T > C
   (p.Leu771=), c.2082C > T (p.Ser694=) were associated with non-objective
   response on neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), furthermore effect of
   chemotherapy was more than 80\% without of these mutations. During
   chemotherapy, 13\% of patients showed the appearance of 5 new BRCA1
   mutations in the tumor and this is associated with a non-objective
   response to NAC by taxotere. Overall, our results suggest that it makes
   sense to take into account not only identified germline mutations, but
   also somatic changes in the BRCA1 gene when appointment taxotere.}},

Abstract = {{This work focuses on subcooled boiling heat transfer during flow in a
   minichannel heat sink with three or five minichannels of 1 mm depth. The
   heated element for FC-72 flowing along the minichannels was a thin foil
   of which temperature on the outer surface was measured due to the
   infrared thermography. The test section was oriented vertically or
   horizontally. A steady state heat transfer process and a laminar,
   incompressible flow of the fluid in a central minichannel were assumed.
   The heat transfer problem was described by the energy equations with an
   appropriate system of boundary conditions. Several mathematical methods
   were applied to solve the heat transfer problem with the Robin condition
   to determine the local heat transfer coefficients at the fluid/heated
   foil interface. Besides the 1D approach as a simple analytical method, a
   more sophisticated 2D approach was proposed with solutions by the
   Trefftz functions and ADINA software. Finite element method (FEM)
   calculations were conducted to find the temperature field in the flowing
   fluid and in the heated wall. The results were illustrated by graphs of
   local heated foil temperature and transfer coefficients as a function of
   the distance from the minichannel inlet. Temperature distributions in
   the heater and the fluid obtained from the FEM computations carried out
   by ADINA software were also shown. Similar values of the heat transfer
   coefficient were obtained in both the FEM calculations and the 1D
   approach. Example boiling curves indicating nucleation hysteresis are
   shown and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Women's patterns of time-use, which proxy the work burdens associated
   with productive and reproductive activities, are an important
   determinant of nutrition and well-being in LMICs. However, there is a
   lack of empirical evidence on how patterns of time-use translate into
   patterns of physical activity and energy expenditure, particularly in
   rural areas where seasonal agricultural labour plays such an important
   role. We address this gap by integrating energy expenditure data derived
   from wearable tri-axial accelerometers with time-use data from
   conventional recall-based surveys. Using datasets from agricultural
   households in four rural communities in India and Nepal, our results
   show that there are significant gender differences in the patterns of
   time-use and energy expenditure. Men and women participate equally in
   productive work, however, women shoulder most of the additional
   reproductive work burdens in rural households at the expense of leisure
   opportunities. Our results provide insights into women's responses to
   opportunities for productive work and highlight the nature of trade-offs
   they face. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: Adolescence represents a critical period for
   rapid psychophysical and socio-cognitive changes, with implications for
   health and wellbeing in later life. From this perspective, the
   manifestation of unhealthy lifestyles and dysfunctional behaviors may
   reflect a change in wellbeing requiring alertness and prompt
   intervention. This study investigated lifestyle behaviors and coping
   strategies among Italian adolescents, also in relation to the ongoing
   COVID-19 pandemic, and whether they would predict a change in subjective
   wellbeing. Materials and Methods: In the period between 1 April and 10
   April 2020, adolescents aged 15-21 filled out an online survey
   consisting of 33 questions investigating socio-demographic
   characteristics, lifestyle behaviors, coping strategies, and subjective
   wellbeing. Results: Data was available on 306 participants. Most
   adolescents planned their daily routine (57.8\%), engaging in structured
   activities (17.6-67.3\%) and developing new interests (54.6\%), and gave
   a positive reading of the ongoing period (57.8\%), thus revealing
   adaptive coping strategies. Family wise, even though it was hard to stay
   at home (66\%) and difficulties emerged, including self-isolation
   (50.7\%) and quarrels (31.7\%), a relevant proportion of adolescents
   shared their feelings (40.5\%) and revaluated their family relationships
   (29.4-39.7\%). In terms of social and school engagement, almost all
   adolescents kept contacts with their partner, friends, and teachers
   (90.2-93.5\%). School commitments at home were sufficiently preserved
   (63.1\%), however adolescents expressed preoccupations about their
   educational path (56.2\%). A change in subjective wellbeing (49.3\%) and
   symptoms of anxiety (39.9\%) were frequently reported. A number of
   factors predicted a change in subjective wellbeing, including adaptive
   coping strategies (physical activity, OR = 2.609, 95\% confidence
   interval (CI) 1.297-5.247; engaging in different activities than before,
   OR = 2.212, 95\% CI 1.157-4.230), family issues (finding hard to stay at
   home, OR = 3.852, 95\% CI 1.953-7.599; having quarrels, OR = 2.158, 95\%
   CI 1.122-4.150), school-related behaviors (fearing a negative
   educational outcome, OR = 1.971, 95\% 1.063-3.655), and female gender
   (OR = 3.647, 95\% CI 1.694-7.851). Conclusions: Both personal and
   environmental coping resources are relevant to subjective wellbeing in
   adolescence and should be taken into account for prevention and early
   intervention in youth mental health.}},

   TO DERRIDA'S ``SENDING{''}}},

Abstract = {{The article deals with the relevance of the concept of representation
   for rethinking the project of modernity and its possible alternatives by
   Heidegger and Derrida. It is pointed out that the concept of
   representation is closely connected with the universalism of modernity
   as it is reputedly provided by metaphysics, since Heidegger's concept of
   ontological difference, e.g., the difference between Being and being
   that has become the token of metaphysics, proves to be an elementary
   model of representation. This makes it possible, in turn, to correlate
   representation as the substitution of one entity for another with
   mediation. In the issue, Heidegger's concept of the history of Being
   turns out to be the description of the sequence of its representations
   that depend on the respective type of mediation. The analysis proceeds
   from Heidegger's concepts of ``clearing{''} (Lichtung) and
   ``appropriating event{''} (Ereignis) that designate man's everyday
   coping with people and things based on habitual skills. It is these
   everyday practices that reveal people and things in ``clearing{''} and
   render the understanding of Being possible. Therefore, the
   ``appropriating event{''}, implying a paradigm or style of revealing
   Being, elucidates Heidegger's idea of the other beginning of thinking.
   The first beginning, having given birth to representation, destined
   metaphysics as the pattern of going from the particular to the general
   for modeling universalism. However, according to Heidegger, the first
   beginning makes possible the other beginning that does not assume
   representation and mediation. In Derrida, the connection of modernity
   with representation is exposed in his critique of the ``metaphysics of
   presence{''} which resulted in specifying representation as a
   ``sending{''} (envoi). Derrida holds the opinion that it is not the
   difference of the origin of a system from the secondary entities, but
   its difference from itself is primordial. It implies that mediation and
   thereby representation prove to be primordial, whereas the immediacy of
   the origin seems impossible. Eventually the limitations of the type of
   universality that is inherent in modernity come into sight, and the
   binary ``logic of identity{''} which was reputedly universal is opposed
   by the ``logic of supplementarity{''}. Thus, the comparative analysis
   juxtaposes Derrida's and Heidegger's modeling of representation, whereas
   their stances on representation and universalism after modernity turn
   out to be antithetical.}},

Abstract = {{Departing from the inquiry if Community-Based Enterprises (CBEs) can
   support the implementation of Community Forest Management (CFM)
   approaches in sustainable use conservation units, the paper delves into
   Community-Based Forest Enterprises (CBFEs) in eight different
   Communities that agreed to be part of the Timber Small-Scale Sustainable
   Management Plan policy (SSSMP), in the Rio Negro Sustainable Development
   Reserve in the Brazilian Amazon. From the perspective of the
   communities, this article explores the factors that influence the
   creation of CBFEs, their viability, and their role in the implementation
   of CFM aiming at sustainable development in the forest in conjunction
   with the SSSMP policy. The analysis is based on the interviews,
   workshops and observation during fieldwork in the Reserve, resulting in
   three inductively deduced aggregate dimensions: community, CBFE and
   state. The findings suggest that these dimensions are interrelated,
   although they affect CBFEs differently regarding the conditions of
   possibility for their establishment in the first place. It is argued
   that considerable attention must be given to the community and their
   incentive structures where the CBFEs are located that directly inform
   the characteristics of the CBFEs themselves, as well as guide how CFM is
   implemented. The findings contribute to CBFE literature and CFM public
   policies in forest reserves. It broadens the discussion to explore the
   interdependent relationship that one has on the other and the benefits
   for livelihood and income generation of the peoples in conservation
   units in the Brazilian Amazon.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) has been
   associated with an increased risk of vertebral fracture. To date, no
   studies have investigated the relationship between DISH and bone
   microstructure assessed by the trabecular bone score (TBS).
   Methods: Cross-sectional study, nested in a prospective population-based
   cohort. All men (968) aged >= 50 years were included. Clinical
   covariates, DISH, TBS, serum bone turnover markers and bone mineral
   density (BMD) were analyzed.
   Results: Mean age of participants was 65 +/- 9 years. 207 (21.6\%) had
   DISH. DISH subjects were older, had higher body mass index (BMI) and
   abdominal perimeter, lower glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and higher
   prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) than non-DISH (NDISH) subjects.
   Bone mineral density at the lumbar spine (LS-BMD) was significantly
   higher in the DISH group. TBS values were 1.317 {[}1.303-1.331] for DISH
   and 1.334 {[}1.327-1.341] for NDISH subjects, after adjusting by age,
   BMI, abdominal perimeter, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
   MetS, GFR, serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), LS and femoral neck BMD (p
   = 0.03). Serum ALP levels were higher in DISH subjects, showing an
   inverse correlation with TBS that remained significant after adjusting
   by age and BMI.
   Conclusions: TBS values were significantly lower in men with DISH
   irrespective of age, BMI and BMD, suggesting that the presence of DISH
   might be related to a worse trabecular microstructure. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Often in the past, the great disasters (environmental calamities,
   earthquakes, epidemics) activated unexpressed energies, triggering
   transformations of the built environment, able to give rise to
   unexpected conditions of economic, cultural and social development. The
   fragility of settlement systems in the face of unexpected threats brings
   out the need for a new planning, changing our gaze on the city.
   The new framework of needs drawn by the pandemic and the renewed
   sensitivity towards the combination of health - sustainability rekindle
   the spotlight on inner areas. These emerged as ``reservoirs of
   resilience{''}, areas to look at, in order to reach an eco-systemic
   balance.
   The aim of the paper is to return an experience of adaptive reuse of the
   Historical Urban Landscape in an inner area of Southern Italy, where the
   needs of health and safety of the community are integrated with the
   transmission of the built heritage to future generations. The goal is
   the promotion of inclusive prosperity scenarios, towards the so-called
   ``new normality{''}.
   Starting from an in-depth literature review on the cases of pandemics in
   history and the strategies implemented, the research identifies health
   security requirements at the scale of the Historic Urban Landscape and
   design solutions aimed at reactivating lost synergies between
   communities and places.}},

Abstract = {{A novel strategy, recently developed by us, to use polyhedral oligomeric
   silsesquioxanes (POSS) as an anti-cancer drug carrier is presented.
   Anthracycline:POSS complexes were prepared by simple co-addition of
   doxorubicin (DOX) or daunorubicin (DAU) with hydrophilic POSS(OH)(32).
   Co-delivery of POSS and anthracyclines led to higher anti-cancer
   activity towards HeLa (cervical cancer endothelial) and MCF-7 (human
   breast adenocarcinoma) cell lines. The obtained supramolecular hybrid
   complexes were characterised by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
   spectroscopy (nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy {[}NOESY] and
   homonuclear correlation spectroscopy {[}COSY]), Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The
   two-dimensional (2D) NOESY spectra of the complexes showed the
   cross-correlation peaks for hydroxyl groups of POSS (similar to 4.3-4.8
   ppm) with OH groups of DOX and DAU. FTIR showed that hydroxyl group of
   POSS can interact with amine and hydroxyl groups of DOX and DAU. The
   viability of HeLa and MCF-7 was analysed with the MTT assay to evaluate
   the cytotoxicity of free DOX and DAU and the relevant complexes with
   POSS at different molar ratios. At a low DOX concentration (2.5 mu M),
   for molar ratios 1:1, 1:4, and 1:8 (POSS:DOX), the complexes showed two
   and three times higher cytotoxicity towards HeLa and MCF-7 cells,
   respectively, than DOX itself after both 24- and 48-h incubation. The 1
   mu M concentration for a 1:4 POSS:DOX molecular ratio and the 2.5 mu M
   concentration for all complexes were more toxic towards MCF-7 cells than
   free DOX after 48-h incubation. In the case of POSS:DAU complexes, there
   was higher toxicity than that of free drug after 48-h incubation. It can
   be concluded that the formation of non-covalent complexes increases
   toxicity of anthracycline drugs towards Hela and MCF-7 cells. The novel
   complexes are inexpensive to prepare and more effective than free drugs
   at low systemic toxicity.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The global honey market has witnessed constant growth over recent
   decades, especially in Asian regions. In recent years, the increase in
   export flows of this product throughout the world has raised the issue
   of the lack of international import standards and regulations, making
   trade susceptible to variables that are not only economic, but also
   social or political. The objective of this study is therefore to
   explore, using the econometric methodology of gravity models, what the
   determinants of the international honey trade are, both economic and
   socio-cultural, and to verify whether a niche market, such as the one
   being examined, is influenced by these covariates, in a similar manner
   to the main commodities of the agri-food sector, or if honey displays a
   unique behavior. The results show that honey market behavior is not
   statistically different from that of the main agri-food products already
   studied and that the cultural distance, introduced as a covariate, does
   not have a significant influence.}},

Journal = {{ENERGIES}},

Abstract = {{The highest challenge of energy efficiency of building stock is
   achieving improved performance in existing buildings and, especially, in
   heritage buildings which per se are characterized by massive limitations
   against the implementation of the most sophisticated solutions for
   energy saving. In Italy, historical buildings represent more than 30\%
   of the building stock and the vast majority require energy retrofit,
   while ensuring the preservation of the heritage value and acceptable
   comfort conditions. In this context, historical buildings must be
   retrofitted and re-functioned by introducing innovative technologies
   aimed at reducing energy consumption and improving human comfort,
   health, and safety. To this aim, this study implements the Historic
   Building Information Modeling (HBIM) approach for the integrated
   modeling, monitoring, management, and maintenance of a novel geothermal
   system involving horizontal ground source heat exchangers (GHEXs)
   coupled to an adsorption heat pump for the energy refurbishment of
   historical buildings. In detail, a rural building part of a medieval
   complex in Perugia, Central Italy, is considered as a pilot case study.
   The analysis stresses the potential of the Facility Management (FM)
   applications of HBIM to provide a tool for the human-centric operational
   management control of the building energy performance and indoor comfort
   when combined with the building monitoring and supervision system.
   Therefore, this integrated HBIM approach may drive the path towards the
   user-centric re-functioning of heritage buildings.}},

Volume = {{76}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Aerobic exercise (AE) demonstrated an overall medium
   treatment effect in anxiety disorders (AD) but there is evidence for an
   ``intensity-response{''} relationship. High intensity interval training
   (HIIT) was highly effective on a range of (mental) health parameters.
   However, so far no randomised-controlled trial (RCT) investigated the
   efficacy of HIIT in AD.
   Methods: 33 patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) were
   randomly assigned to 12-day HIIT or a training of lower intensity (LIT).
   Anxiety, comorbid depression, stress-related bodily symptoms and
   perceived control over anxiety related stimuli (PC) were assessed at
   baseline, post-training and 30 days after baseline by using the Penn
   State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ), the Hamilton Inventories for Anxiety
   and Depression (Ham -A, Ham-D), the Screening for Somatoform Symptoms-7
   (SOMS-7) and the Anxiety Control Questionnaire (ACQR).
   Results: Both interventions showed moderate or large effects on all
   clinical measures. However, effects for HIIT were generally about twice
   as high as for LIT. PC negatively correlated with GAD severity in the
   whole sample at baseline but an association of training-induced changes
   in PC and worrying were exclusively detectable in HIIT.
   Conclusion: HIIT was highly effective and fast acting in GAD. Therefore,
   it may complement first-line treatment approaches in this condition.}},

Title = {{Evaluating the potential for autonomous measurements of net community
   production and calcification as a tool for monitoring coral restoration}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{158}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{As coral restoration efforts increase globally, there is a growing need
   to not only increase post-restoration monitoring, but also advance reef
   restoration monitoring methods. Utilizing autonomous technology to
   compliment manual, SCUBA-based monitoring will diversify the types of
   data available to coral restoration practitioners and aid in determining
   the efficacy of restoration efforts. This study sought to investigate
   how existing reef monitoring technologies can be applied to coral
   restoration to improve monitoring resolution and assess restoration
   progress. The Benthic Ecosystem and Acidification Measurement System,
   which uses the gradient flux approach to measure benthic community
   metabolism, was used to monitor two arrays of nursery grown Acropora
   cervicornis within an offshore coral nursery in the Florida Keys. The
   first deployment monitored corals arranged in a density mimicking
   pre-restoration coral cover, while the second deployment monitored
   corals arranged in a density mimicking a reef site recently restored
   with nursery-grown A. cervicornis. The post-restoration density
   demonstrated a 36\% increase in the observed ratio of net community
   calcification to net community production as compared to the
   pre-restoration density. Additionally, the post-restoration density
   demonstrated net accretion throughout the observation period (20 mmol
   CaCO3 m(-2)d(-1)) as compared to the pre-restoration density which
   experienced net dissolution (-5.0 mmol CaCO3 m(-2)d(-1)). Overall, the
   results of this study are promising indicators that metabolic monitoring
   could one day be widely utilized within the coral restoration field to
   remotely monitor benthic composition changes associated with coral
   restoration progress over time, providing valuable information to
   restoration practitioners, stakeholders, and resource managers.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: Access to knowledge and the ability to absorb it are
   increasingly becoming the decisive factor in the level of development
   and the pace of economic growth. Knowledge transfer is a complex process
   that can have both an internal dimension (between entities within a
   given country) and an international one (between domestic and foreign
   entities). In this context, knowledge flows in the area of science and
   innovation deserve special attention.
   Aim: The main purpose of the article is to present the multidimensional
   nature of knowledge flows and to identify the position of the EU in
   comparison with global competitors in this filed, especially considering
   the global science and innovation context. What are the channels of
   knowledge flow? To what extent does the EU participate in the
   international knowledge flows? What are the EU expectations in this
   area? This article endeavours to answer the questions above.
   Results: The article systematizes information on knowledge flows in
   economy and supplements it with a comparative analysis, which allows for
   better understanding of the international position of the European Union
   in this field. The conclusion states that despite lagging behind the
   United States, European science is becoming increasingly more
   open-access oriented and the EU is still among the leaders of
   international scientific cooperation.}},

   a professional development system to support teachers' use of DBI in
   writing. Data analyzed using a mixed-methods design revealed that
   teachers perceived supports such as coaching as facilitators of DBI
   implementation, whereas access to materials and external factors such as
   time conflicts presented challenges. Teachers made statistically
   significant growth from pretest to posttest on a measure of DBI
   knowledge and skills, implemented DBI components with fidelity, and
   reported that time spent on DBI activities decreased each week,
   supporting its usability and feasibility. Findings suggest that DBI is
   usable and feasible when teachers are provided ongoing professional

Journal = {{RADIOLOGY AND ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{54}},

Pages = {{505-512}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction. The purpose of the study was to compare the results of
   gamma value based film analysis according to the used type of
   self-developer film and software product.
   Material and methods. The films were irradiated with different treatment
   techniques such as 3D conformal and intensity modulated radiotherapy
   with static and rotational delivery. Stereotactic plans with conformal
   and intensity modulated arc techniques, using coplanar and non-coplanar
   beam setup were also evaluated. The data of irradiated film were
   compared with the planned planar dose distribution exported from the
   treatment planning system. Three film analysis software programs were
   evaluated: PTW Mephysto (PTW), FilmQA Pro (FQP) and radiohromic.com
   (RC). Both EBT2 and EBT3 types of films were examined. The comparisons
   of dose distributions were performed with gamma analysis using 10\%
   cut-off level.
   Results. The results of the gamma analysis for larger fields were
   between 78.3\% and 98.3\%, 75.7\% and 100\%, 80.2\% and 98.8\% with PTW,
   FQP and RC, respectively. The results of evaluation in case of
   stereotactic measurements were 76.8\%-99.2\% for PTW, 95.7\%-100\% for
   FQP and 91.2\%-99.9\% for RC.
   Conclusions. All the three software programs are suitable for
   calibrating and evaluating films, performing gamma analysis, and can be
   used for patient specific quality assurance measurements. There is no
   direct connection between gamma passing rate and absolute accuracy or
   software quality, it is just a feature of the software. The
   interpretation of own results has to be defined on an institutional
   level according to given workflow and preliminary results.}},

Title = {{DNA analysis reveals non-falciparum malaria in the Democratic Republic
   of the Congo}},
Journal = {{ACTA TROPICA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{212}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) attributes the entirety
   of malaria infection and transmission in the Democratic Republic of the
   Congo (DRC) to Plasmodium falciparum, one of the several species of
   malaria known to infect humans. Recent studies have put forth some
   evidence that transmission of Plasmodium vivax may also be occurring in
   the DRC. As interventions and treatments differ between malaria species,
   it is crucial to maintain the most accurate understanding of malaria
   species diversity in each region.
   Methods: Blood samples were taken from aymptomatic children 0-5 years
   old living in three regions of the DRC in 2014. For this study, samples
   were taken from a larger pool of samples, collected as part of a
   population-based survey in three regions. Plasmodium infection was
   screened for using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and
   species were confirmed by cloning and DNA sequencing.
   Results: Of 336 samples screened by PCR, 62.2\% (n=209) initially tested
   positive for P. falciparum and 14.6\% (n=49) initially tested positive
   for P. vivax. Sanger sequencing was performed on PCR-positive Plasmodium
   samples to confirm identity of Plasmodium species. Sequencing showed
   Plasmodium malariae in one blood sample and Plasmodium ovale in another
   sample. Plasmodium vivax was detected in 12/65 cases (18.5\%). Overall,
   14/65 sequenced cases (21.5\%) were infected with a non-falciparum
   malaria. 330bp 18s P. vivax DNA sequences were obtained.
   Conclusions: This study reveals Plasmodium vivax and other
   non-falciparum malaria across several regions of the DRC, and enforces
   the importance of further testing and more precise diagnostics when
   testing for and treating malaria in the DRC. Here, we find a higher
   proportion of cases of P. vivax malaria than found in previous studies.
   This is the most robust DNA sequencing of Plasmodium vivax in the DRC to
   date.}},

Abstract = {{A laser optoacoustic method for quantitative assessment of the
   volumetric porosity of cast dispersion- strengthened metal-matrix
   composite materials has been proposed and experimentally implemented.
   The method is based on a statistical analysis of the distribution of
   amplitudes of backscattered broadband pulses of longitudinal acoustic
   waves in the tested materials. Laser excitation and piezoelectric
   recording of ultrasound is implemented with one-way access to the test
   object using a special laser-ultrasonic transducer. Silumin-based
   composites reinforced with silicon carbide microparticles in various
   volume concentrations (0.033-0.135) and composites obtained by reaction
   injection moulding based on aluminum reinforced with intermetallic Al3Ti
   (volume concentration 0.04-0.115) have been studied. For both types of
   composites, the distribution of amplitudes of backscattered ultrasonic
   signals is approximated by a Gaussian distribution function applicable
   for a large number of statistically independent quantities. The
   empirically obtained dependence of the half-width of this distribution
   on the volumetric porosity of composites of two different types is
   approximated by the same linear function regardless of the manufacturing
   technology, as well as of the type, size, and concentration of
   strengthening particles.}},

Title = {{Adaptive spectral band integration in flash thermography: Enhanced
   defect detectability and quantification in composites}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{202}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{In flash thermography, the maximum inspectable defect depth is limited
   when only the raw thermographic sequence is analyzed. The introduction
   of pulsed phase thermography (PPT), in which phase (contrast) images at
   different thermal wave frequencies are obtained, significantly improved
   the maximum inspectable depth while reducing the effects of non-uniform
   heating and non-uniform surface properties. However, in a practical
   environment, the evaluation of many phase images per inspection is a
   cumbersome procedure.
   In this paper, a novel Adaptive Spectral Band Integration (ASBI)
   procedure is introduced for the post-processing of flash thermographic
   datasets, which yields a unique damage index map. ASBI integrates the
   most useful spectral information for each pixel individually, obtaining
   a maximized defect detectability and an almost zero-reference level. The
   performance of ASBI with respect to defect detectability as well as
   defect sizing and depth inversion is evaluated thoroughly with both
   experimentally and numerically generated datasets. The ASBI procedure is
   successfully applied on various composite coupons with flat bottom holes
   and barely visible impact damage, as well as on a stiffened aircraft
   composite panel with a complex cluster of production defects. The ASBI
   procedure is compared with existing data-processing techniques in
   literature, illustrating an enhanced performance.}},

Abstract = {{With the COVID-19 pandemic, the wearing of face masks covering mouth and
   nose has become ubiquitous all around the world. This study investigates
   the impact of typical face masks on voice radiation. To analyze the
   transmission loss caused by masks and the influence of masks on
   directivity, this study measured the full-spherical voice directivity of
   a dummy head with a mouth simulator covered with six masks of different
   types, i.e., medical masks, filtering facepiece respirator masks, and
   cloth face coverings. The results show a significant frequency-dependent
   transmission loss, which varies depending on the mask, especially above
   2kHz. Furthermore, the two facepiece respirator masks also significantly
   affect speech directivity, as determined by the directivity index (DI).
   Compared to the measurements without a mask, the DI deviates by up to
   7dB at frequencies above 3kHz. For all other masks, the deviations are
   below 2dB in all third-octave frequency bands.}},

Journal = {{PLANTS-BASEL}},

Abstract = {{Climate change, with its attendant negative effects, is expected to
   hamper agricultural production in the coming years. To counteract these
   negative effects, breeding of environmentally resilient plants via
   conventional means and genetic engineering is necessary. Stress defense
   genes are valuable tools by which this can be achieved. Here we report
   the successful cloning and functional characterization of a melon
   Y3SK2-type dehydrin gene, designated as CmLEA-S. We generated CmLEA-S
   overexpressing transgenic tobacco lines and performed in vitro and in
   vivo drought and salt stress analyses. Seeds of transgenic tobacco
   plants grown on 10\% polyethylene glycol (PEG) showed significantly
   higher germination rates relative to wild-type seeds. In the same way,
   transgenic seeds grown on 150 mM sodium chloride (NaCl) recorded
   significantly higher germination percentages compared with wild-type
   plants. The fresh weights and root lengths of young transgenic plants
   subjected to drought stress were significantly higher than that of
   wild-type plants. Similarly, the fresh weights and root lengths of
   transgenic seedlings subjected to salt stress treatments were also
   significantly higher than wild-type plants. Moreover, transgenic plants
   subjected to drought and salt stresses in vivo showed fewer signs of
   wilting and chlorosis, respectively. Biochemical assays revealed that
   transgenic plants accumulated more proline and less malondialdehyde
   (MDA) compared with wild-type plants under both drought and salt stress
   conditions. Finally, the enzymatic activities of ascorbate peroxidase
   (APX) and catalase (CAT) were enhanced in drought- and salt-stressed
   transgenic lines. These results suggest that the CmLEA-S gene could be
   used as a potential candidate gene for crop improvement.}},

   The measurement methodology was based on outlining an imaginary ISO cube
   placed in the robot's workspace, in which the robot's tool centre point
   (TCP) attained five measurement points in thirty measurement cycles. A
   video camera and six linear incremental sensors with six evaluation
   units were used for the measurement. The measured values are presented

Title = {{Grit and conscientiousness: Another jangle fallacy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN PERSONALITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{89}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{When grit was first introduced, it gained popularity before basic
   psychometric questions were fully explored. One critical issue is how
   distinct grit is from the Big Five personality trait conscientiousness.
   Most studies have examined correlations between grit and
   conscientiousness, rather than conducting item-level factor analysis.
   This study examined the extent to which grit and conscientiousness are
   empirically distinct, and which predict students' grades. A diverse
   sample of adolescents completed measures of grit and conscientiousness.
   MIRT-based confirmatory factor analyses showed that grit and
   conscientiousness' factor structures strongly overlap. Structural
   equation modeling showed that conscientiousness and the perseverance of
   effort component of grit predicted students' grades more strongly than
   consistency of interest. These findings indicate that grit and
   conscientiousness are not unique constructs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The calculation of errors of the main elements of algorithms in the
   operation of a strapdown inertial navigation system on moving objects is
   undertaken. Four coordinate systems have been treated, in which the
   necessary equations for the projections of vectors on the axis of
   coordinate systems have been obtained for their further use in the
   construction of system algorithms. The transition matrices for different
   coordinate systems are compiled, and the dependences of these systems on
   each other are obtained. When determining the speed of a moving object,
   the equations of the orientation errors of the object have been
   compiled. Errors in the operational algorithms of a strapdown inertial
   navigation system have been simulated, which consist of errors in
   determining the speeds, coordinates, and orientation of an object. A
   structural diagram of the navigation system is compiled demonstrating
   the formation of errors. It is shown that the errors considered depend
   on the accuracy of the sensitive elements-gyroscopes and accelerometers.
   A relationship between the specified accuracy of the navigation system
   and the requirements for the accuracy of sensitive elements is revealed.}},

   Data on 159 patients' PCCs (performed from 1 January 2012 to 6 June 2017
   in three centres) were assessed: median (IQR) age was 66 (58-71) years,
   47 (30\%) were female. Mesothelioma was the most common primary
   malignancy (57\%). The median (IQR) time from cancer diagnosis to PCC
   assessment was 13.3 (6.2-23.2) months; PCC to follow-up was 9 (8-25)
   days; and survival after PCC was 1.3 (0.6-2.8) months. The mean (SD) for
   `average pain' using a numerical rating scale was 6 (2) before PCC and 2
   (2) at follow-up, and for `worst pain' 9 (1) and 3 (3), respectively.
   The median (IQR) reduction in strong opioid dose at follow-up was 50\%
   (34-50). With the exception of `activity', all health-related quality of
   life scores (5-level version of EuroQol-5 Dimension) either improved or
   were stable after PCC. Six patients (4\%) had PCC-related adverse
   events.
   Conclusions
   PCC is an effective treatment for cancer pain; however, findings in this
   study suggest PCC referrals tended to be late in patients' disease
   trajectories. Further study into earlier treatment and seeking
   international consensus on PCC outcomes will further enhance
   opportunities to improve patient care.}},

Abstract = {{Approaching mental health on a global scale with particular reference to
   low- and mid-income countries raises issues concerning the disregard of
   the local context and values and the imposition of values characteristic
   of the Global North. Seeking a philosophical viewpoint to surmount these
   problems, the present paper argues for a value-laden framework for
   psychiatry with the specific incorporation of value pluralism,
   particularly in relation to the Global South context, while also
   emphasizing personal values such as the choice of treatment. In
   sketching out this framework, the paper aims to overcome the clash
   between universalism and relativism about psychiatric categories by
   focusing on how overlaps between cultures can contribute to
   ontology-building. A case study analyzing ethnopsychiatric research in
   the context of South India will illustrate the proposed view, while also
   pointing out avenues for further research on the causal efficacy of
   local shared beliefs about mental disorder. If approaches across
   different traditions and theoretical frames are shown to work in
   treating similar ailments, causal connections appear to cut across the
   different ontologies. Ethnopsychiatry would play a central role in such
   research, namely in disclosing the variables and mechanisms at work
   within the local approaches.}},

Abstract = {{R\&D collaborations between industry, government, civil society, and
   research (also known as `quadruple helix collaborations' (QHCs)) have
   recently gained attention from R\&D theorists and practitioners. In
   aiming to come to grips with their complexity, past models have
   generally taken a stakeholder-analytical approach based on stakeholder
   types. Yet stakeholder types are difficult to operationalise. We
   therefore argue that a processual model is more suited for studying the
   interaction in QHCs because it eschews matters of titles and identities.
   We develop such a model in which the QHC is represented as a process of
   generating four types of value: research value, market value, political
   value, and societal value. We then apply this processual model in
   analysing real-life cases of friction in QHCs. Friction is seen, not as
   an interpersonal clash, but as a discrepancy between two or more
   value-creation processes that compete for limited resources (some
   over-performing while others under-performing).}},

Abstract = {{Vaccines are fundamental instruments upon which all modern medicine is
   hinged. This has recently come into the light because of the COVID-19

   2017 and 2019, was used. We evaluated the responses from 1647
   individuals (61\% female, with a median age of 37 years, mostly from
   urban settings). Most respondents (85\%) had children and were in favor
   of vaccination. Our study underlines the role that family physicians
   have in the education and information of citizens. A small, but
   considerable, number of respondents (108, 7.84\% of those with children)
   had not vaccinated their children according to the national vaccination
   scheme. Deterrents were considered to be lack of information and fear of
   side effects. However, 167 of our respondents (12.12\% out of 1377
   respondents with children) said that their child experienced adverse
   events-most of which were mild local reactions. Alternatives to
   vaccination were proposed by some. In this study, we highlight the

Title = {{The CCL2/CCL7/CCL12/CCR2 pathway is substantially and persistently

   complement system in microglia}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR PROBES}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death in the global
   population. Disturbed inflammatory processes after TBI exacerbate
   secondary brain injury and contribute to unfavorable outcomes. Multiple
   inflammatory events that accompany brain trauma, such as glial
   activation, chemokine release, or the initiation of the complement
   system cascade, have been identified as potential targets for TBI
   treatment. However, the participation of chemokines in the complement
   activation remains unknown. Our studies sought to determine the changes
   in the expression of the molecules involved in the CCL2/CCL7/CCL12/CCR2
   pathway in the injured brain and the effect of CCL2, CCL7, and CCL12
   (10, 100, and 500 ng/mL) on the classic and lectin complement pathways
   and inflammatory factors in microglial cell cultures. Brain injury in
   mice was modeled by controlled cortical impact (CCI). Our findings
   indicate a time-dependent upregulation of CCL2, CCL7, and CCL12 at the
   mRNA and protein levels within the cortex, striatum, and/or thalamus
   beginning 24 h after the trauma. The analysis of the expression of the
   receptor of the tested chemokines, CCR2, revealed its substantial
   upregulation within the injured brain areas mainly on the mRNA level.
   Using primary cortical microglial cell cultures, we observed a
   substantial increase in the expression of CCL2, CCL7, and CCL12 after 24
   h of LPS (100 ng/mL) treatment. CCL2 stimulation of microglia increased
   the level of IL-1 beta mRNA but did not influence the expression of
   IL-18, IL-6, and IL-10. Moreover, CCL2 significantly increased the
   expression of Iba1, a marker of microglia activation. CCL2 and CCL12
   upregulated the expression of C1qa but did not influence the expression
   of C1ra and C1s1 (classical pathway); moreover, CCL2 increased ficolin A
   expression and reduced collectin 11 expression (lectin pathway).
   Additionally, we observed the downregulation of pentraxin 3, a modulator
   of the complement cascade, after CCL2 and CCL12 treatment. We did not
   detect the expression of ficolin B, Mbl1, and Mbl2 in microglial cells.
   Our data identify CCL2 as a modulator of the classical and lectin
   complement pathways suggesting that CCL2 may be a promising target for
   pharmacological intervention after brain injury. Moreover, our study
   provides evidence that CCL2 and two other CCR2 ligands may play a role
   in the development of changes in TBI.}},

Abstract = {{National parks in mountain areas are biodiversity hotspots in which
   implementing the sustainability goals of Agenda 2030 is particularly
   urgent. Ecotourism provides an opportunity to convey bio-ecological and
   economic sustainability principles to the public, focusing on nature
   conservation and a reduction of the negative impacts of tourism. We
   investigated four national parks in the Apennines, Italy using the
   insights of hiking guides with park accreditation to assess
   sustainability issues. Multivariate analyses of questionnaires revealed
   that most of the interviewed hiking guides across the Apennines were
   sensitive toward the theme of sustainability. Limiting the ecological
   footprint of tourism was identified as the main challenge. Interesting
   feedback on management issues was given by hiking guides, indicating
   innovations such as food, waste-disposal management, accommodation, and
   transport as critical areas with the potential to impact sustainable
   development. Certification schemes were also recognized as an important
   tool with which to encourage ecologically responsible tourism. Hiking
   guides themselves revealed an interest in improving national parks'
   scientific communication and the provision of lifelong learning
   initiatives regarding old -growth forests and nature conservation.
   Overall, the research highlights the key role of hiking guides as an
   effective means of conveying conservation messaging to ecotourists,
   while also encouraging sustainable development and the adoption of
   agro-environmental measures on the part of local communities. Hiking
   guides could, therefore, contribute toward both improving cultural
   awareness of conservation issues and encouraging local, low -impact
   economic practices.}},

Abstract = {{ZnO-based ceramic varistors have shown excellent electrical and
   dielectric properties due to their characteristics microstructures
   represented by the arrangement of their grains and grain boundaries that
   allow the absorption and flow of energy when subjected to an electrical
   surge. Their properties and characteristics depend on their chemical
   compositions and processing routes. Typical processing routes involve
   several stages of grinding and precalcination-which are time consuming
   processes. Because of this, this study proposes a simpler and cheaper
   alternative route for processing ceramic varistors. The alternative
   process proposed is the mixing of the precursor oxides by means of a
   hydrothermal treatment. The characteristics and properties of the
   synthesized ceramic varistors were evaluated by means of scanning
   electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and impedance spectroscopy,
   considering the effect of the addition of rare earth oxides (La2O3, CeO2
   and Nd2O3). The results showed that the mixing of the oxides through
   hydrothermal treatment produces ceramic varistors with characteristics
   and properties similar to those obtained by other processing routes.
   Furthermore, it was observed that the addition of rare earth oxides
   affects the characteristics and properties of the ceramic varistor
   depending on the type of rare earth oxide added, its concentration and
   ionic radius.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most frequently utilized liquid crystalline (LC) materials is
   a rod-like (calamitic) compound 4-cyano-4 `-pentylbiphenyl (5-CB). The
   main objective of this work is to enhance its functionality by
   introducing a photoresponsive diazenyl spacer in the aromatic core and
   replace the non-chiral pentyl chain with various chiral alkyl
   carboxylate units. The mesomorphic properties of the prepared materials
   have been studied using polarizing optical microscopy and differential
   scanning calorimetry. It has been found that materials with an extended
   aromatic system possess the liquid crystalline behavior. The studied LC
   materials have shown mesophases at lower temperatures than previously
   reported analogous substances. Furthermore, one of them exhibits a
   chiral orthogonal frustrated twist grain boundary smectic phase, which
   has not been previously observed for this structural type of materials.
   We also investigated photoresponse of the mesophases under illumination
   with UV-light (365 nm) using a polarizing optical microscope. A
   non-conventional photoresponse of the prepared materials in a
   crystalline phase is presented and discussed.}},

Title = {{Chemosensory perception and food preferences in colorectal cancer
   patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL NUTRITION ESPEN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{40}},
Pages = {{242-251}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background and aim: Cancer is one of the major public health problems,
   with colorectal cancer being one of the most occurring types of cancer.
   During treatment, patients may experience changes in their dietary
   intake due to side-effects of treatment, like changes in chemosensory
   perception, i.e. smell and taste function. This study investigated
   alterations in chemosensory perception and food preferences in
   colorectal cancer patients during and after adjuvant chemotherapy.
   Methods: Objective olfactory and gustatory function were measured by the
   Sniffin' Sticks and the Taste Strips test. Subjective smell and taste
   perception were determined with a questionnaire, while food preferences
   were assessed with a computer-based ranking task. To investigate changes
   during chemotherapy, patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy were
   measured before the start, halfway through (approximately 3 months after
   the start of adjuvant chemotherapy), and within one month after
   finishing chemotherapy (longitudinal measurements, n = 15 patients). As
   a comparison group, colorectal cancer patients not undergoing
   chemotherapy (n = 20), underwent the same measurements at similar time
   points. To measure changes after treatment, chemosensory perception and
   food preferences of patients who had undergone chemotherapy treatment
   were measured once, either at 6, 12 or 24 months after diagnosis
   (cross-sectional measurements; n = 20 for all time points). Changes
   during treatment were assessed using linear mixed model analyses, and
   changes after treatment were assessed with a one-way ANOVA or a Kruskal
   Wallis test.
   Results: Objective olfactory and gustatory function did not differ
   statistically significantly between any of the groups and at any time
   point during or after treatment (all p > 0.05). In contrast, subjective
   smell (F(1,84) = 8.17, p = 0.005) and taste (F(1,99) = 4.08, p = 0.046)
   perception were rated statistically significantly lower by patients
   undergoing chemotherapy than the comparison group during treatment. At 6
   months after diagnosis, patients who underwent chemotherapy rated their
   subjective taste perception significantly lower than patients at 12 and
   24 months after treatment (F(2,57) = 12.05, p = 0.002). Food preferences
   did not change during treatment, or thereafter (all p > 0.05).
   Preference for protein-rich foods was positively correlated with
   objective gustatory function (r = 0.36, p < 0.001), while the preference
   for low-energy foods showed a negative correlation with objective
   gustatory function (r = -0.28, p = 0.004).
   Conclusions: Similar to other cancer patient populations, mainly
   subjective smell and taste perception are affected in colorectal cancer
   patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy. Changes in objective
   olfactory and gustatory function in relation to chemotherapy were not
   detected by the tests used in our study nor did food preferences change.
   However, it should be noted that subjective changes in smell and taste
   perception can affect subsequent flavor perception and food enjoyment,
   which might negatively impact eating behavior and nutritional intake.

Abstract = {{Understanding and measuring parameters responsible for the pathogenesis
   of sepsis-induced AKI (SI-AKI) is critical in developing therapies.
   Blood flow to the kidney is heterogeneous, partly due to the existence
   of dynamic networks of capillaries in various regions, responding
   differentially to oxygen demand in cortex versus medulla. High energy
   demand regions, especially the outer medulla, are susceptible to hypoxia
   and subject to damage during SI-AKI. Proximal tubule epithelial cells in
   the cortex and the outer medulla can also undergo metabolic
   reprogramming during SI-AKI to maintain basal physiological status and
   to avoid potential damage. Current data on the assessment of renal
   hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism during sepsis is limited. Preclinical
   and clinical studies show changes in renal hemodynamics associated with
   SI-AKI, and in clinical settings, interventions to manage renal
   hemodynamics seem to help improve disease outcomes in some cases. Lack
   of proper tools to assess temporospatial changes in peritubular blood
   flow and tissue oxygen metabolism is a barrier to our ability to
   understand microcirculatory dynamics and oxygen consumption and their
   role in the pathogenesis of SI-AKI. Current tools to assess renal
   oxygenation are limited in their usability as these cannot perform
   continuous simultaneous measurement of renal hemodynamics and oxygen
   metabolism. Multi-parametric photo-acoustic microscopy (PAM) is a new
   tool that can measure real-time changes in microhemodynamics and oxygen
   metabolism. Use of multi-parametric PAM in combination with advanced
   intravital imaging techniques has the potential to understand the
   contribution of microhemodynamic and tissue oxygenation alterations to
   SI-AKI.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a method to estimate unconditional quantile
   treatment effects (QTEs) given one or more treatment variables, which
   may be discrete or continuous, even when it is necessary to condition on
   covariates. The estimator, generalized quantile regression (GQR), is
   developed in an instrumental variable framework for generality to permit
   estimation of unconditional QTEs for endogenous policy variables, but it
   is also applicable in the conditionally exogenous case. The framework
   includes simultaneous equations models with nonadditive disturbances,
   which are functions of both unobserved and observed factors. Quantile
   regression and instrumental variable quantile regression are special
   cases of GQR and available in this framework.}},

Abstract = {{The literature describes a close correlation between metabolic disorders
   and abnormal immune responses, like low-grade inflammation (LGI), which
   may be one mechanistic link between obesity and various comorbidities,
   including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In our study, we
   investigated the influence of dietary composition on obesity-derived LGI
   in the liver. We used a dietary induced obesity mouse model of C57BL/6J
   mice fed with high fat diet (HFD, 60\% fat, 20\% protein, 20\%
   carbohydrates) and two different controls. One was rich in carbohydrates
   (10\% fat, 20\% protein, 70\% carbohydrates), further referred to as the
   control diet (CD), and the other one is referred to as the standard diet
   (SD), with a more balanced macronutrient content (9\% fat, 33\% protein,
   58\% carbohydrates). Our results showed a significant increased NAFLD
   activity score in HFD compared to both controls, but livers of the CD
   group also differed in their macroscopic appearance from healthy livers.
   Hepatic fat content showed significantly elevated cholesterol
   concentrations in the CD group. Histologic analysis of the cellular
   immune response in the liver showed no difference between HFD and CD and
   expression analysis of immunologic mediators like interleukin (IL)-1
   beta, IL-6, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor alpha also point towards a
   pro-inflammatory response to CD, comparable to LGI in HFD. Therefore,
   when studying diet-induced obesity with a focus on inflammatory
   processes, we encourage researchers to carefully select controls and not
   use a control diet disproportionally rich in carbohydrates.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Penile Prosthetic Surgery is already well characterized but
   the problems connected with possible complications still need to be
   evaluated and discussed.
   Material and Methods: The Authors revaluated their experience in Penile
   Prosthetic Surgery involving 577 patients (18 - 86 years, mean age 513
   years) operated by the same surgeon since 1984. We implanted 199
   silicone-semirigid (Small Carrion, Implantal, Eurogest, Subrini, SSDA
   GS), 200 malleable (Jonas, Omniphase, Duraphase, AMS600, MentorColoplast
   Genesis, Vedise) and 178 inflatable (Mentor: Mark II, Alpha I, Titan
   OTR; AMS: mono-component Hydroftex, Dynaflex; bi-component Ambicor;
   multi-component: 700 Ultrex, 700 CX, 700 LGX) prostheses. Operative,
   postoperative, infectious and malfunctioning complications have been
   recorded. A total of 156 patients drop out at follow-up and we may not
   exclude possible late complications treated at different hospitals.
   Results: The recorded complications and the therapeutic modalities
   utilized to treat them are examined. Operative complications were
   recorded in 2 malleable prostheses (MPP) and in one inflatable
   prosthesis (IPP). Postoperative complications have been recorded in
   three cases of MPP (1.5\%) and in 9 IPP (5.0\%) and were strictly
   connected to general medical comorbidities as diabetes mellitus (DM),
   coronary artery dysfunction (CAD), and Peyronie's disease (PD). In three
   cases of IPP implantation, hematomas were related to the blunt surgical
   maneuvers utilized to insert the reservoir or the scrotal pumps.
   Infectious complications were mostly observed in patients with DM: 4
   patients with MPP (1.0\%) and 15 patients with IPP (8.4\%). Malfunction
   rate of the prostheses in our series was really disappointing
   considering that 13/17 cases (77\%) of mono-component IPP broke while in
   patients with multicomponent IPP the percentage of malfunction has been
   of 13/161 (8\%) and malfunction was observed in only one case of MPP. We
   were forced to explant the prostheses in 2 patients with MPP (0.5\%) and
   40 with IPP (22\%). However, after excluding 17 mono-component IPPs, the
   percentage of explants of multicomponent IPP (23 patients, 4.2\%) is in
   line with other significative experiences.
   Conclusion: The number of complications of PPS are similar to those
   reported by well qualified urological institutions. In our experience a
   scrupulous antibiotic therapeutic schedule, avoiding direct contact
   between the prostheses and the patient's skin, reduced time of surgery
   with surgeon's experience positively influenced the results. In a
   limited number of patients medical treatment or minimal surgical acts
   allowed to solve the complications preserving the prostheses and
   avoiding the prosthetic explant.}},

   Improvement of Direct Torque Controlled IM Drive}},

Abstract = {{The efficiency of an electric vehicle (EV) drivetrain is one of the
   factors that determine the driving range of the vehicle. During the
   driving condition, the efficiency can be increased by choosing an
   optimum value of reference flux linkage in the used control strategy.
   Presently, the optimum values of reference flux linkage are determined
   either by search or lookup table-based approach. However, these methods
   suffer from the convergence issues at optimum value, complex
   calculations, and large memory space. Hence, to eliminate the issues
   mentioned earlier in efficiency improvement techniques, an approach to
   determine the optimum values of the reference flux linkage based on
   current minimization for the desired operating conditions is proposed in
   this article. The drivetrain efficiency obtained experimentally using
   the proposed reference flux linkage selection method is compared with
   other methods. Using the proposed reference flux linkage method, the
   dynamic, field-weakening response and drive-cycle speed-tracking
   performance of the drivetrain configuration are examined using
   experiments. Furthermore, the input energy consumption of the drive
   cycles is also compared. The obtained experimental results confirm the
   feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method to select the
   optimum value of the reference flux linkage in the drivetrain control
   strategy for the desired operating conditions.}},

Title = {{Biochemical and functional responses of stream invertebrate shredders to
   post-wildfire contamination}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{267}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Forests in Mediterranean Europe including Portugal are highly
   susceptible to wildfires. Freshwaters are often exposed to post-wildfire
   contamination that contains several toxic substances, which may impose
   risk to freshwater organisms and ecosystem functions. However, knowledge
   on the impacts of postwildfire runoffs from different origins on
   freshwater biota is scarce. In forest streams, invertebrate shredders
   have a major contribution to aquatic detrital-based food webs, by
   translocating energy and nutrients from plant-litter to higher trophic
   levels. We investigated the leaf consumption behaviour and the responses
   of oxidative and neuronal stress enzymatic biomarkers in the freshwater
   invertebrate shredder Allogamus ligonifer after short-term exposure (96
   h) to post-wildfire runoff samples from Pinus and Eucalyptus plantation
   forests and stream water from a burnt catchment in Portugal. Chemical
   analyses indicated the presence of various metals and PAHs at
   considerable concentrations in all samples, although the levels were
   higher in the runoff samples from forests than in the stream water. The
   shredding activity was severely inhibited by exposure to increased
   concentrations of post-wildfire runoff samples from both forests. The
   dose-response patterns of enzymatic biomarkers suggest oxidative and
   neuronal stress in the shredders upon exposure to increasing
   concentrations of post-wildfire runoffs. The impacts were more
   pronounced for the runoffs from the burnt forests. Moreover, the
   response patterns suggest that the energy from the feeding activity of
   shredders might have contributed to alleviate the stress in A.
   ligonifer. Overall, the outcomes suggest that the post-wildfire
   contamination can induce sublethal effects on invertebrate shredders
   with impacts on key ecological processes in streams. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Title = {{Lithium recovery from salt-lake brine: Impact of competing cations,
   pretreatment and preconcentration}},
Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{260}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The global demand of lithium is rising steadily, and many industrially
   advanced countries may find it hard to secure an uninterrupted supply of
   lithium for meeting their manufacturing demands. Thus, innovative
   processes for lithium recovery from a wide range of natural reserves
   should be explored for meeting the future demands. In this study, a
   novel integrated approach was investigated by combining nanofiltration
   (NF), membrane distillation (MD) and precipitation processes for lithium
   recovery from salt-lake brines. Initially, the brine was filtered with
   an NF membrane for the separation of lithium ions (Li+) from competing
   ions such as Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+. The extent of permeation of metal
   ions by the NF membrane was governed by their hydrated ionic radii.
   Rejection by NF membrane was 42\% for Li, 48\% for Na and 61\% for K,
   while both the divalent cations were effectively rejected (above 90\%).
   Importantly, in the NF-permeate, Mg2+/Li+ mass ratio reduced to less
   than 6 (suggested for lithium recovery). The result showed that MD can
   enrich lithium with a concentration of 2.5 for raw brine and 5 for
   NF-treated brine. Following the enrichment of NF-permeate by the MD
   membrane, a two-stage precipitation method was used for the recovery of
   lithium. X-ray diffraction confirmed the precipitation of lithium as
   well as the formation of lithium carbonate crystals. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Chronic hyperglycemia results in the formation of advanced glycation
   end-products (AGEs) and triggers amyloid fibril formation. Molecules
   designed to inhibit amyloid fibrils function by eliminating toxic
   oligomers or reducing fibril formation. Here, the bioactivity of
   polyphenols in redirecting the self-assembly of amyloid fibrils was
   reported through microscopic, spectroscopic and molecular docking
   studies. Our findings illustrate that glycation causes BSA to
   self-assemble into amyloid fibrils. 17 Lys residues had modified to
   carboxy methyl lysine (CML) but only Lys523 was probable of modifying
   into carboxy ethyl lysine (CEL). In contrast, only 6 Arg residues are
   identified to be modified to Argpyrimidine (Arg-p). A simple polyphenol
   baicalein (BLN) redirect the self-assembly of amyloid fibrils into
   off-pathway hybrid nanostructures. Circular dichroism spectroscopic
   studies suggested that in the presence of BLN helical conformation was
   favored. Molecular modeling studies suggested that hydrogen bonding and
   hydrophobic interaction of polyphenols preferentially at crucial
   amyloidogenic regions can hinder amyloid fibrillation (Phe133, Lys136,
   Tyr137, Ile141, Tyr160 and Arg185). Mass spectrometric results
   illustrated that the presence of a simple polyphenol BLN several
   residues are unmodified to CML, CEL or Arg-p. Together, our findings
   suggest that polyphenols could have a protective effect and the
   redirection can help alleviate the amyloid fibril formation. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{The paper focuses the applicability of political cycles theories in
   specific circumstances of economies in transition which are at the same
   time the new democracies. Economic and political transition in these
   countries change both people's and politicians' preferences,
   institutions and generate specific politically motivated misuse of
   economic policymaking. Theories of political cycles in macroeconomics
   have been developed since 1970s, when the fact that policymakers could
   use economic policy as an efficient tool for increasing their chances
   for reelection became obvious. In countries with parliamentary
   democracies, incentives of policymakers to influence election results
   could be opportunistically motivated (opportunistic models) or
   ideologically motivated (partisan models). On the other side, voters
   could be naive or rational, with different economic outcomes, as argued
   in extensive political cycles literature. The paper studies specific
   political motives of politicians in transition economies which are
   faced, especially in first fazes of transition with weak institutional
   mechanism and rules, and naive voters. Consequently, opportunistic
   motives dominate ideological ones. The paper also focuses how the
   development of the institutional environment, especially in the context
   of international integration, such as accession to the European Union,
   reflects on the political business cycles in these countries.}},

Abstract = {{A brain tumor is one of the deadly diseases that attack the central and
   nervous system. The treatment of brain tumor, need high accuracy and
   precision. Brain tumor detection through Magnetic Resonance Imaging
   (MRI) has two-dimensional output with three perspectives, namely

   seen one by one ineffectively to determine the location and size of the
   tumor. To solve the problem, this study constructs the three-dimensional
   visualization perspective of MRI images. The tumor area in MRI image is
   segmented as a region of interest (ROI) by employing the Gaussian
   Mixture Model (GMM) with Expectation-Maximization as the optimization
   technique. These couple segmentation methods have revealed significant
   gain as a clear boundary of the tumor area to separate from the healthy
   part of the brain and an estimated tumor volume from sagittal, coronal,

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Rooted in practice-based research, the article uses the author's
   artistic work as a springboard to discuss wider issues of ecology
   restoration, rewilding and environmental aesthetics. The first section
   of the article critically reviews and contextualizes the author's
   eight-year photographic project, Forest, which investigates the politics
   of nature restoration projects in two new Chinese cities. Hinged upon
   contemporary environmental awareness and canonical photography
   aesthetics such as the topographic, the documentary and the
   storytelling, the Forest project pictorially and dialectically discusses
   the complexities of urban nature while beginning to accept urbanized
   China as a possible homeland. Extending the notion of constructed nature
   to an international context, within the global conversation efforts of
   re-naturalization and rewilding, the second section of the article
   analyses the inherent contradictions of rewilding in the post-wild
   world. The rewilded landscapes, the neo-wilderness, are brought into
   attention as a physical space to be investigated. The third section of
   the paper returns to its roots as practice-based research and tries to
   understand the neo-wilderness from the perspectives of landscape
   aesthetic traditions of both the West and China. The article finds
   commonality between three generations of representative western and male
   environmental photographers in their aesthetic choices and their
   philosophical grounding towards the sublime, pristine nature, as well as
   the binary between nature and culture. Finally, after a cautious
   discussion around the potential mis-use of Chinese traditional landscape
   aesthetics within contemporary landscape photography, the article points
   out the need to find alternative landscape aesthetics in order to
   critically investigate the meaning of nature now, with the constructed,
   rewilded landscapes as a crux for artists to produce an informed
   pictorial understanding.}},

Title = {{Does nonbinding commitment promote children's cooperation in a social
   dilemma?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{200}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Communication is a powerful tool for promoting cooperation in adults and
   is considered one of the most important solutions to social dilemmas.
   One feature that makes communication particularly useful in cooperative
   contexts is that it allows people to advertise their intentions to
   partners. Some work suggests that adults cooperate more after making
   nonbinding commitments to cooperate (i.e., commitments they do not need
   to uphold) than when they are not allowed to communicate their
   intentions to their partners. However, we know little about whether
   nonbinding commitments play a similar role in children. We addressed
   this gap by testing 6-to 9-year-old children in a simultaneous version
   of the iterated prisoner's dilemma game. In the communication condition,
   children could communicate their intended decision prior to their actual
   choice, whereas in the silent condition, they could not communicate.
   Overall, children in the communication condition were no more likely to
   cooperate than children in the silent condition. However, in the
   communication condition, but not in the silent condition, children's
   behavior was contingent on their previous decision; they were more
   likely to cooperate or defect when they had previously cooperated or
   defected, respectively. In addition, they rarely reversed their intended
   decisions in the game. Our findings suggest that, although nonbinding
   commitment does not promote children's cooperation in general, it may
   encourage children to stick to their chosen strategy, perhaps for the
   sake of appearing consistent. More broadly, these results contribute to
   our emerging understanding of the ways in which children solve social

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the impact of a prepregnancy very-low-energy diet
   (VLED) program on time to pregnancy in women with obesity. Design:
   Substudy of a two-arm parallel group randomized controlled trial.
   Setting: Multiple tertiary care centers.
   Patient(s): Women 18-38 years old with obesity (body mass index 30-55
   kg/m(2)) and planning conception.
   Intervention(s): One hundred sixty-four normoglycemic women with body
   mass index 30-55 kg/m(2), aged 18-38 years, and planning pregnancy were
   recruited through a social media platform for a two-arm randomized
   controlled trial. Women were allocated to a 12-week standard dietary
   intervention (SDI) or modified VLED. Completers of the intervention were
   observed for up to 48 weeks, and time to pregnancy was recorded.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): The prespecified exploratory outcome for this
   substudy was time to pregnancy between the completion of the 12-week
   intervention and the date of conception.
   Result(s): Maternal weight loss at the end of the 12-week intervention
   was 3.1\% in the SDI group and 11.9\% in the VLED group. In completers
   of the 12-week intervention, time to pregnancy was significantly shorter
   in the women allocated to the VLED group than in the SDI group. Post hoc
   analysis showed that this difference in time to conception was
   particularly overt within 90 days of the intervention.
   Conclusion(s): A VLED program that achieves substantial weight loss
   before conception reduces time to pregnancy compared with an SDI in
   women with obesity. ((c) 2020 by American Society for Reproductive

Title = {{Influence of Light and Water Activity on Growth and Mycotoxin Formation
   of Selected Isolates of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus}},
Journal = {{MICROORGANISMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus are the main causes of aflatoxin
   contamination in various foods, particularly grains, as they can thrive
   in environments with lower water activity and higher temperatures. The
   growth of Aspergillus and the formation of the mycotoxins aflatoxin and
   cyclopiazonic acid are strongly influenced by environmental stimuli and
   can be reduced by modulating parameters such as water activity, pH,
   temperature and light during the storage. This study has two
   objectives-on the one hand, to assess how global warming and an increase
   in exposure to sunlight affect growth and mycotoxin formation, and on
   the other hand, how the findings from these experiments can be used to
   reduce fungal growth and mycotoxin formation in stored foods. Using
   growth substrates with two different water activities (a(w) 0.95, a(w)
   0.98), together with a light incubation device consisting of different
   chambers equipped with diodes emitting visible light of five different
   wavelengths (455 nm, 470 nm, 530 nm, 590 nm, 627 nm) plus white light,
   we analyzed the growth and mycotoxin formation of selected Aspergillus
   flavus and A. parasiticus isolates. It was shown that light with a
   wavelength of 455/470 nm alone, but especially in combination with a
   lower water activity of a(w) 0.95, leads to a significant reduction in
   growth and mycotoxin formation, which was accompanied by reduced
   transcriptional activity of the responsible mycotoxin biosynthetic
   genes. Therefore, these results can be used to significantly reduce the
   growth and the mycotoxin formation of the analyzed fungi during storage
   and to estimate the trend of fungal infestation by Aspergillus flavus
   and A. parasiticus in water activity- and light exposure-equivalent
   climate change scenarios. Mycotoxin-producing aspergilli can be
   effective and sustainably inhibited using a combination of short-wave
   light and lowered water activity in the substrate. A higher annual mean
   temperature accompanying climate change may lead to an increased spread
   of aflatoxin-producing fungi in areas that were previously too cold for
   them. On the other hand, there will be regions in the world where
   contamination with aflatoxin-producing fungi will be reduced due to
   increased drought and sun exposure.}},

Abstract = {{Charles H. Frazier (1870-1936), one of the pioneers of neurosurgery in
   the US, is known worldwide for devising surgical procedures to relieve
   trigeminal neuralgia and intractable pain. Less well-known are his
   substantial contributions to understanding and treating pituitary and
   parahypophyseal lesions. Along with Bernard Alpers, he defined Rathke's
   cleft tumors as a different pathological entity from adenomas and
   hypophyseal stalk tumors (craniopharyngiomas {[}CPs]). The surgical
   challenge posed by CPs piqued Frazier's interest in these lesions,
   although he never published a complete account of his CP series. An
   examination of the Charles Frazier papers at the College of Physicians
   of Philadelphia allowed the authors to identify 54 CPs that he had
   treated during his career. In the early 1910s, Frazier developed the
   subfrontal approach, which would become the primary surgical route to
   access these lesions, providing better control of the adjacent vital
   neurovascular structures than the transsphenoidal route hitherto used.
   Nevertheless, strong adhesions between CPs and the third ventricle
   floor, the major reason underlying Frazier's disappointing results,
   moved him to advocate incomplete tumor removal followed by radiotherapy
   to reduce both the risk of hypothalamic injury and CP recurrence. This
   conservative strategy remains a judicious treatment for CPs to this day.}},

Abstract = {{Bacteria as a foreign pathogen can alter the physiology and metabolism
   of the host. Many of the teeth infecting bacteria known to be associated
   with obesity and diabetes in various organisms. The current study aims
   to check the effect of teeth infecting bacteria Enterobacter ludwigii on
   model organism Drosophila melanogaster. To check the effect, various
   concentrations of E. ludwigii on fly physiology the bacteria were added
   to the fly food. Flies were allowed to grow and colonise in infected
   food. The offsprings were checked for the accumulation of lipid and fat.
   With the increase of bacteria within the gut the amount of lipid and fat
   increases. Alongwith the fat various biochemical parameters like
   glucose, trehalose, protein and triglyceride level found to be altered.
   Within the fly gut various metals, which have a role in the metabolism
   is altered. However, during colonisation within the gut, the morphology
   of the bacteria remains unaltered. In the adult fly, all the biochemical
   parameters like glucose, trehalose, protein and triglyceride level
   increased. The expression level of Dilp is upregulated. Altogether, the
   current study reports an infection of E. ludwigii causes the
   accumulation of fat and alters glucose metabolism in Drosophila
